Would you please broadcast the following announcement just before
kick off. It is intended to inform the spectators of the post Taylor
safety measures introduced by SUFC and the SYP.



'This season Sheffield United Football Club and the South Yorkshire
 Police have introduced many extra facilities and procedures intended
 to improve safety at this stadium.

You will see that the gates in the perimeter fences have been removed.
The openings have been outlined in white and marked with green
emergency exit signs. In your own interests you should now identify
the gate nearest to you.

Also there are more stewards and police officers on duty,    especially
around the track. They are wearing fluorescent jackets and although
they may sometimes obstruct your view, they are there for your safety.
Remember not to smoke in the No Smoking areas and throughout your time
here please pay attention to messages on the PA system         and the
electronic scoreboard.

Finally the most important factor when safety is concerned      is the
behaviour of the fans before during and after thematch. I am sure   we
can rely on you all to contribute to our efforts to improve your
safety and enjoyment here today. Thank you all for your attention."



Also could the lady operating the scoreboard display the following
message for a minute or so just before kick off and again at half
time;


          " i n THE INTERESTS OF SAFETY..............
               PLEASE IDENTIFY YOUR EMERGENCY EXIT.*

                                                  PREFACE




    For .11 events staged at Doncaster Rovers Football Club. It Is emphasised that

    the safety of the public Is p a r a m o u n t .   Consequently there Is a need for

    contingency plans to be formulated for the use of Ground C om manders In dealing

    vith foreseeable Incidents that endanger the safety of the public.




    The following options relate to problems specifically centred on the Doncaster

•    Rovers Stadium.     This list is not exhaustive nor are they in any particular order.

     Bone of these options should be considered as preventing individual          initiative


     in a developing    situation.
SECTION 2



                                           INTRODUCTION




Doncaster Rovers Football Stadium, Belle Vue, is unlike other South Yorkshire

Football stadia in certain distinctive features.

1. It is not situated within the immediate boundaries of narrow streets and local

    housing.       It borders an airfield, leisure complex and racecourse, with the

    only feeder road into the stadium being the A638 Doncaster/Bawtry dual


     carriageway.

 2. The airfield creats potential problems with its regular use by light aircraft,

     micro-lights and parachutists.

 3. The g r o u n d s   surround is not fully secure and an invasion of the ground by

     determined fans is relatively easy.         The average gate at Doncaster Rovers is

     approximately 2,000 and the present ground capacity has been re-assessed at

      7,294.     However, well-supported higher division teams have played at Belle

     Vue in the recent past (eg Liverpool, Hull, Derby, Queens Park Rangers) and

      any similar match would create problems with the low crowd capacity.

 These peculiarities will be fully considered when dealing with possible actions

  and options open to Ground Commanders.




  Belle Vue Stadium          (See plan at appendix B)

  The stadium is in a relatively isolated position.          The nearest house is 50 yards

  away from turnstiles 25-30.          No streets or roads actually border the stadium nor

  do any houses face it.          Approaches to the stadium can be from any direction. There

  are no natural barriers or filter areas that can be utilised by Police Officers

   before the stadium itself.
There Is only o n e Grandstand seating 1.259 people.      This faces Bawtry load.     The

remaining capacity Is terracing wi th no protection from the elements.         There Is

a fenced   W      «   the Ro s sington End of the ground which holds 1.700 persons and

is for the ex clusive use .f . wa y eupporters.     This has four gates, two of w h i c h

face the playing pitch.      These r e m a i n open during matches and are attended by

identified stewards and Police Officers.        There are large sterile areas b et we en

 the three main viewing areas (Main Stand/Popular Slde/Rossington End).

 The outside perimeter of the ground is not totally secure.         The perimeter

 bordering the Rossington End and Popular Side is ill-kept and in places is in

 a poor state of repair.      It would not deter a determined effort to scale it.

 although access would be into sterile areas rather than the normal viewing areas.

 There is a sterile area in the car park, the full width of the Main Stand for

 the use of emergency vehicles in the event of a disaster.         A second sterile area

  is maintained in front of Gate 8 to enable ease of access for emergency vehicles


  to the pitch.
EARLY A RR I V A L S

Stadium

The isolation of Belle Vue Stadium enables mobile patrols to monitor

any early build-up of supporters in the immediate vicinity of the

stadium.       Regular checks of the area on match days will quickly bring

any early arrivals to the notice of A1 Sub-Division.             If such a build-up

 of supporters occurrs,       the following options should be consi de re d:-

 a)   Liaison with club officials to allow early access to the ground.

 b)   Belle Vue Police Control to be set up immediately.

 c)   Officers to be deployed to man those turnstiles open and to ensure

      adequate supervision of supporters inside ground.          Regular updating

      of   situation to be made by Belle Vue Control to A1 Control.

 d) Arrangements to be made with the club for an early opening of

      refreshment      areas within the enclosures.

  e) If excessive numbers of supporters arrive early at the ground, they

      should be encouraged to enter the ground once turnstiles are open.

      T h i s should prevent any undue build-up of supporters who may

      contribute to potential public disorder.

   f) G r o un d Commander to be kept informed of numbers of early arrivals

       and early deployment of match serials to be considered.

   g) O p e r a t i o n support to be considered if necessary.
El se wh er e

D e p e n d en t upon their mode of transport, nost early arrivals are

e ncountered in Doncaster To wn Centre and approaches to the Stadium.




Bv B r i t i s h Rail

 ,) L i a i s o n with B r i t i s h Tr.nsport Police to confirm If special trains

     are    in use and estimated numbers of supporters on normal service


     t r a i n s .

 b) Monitoring of f a n s ’ arrival at Doncaster Railway Station.         South

     Yorkshire Transport to provide P S V ’s to carry supporters directly

      to the ground.       A lternatively,   consider escorting fans to Belle Vue

      or. foot.      Route to avoid Doncaster Town Centre being Trafford

      V ay/W aterdale/B ennetthorpe/B elle     Vue.   A1 Control to be updated

      regularly.        Belle Vue Control to be informed and arrange reception

      at Belle Vue by Mounted Branch or match serials if necessary.




   Bv Public Transport/Private Transport

   a) If supporters do not proceed directly to Belle Vue, information to

       be passed directly to A1 Control from beat officers/mobile patrols

       regarding sightings or intelligence of supporters in Doncaster town


       ox- local public houses,

    b) Large groups of supporters to be monitored and actively encouraged

        to make their way to Belle Vue.         Large groups roaming Doncaster Town

        Centre could create serious public order disturbances and one public

        order patrol will be on duty within the town centre until the

        advertised kick-off time.
#
2.          LATE ARRIVALS




            Assess intelligence/information as to likelihood of late arrivals. A1

            Control/Belle Vue Control to be nade aware immediately if large numbers


            of late arrivals expected.




            Ensure sufficient turnstiles open to admit the late comers dependent
2. i i .

            upon the ground capacity and area capacities available within the

            ground.



             Sufficient manpower to be available outside the ground to adequately

             supervise late coiners.




 2. i v .    Visiting Supporters

             These supporters should be directed to the Rossington End turnstiles.

             Where it is foreseen that late coiners will arrive at the Rossington

             End of the ground in large numbers so as to create difficulties at the

             turnstiles, then Officers to form two cordons to hold back the

             supporters and allow them through into the turnstile area in manageable

             numbers.   Officers from reserve serials to be deployed to assist as

              necessary.




              Home Supporters

              These should be directed to the Main Stand turnstiles or Popular Side

              turnstiles.

              Similar action as for visiting supporters to be taken.   Officers from

              reserve serials to be deployed to assist as necessary.
 SECTION 4




                       UN EXPECTED ARRIVAL O F L A R G E NUMBERS OF SUPPORTERS




 T h e ground c ap a c i t y at Belle Vue is only 7,294 and the policing of an a n ti ci p at ed

  c a pacity crowd vo u ld differ little from the normal match crowd.        A match w i t h

  a potential capacity crowd would in all probability be made all-ticket and the

  m a i n problems caused by such a match are covered in Sections 3, 5 and 12.

^iowever,    if an influx of unexpected supporters does occur, then the following


  factors should be taken into consideration:-

  1.    Identify the    supporters and direct t h e m to the appropriate Home/Away


        turnstiles.

  2.    T h e capacity of each section of the ground,      the need for segregation of

        supporters and the effective control       of those supporters to be borne in mind.

  3.    All Of f icers to be made aware of the     large number of supporters.     Reserves

        to be deployed as necessary to safely control and guide supporters to the


        a pp ropriate part of the stadium.

        If necessary for safety or public order requirements, consider delaying the

        kick-off.     If this option is used,    cl os e co-operation is required with match

        and club officials to avoid any unne c es sa ry delay.

   5.   All supporters to be kept informed of the situation by the public address


        system.
It is anticipated that if an unex pe ct e d large number of supporters attend

a non-ticket match, then the ground or parts of the ground will become quick ly

full.   If this involves Away Supporters,      the options to be considered are

of allowing them access to a Home S u p p o r t e r s ’ area or of turning them away

from the ground.

If the de ci s i o n is to allow access to a non-designated area of the ground,

the initial concern must be the ab ility to control them,        segregating Home

and Away Supporters without jeopardising the capacity of any particular area.

If the d ec is i on is to turn supporters away from the ground then the following

points to be considered:-

a) Deployment of sufficient officers (including Mounted Officers and dogs)

   to prevent access to the ground and to escort supporters from the vicinity

   of the stadium.

b) Dispersal of private vehicles or coaches from Belle Vue as necessary.

c) Continued patrolling by Officers to prevent build-up of supporters or

   public disorder.     Consider O p e r at io n Support if necessary.

d) Belle Vue Control and A1 Control to be regularly updated.

e) Officers on the Popular Side w i t h i n the stadium to take up positions

   affording continued surveillance of the rear of the ground.           Any signs

   of a ground invasion to be dealt w i t h as detailed in Section 12.

   Officers outside the stadium to be made aware of this possibility.
SECTION 3

                                A LL TI CKET/PART TICKET MATCHES




The low ground capacity at Belle Vue would ensure that any matches likely to reach

or exceed 7,294 or any whic h would give serious cause for concern will be

all-ticket r a th e r than part-ticket matches.      The location of Belle Vue is such

that the s ta dium can be approached from any direction.           There are no   natural

barriers where effective street checkpoints or filter cordons can be              operated

before the s ta di um and its immediate environs.

In de t ermining the actions to be taken at an all-ticket          game, the following

options should be considered

1. The areas designated for Away Supporters at Belle Vue are the Rossington End

   and Block A of the Main Stand.          This provides a total of 1,900 places for Away

   Supporters.     The numbers of tickets available for Away Supporters to be

   determined prior to the game and the areas designated for Away Supporters

   confirmed.

2. Consider publicity to Home and Away Supporters that the mat ch is all-ticket

   and that access to the ground will not be allowed without a ticket.

3. Consider liaison with the cl ub to determine policy on the sale of tickets on

   the day or admission of non-ticket holders where sufficient ground capacity.

   The decis i on to allow entry to the match by non-ticket holders may prevent

   public di s order or crowd problems outside the stadium.          This option will be

   dependent u p o n various fa ct o r s : -

   a) Co-oper a ti on of club.

   b) Numbers of supporters.

   c) Space in ground available bearing in mind the need for segregation.

   d) The demeanour of the supporters.

    e) Manpower available.
Non-ticket holders can be turned back at Doncaster Railway Station before

transport to Belle Vue or prevented from leaving hired coaches at the ground.

It is impractical for non-ticket holders to be turned back prior to reaching

the stadiun if approaching on foot or by private transport.        Pedestrian access

to the s ta dium is such that outer filters cannot be operated and any checking

of vehicles entering the car parking area would cause severe traffic problems

on a main arterial road.       This obviously places greater emphasis and

responsibility on serials operating checks at the turnstiles.

Officers on turnstiles to ensure the safe and orderly entry of supporters to

the ground.    Checks to be made to ensure valid tickets are held.

Officers to be made aware of any plans in force for sale of tickets on the

day of turnstiles where payment is allowed for entry.        Supporters to be

directed as necessary.

The options for dealing w i t h ticketless fans are:-

a) All ow them into a pre-determined area on payment or otherwise.

b) Detain or contain the supporters.

c) Control dis pe r sa l of supporters.

d) Escort b a c k to transport.

If required,    a holding area to be established in the area of the Doncaster

Bloodstock S a l e s car park.    The assistance of Mounted Branch and dogs to be

utilised w i t h nominated serials.      Disposal of such persons to be decided by

 the Ground C o m m an de r after kick-off.
SECTION 6




                                           EARLY DEPARTURE




The first c o n s i d e r a t i o n is safety of all supporters whether they be attempting

to leave or w i s h i n g to remain.




1. Attempt to d e t e rm i ne the reason.

2. Assess the conseq ue nc es of the early departure of large numbers         ofsupporters.

3. Where practicable, consider detaining them in the ground.

A. Use Public A d d r e s s facility to keep supporters informed.

5. Identify the exit routes and have the necessary gates opened.

6. Having id entified the exit gates,          deploy sufficient manpower to ensure a safe

   and orderly departure.        Officers should be aware of the continued need for

   segregation.

7. Liaison w i t h South Yorkshire Transport to ensure early arrival of transport

   for away fans.

8. Advise A1 C o n t r o l of situation.
SECTION 7




                           A RE A WITHIN GROUND APPROACHING CAPACITY




A   GENERAL



    1. Assess r e t a i n i n g capacity within the ground (consideration of the need for


       segregation is still required).

    2. Where spare capacity is available, police resources to attend the turnstiles

       to supervise an orderly transfer and controlled entry.

    3. Inform P o l i c e Officers and club officials of actions taken.

    4. Consider d e l a y i n g kick-off.   Close co-operation with match and club

       officials n e c e ss ar y to avoid any unnecessary delay.

    5. Consider c l o s i n g the turnstiles to the areas approaching capacity.      Liaison


       with the c l u b is necessary.

    6. If possible, consider negotiating with the club for admission to the new


        area for t h e same admission fee.

     7. If supporters are to be dispersed without allowing admission, deploy

        sufficient    resources and then inform the supporters.        Public order patrols

        outside t he ground to be reinforced to ensure orderly dispersal.

     8. Consider l i a i s o n w i t h South Yorkshire Transport to arrange transport for


        away fans.

     9. Advise A1 Control.
ROSSINGTON E S P




The    'pen' a r e a is used solely by Visiting Supporters.    It is the only area

within Be l le V u e where supporters have access to the playing pitch or a sterile

area t hr ough gates.      The following instructions will apply to this area:-

1. Following the initial response by designated Officers on relevant track

      gates to a l l o w spectators onto the perimeter track to relieve pressure,

      the use of    bolt croppers by the trained steward to be authorised if

      n ecessary to increase the area of escape available.

2. The Senior Officer in charge of public order to go directly to the area

      and direct    Police Operations, using a loud hailer from the emergency

      equipment box.

3. Serials B and E positioned in that location to be directed onto the

      perimeter    tr a c k to assist supporters to leave the terrace, administer first

      aid if n e c e s s a r y and escort supporters to a place of safety or other area

      of the ground.     The ambulance liaison officers to be notified where

      applicable.
  SECTION 8




                                      G R OU N D APPROACHING CAPACITY




  If information shows that the ground is nearing full capacity the following

  options should b e considered

  1.    The closure of turnstiles to ensure safety of fans outside the ground.        Liaison

        with club o ff icials is necessary.      Officers to be deployed to prevent any

        attempt at forced entry.       Consider additional manpower requests from A1 or

        the use of O p e r a ti on Support.

^^2.    Public   Order P atrols/Security Patrols to be increased as those refused entry

        may be   Home and Away Supporters.      The possibility of public order disturbances

        to be considered.

  3.    Loud hailers to be used to inform supporters of the need to disperse.        Mounted

        Branch and d o g s to be utilised to assist an orderly dispersal.

  A. Consider liaison with South Yorkshire Transport to arrange transport for Away

        Supporters.

   5.   Advise A1 Control.
SECTION 9




            EMERGENCY OPENING/FORCING OF GATES TO ALLOW ACCESS/EVACUATION




T h i s could arise where the ground is near to, or at full ca p acity and the

situation outside the gate is one where, because of pressure created by the crowd,

there is a serious risk to life.        All other contingencies have been tried and

have failed.      A s a last resort:-

1.    Identify    the gate.

2.    Identify the area containing spare capacity where extra spectators can be

      absorbed.

3.    Consider

      a) Moving the crowd into that area to relieve pressure on gate.

      b) Evacuating the terraces onto the pitch.

      c) Opening other gates where no crush exists to alleviate pressure.

A.    Stop the m a t c h and inform the referee of the circumstances.

5.    Consider the use of cutting equipment.

6.    Resources to be deployed to:-

      a) Control entry to the ground.      Supporters to be directed/escorted away

        from areas of crowd congestion.

      b) Facilitate the evacuation of terraces.

      c) Maintain segregation.

7.    Consider use of Public Address System to keep all supporters informed.

 8.   Alert Emergency Services and A1 Control.

 9.   Consider Operation Support.

 10. Implement the Emergency Contingency plan.

 11. Consider ma jo r incident procedures if necessary.

                                         G R O UN D INVASION




A ground i n v a s i o n of Belle Vue should always be considered a possibility, but

extra v i g i la nc e should be taken duri ng important matches, eg FA Cup Match V Maj or

Club where the g ro u n d capacity and Away S u p p o r t e r s ’ ticket allocation was

insufficient.     A l l important all-ticket m a t c h may attract large numbers of

ticketless fans        (Section 5).   Any attempt to invade the ground would be m ad e at

the Rossington E n d or Popular Side perimeter,          neither of which can be seen from

normal Police posts .        Any invasion would not give immediate access to v i ewing

areas, but w o u l d    leave those supporters in sterile areas.




 1. In any a l l - t ic ke t match or where the ground is approaching full capacity,      two

    Officers to be positioned at the rear of the sterile area between the P o pu l ar

    Side and the Rossington End.         There is a clear, uninterrupted view of bo th


    perimeter f e n c e s from this point.

 2. A regular p a t r o l by dogs around the perimeter would prevent any concerted


    invasion.

 3. Reserves to b e      sent to sterile area if invasion attempted.


 4. Consider stopp in g game.

                                           A I RC RA FT EMERGENCY




Of all South Y o r k sh i re stadia, Belle V ue alone has a potential hazard caused by

aircraft, mi c ro-lights and parachutists.             Situated next to Doncaster airfield,

it has to accept          regular parachute d e s c e n t s and air traffic.   The normal flight

SECTION 1 4




                           DELAYED START/LATE FINISH OF MATCH




In the event of an incident occurring which necessitates the delaying of the

kick-off or which causes a prolonged stoppage during the game, the problem

arises of away supporters being unable to leave Doncaster by train because of

the timing of their return journey.     Supporters at the stadium who are aware

of the possibility may create public order problems at Belle Vue.      Supporters

who arrive too late for their return train at Doncaster Railway Station may

cause similar problems in Doncaster Town Centre.




It there is a delayed start or late finish to the match, the following action

will be taken:-

1.   Inform A1 Control.

2.   Confirm numbers of supporters having travelled by British Rail.

3.   Liaise with South Yorkshire Transport to re-arrange timing of any transport

     detailed to carry supporters to Doncaster Railway Station.

4.   Liaise with British Rail to confirm times of and possible alternatives     to

     special supporters' trains and normal service trains.

5.   Liaise with British Transport Police and make alternative arrangements     for

     transport   of away supporters by rail, if possible.   It should be borne in

     mind that   British Rail Services may not be capable of being delayed or

     re-scheduled.

6.   The mobile reserve will accompany buses taking supporters to the Railway

     Station.    This reserve will remain at the station until the supporters have

     joined their train.
Each bus will have a police presence.   Officers from Serial E will accompany

the buses to the Railway Station and will remain there until the supporters

have joined their train.

At all times it is essential that supporters inside the ground are kept

fully informed of any alternative arrangements in order to prevent any undue

anxiety or public disorder.

1.   Operate Filters close to the Ground

     a)   The provision of cordons situated in Queens Road, Queens Ground (Top,
          middle and bottom) will satisfy this need for filtering.   This is
          primarily for 'away' support and will exist on all matches, with varying
          degrees of manpower, dependant upon nature, numbers and reputation of
          visiting spectators, and intelligence received.

     b)   The provision of cordons situated in Belgrave Road and Bala Street
          will satisfy this need for filtering.

          This may be a mixture of 'home' and 'away' support, but if our
          segregation policy is working satisfactorily then this should be 'home'
          support only.

          On a normal match a manned barrier cordon will exist at the bottom of
          Bala Street, Belgrave Road junction Windemere Road and Belgrave Road
          junction Grove Street.  Also Windemere Road junction Queens Road, all
          of which will require supplementing by a serial filter cordon.

     c)   The provision of cordons situated in Grove Street will satisfy this
          n e e d   for   f i l t e r i n g .   T h i s   w i l l be p r i m a r i l y   'Home'   supp o r t .
          On a normal            match a manned barrier cordon will exist                          across Grove
          Street near            to its junction with Grasmere Road.

          In the event of filter cordons being necessary, they will be sited
          at the following locations.

            i)       Grove       Street junction Pontefract Road
           ii)       Grove       Street junction Coniston Road
          iii)       Grove       Street junction Grasmere Road (as existing)

          The geographic layout of Oakwell Football Stadium precludes an
          approach to the ground by any other recognised method.

2.   The Checking of Queues into the Turnstile - Last filter

     On a 'normal' match all turnstiles will be manned in groups by a dedicated
     serial.  These will be supplemented by officers from the mounted section.

     Their duty is to ensure the safe and orderly entry and provide a final
     filter.

     The following will be required on the occasion of 'All Ticket or Part
     Ticket matches':

     a)   Brewery Stand                (Turnstiles 1-10)

          One serial to act independantly or in concert dependant upon:-

              i)     Availability of turnstiles
                                                    CA




      ii)        Numbers of tickets sold for this portion of ground
     iii)        Intelligence received
      iv)        Effectiveness of outer filters

This section of the ground will accommodate 'Home' support.

b)   Pontefract Road End                 (Turnstiles 11-26)

     Two serials, one for turnstiles 11-12 (situated facing Grove
     Street Car Park) and one for turnstiles 13-26 (situated on Grove
     Street).  These serials will act independantly or in concert
     dependant upon:-

       i)        Availability of turnstiles
      ii)        Numbers of tickets sold for this portion of ground
     iii)        Intelligence received
      iv)        Effectiveness of outer filters

This section of the ground will accommodate 'Home' support.

c)   M a i n   S t a n d   Blocks   C,   D,   ,   E a n d   Terracing (South)   (Turnstiles 27-34)

     One serial to act independantly or in concert dependant upon:-

       i)       Availability of turnstiles
      ii)       Numbers of tickets sold for this portion of ground
     iii)       Intelligence received

     One serial to act independantly or in concept dependant upon:-

        i)   Availability of turnstiles
      ii) Numbers of tickets sold for this portion of ground
     iii)   Intelligence received
      iv) Effectiveness of outer filters
       v) Visual awareness of approaching supporters down Belgrave Road
      v i ) Anticipated access to be afforded away support to Block 'A'
            and Block 'B'

     This section of the ground will accommodate 'Home and 'Away' support.

e ) Spion Kop (Turnstiles 41-47)

     One serial to act independently or in concert dependant upon:-

       i) Availability of turnstiles
      i i ) Numbers of tickets sold for this portion of ground
     iii)   Intelligence received
      iv) Effectiveness of outer filters
       v) Visual awareness of approaching supporters down Queens Ground
            car park
        One further serial to act in concert and a filtering cordon,
        outside gate 2, on the approach to the turnstiles.

        This section of the ground will accommodate 'Away' support.

The Problem Caused by the Ticketless Fan

  i)   Intelligence from Originating Force as to Numbers which can be Expected

       a)   Due cognizance will be taken of all intelligence irrespective of
            origin, when considering subsequent manpower and action.

       b)   To appraise, assimilate and substantiate 'Rumour'.

       c)   To be aware of the existence of forged tickets, or the allegation
            of such.

ii)    Outer Check Points

       a)   TURN BACK - An additional serial should be provided at each of
            t h e outer check p o i n t s , in the first instance to hold and
            interrogate the spectators.

            This serial will be charged with the responsibility for turning
            back and escorting these spectators to their modes of transport.
            It should be impressed upon these persons that under no
            circumstances will they be allowed into the ground without tickets,
            so as to discourage their attempting to get to the ground by an
            alternative route.  Oakwell Control should be kept appraised of
            the situation and any information gleened.
            Strategic use should be made of officers at such cordons, so as to
            ensure that their numbers do not reduce to a level which may render
            them vulnerable.
            The outer check points in respect of an operator at Oakwell will
            be located as follows:-

            1.   Queens Road/Eastern Relief Road, slip road
            2.   Bala Street/Pontefract Road
            3.   Clyde Street/Langdale Road
            4.   Avon Street/Langdale Road
            5.   Grove Street/Pontefract Road

       Additionally outer check points will be sited on the following
       approaches to the Division:-

            6.   Junction 36, Ml motorway  (Tankersley)
            7.   Junction 37, Ml motorway  (Dodworth)
            8.   Junction 38, Ml motorway (Haigh)
            9.   A635 at Marr, near to A1 road

            These Check points 6-9 will be manned by a mobile serial supported
            by Road Traffic Department.
            Their duties will mainly be directed at vehicular traffic
            The question of the supporters having tickets or otherwise will be
            a consideration, in addition to the enforcement, of the Sporting
            Events (Control of Alcohol) Legislation.
                                           CA




                                  - .4 -




 - Any traffic which is turned back from these check points will
   normally be escorted to the force boundary by Road Traffic
    Department and the adjoining forces will be informed.

b) HOLD - An additional serial should be provided at each of the
   outer check points in the first instance, to hold and interrogate
    the spectators.
   This option will be determined by the proximity to kick-off time.
   It will be impractical to implement this option with large numbers
   of ticketless spectators, for long periods outside the half-hour
   prior to kick off.
 - Additional Serial/s should be available to enforce this option,
   at any particular outer check point which has attracted sufficient
   numbers of ticketless spectators to make the manpower at that
   checkpoint vulnerable.
   Spectators held at this option should be interrogated and
   intelligence/rumour passed to Oakwell control.
   Officers should endeavour to communicate with persons held, and
   keep them informed of their inability to gain access to the ground
   without tickets and the Police strategy.

     The outer check points at Oakwell will be as follows:-

     1.   Queens Road/Eastern Relief Road, slip road
     2.   Bala Street/Pontefract Road
     3.   Clyde Street/Langdale Road
     4.   Avon Street/Langdale Road
     5.   Grove Street/Pontefract Road

     Additionally outer check points will be sited on the following
     approached to the Division:-

     6.   Junction 36, Ml motorway       (Tankersley)
     7.   Junction 37, Ml motorway       (Dodworth)
     8.   Junction 3 8 , Ml motorway     (Haigh)
     9.   A635 at M a r r , near to A1   road

     Check points 6-9 ■ will be manned by a mobile serial supported
     by Road Traffic Department.
     Their duties will mainly be directed at vehicular traffic.
     The question of the supporters having tickets or otherwise will be
     a consideration,   in additon to the enforcement, of the Sporting
     Events (Control of Alcohol) Legislation.
     Any traffic which is turned back from these check points will
     nromally be escorted to the force boundary by Road Traffic
     Department and the adjoining forces will be informed.

     Considerations:-

     1.   Number of persons
     2.   Mood
     3.   Mode of transport
     4.   Timing
     5-   Facilities available for containment
                                   - 5 -



        Away Support

        A holding area will be identified as the Queens Ground car park.
        Serial/s will be identified to effect this holding area, determined
        by the above considerations.
        It is recognised that the numbers will dictate the holding or
        dispersing of these spectators, as small numbers could be easily
        dispersed with safety and without risk to public order, whereas
        to hold them may be disproportionate to the manpower commitment.

        Home Support

        A holding area will be identified on the Grove Street car park.
        Serial/s will be identified to effect this holding area, determined
        by the above considerations.
        It is recognised that the numbers will dictate the holding or
        dispersing of these spectators, as small numbers could be easily
        dispersed with safety and without risk to public order, whereas
        to hold them may be disproportionate to the manpower commitment.

        A further consideration as to whether or not to hold or disperse
        is that some of these spectators may live in the locality which
        may favour dispersal.

  c)    ALLOW TO PROCEED - Not the preferred option as this would breed the
        ticketless fan to a mood of success in the knowledge that at Oakwell
        he could gain admittance at an all ticket match not in possession of
        a ticket.  However, must be allowed if provision exists at the ground
        for admittance, on payment, to home or away, to their respective
        portion of the ground.
        Any decision to allow to proceed should be communicated immediately
        to Oakwell Control and the reason, for the decision, ie. too large
        numbers to contain etc, explained.
        It is recognised that this option merely transfa?s the problems
        from the outer to the inner check points, and ultimately to the
        entrances to the ground itself.
        It may be that the option to allow to proceed may be preferred
        where they are being allowed to proceed under escort to the Police
        Holding area.

iii )   Inner Check Points

        It is considered that the role of the inner check points should be:-

        1.   To observe
        2.   To monitor
        3.   To retard the progress
        4.   To enforce segregation
        5.   To ensure the safety of persons attending the
        6.   To ensure that persons approach the ground in
             and orderly manner.
                                        - 6 -




            7.   To detect those evading the outer     check point.

      They will be located as follows

            1.   Windemere Road/Queens Road
            2.    Belgrave Road/Windemere Road
            3.    Conniston Road/Grove Street
            4.   Grove Street/Grasmere Road
            5.   Belgrave Road/Grove Street
            6.   Queens Ground - top
            7-   Queens Ground - middle
            8.   Queens Ground - bottom
            9.   Grove Street/Queens Ground


       a)   TURN BACK & b)   HOLD

            The efficiency and effectiveness of the outer checkpoints could render
             these two options as unnecessary.        Subsequently additional serials
             should not be necessary at any of the above identifiedlocations.
            H o w e v e r reserve serial/s should be available to       attend at   any ofthese
            inner check points         where there is evidence that     the outer   check point
             serving the inner         check point has failed.
            The numbers likely         to be detected at the inner check points will no
            doubt be inconsequential, and capable of being either held or turned
            back, dependant on resources available.
            The decision to turn back or hold, should be made in the light of
            the consideration identified at 3- ii. a) and 3. ii. b) above.

       c)   ALLOW TO PROCEED - Not the preferred option as this would breed the
            ticketless fan to a mood of success in the knowledge that at Oakwell
            he could gain admittance at an all ticket match not in possession of
            a ticket. However must be allowed if provision exists at the ground
            for admittance, on payment, to home or away, to their respective
            portion of the ground.
            Any decision to allow to proceed should be communicated immediately
            to Oakwell Control and the reason, for the decision, ie. too large
            numbers to contain etc, explained.
            It is recognised that this option merely transfers the problems
            fr'cmtbe outer to the inner check points, and ultimately to the
            entrances to the ground itself.
            It may be that the option to allow to proceed may be preferred
            where they are being allowed to proceed under escort to the Police
            Holding area.

iv)    Arrival at the Ground

       Having arrived at Oakwell being forseen or unforseen, the options
       available will be largely dependant upon the imminence of the kick off
       and the numbers involved.  The options available being

       a)   ALLOW THEM INTO A PRE-DETERMINED AREA ON PAYMENT

            In consultation with the Ground Safety Officer and the Club
Secretary, the Officer in Command will arrive at a decision regarding
this option.
It is not favoured to admit ticketless fans on payment as this again
breeds a mood of success in the knowledge that at Oakwell he could
gain admittance to an all ticket match, when not in possession of a
ticket.
Should a decision to admit them be taken, due cognizance will have
to be taken of the capacities of the sections of the ground, that
they are capable of accepting the numbers involved and whether they
be 'Home'  or 'Away'  sections.
Away Spectators would normally be admitted into the Spion Kop
terracing or in exceptional circumstances the north terracing of
the main stand.
Home Spectators would normally be admitted to the remaining sections
of the ground.  The numbers of these spectators may well be
sufficient for the officer in command to consider, delaying the
kick-off time.

DETAIN OR CONTAIN

Away Support

A Police holding area will be identified on the Queens Ground car
park.
Serial/s will be identified to effect this holding area, determined
by the previously described considerations.
It must be appreciated that a holding exercise is manpower intensive.
Ensure that the spectators so contained are made aware of the Police
strategy.  Communication with them is important and a spirit of good
nature should be fostered, i.e. kept informed of score etc. if they
are to be contained for the duration of the match.  Their comfort
and other facilities should be considered in liason with the football
club.

Home Support

A Police Holding Area will be identified on the Grove Street car
park.
Serial/s will be identified to effect this holding area, determined
by the previously described considerations.
It must be appreciated that a holding exercise is manpower intensive.
Ensure that the spectators    so contained are made aware of the Police
strategy.   Communication with them is important and a spirit of good
nature should be fostered, i.e. kept informed of score etc, if they
are to be contained for the duration of the match.   Their comfort
and other facilities should be considered in liason with the football
club.

CONTROLLED DISPERSAL

Once the kick-off time has passed it will soon become apparent
outside the ground, that there may be a number of persons who do
not have a ticket to gain entry.
                                 - 8 -




     These persons should be quickly identified by officers outside the
     ground, and their numbers, locations and whether ’home’ or ’away’
     support, should be notified to Oakwell Control.
     Serials that have been identified to enforce the Police Holding
     Areas will be utilised in the controlled dispersal of these
     ticketless supporters.
     In every case, ’home’ supporters will be disposed via Grove Street
     and Pontefract Road.
     ’Away’ supporters will always be dispersed via Queens Ground car
     park an Queens Road.
     Such dispersal must only be undertaken when Serial Commanders
     can be satisfied that it can be achieved safely, without risk to
     public order, and the segregation policy kept intact.
     The dispersal of ’home’ supporters may well be more easily
     achieved, owing to their living in immediate locality.

d)   ESCORT BACK TO TRANSPORT

     This option can be taken in conjunciton with options b) or c) above
     as events unfold.
     Numbers will dictate the quantity o f serials , Police horses and dogs
     forming the escort.
     The mode of transport once identified will determine the timing
     of the escort, i.e. train times, bus times etc.
     This option will only be appropriate where the modes of transport
     are known.    Under no circumstances will numbers of football
     supporters be escorted away from the ground and left unsupervised.
     The escort routes from Oakwell will be as follows

     Away Supporters

 — QUEENS GROUND to cars and coaches
 — QUEENS ROAD to cars                            ^
 ~ PONTEFRACT ROAD to Rail Station for trains
 — KENDRAY STREET to Bus Station for buses


     Home Supporters

 - GROVE STREET to cars
  — PONTEFRACT ROAD to cars, buses, and trains.

     These routes will be strictly adhered to, so as to maintain the
     segregation policy.
     Escorting Officers will ensure that those spectators being escorted,
     are aware of the Police intentions and ultimate destinations.

ACTION TO BE TAKEN ON FORESEEABLE PATTERNS OF ARRIVAL




EARLY ARRIVALS

1.   Pre-match Intelligence

     a)    Two reserve serials and two horses to be provided to deal with early
           arrivals.

     b)   Consider increasing/decreasing this number depending upon intelligence
          i.e.

          -     Method of arrival
          -     Locations of arrival, including routes
          -     Representation of supporters
          -     Numbers
          -     History

     c)   Set    up O a k w e l l   C o n t r o l   at an e a r l i e r   stage
     d)   If possible check intelligence

2.   Observe & Monitor

     a)   Serial(s) to be deployed at known arrival locations

     b)   Liaison with Oakwell control at all stages of arrival, giving,          numbers,
           locations, methods etc

     c)   Obtain intelligence from these supporters if possible.

     d)   If early arrivals are at the ground then their arrival andprogress
           should be monitored by the CC TV system.

     e)   Where 'away' football intelligence officers are in attendance, they
          should be actively engaged in the monitoring of these early arrivals.

3•   Sweep, Contain or Controlled Dispersal

     a)   If early arrivals are in proximity of the ground, they should be
          marshalled to the Spion Kop turnstiles in respect of 'Away' support,
          or contained in Grove Street if 'Home' support.

                i)At least one serial should be deployed to effect this marshalling
                  and containment in the first instance,
            i i ) Two horses and two dogs will also be so deployed.
                  As the numbers increase,the Serials and dogs and horses      should
                  be correspondingly increased,
          i i i ) The' \Late arrivals should be made aware of the Police strategy
                  and the rationale behind their containment.

     b)   If away from the ground they should be escorted to the locations
      identified at a) above.  The escorting officer to make Oakwell Control
      aware of numbers, locations etc.

c)    Every effort should be made to encourage early arrivals to go to
      Oakwell, by the advised routes so as to effect segregation.

d)    Controlled dispersal, although an option, means that we lose control
      of those dispersed.   It places away support, in small numbers, at risk
      in what may be to them an unfamiliar town.

         i)    Drunken and/or unruly elements may be dispersed away from the
               town, back onto the advised routes in the direction from which
               they came.
        ii)    Adjoining Division/Forces will need to be made aware of this
               action.
      iii)     Early arrivals, if dispersion during licensing hours may visit
               licensed premises and subsequently fuel hostility,
        iv)    Early arrivals visiting licensed premises may well be subject
               to a mood/attitude charge as kick off time approaches.

Arrange E a r l y   Admission   to the   Ground where Possible

The officer in command will liaise with the ground safety officer and
club secretary to ensure that at least one turnstile into each section
of the ground is capable of being opened early to admit any early
arrivals.  If intelligence is known well in advance this will be done
prior to match day.

This action may well prevent a public order situation outside the ground,
and will foster safety for those entering the ground in an easy and
unhurried manner.

         i)   The serial affecting containment, either at the Spion Kop
              on Grove Street turnstiles will be responsible for the safe
              and orderly admission to the ground by these early arrivals,
        i i ) Sufficient officers from the serial manning the section of the
              ground to which these spectators are admitted will be deployed
              to monitor and supervise their safety and behaviour inside the
              ground.
      iii)    Once all the turnstiles are open at the appropriate time,
              and Phase I of the Police operation commences then these officers
              will resume their Phase I duties.

Consider      Spectators Comfort of those Admitted into the Ground

The officer in command will liaise with the Ground Safety Officer and
Club Secretary and make them aware of the toilet and refreshment, needs
of those; admitted to the ground early.

If intelligence is known well in advance this will be done prior to match
day.
     Be aware of their needs so as to ensure their co-operation, good behaviour
     and well being.

6.   Consider Intelligence From Those Early Arrivals Which May Affect Post Match
     Planning

     Officers involved with those spectators arriving early should communicate
     with them, foster good relations and glean intelligence.

     This intelligence should be passed to Oakwell control for appraisal,
     assimilation and evaluation.

     Be prepared to adopt a flexible approach and to amend duties in line
     with intelligence gleaned.




LATE ARRIVALS

1.   Pre-match Intelligence

     a)   Ensure serials, dogs and horses with responsibilities outside the
          ground at Phase II are aware of this intelligence in order that they
          will be prepared to accept the late arrivals.

     b)   If the intelligence indicates that large numbers of late arrivals
          are expected,, two serials, two horses and two dogs (more if numbers
          appropriate) will be detailed specifically to deal with them.

     c)   A strategy to deal with late arrivals will be determined, i.e. turn back,
          hold or allow to proceed.   This will be governed by available capacity
          within the ground, numbers of late arrivals, whether they will be in
          possession of tickets etc.

2.   Make Available Sufficient Turnstiles to Accommodate the Late     Comers

     a)   Officer in Command will liaise with safety officer and club secretary
          to ensure that adequate turnstiles are available to admit the late
          comers, be they 'home' or 'away' support.

     b)   Ground capacities and densities will be considered in arriving at a).

     c)   If intelligence is known well in advance the arrangements will be made
          prior to match day.

3•   Deploy Sufficient Police Resources/Reserves to Manage the Late Arrivals

     a)   Outside the ground, at least two serials will be detailed specifically
          to deal with them.(this may be increased/decreased dependant upon
          numbers) The use of two horses and two dogs will be considered
          appropriate.

     b)   If this is a forseen situation, the reserve serials will not be
          utilised.
c)   All officers detailed for duties outside the ground at Phase II will
     be made aware of the numbers of later arrivals.  They will ensure that
     their Phase II locations are maintained.

d)   Ensure that the serial commanders are aware of the Police strategy in
     dealing with the late arrivals.

e)   If numbers are such, as being likely to constitute a danger to
      themselves or other spectators consider the turn back, hold or
      controlled dispersal options.

Inform Officers     Policing that part of the Ground into which they are to
be Received and     Arrange their Reo^ition

a)   The sector commander and officers, in the section of the ground,
      deputed to receive the supporters, should be informed of their
      arrival, timing and be appraised of the Police Strategy, in placing
      them at that location.

b)   The two serials detailed to receive the supporters outside the ground,
      should accompany them into the section a l l o c a t e d , i f e x t r a manpower is
      required.  The use of horses and dogs should no longer be required
      after their entry into the ground, dependant on the physical construction
      lending itself to their use.

c)   A serial or part serial will be made available to receive the late
     arrivals inside the turnstiles and to assist/advise club stewards in
     directing them to the less congested sections.

d)   Care will be taken not to encourage the late arrivers to attempt to
     achieve the more advantaged positions, occupied by those arriving early.
     This will be achieved by the provision of filter cordons, who will
     encourage the dispersment to the less conjested areas in that section.

e)   Officers will be aware of crowd densities and capacities at their
      section of the ground.

Controlled Arrival - Consider delaying their Arrival

a)   If conditions at the ground are such, as to cause concern for the
     safety of spectators endeavouring to enter, the outer cordons or
     inner cordons, as appropriate, will be informed and instructed to
     employ the 'HOLD' option.

b)   This hold option will be maintained until conditions at the ground
     have improved, so that their controlled arrival can be achieved with
     safety.

c)   Oakwell control will be kept informed of the numbers and locations of
     those held, by seial commanders.
d)   Officers outside the ground will be kept informed of the approach of
     late arrivals once the hold'option has ceased.

e) Consideration must be given to the anxiety of these late arrivals,
    particularly if the game has commenced and they are in sufficient
    proximity to hear the reactions of crowd, and sense the atmosphere.

f) Once the 'hold' option has ceased the controlled advance to the ground,
    of those held, must be maintained.
    Dependant on numbers, at least 2 serial, 2 horses and 2 dogs will be
    used for escort of these supporters.

g)    The routes to be used for this purpose will be:-

       i)   QUEENS ROAD, QUEENS GROUND for 'away' supporters,
      ii)   PONTEFRACT ROAD, GROVE STREET for 'home' supporters,
     iii)   BALA STREET, BELGRAVE ROAD will only be used when .either of
            the two preferred routes at i or ii, above are not available.

Consider Delaying the Kick-Off

a)   If the safety of large numbers still outside the ground are at risk,
      through their possible determination to gain access as kick-off time
      approaches, this consideration should apply.

b)    It will be the policy at Oakwell not to delay the kick-off, owing
     to the presence of large numbers of ticketless supporters at an  all
     ticket game.

c)   The period of kick-off delay should not be excessive.   Fifteen minutes
      will be the normal accepted delay, but a longer period may well be
      appropriate having regard, to the numbers and the proximity to the
      venue.

d)   It is imperative that Oakwell Control is kept fully informed of the
      numbers and proximity of late arrivals, as to enable the officer in
      command to reach a decision.

Sensible Management of the Fans and Keep them Informed

a)    Two loud-hailers will be provided at Oakwell Control.

b)   A Police Landrover with public address facility will be available in the
     area adjacent to gate 3-

c)   The clubs public address system, will also be utilised.

d)   Equipment at a) and b) above will be utilized to keep late arrivals,
      away from the ground, informed of the existing situation.

e)   The equipment at c) above may be additionally utilized, when these
      late arrivals are i n e r around the ground.
                                - 14 -



f)   Where the decision to delay the kick-off has been taken, it is
     imperative that this information is conveyed to the late arrivals   to
     ease their anxiety.

g)   It may be that late arrivals will have travelled great distances to
      attend the game and their lateness is due to circumstances beyond
      their control.
     All officers should be reminded of the need to foster, a spirit of
      goodwill, and not to aggravate their fractiousness.

UNEXPECTED ARRIVAL OF LARGE NUMBER OF FANS




1.   What is the intelligence?

     a)   Reputation
     b)   Modes of Transport
     c)   Numbers
     d)   History
     e)   Are these unexpected fans additional to, or included in pre-match
          intelligence regarding numbers likely to attend

2.   Can they be Accommodated at the Ground or Specific Area?

     a)   Due cognizance will be taken of the crowd capacities for the various
          sections of the ground, when considering their accommodation.

     b)   Every effort will be made to control their entry into the appropriate
          sections of the ground.

     c)   Their control in other specific areas outside the ground will create
          resource depletion, but will not be dismissed as an option.

     d)   Policeholding areas will have been defined.

     e)   Assectioncapacities are approached,            consider alternative
          accommodation.

3•   Identify Resources or Obtain Additional Resources, i.e. Operation Support

     a)   The serials manning the outer and inner check-points are to be left
           in situ and to monitor, observe and as far as practicable control
           the progress of these supporters.

     b)   The serials immediately outside the ground to be kept informed of the
          progress of these supporters from the intelligence provided by the
          outer and inner check points.

     c)   The number of serials, horses and dogs to be deployed to control and
          escort this large number of fans is dependant upon Police strategy,
          but will be determined by the following sliding scale.

          Up to 100 Supporters    -   1   Serial     -   2 horses     - 2 dogs
          100 - 300 Supporters    -   2   Serials    -   4 horses     - 2 dogs
          300 - 600 Supporters    -   3   Serials    -   4 horses     - 4 dogs
          Over 600                -   3   Serials and    1 Serial     per each 300 thereafter
                                      4   horses and      2 horses   per each 300 thereafter
                                      4   dogs and 2      dogs per   each 300 thereafter

     d)   If these resources are not available within, this policing operation,
          then 'Cperation Support,' will be considered.
Deploy Resources and gain Effective Control

a)   Deployment will depend upon the numbers and locations of the unexpected
     fans.

b)   Serials, horses and dogs, in accordance with the sliding scale at 3.c)
     above should be deployed in order to gain effective control.

c)   If these unexpected fans are approaching Oakwell, the resources
     identified at b) above, will be deployed at, one or more of the three
     following locations:-

       i)         GROVE STREET rear to the Supporters Club
      ii)         BELGRAVE ROAD at junction     with Grove Street
     iii)         QUEENS GROUND at bottom

This deployment will be                      dependant on the direction of the arrivingfans.

d)Should these fans not be in the  proximity of Oakwell, i.e. town centre,
    then the deployment location will be at a point identified by Oakwell
     C o n t r o l ,   b e t w e e n   the   f a n s   a n d the   ground.
e)   Care must be taken to ensure that this deployment location, is not
     overun by these fans resulting in the Police resources being behind
     them thus reducing our control.

f)   Oakwell Control to be kept informed of the progress of such group
     of fans.

Allow them to Proceed or Hold or Disperse

a)   This option will be determined by the following

       i)        Numbers
      ii)        Location
     iii)        Mood
      iv)        The availability of resources
       v)        Effectiveness of Police Operation thus far.

b)   The option and resource allocations will be as indicated, at pages
     3, 4, 5, 6 & 7 of this policy document.

Where the Decision is to Proceed

         i)       Inform officers policing that part of the ground into which
                  they are to be received and arrange their reception.
a)     The sector commander and officers in the section of the
       ground deputed to receive these supporters should be
       informed of their arrival, timing and be appraised of the
       Police strategy in placing them at that location.

b)     It will be appreciated that although the numbers of
       unexpected arrivals may be large, the Police filtering policy
       and the limiting effect of the turnstiles will mean that their
       entry into the ground will be controlled.

c)     The two serials detailed to receive the Supporters outside
       the ground, should only accompany them into the ground if
       extra manpower is required.  The use of horses and/or dogs
       should no longer be necessary after their entry into the
       ground.  The physical construction of certain areas may also
       have a limiting effect.

d)     Officers will be aware of the capacities and crowd densities
       at their section of the ground.

C o n t r o l l e d A r r i v a l   - Consider Delaying Their Arrival

a)     If conditions at the ground are such as to cause concern
       for the safety of spectators endeavouring to enter^the o                   u t e r
       or inner cordons as appropriate will be informed and
       instructed to employ the 'hold' option, if possible.

b)    This 'hold' option will be maintained as long as possible or
      until conditions at the ground have improved, or until the
       'holding' serials have been reinforced, so that their controlled
       arrival can be achieved with safety.

c)    Oakwell control will be kept informed by Serial Commanders
       of the numbers and location of those-.held.

d)     Officers outside the ground will be kept informed of those
       supporters approaching the ground once the 'hold' option
       has ceased.

e)    Consideration will be given to the mood of these large
       numbers of fans, and it will be affected by their proximity
       to the ground when they can hear the reactions of the crowd
       and sense the atmosphere.

f)    Once the 'hold' option has ceased the controlled                  advance
       of those held must be maintained.

g)    The routes to te used for this purpose will               be:-

         i)        QUEENS ROAD, QUEENS GROUND - for away supporters
        ii)        PONTEFRACT ROAD, GROVE STREET - for home supporters
       iii)        BALA STREET, BELGRAVE ROAD - will only be used when
                                                either of the two preferred
                                                routes at i. or ii. above
                                                are not available.
Consider delaying the Kick-Off

a)   If the safety of these large numbers of unexpected fans
      still outside the ground are at risk through their possible
      determination to gain access as kick-off time approaches,
     this consideration should apply.

b) It will be the policy at Oakwell not to delay the kick-off
    owing to the presence of large numbers of ticketless
    supporters at an all ticket game.

c)   The period of kick-off delay should not be excessive.-  15
     minutes will be the normal accepted delay but a longer period
     may be appropriate having regard to the numbers and proximity
     to the venue.

d)   It is imperative that Oakwell control is kept fully informed
     of the numbers and proximity of these arrivals so as to
     enable the officer in command to reach a decision.

Sensible Management of the Fans and Keep them Informed

d)   Equipment at a) & b) above will be utilised to keep
      spectators rot at the ground, informed of the existing   situation.

e)   The equipment at c) above may be additionally utilised,
     when these unexpected arrivals are in or around the ground.

f)   Where the decision to delay the kick-off has been taken,
     it is imperative that this information is conveyed to those
     still outside to ease their anxiety.

2.     WHERE PRACTICABLE,   DETAIN IN THE GROUND.




3.     USE P.A. FACILITY.




4.     IDENTIFY THE EXIT ROUTE BUT SPONTANEITY AND VOLUME MAY DICTATE THE
       EXIT ROUTE - THEN - OPEN THE APPROPRIATE. GATE(S) - ADVISE POLICE
       OFFICERS AND STEWARDS.

EARLY DEPARTURE




The first consideration is safety of all fans, both those attempting to
leave and those remaining.

1.   Attempt to Determine the Reason

     a)   Early departures may be home or away support, or both.

     b)   Direct officer(s) to communicate with those   leaving with   a view to
           determine the reason.

     c)   Quality of play, by one or both teams may be responsible.

     d)   The reason may be apparent to a section of the ground, but not to
          others.

     e)   The age and behaviour of those departing early may suggest the
          possibility of a potential public order situation, or ambush preparation.

     f)   Consider intelligence/rumour.

     g)   Is is because of overcrowding.

2.   Where Practicable, Detain in the Ground

     a)   Efforts should be made to discourage early departure.

     b)   The recognised opening times of exit gates should be revised, if the
           safety of any persons is put at risk.

     c)   Modes of transport may assist in discouraging early departure, i e .
          coaches not leaving until a predetermined time, special train times
          etc .

     d)   Point out to them the dangers of ambush, public order situations etc.

3.   Use P.A. Facility

     a)   The club P.A. facility will be used to discourage early departure.

     b)   This facility should be used with caution as it also informs opposing
          factions.

     c)   The wording of any advice should be of a standard format,    easily
          understood and unambigious.

     d)   Their co-operation and assistance should be requested to fascilitate
          the successful continuance of the Police operation.
                                        - 20   -



     e)   The P.A. system should be utilised to inform the spectators of safe
          egress from the ground.

     f)   It should also be utilised to convey information regarding a
          'hold back' policy and seek their co-operation and support despite
          their seeking to depart early.

     g)   It is important that the fans are kept informed.

     h)   Care will be taken to ensure that no other person using the P.A.
          system unwittingly communicates information likely to be detrimental
          to the success of the Police Operation.

     i)   Only Police Officers practised in the use of Public Address Systems
          should be allowed to broadcast.

4.   Identify the Exit Route but Spontaneity and Volume may Dictate the
     Exit Route - THEN - Open the Appropriate Gate(s) - Advise Police Officers
     and Stewards

     a)   The following gates will be opened by Stewards/Officers from Serial 7,
          20 minutes before the end of the game.  They are considered the most
          appropriate gates servicing the five recognised areas of the ground:-

            i)   Exit   Gate 2        Spion Kop &. Invalids Stand
           ii)   Exit   Gate 4    -    Main Stand Blocks A & B and Terracing (North)
          iii)   Exit   Gate 5        Main Stand Blocks C, D & E and Terracing (South!
           iv)   Exit   Gate 7        Pontefract Road End
            v)   Exit   Gate 13

     b)   These will remain the designated gates which will be opened outside
          these times to facilitate early departure.

     c)   Officers at Serial 7 will retain the responsibility for their
          respective designated gates.

     d)   If spontaneity dictates other exit gates, then Oakwell Control will
          direct other officers to them, who will not be Serial 7 officers.

     e)   The recognised dispersal routes for 'home' and 'away' support will
          be maintained.

     f)   The Officer in Command will, through the Club Safety Officer, provide
          the appropriate stewards with up to date information and the Police
          Strategy.

     g)   Officers opening any exit gates will facilitate egress and at the
          same time prevent access.

5.   Deploy Resources to Control Departure

     a)   A gradual departure will not be demanding upon Police resources.
                                       - 21 -



     b)    Consideration should be given to bringing forward the Phase III time
           in respect of certain serials or part serials.

     c )   Those serials who's duties are outside the ground will be made aware
           of the numbers, mood and direction of travel of those departing early.

     d)    A gradual departure will not require the deployment outside the ground
           of further serial(s).

     e )   A large number of early departures will justify the deployment of at
           least one serial (dependant upon numbers) to the appropriate exit gate.

     f )   Should large numbers seek to leave the ground prior to Phase I I I , then
           the identified filter cordons, in respect of either 'home' or 'away'
           support will require mobilising.

     g)    If necessary Police horses and Police dogs will be directed to the
           appropriate exit gate to assist with the controlled departure.

6.   Attempt to Maintain Segregation

     a)    The routes identified for 'home' and 'away' support should be used
            at all times.

     b)    A cordon supported by horses should be placed across Grove Street
           near the bottom of Queens Ground.

     c ) All serials outside the ground to be alerted to the numbers of those
          departing early and remided to enforce the segregation policy.

     d)    Be aware of the vulnerability of small numbers of supporters leaving
           early, and the likelihood of ambush or attack from oposing faction.

     e)    If possible, marshall the early leavers, and deploy the appropriate
           numbers of serials to escort them to their modes of transport.

     f)    Remember, e) above may require duplicating for both 'away' and 'home'
            support.

     g)    Should the early departures be due to a situation arising at a
           particular part of the ground, and amounts to an emergency evacuation,
           then the appropriate identified areas should be utilised.

7-   Arrange Earlier Transport

     a)    Liasion with the British Transport Police must be maintained, as far
           as trains are concerned.

     b)    If home supporters involved, then the Yorkshire Traction Company
           should be contacted, made aware of the numbers involved and invited
           to consider providing additional local services.

     c)    If a complete coach of supporters wish to leave, consider the
           availability of their driver.
                                    - 22 -



     d)   If away supporters coach or coaches are involved, an escort by Road
          Traffic Department should be provided.

     e)   The serials in and around the three recognised car parks, ie Grove
           Street, Queens Ground - Pipers Collage should be made aware of
           supporters having left early and facilitate their departure if
          possible.

     f)   Be aware of the presence of such persons being unable to leave the area
          due to the 'packing' of car parks.

     g)   If pre-match intelligence indicates that early departure is likely
          - bus and rail organisations should be contacted before match day and
           continguency plans drawn up.

8.   Advise Sub-Division

     a)   Patterns of early departure.

     b)   Match commanders strategy in dealing with those departing early.

     c)   To be alert to the possibility of their being required to provide
          support.

     d)   Of any decision to amend the time of Phase III of the operation,
          brought about by spontaneous early departure.

     e)   Of any arrangements made to provide earlier transport.

WHERE AN AREA WITHIN THE GROUND APPROACHES CAPACITY




1.   Assess Remaining Capacity in the Ground (which includes the Continuation
     of Segregation i.e. Visiting Fans into Home Fans Area)

     a)   Consider information provided by club stewards collating turnstile
          count figures.

     b)   Visual assessment should be used, where possible to measure the
          accuracy of the numbers provided.

     c)   Crowd density to be considered.

     d)   Areas should be identified as being capable of accepting further
          numbers.

     e)   Due cognizance should be taken of numbers still outside the ground,
          and awaiting entry.

     f)   Areas of the ground to be identified as being appropriate to house
          rival fans. At Oakwell, the following are identified

            Spion Kop                       Away supporters only
            Main Stand Terracing (North]    Home supporters only - in the event
                                            of the anticipated away support being
                                            in excess of the Spion Kop capacity
                                            this area may be considered,but only
                                            if this is known prior to match day.
            Main Stand Terracing (South]    Home supporters only
            Pontefract Road End             Home supporters only
            Brewery Stand                   Home supporters only - in the event
                                            of the anticipated 'away' being in
                                            excess of the Spion Kop capacity an
                                            area in this stand, adjacent to the
                                            Spion Kop, may be considered, dependant
                                            upon the numbers of home supporters
                                            already in that area or which may be
                                            anticipated.   This option should be
                                            achieved by allowing the transfer of
                                            away supporters through the sterile
                                            area and then segregated by a Police
                                             cordon.  No access is possible for
                                             away fans through the Brewery Stand
                                             turnstiles without a serious risk to
                                             the segreation policy.  No entry through
                                             turnstiles for a 'mix' of fans is
                                             possible due to the topography of the
                                             ground.
Where Capacity is Available - Deploy Police Resources to those Turnstiles
To be Closed and to those which will receive the fans,

a)   Where a section of the ground has reached or is nearing its capacity,
     and there are still numbers of supporters at the turnstiles attempting
     to gain entry to that section, consideration should be given to:-

        i)   Are they home or away supporters.

       ii)   Communicate with them by the clubs Public   Address System or
             Police equipment - keep them informed.

      iii)   In order to maintain control, additional personnel may be
             required outside the ground to effect the closing of turnstiles
             and the transferring of these fans to other turnstiles.

       iv)   Police horses should be deployed to assist,

        v)   Ensure segregation policy is maintained.

       vi)   The reinforcement of the filter cordons at the receiving
             turnstiles may be required.

      vii)   When transferring numbers to other areas, the capacities of
             these areas must be considered in light of the numbers still
             outside.

     viii)   The stewards providing the details of turnstile useage should
             be required to provide their information more often than every
             15 minutes.

Inform Police Officers and Stewards within       the Ground and the Club,
also what is Intended

a)   Oakwell control to keep all officers inside the ground informed of
      Police stragegy.

b)    The Officer in Command, through the Club Safety Officer should ensure
      that all stewards are kept informed.

c)   The use of the Clubs Public Address System should be utilised.   This
      informs fans, Police and Stewards.  It also puts other emergency
      services on the alert.

d)    The club should already be aware of the approaching capacity situation
      through their turnstile monitoring stewards, but they will need to be
      informed of the polices intention in respect of the diverting those
      outside to other turnstiles and ultimately other parts of the ground.

Option - Consider Delaying Kick-Off - Keep Referee Informed

a)   If the safety of either those already in the ground and/or those
      still outside is at risk then the delay of the kick-off should be
      considered.
                                       - 25 -



      b)    The referee should be kept informed by Oakwell Control.    The telephone
            provided for this purpose is the preferred method.

      c)   As assessment   should be made of the numbers still outside and the
            timescale of their entry considered in arriving at this decision.

      d)   The period of    kick-off delay should not be excessive.  15 minutes will
            be the normal   accepted delay, but a longer period should not be
            discounted.

      Close the Turnstiles

      a)    The closing of turnstiles because of approaching capacity will be a
            decision of the club.

      b)    The Police will assist in enforcing that decision.

      Inform the Fans

     a-)   It is important, when it is necessary to close turnstiles giving
           access to a section of the ground, to appreciate the effect it will
           have on persons seeking to gain entry.

     b)    They will be anxious at this time and may, dependant on numbers and
           temperament seek to gain access by other than the recognised means.

     c)    To allay such a situation arising the fans should be appraised of the
           Police Strategy, whether it be to move them through in the set of
           turnstiles, into another section of the ground, or refuse the admission.

     d)    This information should be communicated obviously before the closure
           of the turnstiles in order to avoid a 'last minute push'.

     e)    The information will be passed to the fans by   the use of loud speaker
           systems;

           1.   Two loud hailers are kept at Oakwell Control for such use.
           2.   A Police Landrover with a Public Address Facility, will be parked
                near to exit gate No. 3, and will be available for use.
           3.   The clubs Public Address fixed system could be used if
                appropriate.

     f)    The co-operation of the fans should be sought in any communication with
           them, and officers should seek to foster a spirit of goodwill.

     g)    If a decision to delay the kick-off is taken, in order to get the fans
            into the ground remember that the fans inside the ground will also need
            to be kept informed.

7.    Controlled Movement to the Pre-Determined Turnstiles

      a) At Oakwell the following arrangements will apply:-
                            - 26 -



  i)   Spion Kop (Turnstiles Nos. 41-47)

          All spectators still outside the ground at these turnstiles
          will be contained at that location by specifically identified
          serials, assisted by Police horses and dogs.

          They will be held until such times as contingency arrangements
          are made to house these 'away' fans elsewhere in the ground
          as outlined in If) above.

          Sufficient serials/horses/dogs should be employed on this
          'hold' policy to prevent pressure on either exit gates 1, 2
          or 3.

          This hold policy may effect the collection of prisoners
          from the Police Detention Room which may have to be delayed.

          Once the decision has been reached to admit them to this or
          another section of the ground, sufficient serials/horses/
          dogs will be deployed to effect that decision under
          controlled conditions.

ii)    Main Stand, Blocks A+B and Terracing North (Turnstiles Nos. 35-40)

          This area may have been determined, before match day as
          being available to 'away' support only.  If that is the case
          and it is reaching capacity, then the following is
          appropriate;

          Sufficient Serials/Horses/Dogs will be deployed to contain
          those 'away' supporters on Grove Street.

          A cordon should be placed across Grove Street at the bottom
          of Belgrave Road in order to maintain the segregation
          policy.

          The only area considered appropriate to accept these 'away'
          fans is the Spion Kop.

          If 'home' fans are being housed in this section of the
          ground, then they should be swept along Grove Street for
          access into the Main Stand Terracing South, the Pontefract
          Road end or the Brewery Stand as appropriate.

          A cordon should be maintained across Grove Street at the
          bottom of Queens Ground to maintain the segregation policy.

iii)   Main Stand, Blocks C, D + E, Terracing South (Turnstiles Nos. 27-34]

          These should be home supporters only.

          Sufficient serials/horses/dogs should be deployed to contain
          and hold these fans outside the Grove Street turnstiles, in
          the first instance.
                         - 27 -



        Once it has been decided to which available section of the
        ground they are to be directed, the holding serials should
        be supplemented by others, to escort these fans to the
        appropriate turnstiles.  Horses and dogs should also be
        utilised.

        These fans should not be placed on the Spion Kop.

iv)   Pontefract Road End (Turnstiles Nos. 11-26)

        These should be home supporters only.

         Sufficient serials/horses/dogs should be deployed to
         contain and hold these fans outside the Grove Street
         turnstiles in the first instance.

        There are two turnstiles facing Grove Street car park
        which will require the presence of serials/horses/dogs also
        should these turnstiles be closed.

        It would be advantageous to unite the two lots of supporters,
        and hold as o n e , rather that the two locations dealt with
        independently.

        Once it has been decided to which available section of the
        ground they are to be directed, the holding serials should
        be supplemented by others to escort these fans to the
        appropriate turnstiles.  Horses and dogs should also be
        utilised.

        A sweeping action down the sterile area of the Grove Street
        car park will be required, if they are to be housed in the
        Brewery Stand.

         If they are to be placed in either of the Main Stand Terraces
         they will need to be escorted and controlled, as they will be
         advancing towards the 'away' end of the ground.

        A cordon will be required across Grove Street at the bottom
        of the Queens Ground, to maintain the segregation policy.

 v)   Brewery Stand (Turnstiles Nos. 1-10)

        These should be home supporters only.

         Sufficient serials/horses/dogs should be deployed to contain
         and hold these fans outside the turnstiles facing Grove
         Street car park in the first instance.

        Once it has been decided to which available section of the
        ground they are to be directed, the holding serials should
        be supplemented by others.  Horses and dogs should also be
        utilised.
                  The two available areas for home supporters ie. Main Stand
                  Terracing and Pontefract Road End will necessitate their
                  being escorted, as they will be advancing towards the
                  'away' end of the ground.

                  A cordon will be required across Grove Street, at the bottom
                  of Queens Ground to maintain the segregation policy.

b)   At all times during any movement of fans from one set of turnstiles
     to another, officers must be alert to any problems or difficulties and
     signs of distress amongst the fans.

Negotiate with the Club - Where Possible - for        Admission to the
Pre-Determined Area for the same Admission Fee

a)   Officer in Command to negotiate with the Club Secretary the possibility
     of introducing a common pricing policy, where admission fees differ,
     and the Police are directing these fans to a section of theground
     attracting a higher fee.

b)   This should be sought as an incentive to encourage the fans
     co-operation.

c)   This remains a club decision.

If no Space Available, Decide - Contain or Disperse - Deploy Resources to
Effect the Decision made - and then Inform the Fans

a)   Contain

       i)     Two holding areas have been identified as follows

              Home support - Grove Street Car Park
              Away support - Queens Ground Car Park

      ii)     Resources identified at Paragraph 7 above will be responsible
              for effecting the containment opton.

     ii i )   . _ Be aware of the need to reinforce if necessary due to increase
              in numbers etc.

b)   Disperse

       i)     The resources identified at Paragraph 7 above will be
              responsible for the controlled dispersal.

      ii)     Be aware of the need to reinforce if necessary due to increase
              in numbers etc.

     iii)     In every case 'home' supporters will be dispersed via Grove
              Street and Pontefract Road.

      iv)     In every case 'away' supporters will be dispersed via Queens
              Ground and Queens Road.
                                       - 29 -



              v)   Such dispersal must only be undertaken if Serial Commanders
                   can be satisfied that it can be achieved safely, without risk
                   to public order and the segregation policy kept intact.

      c ) Inform the Fans

           If either option is chosen, then the considerations at Paragraph 6
           above apply.

10.   Reinforce Security Patrols and Public Order Patrols

           If numbers of those dispersed give rise to concern, then the deployed
           security and public order patrols will require increasing.

           Officer in Command should examine his resources, and determine
           whether or not he has the spare capacity to release serials/horses/
           dogs to supplement the above patrols.

      c)   Consider operation 'Support'.

      d)   Existing patrols to be made aware of dispersal option and numbers,
           mood, direction of travel etc of those dispersed.

11.   Advise Neighbouring Division/Forces where early dispersal is Effected

      a)   The sub-division to be informed of the action re dispersal of fans.

      b)   Neighbouring sub-divisions and divisions should also be informed,
           especially if away fans, are likely to be entering their areas.

      c)   If appropriate neighbouring forces should similarly be informed.

      d)   The home force of the away fans should also be informed of the
            action taken, and of the fact that, the fan may arrive in their
            area en-bloc.

      e)   Advise the Police in whose locality a sporting event may be taking
           place which may attract, these dispersed fans.

      f)   Inform British Transport Police.
GROUND APPROACHING CAPACITY




1.     HERE WE RELY HEAVILY ON PRE-MATCH INTELLIGENCE ON WHICH TO BASE OUR PLANS.




2.    IF GROUND CAPACITY IS APPROACHED THERE IS CLEARLY A NEED TO CLOSE ALL
      TURNSTILES TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF THOSE FANS WITHIN THE GROUND. WHEN THERE
      REMAINS FANS OUTSIDE, STILL INTENT ON GAINING ENTRY INTO THE GROUND, THE
      OPTIONS ARE AS FOLLOWS.




3.    CONSIDER ADDITIONAL RESOURCES, I.E. OPERATION SUPPORT.




4.    IF NO SPACE AVAILABLE, DECIDE - CONTAIN OR DISPERSE      -   D E P L O Y   R E S O U R C E S   TO
      EFFECT THE DECISION MADE - AND THEN INFORM THE FANS.




5.    REINFORCE SECURITY PATROLS AND PUBLIC ORDER PATROLS.




      ADVISE NEIGHBOURING DIVISIONS/FORCES WHERE EARLY DISPERSAL IS EFFECTED.
GROUND APPROACHING CAPACITY




1.   Here we Rely Heavily on Pre-Match Intelligence, on Which to Base our Plans

     a)   Where pre-match intelligence indicates that ground capacity is likely
          to be approached or exceeded, pre-match planning will need to cater
          for sufficient resources to deal with those likely to remain outside
          the ground.

     b)   The filter cordons, barrier cordons and check-points, will need to
          maintain their PHASE I positions, well into if not throughout PHASE
          II of the operation.

     c)   Liaison with the club, prior to match day may well have identified
          the need to provide some form of limited match commentary to be relayed
          to predetermined locations, capable of housing small numbers of fans,
          where it is considered they will be easily contained, and at no risk
          to themselves or others.

     d)   The safety of the® fans, left outside the ground is paramount, as
          their enthusiasm and anxiety to gain access, may put at risk not only
          their own safey, but      . others in an already full to capacity
          ground.

     e)   Where a ground is approaching capacity it needs to be recognised that
          those left outside will be home or away support or indeed both, which
          may well put the segregaton policy at risk.

2.   If Ground Capacity is Approached There is Clearly a Need to Close all
     Turnstiles, to Ensure the Safety of those Fans withn the Ground.  When
     there remains Fans outside, still intent on Gaining Entry into the Ground, the
     Options are as follows:-

     a)   To contain them at their locations immediately outside the ground.

     b)   To move them, under controlled conditions to a predetermined holding
          area.

     c)   To effect a controlled dispersal.

3.   Consider'Additional Resources i.e.      ’Operation Support1

     a)   Reserves held inside the ground.

     b)   Reserves held outside the ground.

     c)   Units on standby at this time.

     d)   Consider reducing the strength ofthe serials at other locations.

     e)   Serials at other locations not fully employed.

     f)   Immediate sub-division.
g)   Surrounding sub-divisions.

h)   Operations, for any spare capacity within the force, i.e. other
     sporting events, marches, etc.

i)   Operation support.

j)   Operation M.A.I.N.E.

If no Space Available Decide, Contain or Disperse - Deploy Resources to
Effect the Decision made - and then Inform the Fans.

a)   Contain

       i)   If possible contain immediately outside the turnstiles, this in
            itself effects the segregation policy.

      ii)   The two holding areas, have been identified as follows:-

            HOME Support - Grove Street car park
            AWAY Support - Queens Ground car park

     iii)   Resources identified on pages 24-27, paragraph 7, will be
            responsible for effecting both levels of containment.

      iv)   Be aware of the need to reinforce if necessary due to the
            increase in numbers, etc .

b)   Disperse

       i)   The resources identified at pages 24-27 paragraph 7, will be
            responsible for effecting the controlled dispersal.

      ii)   Be aware of the need to reinforce if necessary due to the
            increase in numbers, etc.

     iii)   In every case home supporters will be dispersed via Grove
            Street, then Pontefract Road.

      iv)   In every case away supporters will be dispersed via Queens
            Ground, then Queens Road.

       v)   Such dispersal must only be undertaken if Serial Commanders
            can be satisfied that it can be achieved safely, without risk
            to public order and the segregation policy kept intact.

 c ) Inform the Fans

      If either option is chosen then the considerations at page        24,
      paragraph 6 will apply.

Reinforce Security Patrols and Public Order Patrols

a)    If numbers of those dispersed give rise to concern, then the deployed
     security and public order patrols will require increasing.

           dogs to supplement the above patrols.

     c)   Consider operation 'Support'.

     d)   Existing patrols to be made aware of dispersal option and numbers,
          mood, direction of travel etc of those dispersed.

6.   Advise Neighbouring Divison/Forces where early Dispersal is Effected

     a)   The sub-division to be informed of the action re dispersal of fans.

     b)   Neighbouring sub-divisons and divisions should also be informed,
          especially if away fans, are likely to be entering their areas.

     c)   If appropriate neighbouring forces should similarly be informed.

     d)   The home force of the away fans should also be informed of the
          action taken, and of the fact that, the fan may arrive in their
          area en-floc.

     e)   Advise the Police in whose locality a sporting event may be taking
          place which may attract, these dispersed fans.

     f)   Inform British Transport Police.
THE EMERGENCY OPENING OR FORCING OF EXIT GATES TO ALLOW ACCESS




The Scenario envisaged is where the ground is near to, or at capacity and
the situation outside the gate is one where because of the pressure created
fey the crowd, there is a serious risk to life. All other contingencies have
been tried/considered and have failed. As the last resort:-


1.    Identify    the gate:-

      a)     Gate 1.
              (See attached plan).

2.    Identify the area where the supporters can safely enter into.
      This may mean:-

i)    Evacuating the terrace via gates to the pitch or through exit gates.

      a)     Gate     1 will only give access to the Spion Kop terracing.

      b)     The evacuating of the Spion Kop will be :-

                 i)   through the three gates in the perimeter fence onto
                      the playing area.

              ii)     through the gate to the sterile area between Brewery Stand
                      and Spion Kop and subsequently into the Brewery Stand.

             iii)     the dividing gate underneath the police complex will be
                      of limited use owing to its proximity to Gate 1 and its
                      inaccessibility to the terracing.

              iv)     the large gate in the fencing, marked 'Emergency Exit'
                      directly below the Police Complex will also be of limited
                      use, but will allow egress onto the ramp and then the
                      playing area.  It would need to be controlled, as it leads
                      directly to the rear of Exit Gate 2, which may also be
                      under some pressure, along with Gate 1.

ii)   Stop   the gate and brief the Referee

      a)      If the game has not commenced consider delaying the kick off.

      b)     The telephone provided in the Referees room should be utilised
              for that purpose.

      c)     If the game has commenced the Referee should be contacted and
              requested to stop the game.

      d)     This will normally be achieved through the Senior Linesman on
              the Main Stand side of the ground as agreed at the pre-match
              meeting with the match officials.

             In extreme emergency, the Referee may be contacted directly.
      The Referee should quickly be appraised of the situation.

g)    This will enable him to consider

        i)    curtailing the match altogether,

       ii)    merely postponing play for a short time.

Consider use of cutting equipment

a)    At Oakwell cutting equipment is available in two boxes on
       the perimeter track at the Spion Kop end of the ground.

b)    Certain, identified stewards have been trained as to its use.

c)    The Officer in Command will make the decision as to its use.

d)    The safety of those spectators against or near to the
      perimeter fence is of paramount importance, and their
       condition will feature in that decision.

Deploy Resources t o :-

        i)   Control Entry into the ground.

        a)   One half serial will be deployed at the top of the steps
             adjacent to the Invalids Ramp.

        b)   One half serial will be deployed at the bottom of those
             steps.

        c)   One serial will be deployed in the walkway near to the
             rear of the Spion Kop turnstiles.

        d)   The confined space, behind Gate 1, limits the working room
             for a horse or horses.  However, a controlled entry could
             best be effected with horse(s) at this location.

        e)   Outside Gate 1, 2 serials, directly across from the Police
             Detention Room will 'break up' those pushing on the gate.
             These serials will achieve this position by filtering in
             through the Police room.

        f)   They will be supported by at least two horses, which would
             come through the Coop Sports Ground, down the flanks of
             these fans or already be positioned at this location.

        g)    Other horses and serials should be deployed towards the
             rear of this crowd, again to 'break it up' into more manageable
             proportions, and to encourage those at the rear to ease
             back.

        h)   Those serials inside the ground should be supported by at
             least one serial at each of the identified locations.

        i)   This is an extremely limited area, and the only route
             onto the terracing is up the stairway identified at a) and b)
             above.
        j)   The use of police dogs is not appropriate at this
             location owing to the limited working area available.

        k)   Withdraw gate stewards.

       ii)   Facilitate Evacuation of the Terrace

        a)   Four serials would be deployed directly across the
              front of the Spion Kop terracing, forming a cordon.
             They would be positioned on the track or dressed back onto
             the playing area according to need.

        b)   Their role would be containment and segregation, not rescue.

        c)   Behind these serials, four dogs would be in line abreast,
              similarly dressing back as needs dictate.

        d)   Extra serials, emergency services, etc would be fed into
             this area from the sides in front of the pitch wide cordon.

        e)   Two serials and two dogs should be deployed in the Brewery
             Stand, they will form a cordon from the perimeter wall to the
             rear of the terracing and encourage all spectators at
             that location to move towards the Pontefract Road End,
             leaving behind them a cleared area from the Spion Kop
             the the Northern Stairway to be filled by away supporters
              from the Spion Kop.

        f)   Once this area has been cleared, then these serials and
             dogs will need to remain in position to maintain the
              segregation policy.

        g)   One serial will be required to control the flow of the away
              supporters through the gates at the sterile area, and
              should be positioned on the Spion Kop side of the gates.

        h)   A further serial, or dog, may be required to secure the
              Northern Stairway, or control any movement down it.

     iii)    To Maintain Segregation

             The deployments identified at i and ii above encompass
             the maintenance of segregation.

Use of Public Address

a)     The wording of any advice should be of a standard format,
        easily understood and unambiguous.

b)     This facility should be used, to keep both those inside
        and outside informed of the risk to their safety.

c)     Any decision to delay or stop the game should be   broadcast.

d)     The cooperation of the fans should be sought, in any
        communication with them, and officers should seek to foster
        a spirit of goodwill.
 e)   The 2 Police hand held loud hailers should be considered for
      use, if appropriate and also the Landrover's System.

Alert Emergency Services

a)    Ambulance Control.

b)    Fire Service Control.

c)    Sub-Divisional Control.

d)    Force Operations.

      ensure that all stewards are kept informed.

b)    Police Officers will be kept aware via police radios.

 c)   The use of the Club's Public Address System should also be
      utilised to inform Police and Stewards, it also keeps the
      Supporters informed.

 d)   The club will be aware of the approaching capacity through
      their turnstile monitoring stewards, but they will need to
      be kept informed of the policy strategy.
Identify the Gate

b)    Gate 2.
     (See attached plan).

Identify the area, where the supporters can safely   enter into.
This may mean:-

Evacuating the terrace via gates to the pitch, or through exit gates.

a)    Gate 2 will give access to either the Spion Kop terracing
       or Main Stand North terracing, but only through the
       secure dividing gates, which are manned by club stewards.

b)    As will be seen from the attached plan, entry by means of
       this gate, will normally lead down the access ramp onto the
       playing surface, through an unstewarded but closed, access gate.

c)    It would not be appropriate to evacuate any other section of the
       ground in the event of this gate being forced or opened to relieve
       pressure.

d)    Adequate deployment of resources would be able to effectively
       contain those entering.

See Gate 1, above.

Deploy Resources t o :-

i)    Control entry into the ground.

a)    2 horses directly inside the gate.

b)    2 Serials positioned in a cordon directly in front of the refresh­
       ment stand, to relieve any pressure on the dividing gates into

        ate.

f)    Behind this Serial and on the ramp to   the playing area, two dogs
       should be deployed.
  g)    On the playing surface a cordon of at least 4 serials
         would be deployed across this corner of the ground, including
         the front of the Main Stand, North terracing to contain these fans.

  h)    Dogs and horses as appropriate, will supplement these
         Serials, from the rear.

  i)    As the ground is at capacity, it is considered that, the safety
         of those entering the ground and those already in the ground,
         would be best achieved by these fans being contained on the
         playing area.

 j)     At least 2 Serials and two horses should be deployed
         outside Gate 2, to divide the crowd to facilitate a controlled
         entry and relieve pressure.

 k)     Withdraw the steward.

 ii)    Facilitate Evacuation of the Terrace

        As this gate does not give direct access to a terrace, but

d)      One Serial to be positioned on the inside of the dividing
         gate to the North terrace.  This serial will also prevent access
         to the steps at Block 'C '.

e)      One Serial to be positioned at the bottom of the steps giving
         access to Block 'D '.
One Serial to be positioned at the bottom of the steps
giving access to Block *E*. This serial will also give
attention to the snack bar.

One Serial to the rear of the horses at c) above to protect the
dividing gate into the Pontefract Road end terracing.

One Serial to be positioned at the entrance to the South
terracing, opposite Gate 6.

2 Dogs to be positioned to the rear of Serial at h) above, to
prevent access to the South terrace and to prevent any supporters
from the South terrace attempting to link or confront with the
incoming crowd.

2 Serials and 2 horses, should be deployed outside Gate 5, to divide
the crowd, to facilitate a controlled entry and relieve
pressure.

2 Dogs in Grove Street near to Gate 4, to prevent any surge in
that direction.

2 Dogs in Grove Street near to Gate 6, to prevent any surge in
that direction.

Withdraw steward.

Facilitate Evacuation of the Terrace

4 Serials would be deployed on the perimeter track in front of
the South terracing of the Main Stand, forming a cordon.  They
would dress back onto the pitch or funnel supporters onto the
North Terrace or Pontefract Road End terrace as instructed,
but only if permitted capacities allow.

Their role would be containment and segregation not rescue.

Behind these serials, four dogs would be in line abreast,
similarly dressing back as needs dictated.

Extra serials, emergency services, etc. would be fed into
this area from the sides, in front of the cordon to effect rescue.

2 Serials and 2 dogs should be fed into the North terracing
from the players tunnel or into the Pontefact Road End terracing
from the pitch wall adjoining the South terrace.   They should
form a cordon and encourage all supporters at that location to move
along the terracing towards the Brewery Stand.   This would leave
behind a cleared area to be filled by supporters from the South
terrace.

The dividing gate in the wall between the South terrace and
the Pontefract Road End terrace, near to Gate 6, would also lend
itself to use for evacuation of the South terrace, if the
area inside of Gate 6 were kept clear.
g)     Once the area on either the North Terrace or Pontefract Road
       End terrace has been cleared, the serials and dogs may need
       to remain in position to enforce the segregation policy.  This
       will be dependent on whether the supporters fed in are 'home'
       or 'away1.

ii)    To maintain segregation

       The deployments at i) and ii) above encompass the maintenance
       of segregation.

         Stand (seating) or the South terracing.

b)      Immediately inside the gate there is an unrestricted walk
         through a narrow passage onto the South terracing.

c)      To the left there is a narrow passageway between the turnstile
         block and the stairway access to Block 'E*. This gives access
         to a level whichcpens out towards the dividing gate for the
         North terrace.   The area is bounded by the dividing gate to
         the North terrace, the rear of the Main Stand and a snack bar.

Identify the gate

g) Gate 7, and
h) Gate 8.
   (See attached plan).

Identify the area where the supporters can safely enter into.       This
may m ean:-

i)   Evacuating the terrace via gates to the pitch or through exit gates.

a)   Both Gates 7 and 8, will give access to the Pontefract Road
     End terracing, from the Grove Street end of the terracing.

b)   Immediately inside the gates is a level area which has a number
     of terraced steps up from it to the terracing itself, before
     it decends to the corner of the playing area, adjacent to the
     Main Stand, South terrace.

c)   To the right of Gate 7, but to the left of Gate 8, when
     entering is a floodlight pylon, whose four large legs, will
     assist in breaking a crowd surge through either gate.

d)   To the left   from either gate is access at the rear of the
      terracing to the dividing gate to the rear of the Main Stand,
      South terrace.

e)   To the front from either gate is access at the rear of the
      terracing at the rear of the Pontefract Road End Stand
      canopy, and onward to the rear of the open back entries, and the
      dividing gate to the Brewery Stand.

f)   To the right down a flight of steps prior to the    canopy
      is access to the inside of gates 9 and 10.

g)   Spectators on the Pontefract Road End terracing will need to
     be evacuated onto the playing surface.

h)   They could,   under controlled conditions, exit by way of
      gates 9 and 10, provided the police operation holding
      these   entering through gates 7 and 8 permits this option.

i)   Again   under controlled conditions, exit through the
     dividing gate onto the Brewery Stand.   This would facilitate
     limited egress owing to the size of the gate, also, provision
     would have to be made in the Brewery Stand Section of the
     ground for them, due to capacities being reached.   Exit
     gates 11, 12 and 13 would be utilised to achieve this aim.

Stop the game and brief the Referee

See Gate 1 above.

Consider the use of cutting    equipment

Section of the Ground.
Deploy resources to:-

i)   Control entry into the ground

a)   2 horses directly inside the gate(s) to retard the progress of
     the entering spectators. It should be noted that    the legs of the
     floodlighting pylon will   restrict the movement of the horses.

b)   3 serials behind the horses to form a cordon with a view
      to holding those entering, and preventing them from gaining
      access to the terracing.

c)   2 further Serials behind the 3 mentioned at b) to reinforce
      same.

d)   One Serial deployed inside the dividing gate to the Main Stand,
     to secure this gate.

e)   One serial forming a cordon across the walkway to the rear
      of the terracing to restrict the flow of spectators, in the
      direction of the dividing gate and the steps down to Gates
      9 and 10.

f)   Four dogs should be    deployed in pairs, one to the left of the
      gates being entered    to deter movement in that direction and
      two adjacent to the    cordon on the rear walkway to deter any
      rushing towards the    rear of the terracing.

g)   Outside the ground at least 2 serials and 2 horses will
      be deployed to 'break up' the crowd to affect a controlled
      entry and relieve the pressure.

h)   Four dogs in Grove Street, two on either sides of the gate,
      but a good distance away, to restrict any 'surge' to another
      Section of the Ground.

i)   The initial strategy will be to contain this influx in the
      open area directly behidn the gates, if safe to do so, pending accom
      modation being made available on the terracing through controlled
      evacuation.

j)   Withdraw stewards.

Facilitate evacuation of the Terace

a)   4 serials deployed to form a cordon across the entire length
      of the Pontefract Road End. They should dress back sufficient
      distance so as to enable adequate evacuation of the terracing.

b)   Their role would be containment and segregation, not rescue.

c)   Sufficient serials, emergency services, as required should
     be fed into this area in front of the cordon to effect rescue.

d)   Behind the four serial cordon, four dogs, line abreast should
     be deployed to re-inforce the cordon.
                                52




       e)    Two serials, one each at Exit     Gates 9 and 10 to prevent access
              and encourage safe and speedy    evacuation, by those using the
              stairs and ramp.

       f)    The two open entries at the rear of the terracing should
              be manned by a serial, to encourage and ensure safe: and
              speedy evacuation.

       g)    The dividing gate to the Brewery Stand will remain open
              and stewarded.

       h)    An increase in the numbers on the Brewery Stand through the
              above, then consideration,should be given to opening
              the Exit gates, 11, 12, 13 and people encouraged to use
       i)    them.   Serials should be deployed to effect this safe
             and speedy evacuation.

may me a n :-

Evacuating the Terrace via gates to the pitch or through exit gates.

a)   Both gates 9 and 10 give access to the Pontefract Road End
     of the Ground.

b)   The only way to the terracing is by way of   a stairway, or a ramp,
      both of which commence directly behind the gates.

c)   Access to this area may be permitted as it   is possible to contain
      reasonably easily and facilitate a controlled movement towards
      the terracing, if appropriate.

d)   If these spectators are to be allowed on the terracing, then
     those already there will need to be evacuatedonto the playing
     surface, or through Exit Gates 7 and 8.

      of the entering spectators.

b)    At least 2 serials behind the horses to form a cordon with a
      view to controlling those entering.

c)    One serial deployed at the bottom of the ramp to prevent access
      to the ramp in the first instance as this leads directly to
      one of the openings to the rear of the terracing.

d)   One dog deployed directly behind this cordon to reinforce it.

e)   One cordon at the bottom of stairway to prevent or retard access.

f)   Two dogs along the walkway at the rear of the Pontefract Road

                            _ 54 -



       g)   One serial to the left at the top of the stairs to form a cordon
            across the walkway to restirct movement in that direction.  One
            serial will be sufficient due to the restricting effect of
            the stairs, and the filtering exercise by the cordons at
            the foot of the stairs.

       h)   To the rear of this cordon, one further dog to reinforce
            the cordon.

            Stand, to restirct movement towards that seciton of the
            ground.

       j)   One serial to each of the two openings into the rear of the
            terracing, to restrict uncontrolled movement onto the
            terracing.  One serial at each opening is considered adequate
            due to the other retarding and filtering resources in front
            of them.

       k)   Two horses and at least two serials to be deployed immediately
            outside the gate(s) to 'break up' the crowd and relieve
            pressure.

       1)   Two dogs, one at each side of the crowd, but well away,
            to discourage 'surging' to another section of the ground.

       m)   Withdraw stewards.

       n)   The initial strategy will be to restrict the movement of this
            crowd in the area immediately behind the gates and if necessary
            allow them to the terracing under controlled conditions.

ii)    Facilitate evacuation of the terrace

       a)   Four serials deployed to form a cordon across the entire
            length of the Pontefract Road End on the perimeter track.
            They should dress back sufficient distance so as to enable
            adequate evacuation of the terracing.

       b)   Their role would be containment and segregation, not rescue.

       c)   At least four dogs, line abreast should be deployed to reinforce
            the cordon.

Identify the area where the supporters can safely enter into.     This
may mean:-

Evacuating the terrace via gates to the pitch or through exit gates

a)   Gate 11 gives access to the     Brewery Stand.

b)   Immediately behind this gate is the base of a ramp which takes
      spectators directly to the open Brewery Stand corner terracing.

c)   To the left of this gate is a brick built toilet block and
      banking with two meter high fencing on top, segregating it from the
      Pontefract Road End section.

d)   To the right is a level walkway towards Exit gates 12 and 13,
      and ultimately around the rear of the ground to the stairways
      affording access to the covered Brewery Stand terracing.

e)   Access to the Brewery Stand terracing, when full may only be
      achieved by an evacuation of that section of the ground onto the
      playing area.

f)   Exit gates 12 and 13 may also be used in an evacuation, but this
      can only be achieved, if those gaining entry through gate 11 are
      channelled up the ramp to the corner Terracing.

Stop the game and brief the Referee

      f)   Two horses to the right of Gate 11, inside, on the walkway,
           to Exit gates 12 and 13.

      g)   Two serials behiiid the horses, to form a cordon and contain those
           gaining access and prevent their progress towards exit gates
           12 and 1 3 .

      h)   Two horses and at least two serials immediately outside the
           gate to 'break up' the crowd and relieve pressure.

      i)   Four dogs - two at each side of the crowd but a good distance
           away, to discourage surging towards another section of the
           ground.

      j)   The strategy at this location would be to hold those spectators
           gaining entry in the flat area inside the gate, and then under
           controlled conditions allow them onto the Brewery Stand Terracing,
           once adequate room had been made for them.

ii)   Facilitate evacuation of the terrace

      a)   Eight serials deployed to form a cordon along the entire length
            of the Brewery Stand on the perimeter track. They should dress
            back a sufficient distance so as to enable, adequate and safe
            evacuation of the terracing.

      b)   Their role should be containment and segregation, not rescue.

      c)   At least six dogs should be deployed in line abreast, to
           reinforce the cordon.

      d)   Sufficient serials and emergency services as required should be
           fed in front of the cordon to effect rescue and assist with
           evacuation.

      e)   Two serials,one each at gates 12 and 13, should be utilised to
           facilitate safe and speedy evacuation.

      f)   Three serials, one each to be deployed at each of the stairways,
           to ensure they are kept clear and safe for use.

      g)   In extreme emergency it may be considered appropriate to use
           the gate from the Brewery Stand to the Spion Kop as an avenue
           of evacuation, but such a measure, jeopardises the segregation
           policy.

iii) To          maintain segregation

      a)   The deployment at i) and ii)above encompasses the maintenance
           of segregation.

      b)   Additional serials may be required to either:

           1)   Reinforce the perimeter track serial adjacent to the
                Spion Kop.

           2)   To ensure the safety of those supporters permitted into the
                Spion Kop through the sterile areas gates, if that option is

Identify the area where the supporters can safely enter.     This
may mean:-

Evacuating the terrace via gates to the pitch or through exit
GATES, to create space

a)   Both gates 12 and 13 give access to the Brewery Stand section
     of the Ground.

b)   Access to both the open terracing and covered terracing is by
     a walkway along the rear of the stand and up three separate flights
     of stairs, one external, and a southern and northern flight which
     are covered.

c)   Access to the terrace can also be gained by way of a ramp
     opposite gate 11 to the left of gates 12 and 13 but this is
     impractical if entering through gates 12 and 13.

d)   To the right, when entering is an eight foot high solid stone
      wall without any entrances whatsoever.  It runs completely along
      the rear of the ground.

e)   The most appropriate evacuation,should exit gates 12 and
      13 be opened, is onto the playing surface.

f)   A limited evacuation could be achieved by using the dividing
      gate at the rear of the Pontefract Road end.

g)   The use of Exit gate 11 could be utilised if the entry was
      controlled, but this effectively would mean evacuating spectators
      from the ground near to where, either an allowed or forced
      entry had been effected.

Stop the game and brief the Referee

See Gate 1 above.

Consider   use of cutting equipment

See Gate 1 above, but there is no perimeter fencing atthis     Section
of the ground.

Deploy resources t o :-

Control entry ito the ground

a)   Two horses directly inside the gate to retard the progress of       the
      entering spectators.

b)   Two serials to form a cordon behirid the horsesin thefirst
     instance to retard and hold the entering fans.
                                 - 60 -




       c)   Two dogs behind the cordon to reinforce it.

       d)   Two horses to the left of the two gates to securethe walkway
             to Gate 11.

       e)   Two serials   to form a cordon behind the horses to restirct the
            movement of   the entering spectators towards Gate 11 and the
             ramp.

       f)   Two dogs deployed behind this cordon to reinforce   it.

       g)   One serial at the top of the steep banking towards the left
             of the walkway to the rear of the Brewery Stand, to deter
             any persons endeavouring to scale the banking.

       h)   Outside the gate(s), two horses and at least two serials
            to be deployed to 'break up' the crowd and relieve pressure.

       i)   Two dogs to be deployed a distance away from these supporters,
            up Grove Street Car Park to discourage surging towards another
            section of the ground.

       j)   The Police strategy at this location would be to hold those
            gaining entry inside the gates until such time as it was
            considered safe to allow them to proceed under controlled
            conditions.

ii)    Facilitate evacuation of the Terrace

       a)   Eight serials deployed to form a cordon along the entire length
            of the Brewery Stand, on the perimeter track.  They should
            dress back a sufficient distance so as to enable adequate
            and safe evacuation of the terracing.

       b)   Their role would be containment and segregation, not rescue.

       c)   At least six dogs should be deployed in line abreast, to
            re-inforce the cordon.

       d)   Sufficient serials and emergency services as required should be
            fed in front of the cordon to effect rescue and assist with
            evacuation.

       e)   One serial to gate 11 to prevent access and to facilitate safe
            and speedy evacuation (if this option is used).

       f)   Three serials one each to the three stairways to ensure they
            are kept clear and safe for use.

       g)   In extreme emergency it may be considered appropriate to use
             the gate from the Brewery Stand to the Spion Kop as an avenue
            of evacuation, but such a measure jeopardises the segregation
            policy.

iii)   To maintain segregation

       a)   The deployments at i) and ii) above encompasses the maintenance
            of segregation.
b)    Additional serials may be required to either:-

      1)    Reinforce the periiheter track serial adjacent to
             the Spion Kop.

      2)    To ensure the safety of those supporters permitted
             into the Spion Kop through the sterile area gates,
             if that option is taken.

Use of Public Address

See as at Gate 1 above.

Alert Emergency Services

See as at Gate 1 above.

Implement Emergency Contingency Plans

Move to Major Incident procedures if necessary

 Inform Police, Steward and Club

 a)    The Officer in command, through the Club Safety Officer should
       ensure that all stewards are kept informed.

b)    Police Officers will be kept aware via police radios.

c)    The use of the Club's Public Address System should also be
      utilised to inform Police and Stewards, it also keeps the
       Supporters informed.

d)    The club will be aware of the approaching capacity through
       their turnstile monitoring stewards, but they will need to
      be kept informed of the policy strategy.

ADVISE NEIGHBOURING DIVISIONS/FORCES WHERE EARLY DISPERSAL IS EFFECTED.
ACTION TO BE TAKEN ON FORESEEABLE PATTERNS O F ARRIVAL




EARLY ARRIVALS




1.      PRE-MATCH INTELLIGENCE.




2.      OBSERVE AND MONITOR.




3.      SWEEP, CONTAIN OR CONTROLLED DISPERSAL.




4.      ARRANGE EARLY ADMISSION TO THE GROUND WHERE POSSIBLE.




        CONSIDER SPECTATORS COMFORT FOR THOSE ADMITTED INTO THE GROUND.




6.      CONSIDER INTELLIGENCE FROM THESE EARLY ARRIVALS WHICH MAY AFFECT POST
        MATCH PLANNING




LATE ARRIVALS



1.      PRE-MATCH INTELLIGENCE.




2.     MAKE AVAILABLE SUFFICIENT TURNSTILES TO ACCOMMODATE THE LATE COMERS.




3.     DEPLOY SUFFICIENT POLICE RESOURCES/RESERVES TO MANAGE THE LATE ARRIVALS.
GROUND APPROACHING CAPACITY




HERE WE RELY HEAVILY ON PRE-MATCH INTELLIGENCE ON WHICH TO BASE OUR PLANS,




IF GROUND CAPACITY IS APPROACHED THERE IS CLEARLY A NEED TO CLOSE ALL TURNSTILES TO
ENSURE THE SAFETY OF THOSE SUPPORTERS WITHIN THE GROUND.          WHEN THERE REMAINS
SUPPORTERS OUTSIDE, STILL INTENT ON GAINING ENTRY INTO THE GROUND, THE OPTIONS ARE AS
FOLLOWS.




1.     CONSIDER ADDITIONAL RESOURCES, I.E. OPERATION SUPPORT.




2.     IF NO SPACE AVAILABLE, DECIDE - CONTAIN OR DISPERSE - DEPLOY      RESOURCES   TO
       EFFECT THE DECISION MADE - AND THEN INFORM THE SUPPORTERS.




3.     ENSURE THE SECURITY OF THE GROUND.




4.     PUBLIC ORDER PATROLS.




5.     ADVISE NEIGHBOURING DIVISION/FORCES WHERE EARLY DISPERSAL IS EFFECTED.
THE EMERGENCY OPENING OR FORCING OF GATES TO ALLOW ACCESS.




THE SCENARIO ENVISAGED IS WHERE THE GROUND IS NEAR TO, OR AT CAPACITY AND
THE SITUATION OUTSIDE THE GATE IS ONE WHERE BECAUSE OF THE PRESSURE CREATED
BY THE CROWD, THERE IS A SERIOUS RISK TO LIFE. ALL OTHER CONTINGENCIES HAVE
BEEN TRIED/CONSIDERED AND HAVE FAILED.  AS THE LAST RESORT:



1.            IDENTIFY THE GATE.




2.            IDENTIFY THE AREA WHERE THE SUPPORTERS CANSAFELY ENTER.
              THIS MAY MEAN -


       i)     EVACUATING THE TERRACE VIA GATES TO THE PITCH OR THROUGH EXIT
              GATES, TO CREATE SPACE.


       ii)    STOP THE GAME AND BRIEF THE REFEREE.


       iii)   CONSIDER USE OF CUTTING EQUIPMENT.




3.            INFORM POLICE, STEWARDS AND CLUB.




4.            DEPLOY RESOURCES TO:


       i)     CONTROL ENTRY INTO THE GROUND


       ii)     FACILITATE EVACUATION OF THE TERRACE


       iii)    MAINTAIN SEGREGATION




5.             USE OF P.A.




6.            ALERT EMERGENCY SERVICES




7.            IMPLEMENT EMERGENCY CONTINGENCY PLANS.




8.            MOVE TO MAJOR INCIDENT PROCEDURES    IF NECESSARY

  Dear Colleague,

            As vou are aware, one o f the e f f e c t s o f the interim recommendations
  has led to a reduction o f some 15% or so o f the c a p a c i t i e s a t most fo o tb a ll

           A second is su e concerned press s p e c u la tio n , f u e ll e d by a declaration
  by the Football League, t h a t the d e c ision to delay the kick^off. a t fo o tb a ll                 >
  matches had been abused by some ground commanders.                              ^ This o ption,         J
  h ig h lig h te d by recommendation 29 o f the Interim Recommendations, had, the
'League suggested, the e f f e c t of encouraging f o o t b a l1 supporters to arrive
  a t fo o tb a ll matches even l a t e r , a n t i c i p a t in g - t h a t the delay would be
  implemented by the p o li c e anxious to avoid a crush.

              I t was resolved not to respond p u b lic ly to t h i s sp e c u la tiv e
 journalism. At a l l sports e v e n ts , not j u s t foo tb a ll matches, the f a c t of
 l a t e a r r i v a ls has been with us for generations.                    I t i s a matter f o r the
 Chief Constable and the ground commander on the day to make the d e c isio n on
 whether or not to delay a                      k i c k - o f f . The Committee considered i t was
 prudent, however to ensure                  th at Chief Constables were apprised th at the
 matter had been d iscussed.                I t may be th a t there have been occasions when
 e x c e s s iv e caution has been understandably exer c ise d or value judgements
 s l i g h t l y d is t o r t e d immediately post-H illsborough. N evertheless, i t was not
 envisaged th a t i t would be used by Ground Commanders as a matter of routine
 but only in tr u ly exceptional circumstances.

              F i n a l l y , though a number of the Interim Recommendations had proved
  d i f f i c u l t , the Recommendation 4 which required f o r w r itte n agreements
  between the p o li c e and the fo o tb a ll clubs wherein the r e s p o n s i b i l i t i e s o f
  the two groups would be r e s o lv e d , proved most d i f f i c u l t .                 I t became
  apparent th at there remained widespread d i f f i c u l t y on the form and content
  o f same; whereas some p o l i c e fo r c e s and p o li c e a u t h o r i t i e s were content to
  sign agreed minutes of meetings with c lu b s , other fo r c es had sen t l e t t e r s
  to clubs s e t t i n g out parameters o f r e s p o n s i b i l i t y and y e t others had
. drafted all-embracing c o n t r a c t s .      _

         Accordingly, in the l i g h t o f such d is p a r it y , the Committee decided
  th at an approach be njade to Lord J u s t ic e Taylor for a meeting with the
  Chairman and Secretary to r e s o lv e a number of key areas of the Interim
  recommendations.    That meeting h a s been arranged for 18 October 1989.            I
  have undertaken to forward such guidance as I am able a f t e r th at meeting.

        SUBJECT:   Ambulances at Football Grounds

         With regard to the Ambulance Service policy on the above matter, I
         I have spoken to Mr Hopkins, Deputy Chief Ambulance Officer, who
         states that the Ambulance Service policy is as follows
         Incidents outside the ground, even at turnstiles WILL NOT be dealt
         with by the standby ambulance and crew, but SYMAS should be
         contacted via Force Operations Roam and another ambulance will be
         directed to the scene.
         Incidents insdie the ground will be dealt with by the St Johns
         Ambulance Brigade. If they require assistance from SYMAS the standby
         crew will assist but only in exceptional circumstances will they
         carry the patient to hospital. If the standby crew and vehicle carry
         out this journey to a hospital, SYMAS will immediately direct
         another ambulance to the ground to continue the standby duties. More
         often than not, SYMAS will request another ambulance to perform the
         transport duties, to hospital.

        Mr Hopkins pointed out that the ambulances on standby are paid for by
        the football club specifically for major incident duties. He further
        stataes that if the standby vehicles are used for minor accidents then
        the club could claim compensation for breach of contract.

         SYMAS control are now aware of policy. I suggest that this matter
         be included on the next agenda for the information of the Implementation
         Team.

        SUBJECT:       DISCUSSION PAPER - PROBLEMS FOR BRITISH RAIL AND BTP



        The British Transport Police have been lookiag at problems which may be
        coming their way which involve an accute shortage of rolling stock in
        the railway system. The situation may well arise where people will arrive
        over some hours for a football match and will all arrive back at the station
        together to leave and there will be insufficient train space available to
        cope. The worry is that a large crowd may be left for some time at or near
        a Railway Station and they are seeking to plan to aviod this happening.


        At a meeting with Supt Nicholas of the BTP on Tuesday 26 September 1989
        he suggested that British Rails option was to lay on bus trans port in
        lieu of trains where the latter was not available. His main query was that
        at each ground what would be our preferred contingency for this happening.
        Would we prefer:-
        1 Buses to be available at the Railway Station
        2 Buses to be available at the usual coach park location and the crowd advised
        accordingly.


        I would suggest that the decision may be different for different grounds
        and that there may be differing resource implications. The item is submitted
        for discussion please.

    TAYLOR INQUIRY INTO HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - INTERIM REPORT

    1. When the Committee last met it noted the Association's written
    evidence to the Taylor Inquiry (Minute 77/1989).  The interim Report of the
    Inquiry was issued on 4 August 1989 and the Home Office have considered the
    Report with their Circular No 68/1989.  The Circular informs of the
    contents of the Report and that the Home Secretary welcomes the
    thoroughness of it and accordingly urges that the required action be taken
    without delay.

    2. The Circular continues to point out that wide as the scope of the
    recommendations are, they are aimed primarily at football league grounds
    and the international stadiums used for soccer and rugby where there are
•   large,   densely packed crowds on terraces. The Home Office hope that the
    application of the recommendations will be considered in connection with
    other designated sports grounds, and sports grounds at which large crowds
    are in attendance.

    3. On resource implications the Circular states "Whilst acknowledging that
    local authorities will need to examine current priorities in order to
    action   the Inquiry's recommendations, it is not envisaged thatthere
    should   be significant long-term resource implications for them. The cost
    of any additional policing and/or provision of ambulance services at
    football grounds is expected to be met by the clubs or ground operators
    themselves".

>>> 4. Appended is a copy of Chapter 24 of the Report, which sets out the
    recommendations.

    5. Advisers to the Police Committee have been invited to comment.     The
    financial adviser to the Committee comments, in relation to resources,
    referred to in the Home Office Circular, that on "the cost of any
    additional policing ... is expected to Jpe met by the clubs or ground
    operators themselves",   these additional costs could be quite substantial
    and represent a serious extra burden on some football clubs. Mr Johnston
    considers that it may well, be that some of the expenditure is incurred
    outside the football grounds, and that the Associations should therefore
    press the Home Office to reinforce this point, for example by issuing a
    specific circular relating to charges for police attendance.

    6 . Emergency Planning advisers to the AMA's Fire and Emergency Planning
    Committee were also invited to comment on the Report.  One of the Chief
    Fire Officer advisers notes that Taylor has clearly identified a number of
    the problems that arise under security considerations conflict with basic
    means of escape principles.  Mr T F Elton, Chief Fire Officer, Tyne and
    Wear Metropolitan Fire Brigade, feels that the interim Report has brought
    into sharp focus concern about the methods used both to determine and
    monitor safe capacities of all types of premises.  Mr Elton welcomes
    Taylor's recommendation of a 15% decrease in capacities but concludes that
    there is no substitute for a wide ranging and authoritative  study on the
    subject.

                                         APPENDIX TO AMA POL 89 69



                     CHAPTER 24 - THE RECOMMENDATIONS


315. The recommendations which follow are the minimum necessary
to ensure that existing football grounds can for the present be
safely used, based upon the evidence which I have heard at
Sheffield and other information I have received. They complement
the recommendations which Mr Justice Popplewell set out after his
inquiry at Bradford.

316. Those which are asterisked should be carried out before the
1989/90 season starts.  The rest should be started forthwith and
completed as soon as possible.


Maximum Capacities for Terraces

1.   Where a viewing terrace is divided into pens or areas which
are self-contained, the Safety Certificate should specify the
maximum number of spectators to be admitted to each such pen or
area.

A pen or area is to be deemed "self-contained" notwithstanding
that it has a gate or gates affording access to another pen or
area and whether such gate or gates be open or shut.

2.   Each       figure   for   maximum       capacity should   be    assessed   in
accordance with Chapter 16^ of the Green Guide ("the Green Guide
figure") subject to the following qualifications:-


        (a)   in arriving at "the        Green    Guide   figure",    proper and
              realistic allowance must be made for all factors which
              should reduce the permissible           density       in accordance
              with  the range of maximum              figures       specified in
              paragraphs 221 and 222 of the Green Guide;

        (b)   after assessing " t h e    Green Guide figure", a d e d u c t i o n
              of 15% should b e made to improve the safety margin.
                                         1
3.    Arrangements should be made:-


       (a)   to liait the number of spectators entering each self-
             contained pen or area to the maximum capacity figure
             assessed in accordance with Recommendation 2 above
             either electronically, mechanically, by a ticketing
             arrangement, by counting or otherwise, and


      (b)    to close off further access to such pen or area when
             its maximum capacity is about to be reached.



Filling and Monitoring Terraces


4.   There should be a written agreement between the club and the
police setting out their respective responsibilities for crowd
safety and control and in particular for the filling of each
self-contained pen or other terraced area and the monitoring of
spectators in each such pen or area to avoid overcrowding. Any
variation of the agreement in respect of an individual match
should be agreed in writing in advance.


5.    At each match,   there should be on the perimeter track, for
each self-contained pen or other terraced area, a steward (if the
club is monitoring that area) or a police officer (if the polica
are monitoring it) whose sole duty is to check crowd conditions
in that area for possible overcrowding or distress throughout the
period the area is occupied by spectators.        Whoever is so
appointed should 'be in addition to any other steward or police
presence.   He shculc have ready access to the " d i c e cfficar
authorised under Recommendation 3 below 7 and by radio to the
control room.


Fences and Gates


6.    All police officers and stewards with duties in relation to
the   terraced araas and especially those with duties under
Recommendation 5 above, should be fully briefed and trained with
regard to the recognition of crowd densities, to the recognition
of signs of distress and to crowd dynamics.       Training should
include demonstrations at the ground and photographs, designed to
enable stewards and officers to recognise different crowd
densities.

7.   All gates in radial or perimeter fences of pens or other
self-contained areas should be painted in a different colour frcm
the rest of the fence and marked "Emergency Sxit".

8.   Where there are perimeter fences, all gates to the pitch
should be kept fully open during the period when spectators ara
on the terrace.

9.   There should be in respect of each gate in a perimeter fence
(or group of gates if they are close together) a police officer
authorised to decide whether or not to allow spectators through a
gate to relieve overcrowding.     The officer so authorised in
respect of each gate should be identified for each match and
known to be so by all stewards and police officers in that
vicinity.   He should be able to make radio contact with the
control room either himself or via an officer close at hand.


10.   Suitable and sufficient cutting equipment should be provided
by the club at each ground where there are perimeter fences to
permit the immediate removal of enough fencing to release numbers
of spectators if necessary'.   Agreement should be reached as to
whether the equipment should be used by police, the fire brigade
or stewards.  Whoever is to use it should be trained to do so.
Whether to use it .should be a decision of a ncaina cec senior
police officer at the ground.

11. All crush barriers should be visually inspected immediately
for signs of corrosion.  Any barrier found to be affected by a
significant degree of corrosion should be repaired or replaced.
12. The layout of barriers in each pen or terraced area should
be reviewed immediately to ensure that it complies with the
criteria contained in Chapter 9 of the Green Guide.  If it does
not, the assessment of the maximum capacity figure for that pen
or terraced area, in accordance with Recommendation 2 above,
should reflect the fact.

Safety Certificates


13. There    should be an immediate review of each Safety
Certificate by the responsible local authority, which should
consult the club in respect of which the Certificate is issued,
the police, the fire service, the ambulance service and the
building authority.  Such a review should include an inspection
of the stadium.     Its object should be to ensure that the
operative conditions of the Certificate are complied with and to
add or substitute any condition shown to be necessary as a matter
of urgency    following the findings and recommendations          in this
report.


14. Any local authority within whose area there exists a sports
s tad itun designated under the 1975 Act for which no Safety
Certificate has yet been     issued   should     proceed   forthwith    to
remedy the situation.


15.   Every   Safety Certificate should be reviewed by the local
authority at least once annually         and   each Certificate     should
require to be renewed annually.


16. Each local authority 3hculd review its arrangements for
issuing, monitoring, enforcing, reviewing, amending and renewing
Safety   Certificates.   Such   review    should   require   that   there
exists or is provided an accountable administrative structure
whereby the functions of the local authority are regularly and
effectively supervised by senior officers and elected members and
decisions are properly taken in accordance with the local
authority’s rules.
17. To assist the local authority in exercising it3 functions,
it should set up an Advisory Group consisting of appropriate
members of its own staff, representatives of the police, of the
fire and ambulance services, of the building authority, of the
club and of a recognised supporters' club. The Advisory Group's
terms of reference should encompass all matters concerned with
crowd safety and should require regular visits to the ground and
attendance at matches. The Advisory Group should have a chairman
from the local authority, and an effective procedure.        its
resolutions should be recorded and it should be required to
produce regular written reports for consideration by the local
authority.


Duties of each Football Club


18. Each turnstile should be inspected and its potential rate of
flow measured. Thereafter, regular inspections should be made to
ensure   that  each turnstile remains capable of admitting
spectators at the rate anticipated.


19.   The correlation between each viewing area in the stadium and
the turnstiles serving it should be such as to ensure that all
the spectators intended to be admitted to that viewing area can
pass through the turnstiles within one hour.  If that cannot be
done, the capacity    of   that   viewing   area   should   be   reduced
accordingly.


20. Turnstiles should be closed when the permitted capacity of
the area served by them is about to be reached and arrangements
should be aade to ensure quick -and effective communication with
turnstile operators for this purpose.


21. Closed circuit television should be so installed as to
enable crowd densities outside the ground, within concourse areas
and in pens and other standing areas, to be monitored before and
throughout a match.
22. All signposting for spectators both outside and inside the
ground should be comprehensively r aviawed.       It should, in
relation to the arrangements for each match, be unambiguous, eye­
catching, simple and clear and should be designed to ensurs the
rapid movement of spectators to their appropriate viewing arsa.


23. Information cn tickets       should be unambiguous,          simple and
clear and should correlate        absolutely with the            information
provided in respect of each      match both outside and           inside the
ground.    Retained ticket       stubs should contain            information
necessary to guide spectators    once inside the ground.


24. Information on tickets requesting spectators to be in
position by a particular time should, be reviewed by clubs in
conjunction with the police to ensure that it corresponds with
the planned arrangements for admitting spectators to the ground.


25.   Each club should consult with a recognised supporters club
as  to the provision of pre-snatch entertainment                  aimed    at
attracting spectators to the ground in good time.

Police Planninc


26. The Chief Constable of each police force in whose area there
is one designated stadium or more should nominate a chief officer
to liaise with the management of each football club and local
authority   concerned   in   respect   of   the   safety   and   control   of
crowds.


27. The Operational Order for each match at a designated stadium
and the pre-match briefing of all officers on duty there should
alert   such officers   be bha importance of preventing any
overcrowding and, if any is detected, of taking appropriate steps
to remedy it.


28.   The Operational Order for each match at a designated stadium
should enable the police to cope with any foreseeable pattern in
the arrival of spectators ah a match and in their departure.  It
should provide for sufficient raser/es to enable rapid deployment
of officers to be made at any point inside or outside the ground.

29. The option to postpone kick-off should be in the discretion
of the officer in command at the ground. Crowd safety should be
the paramount consideration in deciding whether to exercise it.

30. There should be available in the police control rccm the
results o f all closed circuit television monitoring outside and
inside the ground and the record of any electronic or mechanical
counting o f numbers at turnstiles or of numbers admitted to any
area o f the ground.   Officers in the control rccm should be
skilled in the interpretation and use of these data.


Communications

31 . There should be sufficient operators in the police control
room to enable all radio transmissions to be received, evaluated
and  answered.    The   radio system should be such as to give
operators in the control room priority over, and the capacity to
override, others using the same channel.    Additional channels
should be used, where necessary, to prevent overcrowding of the
airwaves.  Consideration should be given to sound-proofing the
control room against excessive crowd noise.

32.   To   complement radio      communications,     there   should   be   a
completely separate system        of land lines with      telephone   links
between the control room and key points at the ground.


33. Within the ^control rccm, there should be a public addrass
system to communicate with individual araas outside and inside
the  ground, with grcups of araas or with the whola ground.
Important announcements should be pracsded by a loud signal to
catch the attention of the crowd despite a high level of noise in
the ground. This arrangement should be prominently advertised on
every programme sold for every match.

34.   Use should be made whera possible of illmainatad a d v e r t i s i n g
boards to address the crowd. Consideration should also be given
to the use by police officers of a simple code of hand signals to
indicate to the control room the existence of certain emergencies
or requirements.

Co-ordination of Emergency Services


35. The police, fire and ambulance services should maintain
through senior nominated officers regular liaison concarnina
crowd safety at each stadium.


36. Before each match at a designated stadium, the police should
ensure that the fire service and ambulance service are given full
details about the event, including its venue, its timing, the
number of spectators expected, their likely routes of entry
exit, and any anticipated or potential difficulties concerning
the control or movement of the crowd.     Such details should be
readily available in the control rooms of each of the emergency
services.


37. Contingency plans for the arrival at each designated stadium
of emergency vehicles from all three services should be reviewed.
They should include routes of access,              rendezvous   points,   and
accessibility within the ground itself.


38.   Police officers posted at the entrances to the ground should
be briefed as to the contingency plans for the arrival                    of
emergency services and should be informed when such services
called as to where and why they are required.


First Aid. Medical Tacilitias and !\iabolanc-ss


39. There should be at each stadium at each match at least one
trained first aider per 1,000 spectators.    The club should have
the responsibility for securing such attendance.


40.   There should be at each 3tadium one or more first aid rccms.
The   number   of   3uch   rccms   and   the   equipment   to be maintained
                                         8
within them should be specified by the local authority after
taking professional medical advice and should be made a
requirement of any Safety Certificate.

41. The club should employ a medical practitioner to be present
at each match and available to deal with any medical exigency at
the ground. He should be trained and competent in advanced first
aid.  He should be present at the ground at least an hour before
kick-off and should remain until half an hour after the end of
the match.    His whereabouts should be known to those in the
police control room and he should be immediately contactable.

42. At least one fully equipped ambulance from the appropriate
ambulance authority should be in attendance at all matches with
an expected crowd of 5,000 or more.


43.   The nlimber of ambulances to be in attendance for matches
where larger crowds are expected should be specified by the local
authority after consultation with the ambulance service and
should be made a requirement of the Safety Certificate.

FOOTBALL CLUBS - WRITTEN AGREEMENTS

Attached as requested are copies of the five agreements made with the
football clubs in South Yorkshire in accordance with the requirements
of the Taylor Interim Report recommendations.

I am happy that these are given to Counsel as discusned. I would
appreciate it please if you would have a look at them first. My
notion is that we have simply cleared up or minimised areas of
possible misunderstanding or ambiguity between ourselves and the clubs
in relation to specific duties which have to be undertaken to ensure a
proper level of public safety.   I do not see this as contractual
through, a lack of consideration whereas some forces have framed their
agreements in a manner where it seems this can be assumed.

I would appreciate your opinion on the contractual aspect of our
agreements and whether you can see any problems for ourselves in what
has been achieved so far.

        Dear Si r,


                                           CCTV AND PUBLIC SAFETY

              I w rite in my capacity as Secretary of the ACPO G.P. Sub-Committee on
        Hooliganism at Sporting Events.     As you w ill be aware, th e Sub-Committee
        produced a document t h i s year on CCTV and S t i l l Photography. The report
        was approved by the General Purposes Committee and ACPO Council, i t was
        subsequently forwarded t o a ll Forces, England and Wales, in July t h i s y ear.


                    At a meeting o f the Sub-Committee in May t h i s y e a r , i t had been
        resolved t o convene a small Working Group t o further consider the use of
        CCTV placing p a r tic u la r emphasis on i t s use fo r the promotion of public
        safety.           It was, c o r r e c t l y , an ticip a te d th at t h i s would be an area of
        concern fo r Lord J u s t ic e Taylor during his enquiry in t o the Hillsborough
        d i s a s t e r . Indeed   recommendation 21 of h is Interim Report                  req u ires...
        "Closed c i r c u i t t e l e v i s i o n should be so i n s t a l l e d as to enable crowd
        d e n s i t i e s outside the ground, within concourse areas and pens and other
        standing area s, t o be monitored before                      and    throughout amatch".


              Accordingly, the inaugural meeting of the Working Group took place at
        Greater Manchester P o lic e Headquarters on Wednesday 20 September 1989 when
        I was appointed Chairman. At th at meeting I was able to apprise th e Group,
        in my capacity as ACPO Trustee to th e Football Trust, th at th at Trust had
        intimated provision may be made towards th e c o st of implementing a CCTV
        system to meet th e requirements of Recommendation 21.




                                            /c o n t i nued
            The Group acknowledged the need for a speedy implementation of that
Recommendation.         However i t remained a c u te ly aware th at the wide-ranging
systems deployed, post 1985, had been chosen without commqn g u i d e l i n e s .
Experience has sin ce revealed th at some CCTV systems lacked e f f i c a c y as a
r e s u l t . The Group a n t ic i p a t e i t w ill be p o s s i b le t o provide an a n a ly s is of
the problem of public s a f e t y and w ill endeavour to design a "package" t o
use as a t e s t fo r a common minimum standard of performance.                          This w ill
apply for any system which the myriad companies professing to supply CCTV
systems may o f f e r . To th at end, the Group, a s s i s t e d by Technical advisors
from the Home O ffice S c i e n t i f i c Research and Development Branch, w ill v i s i t
a sm all, r ep resen tative number of s ta d ia to compare e x i s t i n g systems.

      I t i s not p o s s ib le at t h i s s t a g e , t o fo r e ca s t a date for the
conclusion of our recommendation's however the matter i s being tr e a te d as
urgent.

     Dear Colleague,

                  INTERIM RECOMMENDATION OF LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR

     I write in my capacity as Chairman of the ACPO General
     Purposes Sub-Committee on Hooliganism at Sporting Events.

^    As you will recall in my correspondence of 22nd September,
     1989, I drew attention to the Sub-Committee’s deliberation
     over the Interim Recommendations and, in particular, the
     reported widespread difficulty on the form and content of the
     written agreements required under recommendation 4.

     Since that time I have had discussion with John Goddard at the
     Home Office drawing     his attention to the difficulties
     experienced and seeking clarification.      In response, Mr.
     Goddard has sought legal opinion before proffering the advice
     of the Home Office in the enclosed letter.

     Mr. Goddard's letter    is circulated for your  information.
     There remain a number of key areas in Lord Justice Taylor's
     Report to be resolved, which will be pursued at the meeting
     which has been arranged for 18th October, 1989.

                                   Yours sincerely,

         police entering into written agreements with football clubs
         under recommendation 4 of Lord Justice Taylor's interim
         report.

         I have circulated it to all Chief Constables in England and
         Wales, the Commissioners of the Metropolis and City of London
         Forces, and Sir William Sutherland ACPO (Scotland).

         With your agreement, and in the context of your letter of the

         Dear Sir/Madam

         VEHICLE PARKING - FOOTBALL MATCH DAYS

         I am writing to inform you of the South Yorkshire Police's strategy
         regarding the control of parking of motor vehicles or. i'he occasion of
         Barnsley Football Club playing at home.

         It is our intention to seal off by way of barriers the streets adjacent
         to Barnsley Football Club.  The only vehicles which will be allowed to
         enter this sealed off area will be those of residents and emergency services
         vehicles.

         The sealed off area will be the following streets:

         Bala Street, Belgrave Road, Windermere Road, Sherwood Street, Clyde Street,
         Avon Street, Grasmere Road, Thirlmere Road, Coniston Road and where
         appropriate, Grove Street.

          I am sure that you will appreciate the reasons for this course of action
          and no doubt will welcome the move.  However, so as to facilitate the free
          access for the emergency services vehicles, it would be greatly appreciated
          if you would assist us by all vehicles being parked on one side of the
          street.  There will be times, however, when we will need to reinforce this
          "one side of the road" parking by placing 'no waiting' cones at appropriate
          locations.

          Should you have any queries regarding the contents of this letter please
          do not hesitate to contact Barnsley Police Station.

          Yours faithfully




          Chief Superintendent

   tear Mr, Walker,

   I am in receipt of your letter dated 26th September 1985 enclosing copies of the
   contract for Special Police Services for the current season.

   Before signing it however I would seek clarification on point 3 in that at the
   meeting held with the Deputy Chief constable on 24th August last it was agreed
   that further consultation with the Clubs would be held prior to any other
   alteration to the Police Charges Agreement/ ie. a revised agreement would not be
   imposed upon clubs,

   1 should be most grateful therefore if confirmation of this consultation could
   be given to us and upon receipt of same I will forward signed copies of the
   Contract,

   Yours sincerely,

            Dear Mr, M a c k r e l 1,

           CONTRACT FOR SPECIAL POLICE SERVICES 1989/90
            I thank you for your letter of the 3rd October 1989,

           1 can confirm that consultations will take place with the Clubs in respect
           of any proposals to change the charging arrangements for Special Police Services
           at football matches. It is hoped that if the review referred to 1n my letter
           dated 26th September last and the Agreements enclosed t h e r e i n s does result in
           a proposal to change the method of charging Football Clubs for the provision
           of Special Police Services, that negotiations with the Clubs will be successful
           in securing their agreement to the proposed change, As stated previously any
           change recommended to the charging arrangements may lead to an increase In the
           charges made for Special Police Services at football matches. In the event of
           any such negotiations being unsuccessful with the Clubs or any one Club, then .
           a power has been reserved to the Authority and the Chief Constable in the
           i n t e r i m agreements proposed for the current season, to terminate the same,
           see Clause 5 (lii) of the Agreement sent to you,

           The^charges^specified in the Agreement sent to you for the provision of Special
           Police Services at football matches is based on those which applied during the
           1988/89 football season, plus an addition to take into account the last police
           pay award on 1st September 1989,

          1 hope this clarifies the position for you and that you will now feel content
          to sign the Agreements which have been forwarded to you, Should you still have
          any anxiety concerning the same please do not hesitate to contact my assistant
          Miss Oades for further clarification.
          Yours sincerely*

        Following the publication of the Taylor Report into the Hillsborough

Disaster, South Yorkshire Police has re-examined the provision of police

services for football matches in the County, and the cost of providing

them.    Until now, charges have been made on a sliding scale, only in respect

of police officers deployed to the ground itself, and, even then, at a

rate which is far less than the cost to the Police Authority of providing

the services.     One of the consequences of the Taylor Report is that more

police officers will have to be used when football matches take place.



        The principktL-of charging for the attendance of police officers

inside football grounds has been approved by the Court of Appeal in the

case of Harris -v- Sheffield United Football Club, 1987 3 WLR 305.                      How­

ever, that case was not concerned with the amount of the charge, nor-

did it directly concern the provision of police officers outside the

ground, whose attendance was necessary because of the match, since no

charge was made at that time for such officers.       I do not think that the

decision in the Sheffield United case can be taken as any authority for

the proposition that special police services are confined to those provided

inside the football ground.     Although the judgment of Boreham J., at first

instance, was upheld, the decision of the Court of Appeal could not con­

stitute approval of everything which he said.     At page 38 of the transcript,

Boreham J said:

"It is accepted that at some fixtures violence was almost certain if the

police were not presentin substantial numbers     -    that was well known

to the club and to the police.     It created problems in two areas:                   first,

outside the ground, in the public domain, where the police gave protection

as part of their public duty.     That alone must have put a severe strain

on normal policing.    The second area was inside the ground, which was a
private domain."

These remarks were clearly not part of the decision in the case, since

there never had been any claim for the cost of providing police services

outside the ground, to deal with problems created by the football match

itself.    In the Court of Appeal, Neill LJ, at page 315H enumerated a

number of matters which he considered were relevant to the question

whether the services provided were special police services.     The first

of these was whether police officers were required to attend on private

premises or in a public place.     A number of other factors were mentioned,

and it is quite clear that none of these factors was regarded as being

conclusive.   Again, one of the factors which he took into account in

that case was that the charges related solely to officers on duty inside

the ground and not to those in the street or other public places outside,

see page 316H.



      In the Sheffield United case, considerable reliance was placed upon

the judgments in the Court of Appeal and in the House of Lords in the case

Glasbrook Brothers -v- Glamorgan County Council, 1924 1 KB 879 and 1925

AC 270, respectively.   It is worth observing that in that case, the Court

did not draw a fine distinction between the attendance of police officers

on private premises or in a public place.    For example, in the Court of

Appeal, Scrutton LJ gave instances of special police services which may

be furnished for payment, at page 890, and included, "where assemblies are

likely to produce disorder, as at races, or football meetings, or to regulate

traffic to private festivities, such as dances."     The last example clearly

envisages the use of police officers on the public highway, to regulate

traffic.   Similarly, in the House of Lords, Viscount Cave gave examples

at page 278, in the following terms:

"Instances are the lending of constables on the occasions of large gatherings

in and outside private premises,    as on the occasions of weddings, athletic
or boxing contests or race meetings,"

It follows that the Glasbrrok case does not constitute an authority for

restricting the provision of special police services, for which a charge

may be made, to the cost of providing policemen inside private premises.

The indications to this effect in the Sheffield United case^ which were

not necessary for the decision, cannot be taken as having superseded the

decision in Glasbrook.



        The question whether a police authority may charge for special police

services is now to be determined by reference to section 15 of the Police

Act 1964, which must be taken to have superseded the previous common law.

That section provides:

"The chief officer of police of any police force may provide, at the request

of any person, special police services     at any premises or in anylocality

in the police area for which the force     is maintained, subject    tothe payment

to the police authority of charges on such scales as may be determined

by that authority."

It is clear from the words underlined that the police authority may not

charge for the deployment of extra police officers occasioned by an event,

in the district generally.    They must be provided at premises or in a

locality.   The word "at", in my view, shows that the police services may

be provided both inside and immediately outside the football ground, since

it is , in its ordinary meaning, not synonymous with the word "in".       The

word "locality" is somewhat diffic ult     to define clearly, but    itplainly

is intended to mean a limited area.     That   area may well be in   the public

domain, to use Boreham J's expression.     If it were intended that special

police services could only be provided on private premises, the words "or

in any locality" would add nothing to the words "at any premises".     There

is a further limitation on the provision of special police services, namely

that they should be provided at the request of a person, such as the football

club.   While one may, for example, construe the provision# of police officers
immediately outside the ground as being consequent upon the request of

the club, as that expression was interpreted in the Sheffield United case,

it is more difficult to do this in respect of the provision of officers

some distance away from the ground.



            The Deputy Chief Constable has raised a number of questions in his

letter of 25th September 1989.           In the light of the observations above,

I would put forward the following as my opinion of the extent to which

the Police Authority may charge for the provision of police officers on

the occasion of football matches.



            It is established beyond doubt that the provision of officers inside

the ground comes within the term "special police services" for which charges

may be made.           In addition, officers immediately outside the ground, monitoring

queues at turnstiles for example, can reasonably be said to be "at the

premises", since they may be partly on private property, as in Leppings

Lane,       and at times on the public highway, as in Penistone Road.      It would

be unreasonable to determine the question whether charges could be made
        r      --- —
for the attendance of officers merely by reference to the accident whether

the turnstiles front directly on to the highway or are separated from it

by a forecourt.          Furthermore, the function they are carrying out is partly

to enforce the general law and partly to ensure that the rules of the club

are met.       It is also a duty which is intended to ensure the safety of those

waiting to get it.          These police offiers are both at the premises, in the

ordinary meaning of those words^, and are in the locality.         Furthermore,

those offiers who are deployed to direct traffic and marshal the arriving

fans on the public road in the immediate vicinity of the football ground

could probably come within the same definition.          However, there must come

a point at which the officers can be said neither to be at the premises

nor in the locality pursuant to the request of the club.           Those who are
 in the streets surrounding the ground to prevent and deal with breaches

of the peace would probably be considered to be carrying out the public

police duty rather than special police services.    I realize that an officer

whose job it is to marshal the arriving crowds of supporters may from time

to time be called upon to prevent a breach of the peace.    However, the

same is true of officers at the turnstiles or in the ground itself.     If,

however, the officer is deployed not as a marshal but to patrol the nearby

streets to prevent disorder, even though his presence would not be necessary

if it were not for the football match, he is likely to be held to be carrying

out his public duty.




      The deployment of officers to bus and rail termini creates a problem.

In some cases, the bus or rail station can be said to be in the locality

of the football ground, so that officers who are deployed to escort supp­

orters could come within the definition.    In the case of the two Sheffield

football   grounds, it is stretching the meaning of the expression "locality"

somewhat   to refer to the main station and railway station in Sheaf Street.

However,   it would be reasonable to regard Wadsley Bridge station as being

in the locality of Hillsborough, and the escorting officers to be employed

on special police services.   Furthermore, it is doubtful whether either

football club could be taken as having requested escort from the main

railway or bus stations, since they are not concerned with the means by

which supporters travel to the match.




      I do not have any doubt that the deployment of additional officers

to town centres to deal with the threat of disorder from football support­

ers , either before or after a match is a public duty and cannot come within

the terms of section 1 5 .
      To summarize the position, therefore, I take thp vi pjj- that-, the deploy­

ment of police officers inside the ground and immediately outside it at

the turnstiles or supervising the queues, even if they extend on to the

public highway, would constitute^speclal police-sermLaes.     Those who are

marshalling the arriving crowds on the approach roads to the stadium could

also be regarded as being there on the same basis.     Those who are merely

patrolling   to prevent breaches of the peace albeit in the same area as

those marshalling the crowds, would probably not be regarded as provided

pursuant to section 15.   The use of police officers as escorts from railway

and bus stations could be argued to be a special police service if the

terminus in question was sufficiently close to the ground to be able to

be said to be in the same locality,   "pie use of police officers in town

centres to prevent hooliganism could not possibly constitute special

services.




      The question is raised whether the Police Authority could charge
                                                                   " p
for the overtime payments made to officers on ordinary duty, who are having

to do this because those who would have done that ordinary duty are on

football duty.   Described as such, these charges would not be recoverable.

It must be observed that the judgments in the Sheffield United case clearly

contemplated the payment of overtime as being a factor which was relevant,

but the references to overtime were concerned with officers who were carrying

out special police services.   Provision may, however, in my view, be made

for these hidden costs in a different way.    Section 15 contemplates

payment of charges pursuant to a scale determined by the Police Authority.

This seems to suggest that there should be a published scale of charges
                                            — — — — -- ---------- -r
applicable to all occasions upon which special police services are requested.

I do not think it would be in accordance with the provisions of section

15 to calculate the charges on a match by match basis, except by reference
to the scale.      Accordingly, the same scale should apply to any occasion,

whether a football match, a    pop concert or any other event at which

special police     services are provided.   The scale itself and the amount

charged at any     one point in thescale are matters which are to be determined

by the Police Authority.     The Police Authority's decision could be questioned

in judicial review proceedings, only if the scale or the charges were so

unreasonable as to be such that no reasonable police authority could have

made them.     This is the so called "Wednesbury" principle, which applies

generally in public law.     I take the view that it would not be unreasonable

to calculate this scale of charges by reference to the costs to the Police

Authority of providing special services, not only in terms of the wages

paid to the men attending, but also in respect of the cost of keeping

vehicles, horses and other equipment in use at the time.       There is certainly

no reason why the scale of charges should be confined to the cost of the

police officers' wages, or the number of hours for which he is engaged

on this work.    If the scale of charges is set up on the basis of so much

per officer attending, it would, in my view, be reasonable to arrive at

that figure by dividing the police budget for the year by the number of

officers in the force, or some more sophisticated calculation^ along these

lines^ which makes allowance for the use of police resources which enable

the officers to carry out their work.       So long as the scale of charges

can be justified as a reasonable calculation of the cost of providing the

service, it would not be open to question in judicial review proceedings.

The factor referred to by the Deputy Chief Constable on the last page of

his letter should not therefore be isolated and identified, but should

be regarded as part of the cost of using police resources.



         I should add that, with all due respect to the author, I regret that

I did not find the opinion obtained by West Yorkshire Police of any particular

value.    Rather surprisingly, no reference was made to the terms of section
15 of the Police Act, nor to the judgment of the Court of Appeal in the

Sheffield United case, which had been widely reported when the opinion

was given.   In essence, I take the view that the questions posed by the

Deputy Chief Constable in his letter, which are concerned with establishing

where the line is to be drawn between special police services and the ordinary

public duty of police must be answered by reference to the terms of section

15 of the Police Act itself.   The consequences of having a large number

of people milling around, away from the ground, although their presence

is the result of the staging of the match, would not come within this provision.

Since the geography around each ground is different, it is not possible

to be more specific in answering the question how far the locality extends.

            SUBJECT: .   STANDING INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE POLICING OF FOOTBALL MATCHES




             I am much encouraged and heartened by the depth of analysis and clear
             thinking in the discussion paper prepared by Superintendent Greenwood
             and agree entirely with the intentions expressed therein.

            Please have a copy filed amongst our working papers and then return
            original to Mr Greenwood.




            Deputy Chief Constable




Gen/2
   DISCUSSION PAPER




                STANDING INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE POLICING OF FOOTBALL MATCHES

   The standing instructions were published in 1985 and last amended 1986 following

   the publication of the Popplewell Report and the revised 'Guide to Safety at

   Sports Grounds.'




   The present instructions are out-dated in many respects, some of the obvious

   examples being the omission of changes brought about by the Public Order Act

   1986, The Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol) Act 1985 and the development of

^ ^ C C T V and command and control facilities.   The interim report of the Hillsborough

   Enquiry suggests that many sections of the instructions require major alterations

   and it is anticipated that other amendments will be required on publication of

   the final report.




   The Implementation Team has recognised this problem and many aspects of the

   standing instructions are at present the subject of reports, working groups and

   on-going dicussions.     It is expected that all policy decisions of the

   Implementation Team will eventually form part of the instructions or act as a

   guide for the final document.




   The scope of the standing instructions is such that its publication must be one

   of the final acts of the Implementation Team if it is to be a definitive guide

   for Senior Officers in the policing of football matches in South Yorkshire

   throughout the 1990's.
PROPOSED FORMAT

The standing instructions are not intended as hard and fast rules to govern every

contingency, but are a standardisation of policing practices within the South

Yorkshire area for football matches.          It is accepted that there will be some

variations at each ground to cater for their different conditions.




It is proposed that the Standing Instructions will remain in a similar format

tp that in use at present.          The main body will consist of basic information and

guidelines on topics common to all matches and grounds.          Additional detailed

information will be made available as appendices to the main report.          This

approach would have the two-fold advantage of:-

(i)     ease of reference

(ii) ease of amendment when necessary.




Each sub-heading within the current Standing Instructions has been retained,

but it is suggested that some additional subjects are introduced.         These are

marked accordingly in the attached list which shows the present position for

each subject.       As force policy on relevant matters evolves, further subjects

can be introduced into the present framework or under a separate heading if

required.




Submitted for information.      '

                        STANDING INSTRUCTIONS    -   SUB-HEADINGS

OBJECT

To be retained with little amendment.




COMMAND STRUCTURE

To be retained.




OPERATIONAL ORDER                                                     ^

The format of the Operational     Order is in the discussion stage.       The present

instruction will remain.   The   revised order will be an appendix when finalised.




BRIEFING ARRANGEMENTS

This instruction will be retained in a briefer form with the appendices          amended

in accordance with current legislation and force       policy, eg Appendix C, item

b(i) will require expansion to cover searches and possession of alcohol.




MANPOWER REQUIREMENTS

This instruction would be retained.

Appendix E may well require a complete revision in due course.

It is also suggested that the     criteria for the staffing arrangements     for football

matches and other Public Order events as detailed in Force General Orders 22/1987

item 2 be included as an appendix.




METHODS OF DEPLOYING PERSONNEL

Uniformed Officers

This would be retained with slight amendments to       include the provision of an

extra reserve following the Hillsborough Report.

The appendix would be retained.
Detective and Plain Clothes Personnel

To be retained with little amendment.




ADDITIONAL RESOURCES

Transport and Mobile Reserves

The bulk of this item will be retained with little change, although a report

on the use of motorcycles is being prepared which may have some effect in due

course.                        ~




Police Horses

A report on the use of police horses is in the course of preparation.




Police Dogs

A report on the use of police dogs is in the course of preparation.




Specialist Equipment

This section will require a complete revision in the light of modern technology

and the Hillsborough Report.       The advent of CCTV at all grounds and the

introduction of turnstile monitoring are seen as being necessary inclusions under

this heading.

A report is also being prepared on the use of spotter planes at football matches.




SPECIAL CONSTABLES

To be retained.




FORCE PRESS OFFICER - MEDIA

To be retained.
REFRESHMENTS

To be amended in line with force policy.




THE MOVEMENT OF SPECTATORS

To be retained.    However, the appendix will require major amendment to include

new legislation (Public Order Act 1986 and The Sporting Events (Control of

Alcohol) Act 1985) in addition to changes in the Taylor Interim Report.      It will

also require a further reassessment following publication of the final

recommendations.




TRAFFIC FLOW

To be retained with little amendment.




COMMUNICATIONS/MATCH CONTROLS

This amended title will replace the previous 'MATCH AND DIVISIONAL CONTROLS -

FOR OPERATIONS ROOM.'

It will require extensive rewriting and is expected to incorporate the major

changes in communications systems (command channels etc), the recommendations

of the Taylor Interim Report (landliries, hand signals) and the facilities

available through the Force Major Incident Room on match days.    It will require

Duties of Stewards
                              3>
In           p a r a g r a p h .of the appendix, duties of s t e w a r d s are
d i v i d e d into four m a i n c a t e g ories.   I w o u l d add a fifth,                  ie:

Monitoring crowd conditions                 for p o s s i b l e o v e r c r o w d i n g or
distress.

The r e m a i n d e r of a p p e n d i x 'L' is adequate.                It m u s t be b o r n e in
m i n d that the m a j o r i t y of s t e w a r d s are not of the sam e c a l i b r e

Perhaps this could be d i s c u s s e d           at the next m e e t i n g of the

    Aerial photographs may be advantageous in giving clearer definition
    of the physical characteristics of the ground and surrounding area.

2   Plan of the Surrounding Area

    This should include agreed access routes and rendezvous points as
    at (12) and (13) together with other information, useful to officers
    performing duty, such as locations for potential disorder, ie public
    houses, railway stations, coach parks.

3   Briefing Police

    This should include how and where officers are briefed and by whom.

    In addition to the normal pre-match briefing, officers must be informed
    of evacuation procedures which will include coded messages.

    The coded message at all league grounds in the county which will indicate
    to police officers and stewards that1there may be an emergency affecting
    the ground will be -

    'The attendance of Mr Meadows is urgently required at police control*.
    When the emergency lias been resolved the message will be -
    'Mr Meadows is no longer required at police control1.

    Officers performing duty in different areas of the ground must be made
    aware of the exit routes, emergency telephones and fire points in that
    area.

    Consideration should be given to providing officers with returnable,
    individual, briefing cards, containing essential facts in relation to
    policing the ground generally and specific roles.

    Consideration should be given to issuing to police officers who are
    unfamiliar with the ground find surrounding areas a map of same to
    enable them to be fully conversant with the layout of the ground.

4   Briefing of Stewards

    Stewards should be briefed by a senior police officer prior to the
    commencement of the league season to ensure they are aware of their
    duties and responsibilities in the event of evacuation or emergency.
    (These instructions contained in Appendix 'L' have been issued to club
    secretaries on 6 8 86 for their information and attention of all stewards.

    Clubs should appoint a chief steward and a senior police officer
    should liaise with the chief steward prior to every match, identifying
    any deficiencies, problems etc, in stewarding at the ground.

5   Dedicated Officers at Dedicated Posts

    Consideration should be given to deploying dedicated officers at key
    points on a regular basis. The key points, together with the officers'
    responsibilities in an emergenciy, should be included under this heading.

6   Details of Deployment, Duties and Instructions to Stewards

    These details should be drawn up by the club in consultation with the
    Police and Fire Brigade, with particular reference to stewards'
    responsibilities in assisting police in evacuation situations.

1      GUIDANCE

1.1    Guidance       for          the    preparation      of    all     Operational         Orders      has

       been     issued         by    the     Association of Chief              Police      Officers and

       is set down in the Public Order Guide to Tactical Options and

       Related Matters at Section A (6) (See Appendix 1).




1.2    The    I.I.M.A.C.             System       is recommended as           the    basic     franework.

       The    Operational                Orders    currently      in    use    for     the    5    football

       grounds       within          South     Yorkshire        comply    to    that    basic system.

       The     South           Yorkshire          Police   Standing        Instructions            for   the

       Policing           of       Football        Matches      sets     out        guidance       for   the

       production             of    Operational Orders at Paragraph                    3 and Appendix

       *A'. (See Appendix 2).




1.3    The    A.C.P.O.             Sub-Committee      on     hooliganism        at    sporting events

       - Guide to Policing Football - Contains information whick needs

       to be        included         in operational orders,              but does not deal with

       the    actual preparation of such orders                           in respect of football

       matches.




2      SOUTH YORKSHIRE FOOTBALL OPERATIONAL ORDERS

2.1    Whilst       our       orders       follow    the   basic       guidance      set     down,   those

        in    use    at       Hillsborough,          Bramall     Lane    and    Barnsley          have over
the    years       been       developed         and   modified       in    the     light    of

experience to suit local conditions.



The    orders      in use at Rotherham and Doncaster follow closely

the guidance         set down in the Force Standing Instructions for

the policing of football matches. (Appendix 2)



It    is    true    to say      that      the    orders    have     to contain       varying

information         to suit      local      requirements,          but onething that

is    apparent,          is   that   we    are    inconsistent       when        it cones   to

specific information being set out in the orders.                                For example,

at    'D'    Division all information is contained within tie body

of    the    order whilst at              'B' and     'F' Divisions,        appendices to

the    order       are    utilised,        however,       *B'   Division number these

1 to 5 whilst             'F' Division letter them A to C with %pendix

'A' having Sub-sections (1) to (6).                         This is just one example

that        illustrates        the     difficulty         supervisory        officers,      in

particular,         experience         when      performing       duty at         the various

grounds within the County.



*A' and       'C' Divisions, as mentioned previously closely follow

the guidance         set out in the Force Standing Instructions with

their orders being produced on size A4 paper.                                    'B', "B' and

*F 1 Divisions produce their orders on size A5 paper, with 'B'

and 'D' Divisions having a "Standing Instruction" type booklet

supplemented             by    separate         sheets     dealing        with     match    day

information, intelligence and serial duties.
Whilst all 5 Grounds utilise the 3 Phase System for the Ftalice

Operation the actual timing of these phases varies.                    ,C   and

*B* Divisions follow the recommendation in the Force Standing

Instructions:



Phase I           Before      kick-off       -     which        will   include

                  arrangements       for    public    order       patrol,   the

                  escorting    and    segretation         of supporters and

                  the control of traffic.



Phase II          During the match from kick-off to 10 minutes

                  before the end of the game.



Phase III        From 10 minutes           before the end of the game

                 before    walking     spectators         and    traffic have

                 dispersed.



The Phases at 'A' Division are as follows:-



Phase I           From     briefing        until     10     minutes     before

                  kick-off.



Phase II          From 10 minutes before kick-off to 10 minutes

                  before the end of the game.



Phase III        From     10 minutes       before the      end of the game

                  until    walking     spectators         and    traffic    have

                  dispersed.
Tfee arrangements at 'D' and 'F' Divisions are as follows:-



Pfaase I                Before    the   kick-off    until      10 minutes after

                        kick-off.



Haase II                From     10   minutes     into   the    match     until   10

                        minutes before the end of the game.



Pfoase III           From 10 minutes before the end of the match

                     until the crowd and traffic have cleared and

                     match control stands down.



TBsese     variations     are     obviously       necessary       to   meet   local

amnditions but are used simply to highlight our inconsistency.



OPERATIONAL ORDERS - OTHER FORCES

In   order to establish the best              possible practice         and gather

as   many    ideas   as possible        Operational      orders    in respect of

football were requested from all other forces in the Cosmtry.

Many     have   supplied the orders and a paper has been prepared

asa this subject by Chief Inspector Hellewell. (Appendix 3).



FORMAT OF THE PROPOSED MODEL ORDER

Tfaat information which remains consistent should be contained

in   the form of a "Standing Instruction" type booklet, otl size

A5   paper.      These should be prepared by Divisions but printed

atr Headquarters        Supplies      utilising    both sides of the paper,

halving     a hard back        and water-proof      covering.          This booklet
s&ould     closely     follow       the    I.I.M.A.C.         System      starting     at

’Intention'     which     should     be    numbered      2    and    concluding      with

’Communications'       which      should be numbered 5.                  Appendices    to

fclaat Instruction       should     cover the      following subjects and be

mnnbered 1,2,3 etc.



Emergency Evacuation Procedure

Crowd Safety/Club Responsibilities

disposition of Fire-fighting Equipment within the Ground

Employment of Club Stewards

Location/use of Emergency Telephones

Legislation

Ground Regulations

Contingency Plans

Hap and Plan



Tlhese    standing     instruction        booklets      should      be   consecutively

EEumbered    and     issued    to   Senior and          Supervisory       Officers     on

either a permanent         or match day issue basis as appropriate.

Copies should be supplied to the Club, Chairman of the Officer

Working      Party,     Emergency         Services      and     other      parties     as

appropriate.



MATCH DAY ORDER

A separate simplified match day order on size A5 paper should

be prepared and produced at Division dealing with INFORMATION

ran the I.I.M.A.C.        System which should be numbered 1.                   Command

and      Sectorisation    details         should   be    included        together     with
«n overall manpower sheet.                    This part of the order should be

«sn white paper.



SERIAL DUTIES

TWo   options        are    open       to   us   -     either    detailed     on     a    sheet

appended to the Match Day Order as proposed at 4.2 above or

Ijy   the     utilisation             of    cards      issued    at    briefing.           The

disadvantage of the second system is that supervisory officers

ere unable to read duties in advance.



SECTOR DUTIES

IKFfic©!^     commanding          a    sector    should    be    issued with written

^instructions as to their duties and specific problems affecting

tttieir sector.       The format should follow that of serial duties.



INTELLIGENCE SHEET

THfais should be produced on A5 coloured paper on the day prior

to    the    event         and    contain        all    relevant      and     up    to    date

intelligence.          Details         of    transport,     with      train    times etc.

should be      included,          together with relevant exclusion orders.

Issued      immediately prior to the main briefing to all Senior

and Supervisory Officers with additional copies being available

for other personnel as considered appropriate.



SERIAL SHEETS



Tiiese      should     be        self-carbonating          and     printed         centrally.

Information       currently           contained on our           serial     sheets       should
be supplemented by details of those officers who are:

Casualty Bureau Trained, PSU Trained etc.



Immediately        following      the   briefing       the   top    copy   should   be

handed     to   Ground    Control.          The second copy which should be

coloured,       retained by the Supervisory Officer being submitted

at   the   conclusion       of   the operation and           include   all relevant

de-briefing        information.         Serial sheets        should also be used

by   the   specialist       sections,       Mounted,     Dogs,     Motorcycle Wing,

Control Room,        Logistics Personnel etc so that a total record

is   available      at   the     Control     Room of all       personnel     actually

on duty.



FORCE POLICY

Whilst it is feasible to set down a format for the model order

at this stage, before the actual information contained in that

order can be detailed Force Policy needs to be determined with

regard to the following areas:-

                                        7          '

1           Overall Strategy

2           Command

3           Sectorisation

4           Deployment of Resources

5           Briefing and Debriefing.



Ideally    an overall simple plan encompassing the above should

be   set   down,    being      scaled up in accordance             with anticipated

crowd attendance and the potential for disorder.                           Whilst the
plans need      to vary     to take account of local conditions, the

overall strategy and principle should remain constant.



PROVISION OF INFORMATION TO EMERGENCY SERVICES

Hie   South     Yorkshire      Fire    Service   and     the    South     Yorkshire

Metropolitan      Ambulance      Service      shonld     be    provided    with    a

sufficient      number    of   Standing      Instruction       Booklets    relating

to each ground within the County and then in respect of each

fixture,    supplied      with   an    information     sheet     as   set oat     at

Appendix 4.       On every occasion this should be accompanied by

a   copy   of   the   Appendix    to   the    standing    instruction       Sealing

with the Emergency Evacuation Procedure.

    1.    INTRODUCTION
          The IIMAC System is a basic framework for the
          compilation of Police Operational Orders. It is sufficiently
          flexible to be used as a planning aid for:—
\
          (a) previously notified events;
          (b)   contingency plans;
          (c)   briefing.

          The framework enables the Operational Order to be
          used for many types of event e.g. demonstrations, football
          matches, public meetings, etc. It can be scaled up to
          cope with an escalating situation without the need to
          alter the initial structure.

    3.    CONSIDERATIONS
    3.1   Aim of an Order
          After identifying the number of men and material
          required its main purpose is to co-ordinate the main
          thrust of effort towards achieving aims and objectives.
          Its purpose is to:—
          fa) identify the problem;
          (b)   impart instructions and directions;
          (c)   co-ordinate resources so that the aims and
                objectives are achieved.
          The framework of the Operational Order is based on the
          words—

          This should cover the time, day, date, place and nature
          of the event in brief, concise terms.
    3.3   lntention-*What do we intend to do about it'
          The aims and objectives should be clearly defined.
          Officers should know why the operation is being mounted
          and what is required of them.
                                   A 6 '1
Method-'How do we intend to deal with the situation'
It may be desirable to start by identifying the
organisational structure with a summary of police
manpower. This will allow all officers to take in at a
glance the general organisation and see where they fit
in-simplicity should be the keynote.
(a) Sectors T h e division of the ground into areas to
                 make supervision easier, usually using
                 a colour code.
 (b) Phases     The term used to describe a stage of
                 events. For example. Phase 1-pre march
                 and assembly, Phase 2-the march.
                 Phase 3-the dispersal.
 (c) Duties     It is sometimes necessary to identify the
                 shifts to be worked and then to outline
                 the Sector Commander's duties, the full
                 details of which can be outlined in an
                 appendix. The duties of support services
                  like the Mounted Branch, Transport
                  Section, Motor Cyclists and CID should
                  also be specified in an appendix.
(d)     Prisoners Detailed instructions of the system to be
                  used and form of documentation should
                  also be given in an appendix.
 Administration
 (a)    Transport It is advantageous to identify the
                  transport by means of the PSU
                  identification number.
 (b)    Refresh­ Personnel should be aware of where
        ments     and when they can obtain refreshments.
 (c)    Dress    Details of dress should be shown to
                 ensure uniformity of appearance. In the
                 case of special protective clothing etc.,
                 it should be issued at the holding
                 centre(s) or in the field dependent upon
                 circumstances.
 (d)    Traffic  Detailed traffic arrangements should be
        Arrange­ included specifying road closures,
        ments    diversions and the police arrange­
                 ments necessary to implement such
                 procedures.
  (e)   Com­     The name and location of the officers
        plaints   appointed to deal with complaints
        Officer   should be included.
                                  ■


    (f)   Maps      it is useful to issue small detailed maps
          and       of various localities to assist officers
          Plans     from different Divisions who are
                     unfamiliar with the area.
   (g) Recording Details of accepted policy on what duties
         of Duties will be worked in regard to:—length of
                     tour of duty, overtime, rest day working,
                     should be agreed upon. An officer should
                     be designated for the compilation of
                     such information.
.6 Communications
   The level of personal radios will accord with the type of
   occasion and its nature. Details of the officers who will
   be equipped with VHF (or UHF) personal radios should
   be shown in appendices. The detail should include
   sector/unit numbers, call signs, radio channel(s) to be
   used. Similarly with radio equipped vehicles or fixed
   locations the details should include duty/location, call
   signs and channel(s). A separate appendix should list
   the telephone numbers of Incident Controls, Reporting
   Stations etc., relevant to the operation.
   In the castfof complex written instructions, this sequence
   may be supplemented by an INDEX and APPENDICES.
OPERATIONAL ORDER                                           APPENDIX 2


3.1       It is necessary to use a standard format for operational orders
          for football matches within the force area with additions to
          cater for -local conditions.  The format shown at Appendix 'A*
          will be adopted.


BRIEFING ARRANGEMENTS

4.1       The Officer in Command will, as far as is practicable, undertake
           his briefing within the      close confines of the ground in
           sufficient time to allow officers to take up their duties within
           the ground before the gates are open to the public, and outside
           the ground before the main body of spectators arrive in the
           vicinity of the stadium.

4.2       All officers will be briefed \/ith uniformed officers being
           paraded in three ranks ready for inspection.     It will be the
           responsibility of the briefing officer to see that each officer
           is fully instructed in his duties and is smartly turned cut
           including having his hair cut to an acceptable length and his
           beard or moustache triuned - one man of scruffy appearance
           standing before a crowd of spectators discredits the farce as a
           whole. Officers not coming up to the acceptable standard will be
           advised and returned iimediately      to their sub-division or
           station.   The officer in cramend will subsequently report the
           natter to that officer's divisional connmander.
V
4.3       Points to consider during inspections and briefing, whilst not in
           theraselves exhaustive, are set out in Appendices 'B' and *C'.


MANPOWER REQUIREMENTS

5.1       In estimating manpower requirements, the        following factors must
      •   be considered:

             i)     the inportance to each club of the result, ie league
                    position, local reputation in 'derby' gaires, etc;

            ii)     the history of previous encounters between clubs and the
                    supporters of the clubs;

           iii)     the absence of other fixtures in the area;

            iv)     the likely number of       visiting   spectators   and their
                    reputation;

             v)     relationships of public transport systems to the stadium,
                     ie rail stations, bus routes, etc - personnel will be
                     required to protect premises 'en route' to and from the
                     stadium;

            vi)     the geographical features of each ground and location in
                     relation to town or city centres - the arrival of early
                     transport encourages supporters to invade sh:;:; .."n ... as
                     Which require extra protection.

                  EVALUATION OF FOOTBALL OPERATIONAL ORDERS




As a result of a request from other Forces to supply copies ©f their

Operational     Orders    in   connection    with    Football matches,       fcodate    we

have received 45 such Orders.



It is quite clear from the outset that there is such a diversity of

ideas,   emphasis,     format and content      that it        is not surprising    that

some Forces have refused to supply copies.



It appears appropriate to have a standard core-Order within the Force

area   with   additions/deletions       to   cater    for     local conditions.        The

vast   majority   of     the   Orders   examined     follow    the A.C.P.O. Guidance

I.I.M.A.C.      The    following    headings   have    been retrieved       from these

Orders   and have      to be considered      for inclusion or otherwise and if

included,     to what depth.       To    include everything would be Tolly as

this would     take on such proportions         so as to make        it unwieldy and

even if read, incapable of absorbtion.

addressed and agreed upon by this Forum. Examples can, and will be

provided    to assist      with    those deliberations.        It will be seen that

they range      from an extensive A4 size           book to a 5" x 5" booklet to

a simple 3-A4 sheets -            a compromise has to be reached.



It    is recognised    that        an Operational Order is a vital part of any

police    operation    andcareful      attention    to   its   content      is critical

if the Order is to be of any value.

APOLOGIES



Apologies for absence had been received from Messrs.
ADAMS, No. 1 Region; JONES, No. 3 Region; WESELBY, No.
4 Region; ROBINSON, No. 8 Region; and McGREGOR, British
Transport Representative.


The Chairman welcomed representatives to the meeting;
Mr. LYONS for No. 1 Region; Mr. IBBS from No. 3 Region;
Mr. WOOD for No. 4 Region; Mr. SPEED for No. 8 Region
and    Mr.   BAKER        for   British       Transport       Police.           The
Chairman      acknowledged           that    Commander        ROBINSON          had
retired      from         theMetropolitan           Police        and          this
Committee.          He wished to formally record on his own
behalf and that of the Committee deep gratitude owed to
John     ROBINSON         for      his     contribution       to        the    Sub-
Committee.        He had proved a splendid member and ensured
the excellent co-operation of the Metropolitan Police
with this Committee.                In welcoming Mr. SPEED he was
confident he would admirably fill                     the    vacancy.           Mr.
ROBINSON had written to the Committee and the Chairman
will respond to wish him good luck at his new home in
Hampshire.


The Chairman also proffered warmest congratulations to
Haydn DAVIES who had been awarded the Queen's Police
Medal in the recent Birthday Honours.                       He acknowledged
it was an honour well deserved and wished him well,
especially at            the Award Ceremony scheduled                   for 16th
October,     1989   .


The    Chairman         reminded    the Committee          that    the    recent
appointment         of      David        PHILLIPS     as     Deputy           Chief
Constable,        Devon and Cornwall, had led to his formal
resignation as both Secretary to this Committee and as
the A.C.P.O. representative as trustee to the Football
Trust.       He    introduced Mr.           Malcolm GEORGE,          Assistant
Chief Constable (Operations) at Greater Manchester who
had assisted in some of the necessary duties that Mr.
PHILLIPS          was      unable,        because      of         geographical
considerations, to perform.                 A discussion ensued on the
matter of a successor to Mr.                PHILLIPS as Secretary,
after which Mr. DAVIES proposed that Mr. Malcolm GEORGE
be nominated Secretary.              Mr. IBBS seconded the motion
and       the        Committee       unanimously        endorsed      the
recommendation.            It was also unanimously approved by
the Committee         that Mr.      GEORGE be recommended to the
A.C.P.O. President as trustee representing A.C.P.O. to
the     Football       Trust.         Mr.   GEORGE      accepted    both
nominations and remained at Committee in his new post.


The Chairman also reported that the day previously he
had been a member of an interview board to select the
Superintendent head of the proposed National Football
Intelligence Unit,          to be based in London.            There had
been four candidates:-


1.      Chief Inspector HALLAS-APPLEBY, G.M.P.
2.      Chief Inspector CANTRELL, G.M.P.
3.      Chief Inspector CHAPMAN, Metropolitan.
4.      Chief Inspector HOSKINS, Metropolitan.


The decision had been made this very morning that Mr.
HALLAS-APPLEBY was to be appointed with effect from 1st
October, 1989*         He would be involved almost immediately
with selection of the staff for the Unit and setting up
of the office which will be at Tintagel House.                     Chief
Inspector Evans will be the contact at the Metropolitan
Police.


During the next few days advertisements will be placed
for the Inspector,              Sergeant and 3 Constables for the
Unit.     This has been done at the insistence of the Home
Office, acknowledging that it will mean more work but
reinforcing the importance of the N.F.I.U. in the eyes
of    all.      It    is   important    that   the   Unit    should   be
operational very quickly and,               to that end,      they will
receive every assistance from this Committee.


It was desirable that members of this Committee should
be apprised of the method of accountability for the
Unit    which    will      be    formally   recorded.       Day   to day
contact will be made via the Public Order Branch at New
Scotland Yard.        Policy direction will be determined by
this     Committee,         a     Working      Committee          which     will
supervise the N.F.I.U.               Accountability will be through
this Committee to a special Standing Sub-Committee of
the Home Office Central Conference,                       Public Order and
General Purposes Committee.


The main Central Conference Committee is Chaired by Sir
Clive WHITMORE and is attended by the Chief H.M.I.C;
other     Home   Office         officials     and    a    number      of   Chief
Constables,      including the Chairman of this Committee.
The Sub-Committee working to                   that Committee will           be
chaired by Mr. Stephen BOYS SMITH of the Home Office
and he will be assisted by one or two other appointees.
The    A.C.P.O.      will       be   represented         on     the   Standing
Committee overseeing the N.F.I.U, by the Chairman and
Secretary representing               this   Committee,          the Assistant
Commissioner,        Mr.    McLEAN      and     by       the    Chairman    and
Secretary of the A.C.P.O.               G.P.    Committee,         our parent
Committee, who are currently Mr. HAYES of Surrey and
Mr. SMITH of Thames Valley.


As there would be such effective liaison between this
Committee and the N.F.I.U., the Chairman had suggested
to Mr.     APPLEBY    that morning,            subject         to whether the
Committee agreed there would be merit in inviting Mr.
APPLEBY to regularly attend our meetings as a co-opted
member.     The Committee concurred there was much merit
in    the suggestion        and unanimously resolved                  that Mr.
APPLEBY should be so invited.                  The Home Office are to
be informed accordingly.
£     PREVIOUS MINUTES

      (Previously Item 4.1)


      This matter had been fully addressed by the Chairman in
      his opening remarks.


4.2   Working Group on C.C.T.V. and Still Photography
      (Previously Item 4.2)


      The Secretary informed the Committee that the Working
      Group Report had been approved by A.C.P.O. Council in
      July and duly circulated to all Forces,                   England and
      Wales.


4.3   Working Group on C.C.T.V. and Public Safety
      (Previously Item 4.2)


      The Secretary reported that he had, in accordance with
      the decision     of    the   Committee      at    the last    meeting,
      convened a Working Group to enquire into the use of
      C.C.T.V.    with particular regard to public safety.                   A
      number   of    officers,     from      various    regions,    had   been
      approached      and    indicated         their      willingness      to
      participate.     Formal requests for their attendance had
      been made     to .the Chief Constables            concerned and Dr.
      YOUNG at      the S.R.D.B.       Responses        thus   far had been
      favourable.     The first meeting will be Wednesday, 20th
      September,      1989    at      Greater          Manchester     Police
      Headquarters.

W      The Chairman expressed his gratitude to all concerned.
       He reflected          that the Working Group had been                        formed
       because of concern expressed by                     the Committee,              post
       Hillsborough,          that    the     safety      aspect      had     not      been
       adequately       covered       by    the     report      mentioned         at    the
       previous agenda item.               That matter is now in hand.


4.4    Charges for Police Presence at Football Matches
       (Previously item 10)


       At the last meeting it had been resolved to embark upon
       a     review    of     the    method    of       charging      for     a   police
       presence a.t_iloQjbball m a tches, so as to provideCuniform,
      ^-national      guidelines)            Events       at     Hillsborough          had
       rPresfcal-ted~'1?uch^action to date.


       Mr. MANNING highlighted the plight of smaller football
       clubs and the necessity to pursue this matter so as to
       negate the opportunity for police forces to be played
       one against the other unless there was unanimity on the
       level and scale of charges.


       A discussion ensued on the complexity of the equation
       of calculating charges.               The basic calculation for the
       Avon and Somerset charge was per 1,000 spectators plus
       a contingency charge based on that Force's professional
       assessment of whether it was a high, medium or low risk
       match.         It does       not necessarily            reflect      the   actual
       attendance.          Mr. DAVIES highlighted the problems that
       the Taylor recommendations had made by                            the need       for
       increased police             presence      and    attendant         increase      in
       charges.             Mr.     IBBS    commented          on    the     increased                            r
       involvement          of    Police      Authorities           in     determining
       policing charges,             whilst not being exempt                 themselves       A t ?— |   //
       from political influences.


       The    Chairman       summed up,        that     there       were    two    issues
       running in tandem; firstly additional charges vis-a-vis
       the Interim Recommendations,                 and secondly, clubs have
                                                                                                              X

     have been assessed.                   Mr. MANNING suggested it would be
     useful        to    have    a    national            overview       on     the    current
     situation.


     To      assist         in            the        Committee's             deliberations,
     correspondence was circulated from Mr. GRAY, Assistant
     Chief Constable Bedfordshire and Mr. O'TOOLE, Assistant
     Chief Constable West Yorkshire.                            The Chairman reflected
     the    concern        of    the       Committee            for    all     the    vagaries
     attached       to    a difficult problem                     which needed          to be
     evaluated and to draw out basic principles/practices to
     proffer       as     guidelines            to     all      Chief     Constables          and
     Forces.


     Mr. SPEED identified one aspect of current thinking in
     the     Metropolitan            Police          on    the        introduction       of    a
     penalty clause for cancelled matches with a graduated
     percentage charge dependent upon notice given.


     It was resolved the details be obtained regionally and                                         Letter to all members
     the regional representatives be invited to apply some                                          of this Sub-Committee
     analysis of the data to be forwarded with any individual                                       sent 13th September,
     ideas in a covering report.                       The resultant document                       1989.
     should encapsulate all the responses.                              If obvious areas
     of    difficulty       remain,             then      action       would    be    delayed
     pending the next meeting; but if there were indications
     within the review which might usefully be actioned as a
     consensus beforehand, ’it may prove beneficial to do so.




5.   THE HILLSBOROUGH ENQUIRY;                       INTERIM RECOMMENDATIONS


     In     opening       this       item       for       discussion          the     Chairman
     reported that at the General Purposes Committee meeting
     on the    6   th September, 1989 it had been reaffirmed that
     this Committee has the full authority of the parent,
     G.P. Committee, and, ipso facto, A.C.P.O. Council.                                       As
     such    it     is    able       to    action         its    own     decisions      where
     considered          necessary         without         awaiting          the     cycle    of




                                                                         - 7 -
A.C.P.O.       business.            This       means        that         if    it     is    felt
necessary to issue guidelines to any Chief Constables
we can proceed.


The     main     concern           of        the     police is                the    manpower
implications          involved           in        implementing               the     Interim
Report.        It was        resolved to deal with each                              of     Lord
Justice Taylor's             recommendations in turn and to develop
and record       those which had proved difficult or which
provoked       comment.             The        Committee had               recently         been
approached       by Sir Richard BARRETT, at the request of
the Home Secretary, for an assessment of the                                        extent to
which     the    interim           recommendations of                      Lord       Justice
Taylor had been implemented.                        The synopsis of responses
and a subsequent more detailed synopsis were circulated
to assist the Committee in their deliberations.


Recommendation         3       -             Mr.    MANNING          highlighted             the
political       considerations which emerged in calculating
maximum    gates       at    grounds.               At    one       Bristol          club    the
capacity       was    reduced           by    15% in accordance with the
Taylor     recommendations                   but      at       another              which     is
experiencing          financial              difficulties                there        was     no
reduction.             Mr.     GEORGE              also        commented             on      the
difficulties for smaller clubs where a Cup draw gives a
distorted, increased attendance.                            It could result in a
greater    number       of     fans          arriving          at    the       ground       than
could be catered             for inside the stadium.


Recommendation k             provoked much discussion.                          There        was
criticism from all the regions.                            The written agreement
had variously been produced as a detailed written legal
contract formally arranged, a letter of intent setting
out parameters         and     even          signed copies               of minutes           of
meetings       between       the        two        sides.       There          had    been     a
strong suggestion that action should be linked to the
spirit     rather           than        the        letter           of        the     interim
recommendations.                   Additionally                 there           had         been
significant requests               to the Committee from individual
forces     for       guidance           as     to        the        form       the    written
agreement should take.
The      Chairman,         being         ’aware       of        the        confusion’
engendered,      had       approached          Mr.    GODDARD         at    the    Home
Office who echoed his               concern.              As far as the Home
Office understood, the Taylor recommendations had been
intended to regularise the arrangements which generally
existed between clubs as to the allocation of functions
and duties inside the ground, paying special attention
to the filling of pens and monitoring of numbers.                                    It
was not meant to be a contractual or legal arrangement
incurring liabilities in the event of wrong decisions.
The problem was, the Chairman informed him, that that
has not happened mainly because the wrong terminology
had been used.             The word "responsibilities” produced
questions       of    liability          and    culpability            which       lent
itself    to    the       conclusion       that       a    legal      and    binding
contract was required.


The Chairman continued that once a Chief Officer is
asked to enter into a written agreement on behalf of
his    force,        he    is     obliged        to       inform      the        Police
Authority.       Each police authority will scrutinise such
written     agreements.              And       even        if    that       part     is
acceptable      to        the    Chief     Constable            and    the       Police
Authority, there remains responsibility for the conduct
and   training of          the stewards.              If it is             to be    the
police    there w i ^ b e          a nee3" to monitor                 the line of
responsibility to ensure it is not broken.


This matter of responsibility fuelled the discussion.
The question was posed;                  even if the club has                     total
responsibility from a public safety point of view, when
the police consider a pen to be full so as to be unsafe
and dangerous, and then reports same to a club official
but is ignored, where does the essential responsibility
at    common    law       lie?       What       if        the   police       officer
considers       the       club     official’s         decision          should       be
overridden.


The    Secretary          echoed     the       difficulties           which        were
compounded      when       draft     written          agreements           had     been
placed     before         the    legal      officers            of    the     Police



                                                                - 9 -
Authority.           They had dismissed same out of hand and
    formed a legal document which sought to distance the
police from all responsibilities                           to the point where,
almost,       it    might        be     questioned            whether           the    police
should be in the ground at all .


It is considered that whatever arrangements are made,
written       or   otherwise,            nothing          takes          away        from    the
police       their    overriding              duty       as     law        officers          and
officers of the Crown to interfere where necessary.


The     problems      of        such    contractual             difficulties                were
compounded in the requirement to adequately brief the
officers      involved.                The    questions          posed           in    return
cannot       always    be        answered,          leaving              the     individual
officer to have to fall back to "normal police powers"
as     per   Hillsborough.                   What    is       required           is     sound
guidance to all Chief Officers, what is viable and what
is not to be included in written agreements.


Mr.     JACKSON      and    Mr.        BROOMHEAD          produced             the    written
agreement produced by South Yorkshire Police.                                        In broad
terms it makes all the arrangements inside the ground
the     club’s     responsibility.                   It       shows        the       role     of
stewards but does not detract from matters of public
safety where the Police will act as necessary.                                              The
Chairman noted that it reflected the Green Guide and
Mr.     Popplewell’s            report.             It        followed           the        view
expressed by Mr. JOHNSON that whatever agreements were
reached      should        be    kept        as   short        and        as    simple        as
possible.


Mr. IBBS in West Midlands had taken a similar line (as
had Mr. DAVIES in South Wales).                          He had written to the
6    clubs setting out            7    areas of responsibility on one
page.     The responsibilities retained by the police were
for     crowd      monitoring,               movement          of         fans        through
perimeter          gates         to          relieve           overcrowding                 and
control/safety at the ground.                        Mr. LYONS reported that
a Merseyside building surveyor who issues the safety
certificate, considered safety and crowd behaviour was



                                                                     -    10 -
the responsibility of the club with the police acting
as agents.         At meetings since it had been agreed that
in a case of complete breakdown of law and order the
police would then assume complete responsibility.


The question of the final responsibility always lying
with    the    police     was       generally          agreed.        Mr.     IBBS
considered recommendation                 9   once again indicates             the
question      of    safety     is   placed           firmly   on   the      police
officers with the decision on when people are allowed
through the gates.            Recommendation 30 similarly places
safety of all the people at the stadium squarely on the
shoulders     of    the police because                 the counting device
will be in the police control room.


The Secretary questioned the power of the club official
to direct police action if, as stated at Merseyside, we
were agents of the club.              Mr. LYONS outlined incidents
of    difficulty      where     the       ground       commander      and    club
official had been in conflict but                        the club official
deferred      to police       advice.           But    had    there    been    no
concession,        it appeared the club official held sway.
Any ignoring of our advice was at his peril.                                 This
would not stop a disaster occurring.


Mr. HEDGES considered it was a major concern that 43
different approaches involving                  92   clubs could result in
various clubs using such disparity against us.                                Mr.
LYONS   commented       that    arrangements            as    they presently
stood   posed      questions        for       who    would    be   liable     for
compensation if it went wrong.                        The G.M.P.      Solicitor
took the same view, the insurance company won't look at
it.     The requirement for all clubs to indemnify the
Police Authority against any failure of duty or wrong
decision by the Police inside the ground provides only
an opening for private security to step in.


There was agreement that 2 sets of lawyers working for
opposing views were unlikely to produce agreement.                            The
original question was how best to respond to the Home
Office.      It is anticipated Lord Justice Taylor will
address    this      issue     in    his     final    report.         In    the
meantime could the Home Office not be requested to
supply guidance in this regard in the form of a Home                              Meeting with Lord
Office circular.          The Chairman had anticipated that                       Justice Taylor
request may well be made.                 He suggested that another               arranged for
approach could well be for a meeting of representatives                           18.10.89
of the Committee, the Home office and Lord Justice Taylor                         Mr . Anderton and
to resolve some of the areas of contention.                                       Mr. George to attend


The Chairman further stated that when Mr. JOHNSON had
contacted him this morning it had been the first                                  Copy correspondence
intimation Mr. JOHNSON had had that there was cause for                           from Mr. Goddard
concern.     The letter from Mr. NOBES, in which he addressed                     dated   2   .1 0 . 8 9   under
the problem of contracts, had been forwarded to us for                            forwarded under
information but had not been actioned in case it interfered                       cover of letter by
with our own approach.              He suggested that it might prove              the Chairman dated
useful to ask him to forward same to the Home Office.                             3.IO.89.
Unanimously agreed.


Recommendation        6      had     national        implications,          the
Secretary reported, with its emphasis on crowd dynamics
and recognising distress.                 It was being prepared by a
number of forces but the potential was there, in the
long term for a national training package.                          Mr. WOOD
questioned     the    underlying           theme    that    stewards       were
professional,        whereas        his    experience      had      suggested
anything but.        The Secretary questioned whether anybody
other than the police could provide such training.                          Mr.
LYONS indicated that responsibility in Merseyside for
such training had been placed squarely with the club.-
The   Chairman    suggested          that    even    if    the   police      do
train, they do so only at the behest of the club, who
will retain final responsibility.                    Whatever agreement
is reached on Merseyside there is a letter or signed
copy of the minutes of the meeting when that agreement
was reached.




                                                           - 12 -
The Chairman drew attention                       to the 3 video              training
packages      (which included duties                        of stewards)        all    of
which might         require           updating       in     the      light of      these
recommendations.


Recommendation          7         -        Mr.     IBBS        had    contacted       the
football      league         on        this       recommendation             but      they
intimated     they were leaving same                           to the police/fire
service/clubs.          West Midlands had suggested it would be
appropriate for a national colour-coding scheme to be
adopted so that it was easily identifiable to all.                                     It
was   suggested          that         the     internationally               recognised
colour for safety was green and this would therefore be
the most appropriate colour.                        Mr. BAKER made the point
of foreign visitors to British Clubs who do not speak
English    would        naturally            turn      to      that    international
colour.     It was so resolved to write to the Home Office
and   suggest       a    national           colour        scheme      and     that    the
colour be green.


Recommendation          8       -      The       requirement          for    gates     in
perimeter fences to remain open and manned throughout a
match was criticised by all members of the Committee.
The Secretary identified one problem where gates were
only able to be opened                90    degrees.


The Chairman queried whether this difficulty had been
mentioned     to Lord         Justice            Taylor or Mr.              WHALLEY    to
invite either of them to explain areas of difficulty of
interpretation.


Mr. MANNING suggested that the reason for the open gate
policy was to reassure the crowds on the terraces with
the   sight    of       an   open       gate      as      an    obvious      means     of
escape.     Mr. WOOD suggested this is a contraction with
Recommendation 9 where police officers are charged with
the supervision of a gate and must decide who is to be
allowed to use same.
Mr.     DAVIES     commented           that     some      Chief      Officers        had
reputedly failed to comply with this recommendation on
the basis that although the gates have remained closed,
they were unlocked and manned.                        This presents problems
when      there         is     an       attempt           to   reinforce            this
recommendation and one club can use the inconsistency
to enter into debate about charges levied to policing
the stadium.


Mr. SPEED explained that all but one of the clubs in
London had agreed to leave the gates open but expressed
reservations and concern.                     The remaining club had met
with     Local    Authority           which     had       endorsed      the    Safety
Certificate        that       the      gates        remain     closed     but        not
locked.


Mr.    IBBS and the Secretary identified                          the danger of
gates which are only capable of opening                         90   degrees both
to players and officials using the perimeter track.


Finally     the    Committee           noted        the   problems      such        open
gates would present should a public disorder situation
arise.     It will allow rival factions an opportunity to
meet     and      has        serious         implications         for     manpower
resources and costings.


Recommendation 9              -       The Secretary observed that the
onus here is on the police officer to be skilled in
recognising pressures and the crowd situation.                                It also
highlights the need for good radio contact.                               Mr. IBBS
noted that the responsibility remains with the police.
Mr. HEDGES pointed out that this recommendation is in
conflict with       8   .    If the gate is open the decision will
be taken away from the police officer.


Recommendation 10                 -    The Secretary said,               presented
some problems locally.                 It has not been defined what is
adequate cutting gear?                  Is there a requirement for it
to be written into the Safety Certificate?                               Certainly
there     are     dangers             with     oxy-acetylene           and         angle
grinders.          Some       clubs          have    been      content        to     use
hacksaws.      The Chairman noted that there is no common
specification for fencing so                 there can be no common
answer to an appropriate cutting gear.


There was general discussion on who should decide which
cutting gear to use and by whom.                   Mr. SPEED suggested
it   should    not be      the     police      because they        are     not
trained but the Fire Brigade and club should endeavour
to resolve     same but the Local Authority                will decide if
necessary.     Mr. LYONS commented             that in Merseyside the
Fire   Brigade    had      agreed       to     specify the         type     of
equipment and train club stewards in its use.                        It was
agreed that is a sensible and reasonable response given
their expertise.


Recommendations 11 fc 12 are concerned with the Local
Authority and the football club.


Recommendations       13         17    all   relate    to     the    Safety
Certificate.


Recommendation        17     concerns        the    establishment           of
Advisory Groups which should soon be in place.                             Mr.
BROOMHEAD reported that it was not a new group in South
Yorkshire.       Some      Local      Authorities     use    this     as    an
extension of the officer working party which has become
the Advisory Group.          Some advice might be required to
decide whether this should be a separate body.


Mr. LYONS expressed reservations about the implications
of involving locally elected representatives.                        On the
other hand,     Mr.   IBBS stated that in his opinion the
recommendation is one of the most positive aspects of
the Report.

Recommendations 18 - 25


Recommendation        21         -      Mr.    GEORGE    considered         this
recommendation        merited          some    comment      especially        in
respect       of     viewing          crowds    outside       the        ground.
Examining crowd density is easy to recommend but clubs
are baulking at the cost.


The Chairman queries whether for any one ground anyone
had determined the additional cost or number of cameras
required       to      fulfil           the     obligation          of      this
recommendation.         Mr. BROOMHEAD had consulted with the
Home Office Scientific Research and Development Branch
and    their       recommendation         increased       the      number     of
cameras from 4 to       20   .


The Chairman noted that for the recommendation to be
truly effective there must be maximum, constant cover
for    even    the    slightest         loophole      would     effectively
negate the efficacy of this recommendation.                        It will be
the crux of the Working Group chaired by Mr.                              GEORGE
which has S.R.D.B. representation.


In    considering      Recommendations           2k   and     25    Mr.     IBBS
queried whether it could be made a condition of all­
ticket match sales that people be in their seats half
an hour before the start of the match.                          If enforced
nationally it might overcome the problem of the late
arrival of fans.        It was acknowledged that the solution
posed problems of enforcement.


Mr. LYONS noted that once a time is stated then crowds
respond to that time.                Mr. WOODS commented on the need
for effective sanction for those who fail to comply.
It will be necessary to ensure that once the gates were
closed the fans knew                 there would be no entry.               Mr.
MANNING    questioned        whether      such    a     request     would    be
effective unless           entertainment        was   provided       for    the
crowds for that additional period.
0   The Chairman considered it was all part of persuading
    people and those measures need to be maintained.                                     If it
    is accepted, there could be a major growth industry in
    pre-match entertainment.                        The ideas must be flexible
    and discretionary.


    Recommendation            26             -       Nominated          Officer.          The < ^ 4 / 4 ,
    Metropolitan           Police            had     queried          whether       it    was
    necessary       for       the       officer of A.C.P.O.                 rank    to deal                 ///
    personally or to delegate.                           Mr. SPEED continued that
    this matter had been taken up with F.8 Division of the
    Home Office and the initial response had been that an
    A.C.C.    should personally attend.                           The Met.         view had
    been     that    this       is          unreasonable         and        suggested     the
    wording should read...."responsible for ensuring that
    such liaison took place.".


    It was the view of the Committee provided the A.C.C.
    attends the annual meeting of the Advisory Group at the
    time of the renewal of the Safety Certificate, that the
    duties thereafter could be delegated.


    Recommendation 28                   -     The Secretary noted the extra
    resources       here      meant          extra       cost    to   the     club.       The
    principle       of    a    contingency               force    had       been   probably
    present at most grounds but now the clubs are being
    charged for them.                   This stemmed from their retention
    inside the ground, ready for immediate deployment.


    Recommendation 29 will be dealt with in item 6.


    Recommendation 30               -       Mr. MANNING spoke of the size and
    varying standards of communications rooms at football
    stadia.     The        cost         of       extra    personnel         that   are    now    *
    required in control rooms and the additional equipment                                           /
    will place a considerable financial burden on football
    clubs.      Neither         of           the    two    controlawrooms           in    his
    particular force area are sufficient                              for command and
    control purposes.               It was acknowledged that clubs would




                                                                        -   17 -
£   be reluctant to surrender space at grounds but had no
    option once the requirement was included in the Safety
    Certificate.


    Mr.     IBBS       considered that                this     recommendation           is    at    / J
    variance with the main thrust of the report.                                        As the
    police have all the data on crowd figures readily to
    hand,     they        must       shoulder           responsibility            for    crowd
    safety.        The data is not duplicated in another part of                                           \
                                                                                                          -4 g s r O -
    the club.           If the police are aware of such data, they
    are always open to the charge of inaction.                                   If there is
    overcrowding in a self-contained pen or terrace,                                          the
    action necessary to stop it must stem from the Police
    Control Room.


    The Chairman           confirmed            the feeling of             the Committee
    that the Police Service have the knowledge and data on
    which to decide actions to preserve public safety.                                        The
    use     of     the        word         "responsibilities"               presents          the
    greatest       problem;          the            simple,     functional        issue        of
    filling        pens        can         be        performed          easily     but        the
    responsibility for the consequences of filling or not
    filling        a    pen        pose         a     different         problem.             When
    considering            the             question            of        acceptance            of
    responsibility in the event of things going awry, then
    one must return to the control room where the figures
    are     registered           and       where        the     Police      Service          has
    immediate control.


    The     Committee         were         in       full      agreement.          Mr.        IBBS
    combined the logic of this argument to that posed to
    Recommendation 9 •                 In reality the responsibility for
    crowd safety can only be properly met by the Police
    Service.


    Recommendation            31       -        The     Secretary         identified          the
    serious        cost       implications              of      this      recommendation.
    Additional channels will need to be considered though
    soundproofing             will     be           straightforward.              Mr.        IBBS
    commented          that    in      West          Midlands       a    second     command
    channel had been installed at a cost of £12,000.                                     In an



                                                                          - 18 -
emergency there will still be one of the extra channels
available and the n e w .equipment provides an option of a
second channel, e.g. for use by officers of Inspector
rank and above.


Recommendation           32        -      It       was    considered    that      this
recommendation           could           be       included      in     the    Safety
Certificate.            Responses             from    regions    indicated        that
some     clubs    were        balking         at     this    recommendation        for
reasons      of     cost.              Mr.        IBBS      accepted    the       cost
implications        would           be    severe          for   some    clubs     but
recommended it be marked by an asterisk (for immediate
implementation).              It is the most secure and efficient
system of communication particularly where an emergency
exists.      Cost    should            not     be    a consideration.             The
Committee agreed with this proposal.


Recommendation 34               -        The suggestion of a system of
hand signals was rejected unanimously by the Committee.
It could not conceive of any suitably worthwhile system
that   would      not     lend         itself        to misinterpretation          or
confusion.


Recommendation 42              -       It was considered that wherever
possible     the    ambulance            must        be one     provided by       the
N.H.S., though the ramifications of strike action were
noted.      It was also recommended that no police officer
was    to    be     regarded as               a     trained     first-aider       for
football stadia. There could be no dual function.                                 The
expense of this requirement was noted.                               The inclusion
of fixtures at all designated grounds, rather than just
football matches,              meant,         as     in   the   case   of    cricket
matches, greater cost implications.




LATE ARRIVAL OF VISITING SUPPORTERS


This     item     also        embraced         Recommendation          29    in   the
aforementioned item.
The problem had been highlighted by A.C.C. McGREGOR of
the     British        Transport      Police          in    a    report      on       one
incident,     Nottingham Forest                 -v- Aston Villa,               when     a
football special train broke down and fans arrived at
the     station    and       had    to     be       contained.         The     ground
capacity at the football stadium had been reached and
for the majority there was no means of accommodating
them.      This was not intended as a criticism of                                    the
action of the Ground Commander at this match, but to
draw attention to a potential problem for future crowd
control.


It was accepted that the majority of these people were
not     targeted       hooligans         but    ordinary         football       fans.
Clearly the problem of what action to take in the event
of a recurrence needed to be addressed.                            Other members
of Committee highlighted similar problems.


Mr. SPEED commented that there did not seem to be any
obvious underlying reasons for the delayed arrival of
fans at grounds.             He suggested that this is a task that
could be,     in part,             alleviated by            the N.F.I.U.,         once
operational,       to     supply      more          information       to visiting
clubs.       This        was         intended to            be    a    reciprocal
arrangement       which        should      encourage            greater      liaison
between supporters, clubs and the police.


The Chairman endorsed that view.                           He returned to the
question    of     future         action       in    similar      circumstances.
Clearly the British Transport Police would be reluctant
to repeat such action.               The Committee agreed that such
action had no authority,                  neither statutorily,               nor at
common    law.          Thequestion         remained             of   the      proper
contingency       plan       to    deal    with       law    abiding      football
supporters travelling in a proper and public way who
are going about their ordinary business, even if their
primary objective is bedevilled with problems.                               And the
likelihood        of     a         recurrence hasincreased                as      a
consequence of          the reduced ground capacity following
the recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor.
There was a short discussion on the compilation of such
statistics.          The Secretary suggested that no changes to
the format be made initially.                     It expected that the
National        Football        Intelligence       Unit        will     collate
statistics, once operational, and any changes should be
delayed until then.




ANY OTHER BUSINESS




National Federation of Football Supporters Clubs


The Secretary reported on a written approach by                                the
National Federation of Football Supporters Clubs,                               in
which it sought a formal meeting with representatives
of    this    sub-Committee.             The   copy correspondence            was
circulated amongst the Committee.


Mr. BROOMHEAD reported that his Force recognised the
Supporters'          Clubs,   which formed part of the Advisory
Group and met with the Police and Local Authority.                            Mr.
WOOD commented on the need to convey information                                to
supporters and to clubs on such matters as: capacities
at    grounds,        numbers      travelling     and    the    routes        they
take.        This may be         an additional          source of      two-way
information.          The Chairman acknowledged that if such an
approach        is    feasible      it    could   be     used    to    prevent
misunders tanding.


Mr.   LYONS was aware of political in-fighting between
national supporters and local supporters clubs in his
own     Force    area.        He    counselled     on     being       aware    of
political motivation.


As a precursor to further involvement,                         the Secretary
offered to meet with representatives of the N.F.F.S.C.
and report back.              There was a general discussion on
this matter.          The majority view supported such liaison;
some supported same at local level, others at national
level.       It was acknowledged that many complaints from
     ADAMS     for     scrutiny          and     comment.          The     technology
     necessary       for     a    card     entry system poses              the    single
     greatest problem with                 the requirement to accommodate
     such      large        numbers         entering         stadia        during      a
     comparatively short period.                      The draft document had
     been intended to specify the tasks which the computer
     system needed to address.                   Mr. ADAMS' reaction to that
     initial draft is that it fails to address many problems
     whereby the system can be circumvented.                             There is a
     main meeting of the F.M.A.                      Working Group on Monday,
     11th September, 1989 which Mr. ADAMS will attend.


     The Chairman briefly outlined the history of the F.M.A.
     Working     Group           which     had       been    charged       with      the
     production of a viable scheme.                         The Group's Chairman
     had     invited        this      sub-Committee           to    perform         that
     function, an invitation which had been declined.


     The Sub-Committee did, however, agree to be represented                               Letter dated 6.10.89
     on the Working Group, a position Mr. ADAMS now holds.                                 sent to all members
     The initial reaction to these meetings had been that they                             of Sub-Committee
     lacked structure and resolution.                                                      enclosing minutes of
                                                                                           meetings to date.


     Mr.    DAVIES      reported         on      recent      meetings       with     the
     Secretary of State for Wales, regarding the prerogative
     to dedesignate matches for the three Welsh clubs.                               The
     proposals in support of dedesignation by Welsh M.P.s
     had been     acknowledged but                  the Welsh      clubs      would be
     treated the same as the English.


     The    Chairman        expressed         his    appreciation        to      Messrs.
     LYONS and DAVIES.             Progress was noted.




8.   STATISTICS


     The Secretary reported that with some extra effort, the
     statistics        of        arrests       and    ejections       at      football
     matches,    for        the    season      1988 -8 9 , had differentiated
     between those inside and those outside the ground.



                                                                   - 23 -
Mr.    IBBS    noted       that     in    the    past          people     have      been
accommodated         at    grounds.            But     post-Hillsborough              no
Ground       Commander       will    take        that          risk.       Mr.      WOOD
endorsed that comment and stressed the need for unity.
All Committee members had experienced attempts by fans
employing       intimidatory             tactics          to     gain     entry       to
grounds,       after      the     kick        off,     in       contravention         of
seating capacity and without tickets or payment.                                     The
only effective means of stopping this tactic was for a
universal policy that fans would not be admitted other
than in a proper and lawful manner.                             Moreover, in the
case    of    all-ticket          fixtures,          no     persons       should      be
admitted      without       same,    even        if       there    was     a     ground
capacity to accommodate them.                    Only by such strong and
united       action       could     such       intimidatory             tactics       be
negated.


The Secretary summed up the argument that where Police
Forces had maintained these tactics the resistance by
fans had been reduced with succeeding games.                              This view
was    generally       endorsed          by    the     Committee.              It    was
accepted      that     the problem was much                     less     acute      with
clubs which had small attendance figures.                               The problem
was with larger clubs or consequential fixtures,                                    but
any lessening of             control      at     the      small        grounds      only
caused to encourage breaches at other fixtures.                                  There
were instances cited of tickets for some fixtures being
returned yet large numbers of fans still attended the
match in anticipation of being admitted.


The Committee resolved to write to all Chief Constables
addressing      the problem and offering the advice                                 that
contingency          plans        needed        to        be      prepared           for
eventualities such as those outlined.                           There was a need
for a national policy for all-ticket fixtures of "no
ticket - no entry".               Mr. HEDGES drew attention to the
selling of tickets at such fixtures on the day of the
fixture.          This          wreaks        havoc         with        segregation
arrangements and undermines the policy agreed.                                 Whilst
it was acknowledged the police could not force clubs to
desist,      the best practice should be encouraged of no
     ticket    sales        on    the    day    of    the     match.         Mr.    LYONS
     highlighted       the problems             ticket      touts    could pose        to
     this strategy.          This would have to be monitored.


     The Committee also considered a Press Release by the
     Barclays Football League which endeavoured to link the
     late arrival of supporters with the decision by Ground
     Commanders       to    delay        the    kick-off       time.         Mr.    SPEED
     opined     that        it     was     never      envisaged         that       Ground
     Commanders would,             as a matter of course, delay kick-
     offs.     Mr. WOODS suggested that it was something which
     would find its own level after the natural caution and
     concern     in     the        first       few    matches        following        the
     disaster.


     The Chairman concluded; the arrangement was designed
     for an exceptional set of circumstances and in the current                             Letter sent to all
     period of understandable caution now being exercised it                                Chief Constables
     may be that value judgements are slightly distorted,                                   dated 22.9.89
     erring on the grounds of safety.                       It was resolved to remind
     all forces that whilst it is a matter for them and the
     Ground    Commander           on     the       day,     that     it     will     not
     ordinarily be necessary to seek to delay a game merely
     because    it    is     known       to    the    Police    that       numbers     of
     spectators, expected to arrive, have still not done so.
     The   point      was        well-taken,         that    with      all     sporting
     events, not just football matches, the practice of late
     arrivals has been with us for generations.


7-   THE FOOTBALL SPECTATORS* BILL


     The Chairman had already reported on developments with
     the Reporting Agency outlined in Part II of the Bill.
     In the temporary absence of Mr. ADAMS he invited his
     representative,         Chief       Superintendent             John     LYONS,    to
     report    on     the    workings          of    the    Football       Membership
     Authority Working Group.


     Mr. LYONS informed the meeting that a draft document
     had already been prepared by the Group prior to Mr.
     ADAMS joining same.                A copy has been forwarded to Mr.



                                                                    - 22 -
      football supporters were ground specific.              Mr. MANNING
      suggested that local arrangements would not adequately
      address      such   complaints     which   more    often    than    not
      emanated from away supporters.             The suggestion by the
      Secretary for a meeting with national representatives
      will underpin the need for good local contact.


      The Chairman emphasised that whatever line or stance the                  Meetings have since
      Committee takes, the greatest benefit is adequate                         taken place:
      consultation and liaison to promote a proper understanding                22.9.89 - F.S.A.
      at local level between local authorities, police and local                26.9.89 - N.F.F.S.C.
      supporters clubs.        To that end the National dimension
      must be taken into account.            It was agreed that the
      meeting      between    the    Secretary     and     the    national
      representatives        will   be    approached     diplomatically.
      There must be no suggestion that this correspondence
      from N.F.F.S.C. has been ignored.             The other national
      body, the Football Supporters' Association will also be
      contacted on our initiative.


9-2   Jurisdiction of British Police Officers


      Mr. BAKER,     representing Mr. McGREGOR of the British
      Transport Police, commented on             the incident on board
      the Tor Britannica DFDS Ferry when one passenger had
      been lost overboard.          The ship had been turned around
      by the Captain and met at port by officers from Essex
      and    theBritish        Transport      Police      who     arrested
      miscreants and returned them to London.             He highlighted
      the logistical problems, with England supporters spread
      throughout the country.


      He continued, officers from the same Forces went to the
      Hook of Holland but due to a lack of information only
      45 troublemakers arrived.          The other troublemakers had
      made   off      but had since      been tracedelsewhere       and
      officers       from the British      Transport     Police    awaited
      their arrival.      The request had emanated from Sea Link
      Officials via the Minister of Sport and Sir Richard
      BARRETT.     There are problems identified as a result of




                                                         - 25 -
this    incident which need            to be addressed.            Some of
those problems will take the form of complaints about
policing in Sweden.


The Chairman confirmed that much excitement had been
caused by this incident.               He had been in contact with
Sir    Richard      BARRETT,    HMCIC,    and    Mr.    O'BRIEN,      Chief
Constable of the British Transport Police.                      The request
had been made in exceptional circumstances and the main
priority had been the return of the miscreants.                            In
doing so, a number of difficulties had been identified
by     the   aforementioned       and    others.          The    Committee
discussed      the issues.        A number of points/questions
were raised.


(a)    What are the responsibilities of British Transport
       Police who go to a foreign country and physically
       escort football         supporters      there;   place them on
       board     ship   and     then    police     them    on     board     a
       commercial        carrier         and     in       foreign         and
       international waters?


(b)    What are the police officers'              liabilities?        They
       are in an untenable position.                  Maritime law and
       the use of police as agents of the Captain is a
       minefield of legislation.


(c)    There are no international              conventions        to cover
       this situation.


(d)    Thought must be given            to an expression of           this
       Committee's foreboding on this matter.                   There must
       be    some    formal    arrangement       for    monitoring        the
       movement of supporters in and out of the country.


(e)    The ad hoc arrangements may have been expedient
       but they were unprofessional and undignified.


(f)    There   is    a problem     for    the position of           Police
       Authorities in these circumstances.

10.   DATE OF NEXT MEETING


      It was agreed that regular fixed meetings be arranged
      for this year and the whole of 1990.        It is anticipated
      that   an   extraordinary   meeting   may   be   required   for
      consideration of the final report of inquiry into the
      Hillsborough Disaster by Lord Justice TAYLOR.


      (The date of the next regular meeting has been arranged
      for Monday, 13th November, 1 9 8 9 . 11.00 hours at Greater
      Manchester Force Headquarters.)

For the attention of Mr D Bownes              <**



Dear Sirs

SAFETY O F SPORTS GROUNDS A CT 1975
R EVI EW O F THE ADMINISTRATIVE/INSPECTION SYSTEM

Thank you for your letter of 25th July, 1989, inviting my comments upon           the
above mentioned review which you are undertaking as a result         of           the
Hillsborough Inquiry.

Since you invite comment on matters other than those you have listed,       I    take
this opportunity of giving m y thoughts on other aspects.

The comments are in three parts as follo w s:-

(i)    My thoughts on how     the City Council might proceed.
(ii)   The legal position     regarding consultation, acceptance of advice and
      enforcement.
(iii) Comments on the headings contained in the letter.

1.     H ow the Council Might Proceed

1.1    I consider that urgent priority needs to be given to the replacement of
       the Sheffield Wednesday certificate and the   issue of General    Safety
       Certificates in respect of Bramall Lane and Owlerton Sports Grounds.

1.2    To  achieve the     above objective I recommend that the multi-disciplined
       safety t e am approach which has always been used should be retained.     I
       am of the opinion however that the City Council will have to become more
       actively involved in the process than it has in the past.

1.3    Manpower resources will be needed to enable the City Council to c o ­
       ordinate the    inspections and advice of the Advisory Group, evidence at
       the Inquiry suggested that the officer concerned was overburdened.     In
       m y view your officers must arrange and Chair meetings and produce prompt
       and accurate minutes for circulation; correspond directly with the clubs
                                 -   1   -
to obtain plans and information pursuant to the issue of certificates;
generally act as the catalyst to ensure that General Safety Certificates
are issued as soon as possible and that clubs get on with any
outstanding work is required to inform the Council when it has been
completed so that arrangements can be made for the safety team to
inspect.

I would emphasise that the City Council is not entitled to take the view
that it is for the Fire Service rather than the Council to pursue the
clubs to ensure that work is completed. As you may know it has been
necessary in the past for the Fire Service to ask the Council to remind
clubs of the need for action. The Fire Service has limited manpower
resources at its disposal and, in addition to its main statutory
responsibility, for issuing fire certificates under the Fire Precautions
Act 1971, it also gives advice to the Council on means of escape and
fire precautions in literally hundreds of premises for which the City
Council is the responsible licensing Authority.

I am of the opinion that all three designated grounds and in particular
Sheffield Wednesday should be comprehensively surveyed by the individual
members of the Advisory Group. This is emphasised by the views on the
apparent low level of maintenance of grounds noted by the Building
Surveyor and Health & Consumer Services. Each department should act in
unison in this respect rather than separately. The Green Guide and the
interim recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor should form the basis of
the standard to be achieved and in this connection the City Council will
need to consider and make known its policy as regards the use of
professional judgement in cases where provisions within sports grounds
fall below that of the Green Guide. I say this in the light of the
attitude which was apparent from some quarters during the Hillsborough
Inquiry that the Green Guide should be applied without flexibility. I
would emphasise that I will always require my officers to apply their
professional judgement in applying any code of guidance.

At the same time the many recommendations stemming from the extremely
comprehensive safety audits carried out by the Council's Health and
Consumer Services Department, many of which cut across the expertise of
other disciplines will need to be actively considered except for those
aspects which are required to be implemented before the commencement of
the football season. I note one recommendation for the restriction of
use of two sections of the Spion Kop at Hillsborough which you will need
to decide upon before the new season. Has a similar report been done on
Owlerton?

A copy of the report of each discipline should be sent by the City
Council to each other discipline after which the City Council should
Chair a meeting to enable problems to be discussed so that an accepted
approach might be determined by the City Council and consolidated into a
single report of requirements which should be forwarded to the clubs or
included as requirement conditions in the General Safety Certificates
when they are issued. In my opinion this method of working is necessary
in the case of all new applications and where alterations and extensions
are made to certificated grounds. The City Council must arrange the
meetings not put the onus on individual disciplines to ask for a meeting
as it has previously done.

It is my view that the necessary comprehensive surveys could not be
undertaken satisfactorily without accurate and detailed drawings of all
parts of the grounds. Duplicate sets of drawings should be obtained for
all disciplines so that one set can be marked up and sent to the City
Council and one be retained on file for record purposes. As a minimum
the following drawings are needed:-
                         -   2   -
(i)   A site plan showing the ground and its surroundings at a     scale   of
      1:500

(ii) A plan view of the ground showing entrances, exits, gates, stands,
     terraces etc at a scale of 1:200

(iii)Drawings of each stand, terrace, building within the ground and the
     use of rooms - including areas beneath stands at a scale of 1:100.

(iv) Drawings of emergency lighting and       fire   alarm   and   detection
     equipment and public address system.

I also take the view that the plans which have been supplied on behalf
of Sheffield Wednesday and Sheffield United by Eastwood and Partners
have often contained insufficient detail.      Often   for example  such
details as entrances and exits or their widths, perimeter fences and
gates or their widths, the area and rake of terraces, the location of
emergency lighting, and fire warning and fire equipment are not shown.
I am of the opinion that much more detail needs to     beshown on    the
drawings forming part of General Safety Certificates as is the case with
fire certificates issued under the Fire Precautions Act 1971. This will
facilitate   the   re-inspection   of   the   sports   grounds and the
identification of any unauthorised alterations which might have been
made.

Following receipt of drawings I suggest that the City Council calls a
meeting of the Advisory Group to agree on common identification
procedures.   In order that each discipline is able to identify parts of
grounds in a uniform manner, I suggest that stands     and terraces  are
clearly identified, exit routes, passages, gateways, doors etc. numbered
in a consecutive manner and stairways lettered.   At   the same time a
suitable deadline for submission of survey reports by each discipline to
the City Council should be agreed after which the procedure outlined in
1.7 above would operate preparatory to the issue/replacement of a
General Safety Certificate to each ground.

The Legal Position

I have included this part in order to outline my understanding of the
legal position and to indicate a number of aspects about which I think a
clear understanding is necessary.

As I see it the powers, duties and functions of the    City Council   are
clearly set out     in the 1975 Act.    The Advisory Group (safety team)
approach is not     covered in the Act although      it    is   obviously
advantageous.

The Council is required to send a copy of any application for a safety
Certificate or a transfer of a safety certificate to the Fire Authority.
In the case of an application for a Safety Certificate, the council is
required to consult the Fire Authority about the terms and conditions to
be included in the certificate.       This requirement to consult also
applies to   any proposal to amend,      replace or transfer a safety
certificate.

To consult means to seek information or advice from; to take into
consideration. It imposes no requirement on the City Council to accept
the advice    of the Fire Authority.For example, the Council may
sometimes have to balance the merits of conflicting advice and make a
judgement which it considers will provide for the reasonable safety of
spectators. This is the reason why I regard my recommendations at 1.2
                         - 3 -
and 1.7 to be extremely important.  Ultimately the City Council sets the
standards having first considered professional advice it has received.

The Council is also required to give notice in writing to the Fire
Authority as an interested party of its decision to issue, replace or
amend a Safety Certificate or to refuse to amend or replace a Safety
Certificate.   As an interested party the Fire Authority has a right of
appeal which could be used for example where the Fire Authority did not
agree with the standard set by the City Council perhaps as a result of
its judgment of the merits of conflicting advice as mentioned in 2.4
above.

Once the Council determines that, in its opinion, an applicant is a
qualified person, it is then under a duty to issue a General Safety
Certificate.   It has no power to withhold the issue of a Safety
Certificate pending the carrying out of alterations or additions to the
sports ground.    However, the terms and conditions within the Safety
Certificate may be such as to involve alterations or additions being
made at a sports ground. Pending the satisfactory completion of such
works, the crowd capacity of the ground or parts can for example be
limited or the use of a stand or a terrace entirely prohibited etc. By
this means the General Safety Certificate becomes an instrument of
continuing control.

In issuing a Safety Certificate the City Council has power to require an
applicant to provide them within such time as they specify with such
information and such plans as they consider necessary to enable them to
determine the terms and conditions which ought to be included in any
certificate issued in response to his application.         It would seem
therefore that although once having determined an applicant to be a
qualified person a Safety Certificate must be issued, the Act recognises
that this is not possible if the necessary plans and information are not
furnished within a reasonable time. The Council has power to extend the
time allowed after which the application is deemed to have been
withdrawn and an offence is committed if the sports ground is then used.

If while a General Safety Certificate is in force it is proposed to
alter or extend the sports ground or any of its installations in a way
which is likely to affect the safety of persons, the holder is required
to give notice to the City Council.   Notice is particularly required
when it is proposed to alter the entrances to or exits from the sports
ground or any part of it (including any means of escape in case of fire
or other emergency) or the means of access to any such entrances or
exits.   Since such changes would necessitate the replacement        or
amendment of the General Safety Certificate the City Council would be
required to consult the Fire Authority as set out in 2.3 above.

The Fire Authority have powers of entry and inspection of sports grounds
under Section 11 of the 1975 Act and has authorised its officers
accordingly.

I feel that the Council should inform the disciplines in the Advisory
Group what its policy is as regards enforcement of the Act particularly
as regards the use of prohibition/restriction powers under section 10 of
the 1975 Act and as regards contravention of Safety Certificate
conditions.   Is there a procedure    and standard form in being for
implementing   Section    10?   In what form would the Council wish
information to be passed to it where contraventions          of   Safety
Certificate    conditions are found    by fire officers at a "during
performance"  inspection? Do you have your officers on call and would
you want them to be called to the grounds? If so, details need to be
supplied of names and telephone numbers.
                          - 4 -
2.11   My view is that any legal proceedings for contravention of Safety
       Certificate conditions is the responsibility of the City Council. It
       has in the past been suggested that the Fire Service could institute
       legal proceedings regarding matters within its expertise regarding
       contravention of Safety Certificate conditions in view of its powers of
       entry and inspection under Section 11 or the 1975 Act. As indicated
       above, this is not a view to which I subscribe but I would be grateful
       for your view on the matter for the purposes of clarification.

2.12   As you know, Section 10 of the Fire Precautions Act 1971 is broadly
       similar to Section 10 of the 1975 Act. As such it can be applied by the
       Fire Authority to structures within sports grounds as regards fire risk.
       I do not envisage a situation arising where it would be appropriate to
       use the power since I regard the power under the 1975 Act to be the
       primary controlling legislation. Should a fire risk which merits the use
       of Section 10 powers come to the notice of the Fire Authority it will be
       my policy to consult the City Council with a view to it using its
       Section 10 powers.     Only in the case of a dispute where the Fire
       Authority considered a Section 10 notice should be served and the City
       Council did not, would the Fire Authority use its powers under Section
       10 of the 1971 Act.

       I stress that this is very unlikely to occur since any use would be a
       last resort, after consultations with the ground operator had failed to
       secure a reasonable standard of safety. I would be grateful for your
       comments regarding agreement or otherwise with this position so that any
       differences might be sorted out.

2.13   Under Section 10B, the City Council is required to enforce the 1975 Act
       and arrange for annual inspections of designated grounds in accordance
       with guidance issued by the Secretary of State under cover of Home
       Office Circular 72/1987.

3.     Commentb on Content of Letter

3.1    In addition to giving advice to the City Council the Fire Authority
        advises Rotherham, Barnsley and Doncaster Councils.   Under the former
        South Yorkshire County Council there was a common Safety Certificate.
        This was convenient because a fire officer (or a police officer) being
        county based knew that certificate conditions were identical. Under the
        District Councils there are now four different sets of conditions which
        is in my view confusing and unnecessary. I recommend that liaison takes
        place between the District Councils to produce a common standard.

3.2    Communications

       I think my comments in part one indicate           my   views   regarding
       communication between the City Council and the members of the Advisory
       Group. It will obviously be necessary for there to be extensive
       consultation with clubs when dealing with applications for safety
       certificates, extensions or alterations to grounds and statutory and
       other inspections.    In this respect I refer to paragraph 4 of Annexe C
       to Home Office Circular 7/1986. A firm but friendly and helpful approach
       should be adopted when dealing with the clubs. You mention that Council
       members may wish to have a more prominent role in relation to the system
       although you do not state what that involvement might be.    So far as the
       carrying out of inspections is concerned I feel that the Council should
       receive its advice from the professional members of the Advisory Group.
       Clearly, however, it is for the Council members        todetermine any
       involvement they consider appropriate. My only note of caution would be

                                - 5 -
to avoid any lengthening of the process leading to the issue   of   Safety
Certificates.

Role of each Member of the advisory Group

I think that the group needs to meet to discuss this aspect in detail
taking into account any recommendations in Lord Justice Taylor's interim
report.   The comments of each discipline would have to be restricted to
those aspects for which they have expertise. The objective has to be to
ensure that no aspects are missed. Simply put, I perceive the role of
the Fire Service as giving advice on means of escape and fire
precautions in their broadest sense and ground capacity baaed on the
capacity of exits only. There are many areas of overlap particularly
between the Fire Officer and the Building Control Officer.           The
objective of designating a primary authority for certain aspects adopted
by the South Yorkshire County Council and in amended form by the City
Council is sound and both should be used as a basis for any review.

Review of Council'a Approach to the Clubs

I am in general agreement with your comments although I will want to
discuss with you the exact method you propose and I would draw your
attention to my comments in Part 1 regarding surveys and the provisions
of plans etc.     It should be emphasised to all members of the Advisory
Group that they must not deal direct with clubs on matters covered by
the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 because of the danger that the
clubs will make alterations which may affect the safety of spectators
without the knowledge of the City Council or the other members of the
Advisory Group. All correspondence with the clubs on Safety of Sports
Grounds matters must be via the City Council.

Another problem which I feel needs addressing with the clubs is the
tendency for a sudden rush of proposals usually in July when time is
short and they want the work done before the start of the new season.
Because of the timing, key officers are often on holiday.     Often the
alterations could have been submitted for approval long before the end
of the playing season so that work could commence immediately after the
end of the playing season.

Inspections and Enforcement of Certificate Conditions

So far as inspection prior to the issue of a general Safety Certificate
or in the case of extension or alteration of a certificated sports
ground is concerned. I refer to my comments in Part 1. As to a rolling
programme of inspections I refer to my comment at 1.5.

I feel that inspections carried out under Section 10B of the 1975 Act
should be in accordance with the statutory guidance and also the
supplementary but non statutory guidance given in Home Office Circular
72/1987.   Where there is no outstanding work to be done an annual
inspection should suffice but where work is outstanding or general
housekeeping and maintenance give cause for concern inspections should
be carried out more frequently. During performance inspection should be
carried out on an ad hoc basis, the frequency being determined according
to the standard of compliance found. Normally a DP inspection should be
carried out in the early part of a season. There may be advantage in
having the odd joint DP inspection, although I don't consider that
should be more than once per season, perhaps the first early season
inspection. The police should normally be notified in advance when a DP
inspection is to be made and any comments forwarded to the City Council.
So far as enforcement is concerned, I would refer you to my comments in
Paragraphs 2.10, 2.11 and 2.12. A standard inspection form similar to
                         -   6   -
>Si v. «

                   that attached to HOC 72/1987      would   be   invaluable   for   carrying   out
                   section 10B inspections.

                   Role of Advisory group and its Administration

                   I believe that the role of the Advisory Group has to be limited to
                   giving professional advice within its area of expertise to the City
                   Council to assist it to carry out its enforcement function. The City
                   Council is ultimately responsibility for setting the required standard
                   hopefully on the basis of agreed common advice from the Advisory Group.
                   1 do not believe that the notes (minutes) of meetings have been adequate
                   in the past (often non were done). To maintain the impetus of such a
                   diverse group needs active central administration and co-ordination.
                   Hence my comments in Paragraphs 1.2 and 1,3. Properly devised forms
                   could be of very great benefit. Obviously their objective and content
                   would need careful consideration.      The notes or minutes of meetings
                   whatever they are called should seek to record what was agreed or
                   decided so that the progress made is identified. The whole objective
                   being to ensure any differences are ironed out and a consolidated view
                   reached.

^                  Safety Certificate Conditions

                   There are a number of the conditions which I would like to discuss with
                   Mr Bownes. Although I have not had time to give detailed consideration
                   to them as yet. What I have mainly in mind is what detail should be
                   recorded on the Safety Certificate plans. See Paragraph 1.9

      I hope you find the contents of this letter both helpful and constructive and
      I look forward to your response.        I look forward also to receiving the
      comments of the other members of the Advisory Group which you stated in your
      letter you would circulate.

      ACO Seaman is on annual leave between 4th and 21st August and recognising that
      the interim report will shortly be issued, I would ask that you contact my
      Senior Fire Prevention Officer, Divisional Officer Hildreth or in his absence
      either Divisional Officer Binnington or Temporary Divisional Officer Ryder.

Summary of Action Taken

The report to MEGS Programme Committee summarises the action which has
already been taken by the Council in its capacity as licensing authority
and no need is seen to repeat it here; however, members should be aware
that the General Purposes Panel, acting under delegated powers, considered
a report of the Advisory Group at its meeting on 15th September concerning
Owlerton Stadium and resolved to serve a Prohibition Notice with immediate
effect.

Members should also be aware that the Advisory Group is at present being
chaired by one of the Department's Principal Solicitors as an interim
measure pending a decision by the Council on its future and to respond
to the views of the Taylor Report that the Group should be chaired by a
senior officer.

Finally, the views of other interested bodies and Departments have been
requested on how the responsibilities of the Council should be carried
out in future; as already indicated, copies of these observations are attached.


Matters for Consideration

A number of matters now require members' consideration; these include

(i)     The staffing requirements necessary for the effective and efficient
        running of the licensing service.

(ii)    The level of fees which should be charged for the issuing of
         certificates and the length of such certificates.

(iii)   The future administrative arrangements and decision-making     procedures
         required to operate the service.

This report, addresses these three issues in turn.

(i)     Staffing
                   fi
        It has to bt? said that the existing staffing arrangements in the
        Licensing" Section of my Department are totally incapable of handling
        the additional volume of work likely to arise from the implementation
        of the recommendations of the Taylor Report as well as the existing
        licensing obligations.   Members will see that the report to MEGS
        Programme Committee recognises this and proposes a new structure
        and additional staffing to handle the increased workload.   It has
        to be said that the additional expenditure of £26,400 needed to
        implement this additional staffing requirement cannot be found
        from within the provisional cash limit notified to the Department
        for 1990/91.   It may be possible to meet some limited expenditure
        in the remainder o f the current financial year but not in a full
        year.

(ii)    Fees
S
f       At the present time fees are not charged by the Council for the
         issuing or amendment of any safety certificate.  Regulation 14
         of the Safety of Sports Grounds Regulations 1976 enables a local
         authority to "determine the fees to be chargged in respect of
         applications for the issue or amendment of safety certificates
         but such fees must not in a particular case exceed an amount
         commensurate with the work actually and reasonably done."

        The guidance quoted in the Taylor Report is that every safety
        certificate should be reviewed annually and renewed annually;
        therefore it can only be assumed that the expenditure will increase.

        Accordingly it is recommended that with immediate effect fees  be
        charged to all applicants for safety certificates at whatever level
        is considered to be appropriate for the work done - clearly, fees
                                   -   3 -



      may be different in different cases. Any increased income would
      of course be used to offset the increased expenditure referred
      to above.

ii)   Future Administrative Arrangements

      Paragraphs'16 and 17 of the interim recommendations of the Taylor
      Report state that a local authority should review its administrative
      arrangements and set up an effective Advisory Group with a Chairman
      from the local authority and an effective procedure which should
      produce regular written reports for consideration by the local
      authority.

      The revised administrative structure that is summarised in the
      report to MEGS Programme Committee would in my view provide an
      administrative structure within my Department which would enable
      the Council to deal adequately with the administration of the
      certificate, but clearly the Council must consider whether its
      procedures would need to be amended in the light of the recommendations.

      So far as the Advisory Group recommendation is concerned, such
      a Group already exists, although it does not have representatives
      from the Clubs and Supporters' Club and is at present charied by
      on^ of my Principal Solicitors. Members may wish to consider whether
      these arrangements are considered satisfactory or whether it would
      be appropriate fgr the local authority Chairman to be a member
      rather than^^an officer.  In any event, members should consider
      whether iir’is desirable that an Advisory Group reporting directly
      to the Council on matters related to safety of the public should
      include representatives of the Clubs and Supporters' Clubs or

      whether an additional body including representatives of Clubs and
      Supporters' Clubs should be created to advise the Advisory Group
      as and when appropriate.

      I am of the opinion that the Council should be advised in the exercise
      of its functions under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act by an
      independent and impartial Advisory Group, chaired by one of my
      senior officers as at present and consisting of the professional
      officers who have an input into the recommendations that the Council
      need to consider.  To include representatives of the clubs, stadia
      and supporters' clubs onsuch a Group would cloud the matter and
      leave the public, and indeed the Council, unclear on the role of
      the Group, since inevitably the views of the clubs and supporters
      will be based on different attitudes from those of professional
      officers with a responsibility to advise the Council on the exercise
      of ifs functions.

      I feel that the views of   the Taylor Report on the importance of
      consulting clubs, stadia   and supporters should be recognised by
      the creation of a different group, which would contain representatives
      of the formal Advisory Group and of the clubs and supporters and
      whose function would be to make representations to the Advisory
      Group and through it the Council on matters of particular concern
          to the members, whether on the functions of the Council under the
          Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 or otherwise.  Such a group could
          appropriiately be chaired by a member of the Council t© emphasise
          the link recommended by the Taylor Report.

 (iv)     Future Decision — Making Arrangements

          Finally, any consideration of the Council's procedures must clearly
          include the formal decision-making process of the Council.  At
          present the powers and duties of the Council under the Safety of
          Sports Grounds Act 1975 are delegated to the General Purposes Panel
          of MEGS Programme Committee, with urgent matters delegated further
          to me. Members need to consider whether this arrangement is
          satisfactory, and if not, whether another Committee or Sub-Committee
          of the Council should be responsible for such matters.  Members
          need to be aware that Annual Council resolved at its meeting on
          17th May that       the powers and duties exercised by MEGS Programme
          Committee in relation to licensing matters be referred to the Health
          and Consumer Services Programme Committee

         It would seem to be consistent with that decision that the licensing
         functions of the Council should in due course be transferred to
         Health and Consumer Services Programme Committee, presumably at
         the same time as this Committee considers the date of transfer
         of the other licensing functions.   Such a decision should, however,
         take into   count the need to consider what level the delegation
         to the Programme "Committee and any Panels or offices would need
         to be established.


Recommendations

Members are asked to note this report and to

(i)      agree with the proposed new staffing structure and to indicate
          how this should be funded;

(ii).    agree with the basis of charging fees;

*(iii)   agree with the recommendations concerning the future of the Advisory
 *       Group, its constitution and chairmanship and also with the creation
         of a separate group including representatives of the stadia and
         chaired by a member of the Council; and

(iv)     consider what Committee/Panel arrangements should  be brought into
         force to deal with the statutory responsibilities of the Council
         under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975, in the light of the
         decision of teh Council on 17th May.

            SUBJECT:          GATE CONTROL OFFICERS - BARNSLEY FOOTBALL CLUB




            I refer to the report dated 25 October 1989 endorsed by yourself on 30
            October setting out the present 'gate control' arrangements in being at
            Barnsley Football Club.

            I agree entirely with Superintendent Simpson's recommendations and he
            has permission to supply 'gate control officers' as he sees fit, and in
            accordance with intelligence received preceding each match provided, of
            course, there is always one 'gate control officer' for each of the
            perimeter gates at the Spion Kop fence.

            SUBJECT:         g a t e   c o n t r o l   o f f ic e r s   -   b a r n s l e y   f o o t b a l l   c l u b



             Following the publication of the Taylor Report, Force Policy dictated
             that for every football fixture at Oakwell 2 Officers would be detailed
             for gate control duty at each of the 3 gates in the Spion Kop perimeter
             fence.         One officer was to monitor the crowd at all times and supervise
             the gate with the other being responsible for general public order
             p r o b l e m s . In order to maintain this level of cover, we found it
             necessary to utilise one officer to act as a reserve to relieve for
             refreshments etc.         In total we therefore use 7 Officers to perform
             this function.

            -Set out below are the home fixtures played to date showing the number
             of supporters using the Spion Kop area:-

             26 August 1989            -         Brighton      - 134
             5 September 1989          -         Stoke         - 1190
             9 September 1989          -         Middlesborough - 2737
             23 September 1989         -         Bradford      - 1792
             26 September 1989         -         Wolverhampton - 1063
             14 October 1989           -         Port Vale     -   849
             17 October 1989           -         Sheffield United -3646

             Pre-Taylor the Spion Kop had a capacity of 7,500.    In accordance with
             the recent recommendations, that has n o w been reduced to 5,250 as a
             result of the turnstile factor. Taking the initial maximum capacity
             and reducing that by Taylor's Recommendation of 15% the Spion Kop could
             house 6,375.

             As can be seen from the above figures, the Spion Kop has not approached
             capacity on any game thus far.  I consider that on all the fixtures
             this season with the exception o f - t h e Sheffield United game, the gates
             could have adequately have been manned by one officer.       The fact that
             Officers on gate duty wear yellow fluorescent jackets draws extra
             attention to them and gives the impression of an excessive police
             presence.

             I recommend that we be permitted to use one officer performing gate
             duty on each of the 3 perimeter gates in the Spion Kop fence and that
             this number should be increased at the discretion of the Ground
             Commander having due regard to the number of supporters anticipated,
             their potential for disorder and general reputation.

             On the majority of games this will lead to a reduction of 4 Constables.

             I ask that should you be in agreement with this proposal, that my report
             be forwarded to the Acting Assistant Chief Constable (Operations)
             Mr Broonj^ead for his consideration.

A/ACC (Operations)     Mr Broomhead

Forwarded for consideration, please.     I support the views expressed by
Superintendent Simpson and feel that one Officer per Gate would be adequate
in most situations at Barnsley Football Club.

As a point of interest, Stewards are on the track to assist in monitoring
crowd safety and of course supplement the Officers designated to the Gates.

        SUBJECT:    PRESENTATION TO MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT ON THE SUBJECT
                    OF THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

        On 3 October 1989 Mr Michael Shersby MP (Con), who represents the
        interests of the Police Federation in the House of Commons, visited the
        Force. His host was Paul Middup, and he was accompanied by his private
        secretary Mrs Hampton; by national and local representatives of the
        Federation's solicitors; by Tony Judge, Editor of the 'Police' magazine;
        and by Mr Coyles, Vice Chairman of the Police Federation of England and
        Wales.

        PC Middup sought permission for me to address the group on the subject
        of the Hillsborough disaster which you granted. To assist in this
        regard I compiled from the mass of video tape evidence a 31 minute
        chronology of the events. Mr Hayes was present throughout the
        presentation and stayed for the question/answer session that followed.

        Over lunch that day, Mr Shersby asked Mr Hayes if I might be permitted
        to give the same presentation to an invited audience of Members of
        Parliament in London. Approval was subsequently given after Mr Hayes
        had discussed the request with you.

        On 8 November 1989, by arrangement with Mr Shersby MP, I visited the
        Palace of Westminster. Mr Shersby had invited an audience of 40+ to
        hear the presentation. A total of 12 Members of Parliament were
        actually in attendance as follows:-

             Mr Michael Shersby (Con)
             Mr Tom Pendry (Lab) - Chairman of the All Party Selection Committee
                                   on Football
             Mr David Evans (Con) - Member of that Committee and Chairman of
                                    Luton Town FC
             Mr Irvine Patnick (Con) - Member for Hallam
             Mr Joe Ashton (Lab)
             Mr Menzies Campbell QC (Con)
             Mr Keith Vaz (Lab)
             Mr Alan Meall (Lab)
             Mr John Greenway (Con) - believed Director of York City FC
             Mr Jim Couchman (Con)
             Mr Michael Lord (Con)
             Mr Martin Brandon-Bravo (Con)

        Apologies were received from many Members who were detained on other
        parliamentary business.

        In order to set the scene, I report as follows.

        I set up my visual aids in Committee Room 14 at the Palace of Westminster.
        The room is a mini debating chamber with benches arranged along either
        side of the room.   I positioned the video monitor so that it was facing
        just one side of the chamber. I accompanied Mr Shersby to the Members'
        Tea Room and, upon my return to the Committee Room, the Members were
        arranged (with the exception of one Conservative and one Labour Member
interposed) by Party - Labour on the left, Conservative on the right!
The video monitor had been turned through 90° so that each 'side of the
House1 had an equal view. This seating arrangement set the tone for the
presentation.

'Public' response to the presentation was devalued by posturing and
rhetoric on all sides but, interestingly, I spoke to five members
individually after the presentation (three Conservative, two Labour) and
each warmly welcomed the input.

The most surprising volte face was by Joe Ashton who repeated 'in
public' much of the invective that he has become famous for since the
disaster, e.g. "the police have got to carry the can when they throw
their weight about in deciding how football is going to be run and when
it all goes wrong". The strength and monotonous persistence of
Mr Ashton's remarks actually caused one Conservative member to throw down
his papers and storm out of the Committee Room. However, Ashton
actually returned to the Committee Room, 10 minutes after everyone else
had left and whilst I was clearing my maps and photographs away. On
this occasion he expressed his gratitude for my visit, hoped that I
hadn't taken anything he had said personally and conceded that the
issues surrounding the disaster were complex ones. ".... but you can't
blame us MPs for looking for simple solutions". I likened the
Hillsborough disaster to the story of the blindfolded men feeling
different parts of the elephant - everyone can get a different impression
of the same beast if they don't take care to gather all the evidence.

Tom Pendry (Lab) stated that his Committee would be speaking with Lord
Justice Taylor next week and thought the presentation was useful as a
prelude to that meeting. This comment apart, much of what Pendry said,
'publicly*, suggests that he has already made up his mind where blame
for the disaster lies - with the South Yorkshire Police.

On the other hand, David Evans (Con) was scathing about the attitude of
Sheffield Wednesday FC both before and after the disaster. Menzies
Campbell (Con) confided that in his view Taylor   had got it all wrong
and, as far as he was concerned, he intended to  try to put the record
straight.

Alan Meall (Lab) thought the presentation was some sort of propaganda
exercise and wanted to know what the other 68^ hours of evidence
depicted before he would adopt a position on what he had been shown.
Keith Vaz (Lab) walked out before the end of the video!

All in all an interesting day, but I doubt whether any opinions have
been changed.

Mr Shersby left the presentation for an audience with the Home
Secretary, Mr David Waddington, (discussing the issue of police rent
allowance). When he returned to the House, Mr Shersby mentioned
privately that he had taken the opportunity to discuss the Hillsborough
disaster presentation with the Home Secretary who expressed interest in
seeing the video tape. Mr Shersby expects to see you at a Police
Federation Dinner planned for 9 November 1989.    For your information he
intends to raise this matter with you at this time.
You will be aware that the debate on the Taylor Inquiry Report has now
been postponed until the new year when the Final Report is published.
At least two Conservative MPs expressed disappointment that the debate
was not more imminent as they believed the passage of time will diminish
the impact of their 'promised' attack upon the findings of the Interim
Report.

       Dear Mr Wright

       HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY

       I refer to my telephone conversation with Mr Hayes this
       morning when he indicated that you were shortly to attend a
       meeting of the South Yorkshire Police Authority.  He felt that
       members of the Authority might raise questions relating to the
       policing of Hillsborough Stadium on the 15th April 1989.
       Mr Hayes was aware that certain matters of potential concern
       had been revealed by evidence given to the Inquiry conducted
       by Lord Justice Taylor and mentioned in his subsequent interim
       report.

       Whilst clearly the concern of the members may be quite proper
       I am firmly of the view that it would be wrong to make any
       comment at this stage upon the contents of the report. As you
       know following the publication of this report the Director of
       Public Prosecutions requested a full police investigation into
       the possibility of criminal charges being brought.  That
       Inquiry is continuing and is not expected to be completed
       until the new year. The investigation is, of course, being
       supervised by the Police Complaints Authority.

       In my view, any public comment would be improper and could
       prejudice not only the current investigation but also any
       possible subsequent criminal proceedings.




Fax 01-222-4751                             Telex 945310 CPS HQ                                   Britdoc DX2328 Victoria
I feel that any public comment should be reserved until after
either the conclusion of any criminal proceedings or the
Director's decision, if it be so, not to institute a
prosecution.

Yours faithfully

Dear Sir

Report to Police Authority

We are asked to advise on the extent to which it is appropriate
for you to respond to questions raised by the Police Authority
where such questions m ay bear upon issues which remain to be
determined in the Courts of England and Wales.

    power of the Police Authority to require a report from the
Chief Constable is contained in Section 12(ii) Police Act,
1964, as follows:                                            ’

 (ii)  The Chief Constable of a police force shall, whenever so
required by the Police Authority, submit to that Authority a
report m   writing on such matters as may be specified in the
requirement, being matters connected with the policing of the
area for which the Force is maintained."

You will note that a written report is all that can legally be
required  and   it   follows   that  there  is no  duty upon    the
Chief Constable    to  respond   orally   to questions put   at   a
meeting.  Moreover, there does not appear to be any requirement
to provide a report unless this is requested by "the Police
Authority   so that unless questions of individual members are
subsequently authorised as being the questions of the Authority
as a whole, there is no requirement to respond to them at all.

Deputy Chief Constable,

 It would seem to follow, although this is not specifically
 stated in the Section,    that a requirement from the Police
 Authority must be made in w riting since the statute can hardly
 have contemplated a joint oral request from all or a m aj o ri t y
 of the members of the Authority.

 If a report is properly required by the Police Authority, then
 a  response   must  be  made  subject   to  the  provisions  of
 Section 12(iii) Police Act, 1964, which provides as follows:

 w (iii)  If it appears to the Chief Constable that a report in
 compliance with any such requirement of the Police Authority
 would contain information w h ic h in the public interest ought
 not to be disclosed, or is not needed for the discharge of the
 functions   of  the  Police  Authority,   he  may  request that
 Authority to refer the requirement to the Secretary of State;
 and in any such case the requirement shall be of no effect
 unless it is confirmed by the Secretary of State."

 It might well be thought that it would not be in the public
 interest for information to be disclosed which could have a
 prejudicial effect on subsequent Court proceedings, and on
 these grounds the Chief Constable might think it appropriate to
 refer any requirement to the Secretary of State if the response
 might be thought to have some prejudicial effect.

 Moreover, you should not overlook the possible effect of the
 Contempt of Court Act, 1981, about which we gave some advice in
 our letter of 20th April, 1989.

 The  position  now  is  that  a date   has  been set for  the
 commencement of the civil action, namely 19th June, 1990, and
 it follows that "arrangements have been made for a hearing"
 within the meaning of the Contempt of Court Act.

 The consequence is that there will be strict liability under
 the Act for anyone making a statement which could prejudice the
 fair trial of the action.    You may well take the view that a
 public statement which bore upon the training, experience and
 efficiency  of  the officers   in charge of   the policing   of
 Hillsborough on 15th April, 1989 could prejudice a fair trial
 of the action.

 Quite aside from the foregoing, it must be kept in mind that
 there will at some time be a Coroner's Inquest into the events
 of 15th April, 1989 and that the West Midlands Police are
 conducting a criminal enquiry encompassing those events.      It
 seems to us a matter o f justice, fairness and common sense that
 no public statement should be made by the Chief Constable which
 might pre-judge the results of the Inquest or the criminal
 enquiry unless there is a legal duty to make such a statement,
 which, for the reasons given above, we do not think there is.

  Perhaps you will kindly let us know if we can assist further.

SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE AUTHORITY


17 NOVEMBER 1989




REPORT OF THE CHIEF CONSTABLE


ACTIONS OF THE SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE FOLLOWING THE
PUBLICATION OF LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR'S INTERIM REPORT


1.    Introduction

1.1   In the wake of the disaster which occurred at Hillsborough Stadium,
      Sheffield, on 15 April 1989, a Public Inquiry was commissioned to enquire
      into the events and to make recommendations about the needs of crowd
      control and safety at sports events.     The Inquiry was chaired by Lord
      Justice Taylor and it sat from 15 May until 14 July 1989.

1.2   Lord Justice Taylor published his Interim Report on 4 August    1989,  in
      which he made 43 interim recommendations.   He emphasised that these were
      designed to prevent overcrowding and crushing on terraced areas in the
      short term,  and that long term recommendations fell to be considered in
      his Final Report. A copy of the recommendations is appended.


2.    Implementation of Recommendations

2.1   The recommendations contained in Lord Justice Taylor's Interim Report
      included many which were already identified as necessary in the light of
      the events at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989.   The South Yorkshire Police
      were therefore well prepared to ensure that they were swiftly implemented
      at the five football league grounds in the County.

2.2   The Chief Constable nominated Mr P Hayes QPM LLB MA, Deputy         Chief
      Constable, to liaise personally with the management of each football club
       and with each local authority concerned in respect of future crowd
       safety.  Mr Hayes met with directors and secretaries of all five South
      Yorkshire   football   league   clubs on 24 August      1989   and   with
      representatives of the four local authorities on 18 September 1989.

2.3   To progress the recommendations of the Taylor Report the Deputy      Chief
      Constable  appointed an 'Implementation Team' which included the local
      ground commanders who have a responsibility for policing each of the five
       football league clubs in the County,      and officers with specialist
      knowledge in such areas as communications,   CCTV and training.   The team
      has met under the Deputy Chief Constable's chairmanship on seven
      occasions  since 4 August 1989 and each of the recommendations which
      places a responsibility with the police has been implemented at all
      football league grounds.   Those recommendations which were asterisked by
      Lord Justice Taylor,     signifying their immediate need,       were each
      implemented by 18 August - just two weeks after the publication of the
      Taylor Report and before the start of the current league programme.
      Furthermore,  it is pleasing to be able to report that, with the positive
      co-operation   of   the football clubs,      signed   written   agreements
between   the clubs and the police,       setting out    their   respective
responsibilities for crowd safety, have been drawn up.

The   South   Yorkshire  Police have also addressed      the remaining
recommendations for which they are not directly responsible. A report
concerning these matters has been forwarded to each of the local
authorities who have a responsibility for safety certification at
football grounds.

A copy of each written agreement together with a summary of the action
taken on all relevant recommendations in relation to that football ground
is appended.


The Responsibilities of the Local Authorities for Safety at
Sports Grounds

Any local authority within whose area there exists a sports stadium
designated under the Safety at Sports Grounds Act 1975 (as amended) is
responsible for the issue of a Safety Certificate in respect of that
stadium.   Each of the local authorities of Rotherham, Barnsley and
Doncaster have a responsibility for one football league ground, Sheffield
has a responsibility for two.

The certifying authorities are called upon by the Taylor Report to
immediately review each Safety Certificate, ensure that the operative
conditions of the Certificate are complied with, then add or substitute
any condition shown to be necessary by the findings and recommendations
of the Taylor Report.

The centrally directed police 'Implementation Team1 has achieved as much
as it can by independent action.       The local authorities in South
Yorkshire, which each have a responsibility under the Safety of Sports
Grounds Act, have been provided with a comprehensive report of what the
police have so far achieved.     Where it has not been possible for the
South   Yorkshire   Police   to fully    implement   any   recommendation
unilaterally,   proposals are offered to the responsible certifying
authority of how the recommendation might be progressed.


Increased Costs for Policing Football Matches

Several of the recommendations in the Interim Report of Lord Justice
Taylor impose additional duties upon the police at football matches. For
example,  (i) the deployment of police officers, to each gate in a
perimeter fence, authorised to decide whether or not to allow spectators
through a gate to relieve overcrowding;      (ii) the deployment of a
reserve of police officers to each match who are not committed to any
specific duty and are therefore able to deal with any unforeseen
difficulties which arise inside or outside the ground;   and,  (iii) the
deployment of a sufficient number of skilled operators in the police
control room to enable all radio transmissions to be received, evaluated
and answered and to enable all the results of CCTV recording outside and
inside the ground to be monitored and interpreted.

It is obvious from the implementation of these three recommendations
alone that the cost of policing football matches will be greater than
ever before.
Members will be aware that a proportion of policing costs is met by the
football clubs themselves.     At present the financial contribution is
determined by reference to a sliding scale of charges agreed annually
between the Police Authority, the Chief Constable and each of the clubs,
based upon a prior estimate of crowd size for a particular game.   In the
two seasons 1987/88 and 1988/89 the total cost of policing the five
football clubs in South Yorkshire, both inside and outside the grounds,
amounted to some £1.83 million and, of this figure, the clubs contributed
£398,000 which amounts to 22% of the overall cost.

In the light of Lord Justice Taylor's recommendations many Police
Authorities are now reassessing the charges levied on football clubs for
special police services.

The facility to charge for police officers in these circumstances is
provided by Section 15 of the Police Act 1964, which enables the Chief
Constable, at his discretion, to provide, on request, special police
services at any premises or in any locality in the police area.    The
section further empowers the Police Authority to charge for these
services.

There is no precise definition of the term 'special police services' but
the case of Harris -v- Sheffield United Football Club 1986 held that the
Chief Constable is not, as part of his normal policing responsibility,
obliged to provide officers to react to potential breaches of the peace
where the owner of private property creates such a risk on his property.

It would seem, therefore, that officers provided to meet such a risk, as
in the case of a football match, are within the meaning of special police
services and can be charged for.     Indeed, Police Authorities have a
fiduciary duty to the ratepayers of their area to make such charges.

The Harris case, however, does not fully resolve which officers can be
regarded as performing special police services.    It held that the fact
that officers were deployed on private property was significant in
tending to show their provision amounted to special police services, but
did not deal with the question of officers deployed to perform duties
outside the ground - duties that arise directly from the event which is
occurring inside the ground.   Legal opinion has, therefore, been sought
for clarification as to which duties performed by police officers at
football matches can properly be regarded as 'special police services'.

Notwithstanding the question of payment for police deployment outside
football grounds it is submitted that the level of contribution from the
clubs presently falls significantly short of the actual cost of officers
inside the ground, and that the shortfall is set to widen in the light of
the Taylor recommendations which necessitate an increase in the number of
police officers deployed at football matches.


Criminal Investigation of South Yorkshire Police Officers

During   the    course of the Hillsborough Inquiry     the question  of
manslaughter   by the criminal negligence of SouthYorkshire Police
officers was    raised by counsel for the bereaved, Mr Benet Hytner QC.

Because this matter was not dealt with in the Report of the Hillsborough
Inquiry the Chief Constable, on the morning of the Report's publication,
referred it     to the Director of Public Prosecutions, asking for his
                                     - 4 -

      decision on the question of criminal liability of any member of the South
      Yorkshire   Police.   It was considered appropriate, at that time, to
      suspend from duty the police commander of the Hillsborough event, Chief
      Superintendent David Duckenfield, pending the outcome of the Director's
      deliberations.   Mr Duckenfield remains suspended.

5.3   On 15 August 1989, the Director wrote to the Chief Constable setting out
      his view    that the matter should be subject of a full          criminal
      investigation.    The West Midlands Police had already done considerable
      work in gathering evidence for Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry.   It seemed
      sensible,   therefore, to invite Mr Geoffrey Dear QPM DL LLB, Chief
      Constable   of the West Midlands Police Force,        to undertake   this
      investigation.    His report, in due course, will be submitted to the
      Director of Public Prosecutions.


6.    Matters of Complaint and Discipline

6.1   Additionally, the Chief Constable has asked that if, during the course of
      their investigation, the West Midlands Police officers discover any
      matters which might suggest that offences were committed against the
      Police (Discipline) Regulations, of a non-criminal nature, those offences
      should be brought to his attention and, where appropriate, be enquired
      into by the West Midlands Police on behalf of the South Yorkshire Police.
      This is agreed.

6.2   There are currently seven matters of public complaint about the actions
      of South Yorkshire Police officers, arising from the Hillsborough
      incident.

6.3   Three of these matters have been raised by a single complainant.      Two
      relate to the actions of the senior officers in command of the policing
      operation at Hillsborough on the day and these are being supervised by
      Captain E Noel Taylor of the Police Complaints          Authority.    The
      investigation of these complaints is being conducted by Mr Geoffrey Dear,
      Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police, along with the criminal
      matters. The third complaint is of incivility and is being investigated,
      unsupervised by the Police Complaints Authority, by Superintendent Ashton
      of the South Yorkshire Police.

6.4   A fourth complaint is that an officer at the perimeter fence contributed
      to the death of the complainant's son by his failure to open the fence
      gate in good time.

6.5   A fifth complaint is that the failure by South Yorkshire Police officers
      to open perimeter fence gates caused the complainant to sustain injury.

6.6   A sixth complaint is made by a man who alleges that he was assaulted by a
      police officer whilst attending the football match.

6.7   These latter three cases are again to be investigated by Mr Dear's team
      and are likewise being supervised by Captain E Noel Taylor of the Police
      Complaints Authority.

6.8   There is a seventh complaint of corruption, namely of police officers
      offering to allow fans into the ground on payment.   This complaint is
      being investigated by Superintendent Carlisle of the Greater Manchester
      Police.
Coroner's Inquest Regarding the 95 Deaths Which Arose

The   gathering of evidence on behalf of HM Coroner,          Dr   Stefan
Popper LLB BMedSci BM BS MRCGP, in relation to the 95 deaths that
occurred at Hillsborough, is continuing by the West Midlands Police.

The Coroner opened the inquests on 19/20 April 1989, and adjourned them
to a date to be fixed.      He had set aside three months to hear the
inquests beginning in January 1990.    I understand, however, that the
Director of Public Prosecutions has recently written to Dr Popper
requesting that the inquests be deferred until after the results of the
on-going criminal investigation are concluded.


Civil Actions

To date eight writs have been served upon the South      Yorkshire Police
alleging negligence by its officers on 15 April 1989,    leading to loss,
injury, damage and, in two cases, death.

The writs are to be defended by the Police Authority's insurers,
Municipal Mutual Insurance Company. It is understood that three of these
actions will be representative actions.

The presiding Northern Circuit Judge, Mr Justice Rose, has taken personal
charge of the interlocutory proceedings.      At a Directions Hearing on
26 October 1989 at the High Court in Manchester Mr Justice Rose set the
date for commencement of the civil actions for 11 June 1990.     At that
hearing Mr Justice Rose expressed his satisfaction regarding the work
done by all parties to the claims to achieve a state of readiness for
trial.


The Effects of the Hillsborough Disaster on the Health
and Welfare of the Force

Twenty-three officers reported injuries sustained in the rescue of people
from the Leppings Lane terraces. These injuries were, in the main, minor
strains and bruising to backs and limbs.

A total of 58 officers subsequently took sick leave which was directly
attributable to the disaster in the weeks which followed the event,
mainly due to the effects of shock and stress. As a result, 356 working
days were lost.

Two officers remain on sick leave, suffering from stress, one of whom may
well retire from the Force on the grounds of ill-health in the near
future.

During week ending 2 3 April 1989 - the week immediately following the
disaster - only 92 officers had taken sick leave, compared with 101 in
the corresponding week in 1988.     The figure rose to a maximum of 143
officers taking sick leave during week ending 30 April 1989, compared
with 107 in 1988.    By week ending 21 May 1989, however,   the number of
officers   taking sick leave had fallen to       105 which corresponded,
identically, with the same period in 1988.

Any effects that the Hillsborough disaster had upon the health and
welfare of the Force appear, largely, to have been short lived. It is
      thought that this is, to a significant extent, due to the efforts of the
      Force Welfare Officer and our Consultant Counsellor who started their
      work at the ground within hours of the tragedy occurring.   The memories
      of the disaster, and the emotions evoked by it, will remain with many
      officers for a long time.  The Force as a whole, however, has adjusted
      well,


10.   Recommended

10.1 The   Police   Authority note the efforts made       to   implement  the
     recommendations of the Interim Report of Lord Justice Taylor, insofar as
     they relate to the police.

10.2 The Police Authority accept, in principle, the need to review in detail
     and, if necessary, re-negotiate the basis for recovering the costs of
     providing special police services to the football clubs in South
     Yorkshire.

10.3 The Police Authority note -that "'the relevant' local authorities, are
     responsible for the implement at ion of any outstanding recommendations,
     and for the enforcement of new or existing conditions of '''trite' Safety
                      in respect of ''each football stadium.

10.4 The Police Authority note the progress of the on-going         criminal
     investigation, the civil litigation and the Coroner's Inquiry arising
     from the disaster at Hillsborough. Further reports will be submitted in
     due course.

NOTE FOR FILE:


POLICE AUTHORITY REPORT RE. HILLSBOROUGH


Spoke with Peter Metcalf this date regarding the types of questions likely to
be posed by Sheffield members and the advice we have received from Stephen
Walker.

(1)   With regard to the comment in the Report about the inverse proportion of
      evidence, Mr Metcalf describes this as a 'throw away line1 too general in
      nature to be capable of any precise meaning. Certain senior officers
      were praised by the Judge during the Inquiry and to base deep
      implications on this single comment is unrealistic.


(2)   With regard to the Chief Constable's decision to move officers, one could
       comment from the standpoint that it would not have been fair to leave
       officers in positions where they would be again performing duties in
       respect of which they were subject to criticism.  This makes sense of
       Superintendent Marshall remaining in post.


(3)   As a general comment - Mr Metcalf is aware of both Stephen Walker's
       'Note' and mine - he thinks it would be wrong to comment on matters which
       even broadly look back to what occurred on 15 April or the planning
       arrangements in advance of that.

      Mr Metcalf   makes the further point that:-

      (a)   there is an absolute certainty of a Coroner's Inquiry   into the cause
            of the 95 deaths;

      (b)   there is the likelihood of civil proceedings when in addition to
            Lord Justice Taylor's observations another High Court Judge will
             consider and pronounce on these same issues; and,

      (c)   there is the possibility of a criminal enquiry when both judge and
             jury will be considering these same matters.

In the light of this it is considered that comments which touch on the crux of
these issues by the Chief Constable may be contemptuous but even if that point
is not reached then would certainly be unwise.

I informed Mr Metcalf he is acting officially and that we are referred to him
by Stephen Walker who will fund the advice provided.

Mr Metcalf will fax a 'Note' of the above to us by this afternoon.


At 10.40 am spoke with Mervyn Jones who makes the point that on advice from
the Director's Office he is not releasing statements or any information to any
third party until all of it has been seen and considered for a decision
regarding criminal proceedings.
                                    - 2 -


At 10.55 am spoke with Mr Colin Cleugh of the Director's Office who stated
that any comments which may be attributed to any person who may be subject of
the on-going criminal investigation, either directly or remotely, may well be
regarded as very prejudicial at this time and should not be made.

I advised him of the sort of peripheral comment the Sheffield members may
start with and he saw any response to those as being unwise.

Mr Cleugh agreed to fax his advice which could be used to give the Chief
Constable some protection at the meeting scheduled for tomorrow.

Here is the requested letter of advice. I am also sending with
this fax a copy of a further letter from David Phillips as regards
some additional information which he would like to have,

Appreciating that the Hillsborough "team" has now been disbanded,
1 wonder if it would toe possible for some enquiries to be made on
the point raised in the second paragr a p h ,______

         Dear Sir                      .                                    :

         Report to P o l i c e ■Authority

         We axe asked to advise on the extent to which it is appropriate
         tor y o u to respond to questions raised by the Police" Authority
         j ere such questions may bear upon issues which remain to be
         determined is the Courts of England and Wales,

         T h e ■power of the Police Authority to require a report from the
         Uiiel Constable is contained in Section 12'(ii) Police Act,
         I9b4, as followsi          _         ■                          ?

          Cii)  The Chief Constable of a police force shall, whenever so
         required by the Police Authority, submit    to that Aut
         report in writing on such matters as may-'be specified in the
         requirement, being matters' connected with the policing of the
         area for which the Fores is maintained."

        You will note .that a written report is all that" can legally be
        required and it follows . that there is no duty upon the
         “i , Constable     to respond orally    to questions put at a
        meeting.     Moreover, there does not appear to be any requirement
        a P ro,V l'
                  “ f a report unless this is requested by "the Police
        Authority     so that unless .questions of individual members are
        subsequently authorised as being the questions of the Authority
        as a whole, there is no requirement to respond to them at a l l /

           S a « c o l l a t e d a joint oral A q u . t                  frora all or a majority
           of the members of the Authority,
           If a report is properly required by the Police Authority, then
           a  response   imjst be  made  subject   to  the  provisions  of
           Section 12(iii) Police Act, 1964, which provides as fellows:

           "(iii)  If it appears to the Chief Constable that a repor*, in
           compliance with any such requirement ^of the ^ Police Authority
           would contain information which in the public ^interest ought
           not to be disclosed, or is not needed for the discharge of trie
           functions  of  the   Police  Authority, he may     request ^ that
           Authority to refer   the requirement to the Secretaj
           and in any such case the requirement shall be of no effect
           unless it is confirmed by the Secretary of State*”

      .• It might well be thought that it would not be in the p
         interest for information to be disclosed which could have a
         prejudicial effect on subsequent Court proceedings, and on
         these grounds the Chief Constable might think .
         refer any requirement to the Secretary of State if the response
         might be thought to have some prejudicial effect,

           Moreover, you should not overlook the possible           of the
           Contempt of Court Act, 1981, about which we gave some advice in
           our letter of 20th A p r i l , 1989 -

       , The  position  now  is  that  a data   has been     set  for   the
       j commencement of the civil action, name ly 19th J u n e » 1990, and
         it follows that "arrangements have been made for a h e a r i n g ”
         within the meaning of the Contempt of Court A c t *

       , The consequence is that there will be strict liability under
       i the Act for anyone making a statement which could prejudice the
         fair trial of the action.    You may well take the view that a
         public statement which bore upon the training, experience and
                 c , of  the  officers in charge of the policing of
         Hillsborough on 15th April, 1989 could prejudice a fair trial
         of the action.

    HAMMOND SUDDABDS

      Quits aside from the foregoing, it must be kept in mind that
      there will at some time be a Coroner’s Inquest into the events
      of 15th A p r i l , 1989 and that the West Midlands Police are
      conducting a criminal enquiry encompassing those events.         It
      seems to us a natter of justice, fairness and common sense that
      no public statement should be made by the Chief Coii3rs M - which
      might pre-judge the results of the Inquest or the criminal
      e n q u ir y unless there is a legal duty to make such a statement,
      which* for the reasons given above# we do not think there is.

      Perhaps you will kindly let us know if we c s m           a^pist further.

      Tt. is a c r i m i n a l o iffence, u s u a l l y c h a r g e d as c o n t e m p t of Court, to

            Dear Mr Wright

        "HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY

         I refer to my telephone conversation with Mr Hayes this
         morning when he indicated that you were shortly to attend a
         meeting of the South Yorkshire Police Authority. He felt that
         members of the Authority might raise questions relating to the
         policing of Hillsborough Stadium on the 15th April 1989.
         Mr Hayes was aware that certain matters of potential concern
         had been revealed by evidence given to the Inquiry conducted
         by Lord Justice Taylor and mentioned in his subsequent interim
         report.

         Whilst clearly the concern of the members may be quite proper
         I am firmly of the view that it would be wrong to make any
         comment at this stage upon the contents of the report. As you
         know following the publication of this report the Director of
         Public Prosecutions requested a full police investigation into
         the possibility of criminal charges being brought. That
         Inquiry is continuing and is not expected to be completed
         until the new year. The investigation is, of course , being
         supervised by the Police Complaints Authority.

         In my view, any public comment would be improper and could
         prejudice not only the current investigation but also any
         possible subsequent criminal proceedings.

Director’s decision, if it be so, not to institute a
prosecution.

                                                           15 November 1989


NOTE FOR FILE:


TAYLOR INQUIRY - INTERIM REPORT


Had a discussion this date with Stephen Walker (Joint Secretariat) who has
spoken with Sheffield members about the questions they require the Chief
Constable to comment upon in relation to the findings in the Interim Report.

They will very probably not ask direct questions of the type referred to below
at the Police Authority meeting on Friday 17 November but refer to them
broadly and ask that the information be made available by way of a further
report.

None of the other three Districts has identified specific questions they would
wish answering.


Issues to be addressed in due course - possibly by way of further report

a.   Is the Chief Constable considering carefully the implications of the
     findings especially with regard to the effectiveness of his senior
     management team and is he dealing with these.

     Clive Betts will say that it appears weaknesses have been revealed with
     regard to the quality of some senior officers and will be interested to
     know something of their suitability for the post they hold in terms of
     experience, training, performance monitoring (appraisals), etc.


b.   This is a specific within the general comment above arising from the
     statement in the Report that '...the quality of evidence given by South
     Yorkshire Police officers was in inverse proportion to the rank of the
     giver...'.  Sheffield see this as a powerful criticism and feel it
     possibly indicates that the senior officers concerned were unduly
     defensive of both themselves and the Force, could have been more
     forthcoming, and wonder if at the highest level there has not been some
     kind of 'cover-up'.

     The fact we advised those concerned to be helpful and honest at the
     Inquiry, that apart from advising on likely questions and making
     available all factual evidence to hand (videos, plans, photographs,
     etc.), may well offset the above feelings which I am advised expand
     beyond the Sheffield members.


c.   They would like some explanation as to why certain officers have been
     moved, for example, Mr Jackson, Chief Superintendent Duckenfield,
     Superintendent Murray.

     The point they would make is that if the officers have been moved because
     they are inadequate to deal with the level of command as occurred at
     Hillsborough, then they should not have been there in the first place.
                                    - 2 -


d.   They make much of the comments which emerged to the effect Mr Duckenfield
     deliberately misled senior officials on the day.


e.   They have previously asked if our Operational Orders could be made
     available to the local authorities (ground safety certificate officials)
     before each match and the Chief Constable said he would consider this.

     We now supply these to the Fire and Ambulance Services and it would not
     be a problem to give them to the local authorities but the question to be
     considered is for what purpose do they need this information?

           (iii)   during week commencing 30.10.89 - Implementation Team
                   members to discuss with respective Clubs so as to ensure
                   they cannot claim to be taken by surprise at the Officer
                   Working Group meeting

            (iv)   during week commencing 6.11.89 - letters to be sent with
                   relevant packages to all four local authorities asking for
                   an extraordinary meeting of Officer Working Group to
                   consider same

             (v)   17.11.89 - packages to accompany Police Authority paper re.
                   Hillsborough.




Deputy Chief Constable




copy to A/ACC(Operations)
The first return of the Liverpool supporters to Hillsborough is

likely to be a highly sensitive event both for those who were there

on 15 April, particularly those who suffered loss or injury, and for

my officers who were also affected by the terrible tragedy which

occurred that day.




Whilst the evening of Wednesday 29 November will be an emotional

occasion, its prime purpose is to stage a game of football to be

enjoyed by all who attend.




I know that the police officers on duty at the game will be aware

of the feelings of the Liverpool fans.   They will welcome their

return to Sheffield, and will do all they can to ensure that they

enjoy the occasion.

South Yorkshire Police Authority,

Dear Mr. Walker,
                               Contract for Special Police Services 1989/90

Thank you for your letter dated 26th September 1989 along with three copies of the
contract for Special Police Services.

We are a little concerned that point three appears to give the Police Authority the
right to revise the charging structure without further consultation and agreement
with ourselves. This contravenes the comments made by Mr. Peter Hayes, Deputy Chief
Constable at a meeting held on 24th August last when he clearly stated that any
amendments would be subject to negotiation with the five South Yorkshire Football
League Clubs.

In the circumstances we are somewhat reluctant to sign the agreements as we do not
wish to find ourselves in a situation where unreasonably high charges are being
levied against the company.

If you are able to withdraw or suitably amend point three I feel certain that we
would be prepared to have the contracts signed and returned in accordance with your
requirements.



                                                            Yours faithfully,

The first duty of the Police is always
the protection     of   life.     It   is  the
intention to ensure that the match takes
place without danger or injury to any
person,   to maintain the peace and to
minimise disruption to those not attending
the game.   Crowd safety will be paramount,
all officers must be vigilant at all
times    with    a    view    to   preventing
overcrowding and crowd distress. Positive
action   will   be    taken    to  deal   with
outbreaks    of   public    disorder   thereby
enabling early resolution.          Damage to
property    and   unlawful    obstruction   of
the highway will be prevented.

We will endeavour at all times to ensure
that the intention is achieved with a
high standard of discipline, smartness
and professionalism,  so as to reflect
the best possible image of the South
Yorkshire Police.

         command purposes as shown at 1.3 of this
         Operational Order.

3.2      CONTROL

         The Police will maintain control                     at    all
         times by the following means:

3.2.1    The accurate assessment of intelligence
         relating    tothe patterns of arrival at
         or   departure    from   the Stadium  by
         supporters.

3.2.2.   By positioning an   adequate number of
         police resources  at   strategic points
                    to:-

         (i)    Provide information and intelligence
         to Oakwell    Control  relative   to crowd

         and from the stadium.

3.2.3    The segregation of supporters travelling
         to and from the stadium by means of
         separate   and distinct routes of arrival
         and departure    for both   vehicular and
         pedestrian   traffic.  Such   routes  will
         be controlled and supervised at all times
         by police.

         any   developing   situation.     In   such
         circumstances,   whilst  adhering   to  the
        overall plan, there will always be        the
        need   for   individual   officers   to   use
        initiative    and   be flexible   in   their
        response   to   any  developing situation.


3.2.6   At the conclusion of the game, visiting
        supporters may be held back at the stadium
        for a short period, in order to enable
        home supporters to clear   the area.     The
        decision   as   to whether or not      these
        supporters are to be held back will be
        made by the Officer in Command, who will
        give due consideration to, the numbers
        involved,     crowd   safety   and     crowd
        behaviour.     The "hold back" policy for
        the day    will   be communicated   to all
        officers prior      to the termination    of
        play.

3.2.7   Police   resources   deployed  throughout
        the operation will be directly relevant
        to the number of supporters anticipated,

        potential for disorder.

Intensive               Therapy.           I then went                down      to    the    A + E department,                  and

realised            I would          be    b est      employed           supervising              in the       Intensive           Care

Soon         afterwards,             approximately                  1630       hr/,    my    first       patient        arrived,

rny a t t e n t i o n         to    supervise             their       treatment,            ensuring       that        each     one    had

an    experienced                  doctor       with       them.

Patient            29    (Adam S P E A R E T T )           was     transferred              to a    cubicle        in     the

Intensive               Care Unit.              However,           we    soon        needed      tha t    cubicle         for      another

patient            as    the       I.T.U.      was        now     full     (with       10 v e n t i l a t e d     patients).              The

body         was    then       transferred                to    the     Doctors        Office       as    it was        the     only

space         available.               I do         not    know when            it w a s     removed       from        t her e .

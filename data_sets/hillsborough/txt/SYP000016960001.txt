20th April, 1989

Peter Robinson Esq.
Chief Executive
Liverpool Football Club
Anfield     Jg -*•
Liverpool




Dear Mr. Robinson,

I would like to express my heartfelt condolences on behalf of the company to all
those supporters and friends of Liverpool Football Club who so tragically lost
their lives at the F.A. Cup Semi-Final at Hillsborough last Saturday.

I attended the game with my father and experienced the crush and panic outside
the ground at entrance A and B at the Lemmings Lane end, before the kick-off and
during the fateful five minutes after commencement of      play. I am therefore
startled at the comments   I have recently heard and read in the media since that
tragic day.

I am under no illusion whatsoever that the crowd control before the game was
totally inadequate and in my opinion the action of some of the mounted police
immediately before and during the opening five minutes of the game only served
to heighten tension and anxiety amongst the supporters queuing at this
particular entrance.

The purpose of my letter   is two fold. One to express     my deepest sympathy tothe
families of the bereaved   and to make myself available    as a witness for the
public enquiry. I would also like to commend the Board and members of
Liverpool’s playing staff who have handled a difficult and tragic situation with
great respect and dignity, particularly when other interested parties seem to
have issued statements which have only hindered and inflamed a tragic period in
Liverpool’s recent history.

Yours sincerely




          Marketing Manager

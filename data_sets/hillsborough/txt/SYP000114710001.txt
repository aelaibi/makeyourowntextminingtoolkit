Lang ,and PC.- .3232 B u r t o n              took up positions               at turn s t i l e s A and B .

When      the    turn s t i l e s    opened there were                 not m a n y fans        outside       the

g r o u n d and      prior       to entering          the g r o u n d were          subject      to a search and

w ere     then subject            to a further            search       once    inside       the ground-            Due     to

this      double       searching         of    Fans    I anticipated            that       there w o u l d    be some

objections           or a d v e r s e    comment       regarding         this       but neither were

for'thcoming at             this     time.

As the morn i n g           p r o g r e s s e d and the         number     of fans         i n creased     I saw

several         fans a t t e m p t      to gain entry            to the ground via t u r n s t i l e s A and

■B, only to be told                 by the       turnstile         operator         that    they were at           the

wrong        turnstile.           The y then had to              force     their way back            towards         the

other        turn s t i l e s    on Le pipings Lane             end.     Around        1.00 pm     < T 3 0 0 ) the

number        of fans       outside        the    ground        had g r e a t l y    increased and we then

had to be rnore se 1e ctive                    in our      searj£+Ti ng .       Ar o                      (1430)       a

turnstiles           A to Gj        thev/were         instructed          to get       down and were          ejected

from the ground                 by other       officers.

At    this      time    there were            several      hundred        people       hanging a r o u n d       the

ar e a    of the       t u r n s t i l e s and due        to the amount             of fans      now entering

the      gr o u n d were        asked    to move       from that         area t o / a l 1ow fans           in.

Several         people who          had ente r e d the           g r o u n d y t o m p J . Q i n q j i . ■%&&% people at

the      back    of the         crowd were       pushing         towards       the front,          and   that      the

Po l i c e    should      be aware         of this.

At    this      I looked         thro u g h the       turns t i l e s    towards L e p p i n g s Lane,

a l t h o u g h my view was             restr i c t e d   I could see           officers         on foot and on

hor s e b a c k who a p p e a r e d        to be a t t e m p t i n g     to    control       the    surge     towards

the      turnstiles.

People        were     now s t r u g g l i n g   to enter         the    ground and          in fact were            being
                                                                                                                   PAGE
                                                                                                                   R398

pushed        into the wall          and turnstile              e n t rance       itself.        Man y fans were

now    c o m p l aining      that    someone w o u l d          be     injured,        and all      o f f icers at

ths    turns t i l e s    sh o u l d go outside.                All     fans were         informed       that

officers        inside       had a task          to    perform and that officers                      outside would

be doing        everything          possible          to a l l e v i a t e    the    problem.

Artmnd 2.40pm            I saw that         several          fans     had a g a i n oSriTmbed the            outer

wall    and were         dn top of the            tur n s t i l e     entrance         roof,     they were

i n s t r u c t e d 'to get     down.       This       they flatly            refused 'to do.            I saw two

yogiths on the           roof    showing         their       tickets         to Police       officers        they were

again     inst r u c t e d to get         off     the      roof,      but a gain         refused..

By now many           fans    had    c o n g r e g a t e d a r o u n d the        turnstiles and several

offic e r s     including myself were                    being       s u r r o u n d e d by fans who were

being abus i v e         towards       us because            they     had been sub j e c t e d          to the      crush

o utside       the    turnstiles.           Fans were           now     being a l l o w e d      into    the      ground
     ;
w ith o u t    the    ticket     stubs      being        torn off         (this      I presumed was              to allow

quicker        entry)     and    these were            being      passed tp**'rans on the                 roof who        in

turn began to throw 'them over                         the wall         to fans a w a i t i n g       entry.

It had        now got     to the       stage where            s e arching was            impossible        due to the

amount        of fans     cong r e g a t i n g    inside        the     turnstile         are a and together

w i t h several        other     officers we a t t e m p t e d               to   clear      the area.           This was

met with verbal              h o s t i l i t y towards        the Police and many                  fans appeared

to be     losing       their     tempers. .

1 formed        the    o p i n i o n that    before         too      long a Police           officer       w ould    be

physically a ssaulted,                and    due       to the        fact     that     only serial         14 was

deployed        in that area,           had an officer                bean a s s a u l t e d     then a s sistance

would     have       been very       limited and the                 s i t u a t i o n got   out of hand.

Thankfully           this did not         occur.

I feel        that at     least 2. further               serials        should have          been d e p loyed        in

the area.            Whilst     speaking wit h several                    fans      .1 was a p p r o a c h e d    by a

m a n who      stated     that      he was a M e r s e y s i d e         Police        officer,       he said that
                                                                                                                    PAGE-:
                                                                                                                    R398

s o mething       had to        be done        outside        or    people would          be    injured-.          He

appreciated          the    pressure we were                  under       but    something       had to be done

an d f a s t .

I informed him that                    the    o f f icers      outside          the    ground        w o u l d be doing

everything;, p o s s i b l e .           At this        he     left and went into the                  ground

without      formally           i dentifying         Himself         to rne „

Fans we re st i 11          congregating             round the area               inside       'the t urnstiles              arid

I made      several        request           for them to move awa y to a llow                        people    to get

t hro u g h the      turftsti 1 es as. this              in itself was                creating a problem                for

fans entering             the     ground.         I saw        fans      climbing over the              turnstile and

entering S at a time                    but was      unable         to    prevent       this due       to the       number

of fans a r o u n d the            turnstiles.               These       people       just d-isapp^arfed into

the    crowd

Shortly       b e f o r e 3 . 0 0 pm     (1300)      the m a i n exit                    situated        near to

turnstile         G suddenly            opened and fans              bega^V to surge            into the ground,

several       officers          from the serial               ran t o w a r d s 'the      gate and          I joined

them     in an ef f o r t         to    close     the    gate       <1 was of the          o p i n i o n that       the

gate     had been for c e d open by fans)                           but this was          impossible.

As the      fans     su r g e d    into the ground,                 many    chanting as          they       ran,    I

turned and         saw a gap            in the     centre          of the       fans and       peocae moving             to

the    left and       right.            People were           scr e a m i n g and shouVing,              I went         to

that    area w i t h       other        officers        and    found that             pecwvLe were       on the         floor
                                                                                       ./                  r
having      tripped        or     been pushed over                 in the       rus^s to get         into   the

ground.        These       people were            quic k l y       put on their          feet and m oved away

to the      side walls            a way from the             rush.       Not     one    person       compl a i n e d to

me about         being     injured.

The m aj o r i t y    of    the        fans went, towards                the tunnel       leading        to the

central      enc l o s u r e      but    some     did go to the South side                      of    the West          stand.

Eventually         the     gates were           closed,        some       fans were       still       coming       through

the    turn s t i l e s    but     the       numbers     outside were             greatly       reduced.

Most    of the fans              had gone        into    the       stand and^fefie rear was almost

clear with just a few fans m i l l i n g                           aroofra.

Serial     14 was        then d e p l o y e d         onto    tj^re pitch after a report                of a pitch

invasion.           Ac c e s s    to the       pitcjx'was          gained     via the     gate    leading          from

the S o u t h side          of the West              stand    into       the S outh     stand and walking

down    through the s e a t e d area.                    Wh i l s t w a l k i n g   down the S o u t h stand              I

could see        several          fans       climbing        oy£r    the    perimeter         fene4    onto the

track area a n d            thepe were a large                 number       of fans a l r e a d y on the

pitph.        There were a large                     number    of P o l i c e    officers and          stewards       in

the area       of the        centre          enclosures a s s i s t i n g        fans    to get       out, via the

e m e r g e n c y exit      gates       or    over     the    perimeter         fence.

Some    officers         had      climbed the           perimeter          fence    in an effort            to assist

people     over       the    fence.           I went      over      to the      perimeter       fence       covering

the    central        south enc l o s u r e and              saw that, people had              been    crushed

against       the     perimeter          wall and         fence,         I w ould estimate        that, about 40

to 50 bodies were                 laid up agai n s t           the wall         on top of       one another.

Some who were             in a standing               p o s i t i o n up against        the    fence were          unable

to move,       being        trapped          by the     lower half          of their      body.        Some were

still    b r eathing         but       it was a p p a r e n t       that m any were           dead.

The area a r o u n d the               emergency        exit       gate    of the     centre     south enclosure

was    c o n gested w i t h        people        trying       to get       out and Police         officers

attempting          to get        inside        to    rescue       the    injured.

I looked       towards           the    centre        north enc l o s u r e and saw that               part of the

perimeter        fence       had been           pulled away,             allowing     fans     greater       egress

onto    the    pitch.            1 then       climbed        the    fence     of the     centre       south

e n c l o s u r e and     began        to sway on the              fence    hoping      that    this w ould give

way a n d ^ a f ford greater                 entry     into    the       enclosure.       The    fence       did not

give way and            I climbed            down onto        the    track.         I could see PS           1341

position,         I moved         over    to a s s i s t PS C r a / f o r d and as               I did so the

youth    became        free and d r o p p e d           onto    the   track,            At that    point      the   top

a v o i d any    person      falling        over        it.;,, B y now many             injured and. dead had

been    removed from the               e n closure and were                being a t t e n d e d to by St.

John Ambulance            brigade,        some     fans        had torn down a d v e r t i s i n g            boardings

and were        using    these as make             shift        stre t c h e r s    to remove         people     from

the    pitch,,

I t h e n saw Chief          S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Nesjbit near          the       emergency       exit    gate,

he was     i nstructing           officers         to form a line            either side           of    the gate        to

allow    for quicker           evacuation           of the        injured and dead.

I formed one of the                lines an d a s s i s t e d         in the evacuation,                 handling

many    bodies     none      of w h i c h     X can describe.

After all        the    inju r e d and dead had been                    removed from the                e n closures

and    pitch     I remained          in the area and               joined      several       other       officers

from our        serial,      we were        instr u c t e d by PS C r a w f o r d           to    remain at         that

location until            he had e s t ab l i s h e d the w h e r e a b o u t s            of all       officers

from the        serial«

Seve ral    fans were          going       round and shaking                officers        hands,       thanking

them for what           they      had done.

A me ss a g e was       then      passed over            the    public address             system       by police

control     stating         that     the m a t c h had been abandoned,                      and that fans

would    be a l l o w e d    to    leave      once       emergency         services        had    cleared away

from the ground.               When      the fans were a l l o w e d               to    leave    serial       14 was

 B1 SUB-DIVISION


 AT 09.00am SATURDAY 15th APRIL 1989 I PARADED FOR DUTY AT BARNSLEY POLICE
 STATION FOR THE F A CUP SEMI-PINAL. TOGETHER WITH PS 1341 CRAWFORD AND OTHER
 OFFICERS FROM B1,I TRAVELLED TO HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL GROUND.ON ARRIVAL WB
 WERE BRIEFED BY SENIOR OFFICERS.
 AT 10.50am TOGETHER WITH P S 1341 AND OPPXQERS OF SERIAL 14 WE ATTENDED AT
 THE WEST STAND FOR A FURTHER BRIEFING BY INSPECTOR WHITE,WHO WENT INTO
 DETAIL AS TO THE DUTIES OF SERIAL 14.
 BEFORE KICK OFF SERIAL 14 WAS DEPLOYED ON THE INSIDE OF TURNSTILES A-+G TO
 SEARCH ALL FANS ENTERING THE GROUND.
 KICK OFF WHEN ALL FANS HAD ENTER ED THE GROUND ALL OF SERIAL 14 WAS TO STAND
 BY IN THE'TUNNEL OF TfiE WEST STAND WHICH LEADS TO THE CENTRE ENCLOSURES.
 IN THE EVENT OF THE EMERGENCY EVACUATION PROCEDURE BEING EFFECTED MY DUTY
 WAS TO ATTEND AT THE GATE IN THE FENCE BETWEEN THE CENTRE SOUTH & SOUTH
 ENCLOSURES.
 FOR THE DURATION OF THE MATCH I WAS TO WORK IN COMPANY WITH PC 1002 WILD,AND
 WE BOTH WERE INSTRUCTED BY PS1341 CRAWFORD TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE SNACK BAR
 WHICH WAS SITUATED AT THE REAR OF THE WEST STAND ON THE SOUTH END.


 AFTER BRIEFING BY INSPECTOR WHITE ALL OFFICERS OF SERIAL 14 TOOK UP POSITIONS
 AT TURNSTILES A TO G.PC1002 WILD AND MYSELF AND PC1278 LANG & PC3232 BURTON
 TOOK UP POSITIONS AT TURNSTILES A & B.
 WHEN THE TURNSTILES OPENED THERE WERE NOT MANY FANS OUTSIDE THE GROUND,AND
 PRIOR TO ENTERING THE GROUND WERE SUBJECT TO A SEARCH AND WERE THEN SUBJECT
 TO A FURTHER SERACH ONCE INSIDE THE GROUND.DUE TO THIS DOUBLE SEARCHING OF
 FANS I ANTICIPATED THAT THERE WOULD BE SOME OBJECTIONS OR ADVERSE COMMENT
 REGARDING THIS,BUT NEITHER WERE FORTHCOMING AT THIS TIME.
 AS THE M0HNING PROGRESSED AND THE NUMBER OF FANS INCREASED I SAW SEVERAL
 FANS ATTEMPT TO GAIN ENTRY TO TH     GROUND VIA TURNSTILES A & B ,ONLY TO BE TOLD
 BY THE TURNSTILE OPERATOR THAT THEY WERE AT TH E WRONG TURNSTILES.THEY THEN
 HAD TO FORCE THERE WAY BACK TOWARDS THE OTHER TURNSTILES OR LEPPINGS LANE END.
AROUND T.00pm      THE NUMBER OF FANS OUTSIDE THE GROUND HAD GREATLY INCREASED
AND WE THEN HAD TO BE MORE SELECTIVE IN OUR SEARCHING.AROUND 2.30pm A FEW
 FANS CLIMBED THE PERIMETER WALL AND WERE ST OD ON THE ROOF OF THE TURNSTILES
A TO GfTHEY WERE INSTRUCTED TO GET DOWN AND WERE EJECTED FROM THE GROUND BY
 OTHER OFFICERS.
AT THIS TIME THERE VvERE SEVERAL HUNDRED PEOPLE HANGING AROUND THE AREA OF
 THE TURN;, TILES AND O'UE TO THE AMOUNT OF FANS NOW ENTEREING THEY GROUND WERE
ASKED TO MOVE FROM THAT AREA TO ALLOW FANS IN.
SEVERAL PEOPLE WHO HAD ENTESffi) THE GROUND COMPLAINED THAT PEQS&E AT THE BACK
                                        (2)


* OF THE CROWD WERE PUSHING TOWARDS THE FRONT,AND THAT TKE POLICE SHOULD BE AWARE
  OF THIS.
  AT THIS I LOOKED THROUGH THE TURNSTILES TOWARDS LEPPIIGS LAKE,ALTHOUGH MI VIEW
  WAS RESTRICTED I COULD SEE OFFICERS ON FOOT AND 01; HORSEBACK WHO APPEARED TO
  BE ATTEMPTING'!TO CONTROL THE SURGE TOWARIE THE TURNSTILES.
  PEOPLE WERE NOW STRUGGLING TO ENTER THE GROUND       AND IK'TACT fERE BEING PUSHED
  INTO THE WALL AND TURNSTILE ENTRANCE ITSELF.MANY FANS WERE NOW COMPLAINING
  THAT SOMEONE WOULD BE INJURES,AND ALL OFFICERS AT THE TURNSTILES SHOULD GO
  OUTSIDE.A"L FANS WERE INFORMED THAT OFFICERS INSIDE HAD A TASK TO PERFORM
  AND THAT OFFICERS OUTSIDE WOULD BE DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO ELEVIATE
  THE PROBLEM.
  AROUND 2.40pm    I SAW THAT SEVERAL FANS HAD AGAIN CLIMBED THE OUTER WALL AND
  WERE ON TOP OF THE TURNSTILE ENTRANCE ROOF,THEY WERE INSTRUCTED TO GET DOWN
  THIS THEY FLATLY REFUSED TO DO,I SAW W O YOUTHS       ON THE ROOFSHOWING THESE
  TICKETS TO POLICE OFFICERS THEY WERE AGAIN INSTRUCTED TO GET OFF THE ROOF,
  BUT AGAIN REFUSED.
  BY NOW MANY FANS HAD CONGREGATED AROUND THE TURNSTILES,AND SEVERAL OFFICERS
  INCLUDING IVYSELF WIRE BEING SUROUNDED BY FANS WHO WERE BEING ABUSIVE TOWARDS
  US BECAUSE THEY HAD BEEN SUBJECTED TO THE CRUSH OUTSIDE THE TURNSTILES.
  FANS WERE NOW BEING ALLOWED INTO THE GROUND WITHOUT THE TICKET STUBS BEING
  TORN OFF (THIS I PRESUMED WAS TO ALLOW QUICKE R ENTRY) AND THESE WERE BEING
  PASSED TO FANS ON THE R OOF WHO TH TURN BEGAN TO THROW THEM OVER THE WALL
  TO FANS AWAITING ENTRY.
  IT HAD NOW GOT TO THE STAGE WERE SEARCHING WAS IMPOSSIBLE DUE TO THE AMOUNT
  OF FANS CONGREGATING INSIDE THE TURNSTILE   a R E A ,AND   TOGETHER WITH SEVERAL
  OTHER OFFICERS WE ATTEMPTED TO CLEAR THE AREA.THIS WAS MET WITH VERBAL HOSTILITY
  T0WA1DS THE POLICE AND MANY FANS APPEARED TO BE LOOSING THEIR TEMPERS.
  I FORMED THE OPINION THAT BEFORE TOO LONG A POLICE OFITCER WOULD BE PHYSICALLY
  ASSAULTED, AND DUE TO TEE FACT THAT ONLY SERIAL 14 WAS DEPLOYED IE THAT AREA,
  HAD AN OFFICER BEEN ASSAULTED THEN ASSISTANCE WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY LIMITED
  AND THE SITUATION GOT OUT OF HAND.THANKFULLY THIS DID NOT OCCUR.
  I FEEL THAT AT LEAST 2 FURTHER SERIALS SHOULD HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED IN THE AREA.
  WHILST SPEAKING WITH SEVERAL FANS I WAS APPROACHED BY A IIAN IHO STAliD THAT HE
  WAS A MERSEYSIDE POLICE OFFICER,HE SAID THAT SOMETHING II.D TO BE DONE OUTSIDE
  OR PEOPLE WOULD BE INJURED.HE APPRECIATED THE PRESSURE WE WERE UNDER BUT SOME­
  THING HAD TO BE DONE AND FAST.
  I INFORMED HIM THAT THE OFFICERS OUTSIDE THE GROUND WOULD BE DOING EVERTHING
  POSSIBLE.AT THIS HE LEFT AND WENT INTO THE GROUND WITHOUT FORMALLY IDENTIFYING
  HIMSELF TO ME.
                                           (3)


'   FANS WERE STILL CONGREGATING AROUND THE AREA INSIDE THE TURNSTILES AND I
    MADF SEVERAL REQUEST FOR THEM TO MOVE AWAY TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO GET THROUGH THE
    TURNSTILES AS THIS IN ITSELF WAS CREATING A PROBLEM FOR FANS ENTERING THE
    GROUND.I SAW FANS CLIMBING OVER THE TURNSTILE AND ENTERING 2 AT A TIME,BUT
    WAS UNABLE TO PREVENT THIS DUE TH THE HUMBER OF FANS AROUND THE TURNSTILES.
    THESE PEOPLE JUST DISAPPEARED INTO THE CROWD.
    SHORTLY BEFORE 3.00pm THE KAIN EXIT GATE SITUATED NEAR TO TUPJ.VSTILE "G"
    SUDDENLY OPENED AND FANS BEGAN TO SURGE INTO THE GROUN D,SEVERAL OFFICERS
    FROM THE SERIAL RAN TOWARDS THE GATE AND     I JOINED THEM IN AN EFFORT TO CLOSE
    THE GATE ( I WAS OF THE OPINION THAT THE GATE HAD BEEN FORCED OPEN BY FANS )
    BUT THIS WAS IMPOSSIBLE.
    AS THE FANS SURGED INTO THE GROUND, MANY CHANTING AS THEY RAN,I TURNED AND
    SAW A GAP IN THE CENTRE OF THE FANS AND PEOPLE MOVING TO THE LEFT AND RIGHT.
    PEOPLE WE3E SCREAMING AND SHOUTING,I WENT TO THAT AREA WITH OTHER OFFICERS
    AND FOUND THAT PEOPLE WERE ON THE FLOOR HAVING TRIPPED OR BEEN PUSHED OVER
    IN THE RUSH TO GET INTO     TH1 GROUND.THESE PEOPLE WERE QUICKLY PUT ON THEIR
    FEET AND MOVED   AWAY TO THE SIDE WALLS AWAY PROM THE RUSH.NOT ONE   PERSON
    COMPLAINED TO ME ABOUT BEING INJURED.
    THE MAJORITY OF THE Fa NS WENT TOWARDS THE TUNNEL LEADING TO THE CENTRAL
    ENCLOSURE BUT SOME DID GO TO THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE WEST STAND.
    EVENTUALLY THE GATES WERE CLOSED, SOME FANS WERE STILL COMING THROUGH THE ^
    TURNSTILES BUT THE NUMBERS OUTSIDE WISE GREATLY REDUCED.
    MOST OF THE IANS HAD GONE INTO THE STAND AND THE REAR WAS ALMOST CLEAR WITH
    JUST A FEW FANS MILLING AROUND.
    SERIAL 14 WAS THEN DEPLOYED ONTO THE PITCH AFTER A REPORT OF A PITCH INVASION.
    ACCESS TO THE PITCH WAS GAINED VIA THE GATE LEADING FROM THE SOUTH SIDE OF
    THE WEST STAND   INTOTHE    SOUTH STAND,AND WALKING DOWN THROUGH THE SEATED AREA.
    WHILST WALKING   DOWN THE   SOUTH STAND I COULD SEE SEVERAL FANS CLIMBING OVER
    THE PERIMETER FENCE ONTO THE TRACK AREA AND THERE WERE A LARG NUMBER OF FANS
    ALREADY ON THE PITCH.THERE WERE A LARGE NUMBER OF POLICE OFFICER;,; AND
    STEWARDS IN THE AREA OF THE CENTRE ENCLOSURES ASSISTING IANS TO GET OUT VIA
    THE EMERGENCY EXIT GATES OR OVER THE PERIMETER FENCE.
    SOME OFFICERS HAD CLIMBED THE PERIMETER PENCE IN AU EFFORT TO ASSIST PEOPLE
    OVER THE FENCE.I WENT OVER TO THE PERIMETER FENCE COVERING THE CENTRE SOUTH
    ENCLOSURE AND SAW THAT PEOPLE HAD TEEN CRUSHED AGAINST THE PERIMETER WALL
    AND FENCE,I WOULD ESTIMATE THAT ABOUT 40 TO 50 BODIES WERE LAID UP AGAINST
    THE WALL ON TOP OF ONE ANOTHER.SOME WHO WERE IN A STANDING POSITION UP AGAINST
    THE FENCE WERE UNABLE TO MOVE,BEING TRAPPED BY THE LOWER HALF OF THEIR BODY.
    SOME WERE STILL BREATHING BUT IT WAS APPARENT THAT MANY WE!*E DEAD.
                                           (4)

•    THE AREA AROUND THE EMERGENCY EXIT GATE OP TEE CENTRE SOUTH ENCLOSURE WAS
     CONGESTED WITH PEOPLE TRYING TO GET OUT,AND ‘POLICE OFFICERS ATTEMPTING TO
     GET INSIDE TO RESCUE THE INJURED.
     I LOOKED TOWARDS THE CENTRE NORTH ENCLOSURE AND SAW THAT PART OF THE PERIMETER
     FENCE HAD BEEN PULLED AWAY,ALLOWING FANS GREATER EGRESS ONTO THE PITCH.
     I THEN CLIMBED THE FENCE OF THE CENTRE SOUTH ENCLOSURE AID BEGAN TO SWAY ON
     THE FENCE HOPING THAT THIS WOULD GIVE'WAY AND AFFORD GREATER ENTRY IN TO
     THE ENCLOSURE.THE FENCE DID NOT GIVE WAY,AND I CLIMBED DOWN ONTO THE TRACK.
     I COULD SEE PS13 41 CRAWFORB WAS STILL ON THE PENCE ASSISTING A YOUTH OVER,WHO
     HAD CAUGHT HIS CLOTHING ON THE TOP OF THE FENCE AND WAS IN A PRECARIOUS
     POSITION.I MOVED OVER TO ASSIST PS CRAWFORD AND AS I DID SO THE YOUTH BECAME
     FREE AND DROPPED ONTO THE TRACK.AT THAT POINT THE TOP PART OF ONE OF A,..BRUSH
     BARRIER WAS THROWN FROM THE CENTRE SOUTH    ENCLOSURE TOWARDS THEPITCH,IT   WAS
     ABOUT 5 inch IE   DIAMETER,7 iPBXT LONG AND WAS     BENT.
     IT HIT THE TOP OF THE PERIMETER PENCE,AT THE SIDE OP PS CRAWFORD,AND BEGAN
     TO FALL TOWARDS THE TRACK I DUCKED TO AVOID IT HITTING ME AND CAUGHT IT WITH
     MY LEFT HAND.I MANAGED TO KEEP HOLD OF IT AND IT DID NOT STRIKE ANY PERSON, I
     THEN REMOVED THE ITEM ONTO TEE PITCH TO AVOID ANY PERSON FALLING OVER IT.
     BY NOW EANY INJURED AND DEAD HAD BEEN REMOVED FROM THE ENCLOSURE AND WERE

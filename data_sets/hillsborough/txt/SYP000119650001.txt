SUMMARY OF EVIDENCE AVAILABLE



TRANSCRIPT OF EVIDENCE TO THE INQUEST - 156 pages
CHRISTOPHER EDGAR NICHOLSON                               PAGE 1




I am a Doctor of Engineering PhD, I am a Chartered Engineer and

I am a member of the Institute of Metallurgists.     My position is

Deputy Director of the Research and Laboratory Services Division

of the Health and Safety Executive based in Sheffield.

Following the disaster at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989, I and

members of my staff carried out investigations for the purpose

of the public inquiry giving the findings as a report.     I also

gave oral evidence at the Inquest.

I have seen a copy of the transcript of the evidence I gave.        I

have not subsequently been given cause to wish to revise any of

the context of the report or my evidence.

In particular I can say that an analysis of the video recording

(RJH2) enabled a count to be made of the people who entered Gate

'C.1 (Inquiry 54 86E).   There were one hundred and thirty

persons who entered on the first opening.     One thousand eight

hundred entered on the second opening and ninety on the third.

Adjusting these counts with a percentage of persons who might

have been missed in the count gives a best estimate of one

hundred and fifty for the first opening, two thousand for the

second and ninety for the third.     The third opening led to an

orderly entry and it was felt that the count was accurate.     The

total number of persons calculated as entering the ground via

Gate   'C' is (one hundred and fifty plus two thousand plus

ninety), two thousand two hundred and forty as best estimate

with a maximum of two thousand four hundred and eighty.(Inquiry
CHRISTOPHER EDGAR NICHOLSON                                   PAGE 2




54 87A).

The number of persons entering via turnstiles A - G as indicated

by the computer print out timed at 3.00 pm is seven thousand

four hundred and ninety four.     (Inquiry 54 87D).   Tests

indicated that the turnstile mechanisms seemed to have worked

accurately when compared with a visual count using a video

showing the turnstiles operating, except that turnstile         'G' was

not accurate in that it broke down in the course of the

afternoon.   The best estimate of persons having entered via the

turnstiles A - G by 3.00 pm was given as seven thousand four

hundred and ninety four    with a maximum of seven thousand     six

hundred and forty four.(Inquiry 54 87E).

Thus it is possible to calculate the total number of persons

entering the ground via Gate    'C' and turnstiles A - G as being

(two thousand two hundred and forty plus seven thousand four

hundred and ninety four) nine thousand seven hundred and thirty

four best estimate into a maximum of ten thousand one hundred

and twenty four.    (Inquiry 54 96E).

An estimate was made of the occupancy of Pen 3 using

photographs.   It was calculated that there were one thousand

five hundred and seventy six    people in Pen 3at 3.03    pm.

(Inquiry 54 96E).   That   is a density of 8.38 persons   per square

metre, about 50% more than the density of 5.4 per square metre

mentioned in the Green Guide.    The figure for a crowd capacity

of 5.4 per square metre in Pen 3 would be one thousand and
CHRISTOPHER EDGAR NICHOLSON                               PAGE 3




fifteen.    (Inquiry 55 10E).   This figure is based purely on

area.    If account is taken of length of barriers actually in the

pen the figure would be eight hundred and twenty two.

An estimate was made of the occupancy of Pen 4 using

photographs, but the photograph was not as useful for Pen 4

(Inquiry 54 98C) and consequently the assumption was made that

the density was about the same as that in Pen 3.     (Inquiry 55

2F).    This assumption was supported by the available

photographic evidence.    It was calculated that there were one

thousand six hundred and seven persons in Pen 4 at 3.03 pm that

is a density of 8.38 persons per square metre.     At a density of

5.4 persons per square metre the figure would be one thousand

and thirty six.    (Inquiry 55 74D).   This figure is based purely

on area.    If account is taken of length of barriers actually in

the pen the figure would be eight hundred and seventy one.

Clearly those centre pens were easily on any view overcrowded.

(? 74E).

On 15 April 1989 the spectators were intended to enter the

stadium through 83 turnstiles of which 23 (28%) were sited in

Leppings Lane.    If the stadium was to be filled to its maximum

capacity of 54,324 persons then 45% (24,447 persons) of this

capacity would be admitted from Leppings Lane.

The 7 turnstiles serving the West Terraces    (10,100 capacity) had

the highest average admission requirement of 1443

persons/turnstile of any group of turnstiles serving the
CHRISTOPHER EDGAR NICHOLSON                             PAGE 4




stadium.

The longest delays in admission would be encountered by persons

required to enter through turnstiles in Leppings Lane and larger

crowds would form in that area than in other entrance areas to

the ground.

On the basis of Research and Laboratory Services Division's

measured average rate of admission of 660 persons/turnstile/hour

through turnstiles A to G, between 2.08 pm and 2.50 pm and the

number of persons who had already been admitted through those

turnstiles at 2.50 pm, they estimated that if Gate   'C' had not

been opened it would have taken until about 3.4 0 pm to admit a

total of 10,100 persons through those turnstiles to the West

Terraces.

1.1     Following an incident on 15 April 1989, I visited Sheffield Wednesday
        Football Club's (SWFC) Hillsborough Stadium on 16 April 1989 at the
        request of Mr M S Nattrass, Area Director of South Yorkshire and
        Humberside Factory and Agricultural Inspectorate of the Health and Safety
        Executive (HSE). Subsequently I was appointed to head the HSE team
        investigating the incident following correspondence between the Court of
        Inquiry and the then Deputy Director General of the HSE, Mr J D G Hanmer.

1.2     The HSE's Research and Laboratory Services Division (RISD) consists of
        3 laboratories, one of which, the Safety Engineering Laboratory (SEL), is
        based in Sheffield. As a Deputy Director in the Sheffield Laboratory, I
        was able to assemble a team of scientists and engineers from various
        specialist sections to tackle the various technical problems which arose.
        I was also assisted by members of HSE's Technology Division in much of the
        on site investigation at the Hillsborough ground. They produced site
        reports, which are reproduced in the Annexe, and which have been utilised
        by HSE staff throughout this investigation.

      In considering collapse load calculations of barrier 124A, Professor
      R A Smith of the University of-Sheffield Department of Mechanical and
      Process Engineering, acted as a consultant and in conjunction with RISD
      staff produced a report on this topic.

1.3     A few days after the incident, the West Midlands Police were appointed to
        assist the Inquiry and all the initial stages of the investigation were
        carried cut in close collaboration with ACC M Jones of the West Midlands
        Police. When the Inquiry assessors were appointed, the direction of
        technical aspects of the investigation was then planned with Professor
        L Maunder of the University of Newcastle Department of Mechanical
        Engineering, but still in collaboration with ACC Jones.

1.4     A summary report of HSE's findings "The Hillsborough Incident
        15 April 1989: An Investigation into Various Technical Aspects prepared
        for the Court of Inquiry" by C E Nicholson, Report No IR/l/ME/MM/89/1 was
        written and presented to the Court of Inquiry in June 1989.

1.5 This compendium of reports contains details of examinations performed on
    site and in the laboratory. The work was carried out by me, by other
    staff of HSE and by the consultant Professor Smith, working on my
    instructions and under my general supervision.

1 INTRODUCTION

Following the incident on 15 April 1989, staff of the Health and Safety
Executive visited Hillsborough Football Ground. The crush barriers in
Pens 3 and 4 (central pen), at the Lappings Lane end of the ground, were
examined on 16 and 17 April 1989 and identified with a paint marker in
accordance with a drawing supplied by Mr Paul Jackson, Sheffield
Environmental Health Department. On each barrier the support locations
were numbered sequentially from left to right when viewed from the pitch.

Barrier 124A appeared to have collapsed and a length of the horizontal
tube had become detached. This detached length of tube had been found on
the pitch in front of gate 3 in the perimeter fence at the Leppings Lane
end on 16 April 1989 by Dr Nicholson. It was kept in a secure place by
Club Officials and was placed in Pen 3 on 17 April 1989 so that it could
be examined in conjunction with the rest of the barrier. Subsequently on
17 April 1989 it was taken to the Sheffield Laboratory of the Health and
Safety Executive together with another small piece of tube found by Dr
Nicholson on 17 April 1989 (see 2.1, page 3 below).

On 24 April 1989 the damaged parts of barrier 124A, consisting of two
lengths of tube and two supports, were removed from Pen 3, under the
supervision of the authors of this report, and taken to the Sheffield
Laboratory of the Health and Safety Executive for metallurgical
assessment. The remainder of barrier 124A was removed by Mr P F Heyes
and HSE staff on 7 July 1989.

This report contains details of examinations performed both on site and
in the laboratory. The work was carried out by the authors and by other
staff of HSE working on their instruction and under their general
supervision.

2 ON SITE EXAMINATION

2.1 BARRIER 124A

Barrier 124A was located on the seventh, eighth and ninth steps of Pen 3
adjacent to Pen 2. The overall length of this barrier before collapse
was estimated to be 7.5m including a tube overhang of 0.6m near the
radial fence adjacent to Pen 2. The horizontal distance from this
barrier to the perimeter fence at the front of Pen 3 was approximately
3.5m, and the distance of the tube end from the radial fence, separating
Pens 2 and 3, was 28mm. There were no other barriers between barrier
124A and the perimeter fence. A sketch of this barrier, showing our
opinion of its appearance before the incident, is shown in Figure 1.

The evidence suggested that, prior to the collapse, barrier 124A had
consisted of four vertical supports with a horizontal tube between them.
HSE staff numbered the supports 1,2,3 and 4, beginning at the end nearer
Pen 2.
                                                                 Document No.   g9    CONPC




    Each vertical support had consisted of two lengths of 52mm wide metal
    angle, having a thickness of 6mm, inclined at an angle of 20 degrees to
    one another. During manufacture each front support leg had been curved
    near the top to form a horizontal surface and had been joined to the
    rear support leg by a triangular gusset plate. The latter had been
    rivetted to the two lengths of metal angle. The horizontal tube had been
    made from hollow circular section metal with an outside diameter of
    60mm. An inverted U-shaped strap, approximately 50mm wide, had been
    bolted to the top of each support, and this was presumably intended to
    retain the horizontal tube.

    Figure 2 shows barrier 124A viewed from the pitch as it appeared on the
    morning of 17 April 1989. The detached length of tube had a transverse
    fracture at either end. One of these fractures matched the fracture on
    the length of tube in contact with support 2 and the other matched the
    fracture on the length of tube in contact with support 3. Hence it was
    possible to locate this detached length of tube in the correct
    position between supports 2 and 3. This detached length of tube had
    been bent symmetrically about its mid-point where the maximum deflection
    was 133mm.

    Support 4, shown in the foreground of Figure 1, had been moved forward
    and twisted towards the front left-hand corner of Pen 3, viewed from the
    pitch. The lower portion of the front leg had remained straight,
    although by comparison with the front legs of other barriers, it
    appeared to have moved forward through an angle of 25 degrees
    approximately. In so doing the front leg had broken away from the edge
    of the concrete step in which it had been supported. Several pieces of
    detached concrete were observed nearby, two of which matched the
    fracture on the step, shown in Figure 3. The upper portion of the front
    leg had suffered localised bending and it had been twisted inwards with
    respect to the other supports on this barrier.

    The rear leg of support 4 had been deformed and kinked at the lower end
    near the junction with a piece of reinforcing steel angle which had been
    bolted on top of the original angle section. The latter had been thinned
    by corrosion in the area where this deformation had occurred. The rear
    leg also exhibited localised deformation and cracking in the vicinity of
    the lowest gusset plate attachment hole. The gusset plate appeared to be
    relatively undeformed but had been moved inwards towards the other
    supports. The tube retaining strap appeared to be intact and still in
    position.

    Support 3 had been deformed extensively and flattened so that it was
    almost horizontal. The general direction of deformation was towards the
    front left-hand corner of the pen, viewed from the pitch. At its lower
    end the front leg had been deformed adjacent to a piece of reinforcing
    angle, but both the latter and the surrounding concrete were
    undisturbed. The rear leg had been bent forward and the majority of the
    deformation had occurred at the junction with the concrete step. The
    step itself was intact. The gusset plate was undeformed but it had been
    torn from the upper part of the rear leg and moved forward. The strap
    retaining the tube at support 3 had been straightened partially but the
    tube appeared to be captive at this position. A transverse fracture of
    the tube, in the vicinity of some tube wall corrosion, was visible under
    the strap.

The length of tube in contact with support 3 had been bent by 200mm at
midspan and it had a ragged fracture in a corroded region near the end
further from support 3, i.e. the free end. The latter had presumably
been located under the strap on support 4 before collapse occurred. The
fracture in the tube corresponding with support 4 was partly transverse
and partly longitudinal, the original manufactured end being deformed
but not fractured. At some stage the tube had also been partially
crushed at this location.

During the visit on 17 April, a small piece of netal, roughly
semi-circular in section, was found in Pen 3 by Dr C Nicholson amongst
the debris near gate 3 in the perimeter fence. The fracture on this
small piece matched that at the end of the tube corresponding to support
4. This end of the tube had apparently moved a distance of 1.4m in the
horizontal plane before coming to rest on the steps. In total, the
collapsed part of barrier 124A occupied an area measuring 4m along the
terrace and 1.6m down the terrace in Pen 3.

Supports 1 and 2 were free from damage and the length of tube between
them had not been deformed significantly. This length of tube contained
two circumferential welds positioned as follows when viewed from the
pitch side: one approximately 0.2m left from the strap on support 2; the
other 0.05m right from the strap on support 1. The tube had fractured
transversely under the strap on support 2 and a smaller diameter tube
insert was observed protruding a distance of 25mm from this fracture.
There was evidence of considerable corrosion of the original tube under
this strap. The tube insert appeared to be approximately 150mm in total
length. The strap on support 2 had been welded to the tube on the left
side only. This was the only location on barrier 124A where a strap had
been welded to the tube.

Support 1 had a piece of reinforcing angle attached to each foot and the
rear leg had been braced by an additional piece of angle acting as an
outrigger. Support 2 had a piece of reinforcing angle attached to the
front foot only with an outrigger on the rear leg.

2.2 OTHER BARRIERS IN PENS 3 AND 4

The remaining barriers in Pen 3 and those in Pen 4 were examined. The
layout of all the barriers in Pens 3 and 4 is shown schematically in
Figure 4. On each barrier the supports were numbered sequentially from
left to right as viewed from the pitch. Several barriers had been
fabricated with rectangular hollow section supports and these appeared
to be somewhat newer than the rest. Most of the old-style barriers had
been modified in some way, for example by reinforcing of the support
legs and welding of the horizontal tubes. Corrosion was evident at all
joints and intersections, and rust "jacking" had occurred at many of the
gusset plate/support leg junctions.

Most of the horizontal tubes on the older barriers were open-ended and
in two cases (barrier 125 near support 1 and barrier 128 near support 1)
holes in the tube wall, caused by corrosion under the support strap,
were clearly visible. An example of this is shown arrowed in Figure 5
which depicts the end of barrier 125 adjacent to barrier 124A in Pen 3.
The hole is approximately 25mm in diameter and its centre is 60mm from
the end of the tube.

2.3 EXCAVATION OF BARRIER 124A SUPPORTS 3 AND 4 ON 24 APRIL 1989

It was agreed by the Inquiry that supports 3 and 4 on barrier 124A could
removed for laboratory examination. Three cylindrical cores, measuring
0.1m in diameter and 0.4m in length, were cut from the concrete steps at
positions specified by Mr C Pertee, a Principal Specialist Inspector in
the Technology Division of HSE, before excavation of the supports
commenced. These cores, from steps 7, 8 and 9, were identified by the
letters P,Q and U respectively. After cutting, core P was found to
contain a piece of the front foot from support 4 and core U was found to
contain a piece of the rear foot of support 3.

It became apparent during excavation that each support leg had been
flattened and shaped to form a foot which had been positioned
horizontally in the ground and bolted to a base plate. The supports were
freed by unscrewing, or grinding off the nuts in contact with the feet
of the supports. In all cases the boundary between the support and the
concrete was marked using yellow paint.

When the front foot of support 4 was exposed, considerable thinning and
loss of metal was observed in the vicinity of the bend between the
upright and the foot. This area was further weakened during core
drilling and the remaining ligament of metal, approximately 5mm wide and
0.8mm in thickness, became detached during removal of the support. Part
of the front foot was found to be in contact with a reinforcing wire in
the concrete and a length of this wire was removed for possible future
examination.

The pieces of reinforcing angle, noted previously on the rear leg of
support 4 and the front leg of support 3, were observed to extend below
the surface of the concrete to the bend at the start of the foot.

The length of tube remaining in contact with support 3 slipped out of
the strap during lifting of the support. It was apparent that this
length of tube had not been fixed intentionally to the strap and it had
been held temporarily in position by accumulated rust and debris only.

2.4 REMOVAL OF INTACT PART OF BARRIER 124A ON 7 JULY 1989

The feet of supports 1 and 2 were excavated to a depth of 50mm
approximately and subsequently cut using an angle grinder. This
permitted both supports, and the length of tube between them, to be
removed in one piece.

    3.2 CONCRETE CORES

    The three cores are shown schematically in Figure 6. They were taken at
    different positions along the terrace but, for convenience, they are
    shown here in the same plane. Core P was extracted in three pieces: a
    cylindrical upper piece, approximately 85mm in length, which was
    composed of an upper layer (27mm in thickness) containing relatively
    fine aggregate, typically a few millimetres in section and a lower layer
    (52mm in thickness) containing coarser aggregate, typically 5-10mm in
    section; an irregular shaped intermediate piece, with a maximum length
    of 120mm, Which contained the coarsest aggregate, typically 20-30mm in
    section, and bore an impression of a section of barrier support foot; a
    cylindrical lower layer, 180mm in length also containing the coarsest
    aggregate (20-30mm in section)

    Core Q was extracted in two cylindrical pieces: an upper piece,
    approximately 138mm in length, which was composed of an upper layer (23mm
    in thickness) containing relatively fine aggregate, typically a few

millimetres in section, a middle layer (65mm in thickness) containing
coarser aggregate, typically 5-10mm in section, and lower a layer, 50mm
in thickness, of loosely bound coarse material; a lower piece, 245mm in
length containing the coarsest aggregate, typically 20-30mm in section.

Core U was extracted in two cylindrical pieces: an upper piece,
approximately 141mm in length, which was composed of an upper layer
(26mm in thickness) containing relatively fine aggregate, typically a
few millimetres in section and a lower layer (115mm in thickness)
containing coarser aggregate, typically 5-10mm in section; a lower
piece, 200mm in length, containing the coarsest aggregate, typically
20-30mm in section. The lower layer contained a slice through a barrier
support foot consisting of, in descending order, a nut, a piece of foot,
a piece of bolt and a piece of base-plate.

3.3 LENGTHS OF TUBE FROM BARRIER 124A

3.3.1 visual evannnation

The two detached lengths of tube (CEN/2 and PFH/1) are shown in Figures
7 and 8 respectively. The length of tube which had been between supports
3 and 4 was designated "tube 3/4" by the authors and the length of tube
which had between supports 2 and 3 was designated "tube 2/3". Each
length measured 2.3m and had an external diameter of 60mm. The length of
tube between supports 1 and 2 was designated "tube 1/2" and its overall
length was approximately 3m. The outside diameter of this tube was 60mm.

Bottom dead centre of tube 2/3 and 3/4 was located by examination of
paint runs and an accumulation of dried paint. It was deduced that both
lengths of tube had been deformed towards the pitch in a horizontal
plane.

Visual examination of the fractures indicated that in general the
failure of the tube had occurred in a fibrous, ductile manner. On the
two matching fractures which had been coincident with support 3 there
was however a region of bright crystalline fracture, shown arrowed in
Figure 9, consistent with a more brittle failure mode. This crystalline
fracture had occurred where the remaining wall thickness of the tube was
at a maximum.

In general the appearance of the tube fractures was typical of wrought
iron which had fractured in a single-stage bending/tensile mode.
Fracture of the tube adjacent to support 3 appeared to have initiated on
the uphill side of the barrier at a position at right angles to top
dead centre. The other tube fractures had suffered some post-failure
damage and the origins were not readily identifiable.

At all the fracture positions much of the wall thickness of the tube had
been reduced, mainly by external corrosion. The corrosion had occurred
under the locating straps in areas, approximately 65mm wide, which were
unpainted. The end of the tube at the position of support 4 had been
open to the environment and additional corrosion at the internal surface
of the tube had occurred. This had resulted in the formation of two
holes through the wall approximately 10 and 20 mm in diameter under the
strap. One of these holes, shown arrowed in Figure 10, appeared to have
initiated the fracture and led to the detachment of the small piece of
tube (arrowed in Figure 11) found on the steps, item CEN/1. These holes

                                                                                490

were location at the 4 o'clock and 8 o'clock positions and their centres
would have been approximately 50mm from the open end of the tube at
support 4 before failure.

The extent of corrosion of tube 1/2 under the strap at support 2 was
disclosed when the strap was removed (Figure 12). Tube 1/2 was removed
subsequently from supports 1 and 2 to permit closer examination. This
revealed that two pieces of tube had been joined beneath support 2 by a
part circumferential weld which also served to join the strap to the
tube at this support. A 150mm long tubular insert (arrowed in Figure
12), with an outside diameter of 49mm and a wall thickness of 5mm, was
located inside the main tube at a position corresponding with support 2.
This reinforcement was retained by means of a tack weld on the inside of
the main tube between support 2 and the adjacent circumferential weld in
the main tube, which had been noted on site. Hence, neglecting the
insert, the tube between supports 1 and 2 apparently consisted of three
pieces joined by: a circumferential near support 1; a circumferential
weld near support 2; a part circumferential weld beneath support 2.

An oval hole, shown in Figure 13 and measuring 35 x 15mm, was revealed
in the tube under the strap on support 1, at the 4 o'clock position when
viewed from the end nearer support 1. This hole had apparently been
formed by external corrosion of the tube under the strap.

A rolled-up newspaper was found inside tube 2/3. This was part of a copy
of the "Yorkshire Telegraph & Star", dated Saturday 24 October 1931. A
piece of another newpaper, "The Star" dated Saturday 26 September 1959,
was found in tube 1/2. Various other items of debris were found
elsewhere in the lengths of tube.

3.3.2 Tube wall thickness measurements

The wall thickness of the tube at the fracture positions was measured at
various locations around the circumference. The thickness range recorded
at each fracture is shown below:

Support 2       0.4 to 4.4 mm

Support 3       1.6 to 4.5 mm

Support 4       1.1 to ^ 5   mm (ignoring theedges of the   holes)

Measurements taken along the lengthsof tube using anultrasonic
instrument showed that the wall thickness remote from the fractures was
in the range 3.2 to 4.9 mm. Corrosion was confined to regions about
70'75mm wide, centred on the support straps, and there were no areas of
pronounced thinning elsewhere. The ultrasonic thickness reading was
5.0mm throughout the length of tube between the circumferential welds on
tube 1/2.

3.3.3 Microstructural evamination

A transverse ring section was cut from tube 3/4 at a distance of 65mm
from the fracture corresponding to support 3. Microexamination showed
that the tube had been manufactured from wrought iron and that it
contained a longitudinal, forged lap weld.

A microsection of a sample of paint removed from a similar position
showed that the paint consisted of 13 coats plus an initial metal loaded
primer coat. The total thickness of these coats was approximately 0.5 mm.
Various microsections from tube 1/2 indicated that this length of tube
consisted of both wrought iron and low carbon steel as follows: the
length between the end nearer Pen 2 and the circumferential weld near
support 1 was wrought iron; the length between the circumferential welds
was low carbon steel; the length between the circumferential weld near
support 2 and the part circumferential weld beneath the strap on support
2 was low carbon steel; the length between the part circumferential
beneath the strap on support 2 and the fracture was wrought iron.

3.3.4 Tensile tests

Two longitudinal tensile test pieces, identified as T343/1 and T343/2,
were machined from tube 3/4 near the end corresponding to support 3. Two
further longitudinal tensile test pieces, identified as T1221 and T1222,
were machined from the central portion (low carbon steel) of tube 1/2.
In order to minimize the effects of previous work hardening, all test
pieces were taken as near as possible to what would have been the
neutral axis during bending.

These test pieces were tested in accordance with BS 18:1987 "Method for
tensile testing of metals (including aerospace materials)", and the
following results were obtained:

3.3.5 Hardness testing

Hardness tests were carried out on the ring microsection from tube 3/4
and on the microsections from tube 1/2 in accordance with BS 427:Part

3.4 SUPPORTS niOM BARRIER 124A

3.4.1 Visual examination

Supports 1 and 2 had not been deformed. Supports 3 and 4 are shown after
excavation in Figures 14 and 15 respectively. Although the extent of the
deformation of supports 3 and 4 was noted on site (see section 2.1 of
this report), a number of additional features became apparent in the
laboratory-

The legs of supports 3 and 4 had been corroded, particularly at the
junctions with the concrete step and/or additional reinforcing angles.
At these locations the residual thickness was in the range 3.1mm to
5.9mm, compared with a nominal thickness of 6.3mm elsewhere. A
considerable amount of metal had been lost by corrosion from the
sub-surface region of the supports. For example, on the rear leg of
support 4, a ligament of metal 8mm wide and 2mm in thickness was all
that remained of the original nominal 50 x 50mm angle section at a
distance of 150mm below the surface.

The front leg of support 3 and the rear leg of support 4 had been
reinforced with additional sections of steel angle. Both these
reinforcements spanned areas of corrosion on the sub-surface region of
the supports. In general on the collapsed supports, the most severe
sub-surface corrosion was located at a distance which varied from 50mm
to 170mm below the surface depending on which step the barrier had been
located.

3.4.2 Dimens ions

In general, the width of the steel angle from which the support legs had
been made was in the range 49 - 52mm and the thickness remote from
corroded regions was in the range 6.0 - 7.4 mm. In some above surface
regions of supports 3 and 4 the thickness of the angle had been reduced
by corrosion and buckling had occurred during collapse. This can been
seen in Figures 14 and 15 in which the thickness of the angle at the
positions indicated was:

           Support 3       (a)     4.6   to 5.9 mm
                           (b)     5.9   mm
           Support 4       (c)     1.5   mm
                           (d)     5.6   to 5.8 mm

The thickness of the steel angle in the sub-surface regions of supports
3 and 4 varied from zero, where through-thickness corrosion had
occurred, to 6.4mm.

3.4.3 Microexamination

Microsections were cut and prepared for examination from each of the
legs on supports 3 and 4 only. The following microstructures were
observed:

    Support 3   Front leg - 100% ferrite
                Rear leg - small amount of pearlite in ferrite in central
                            region; ferrite at edges.

    Support 4   Both legs - small amount of pearllte in ferrite in central
                            region; ferrite at edges.

These microstructures were typical of low carbon or rimming steel.

3.4.4 Tensile tests

One tensile test piece was machined from each leg of support 3. The test
pieces were identified FL3 and RL3 and were tested in accordance with BS
18:1987 " Method for tensile testing of metals (including aerospace
materials)", and the following results were obtained:

                         ReH           Rm        A%

    FL3                267 MPa      343 MPa      32
                       17.3 tsi      22.2 tsi

    RL3                308 MPa      376 MPa      31
                       19.9 tsi      24.3 tsi

Both test pieces exhibited yield phenomenon and hence the upper yield
stress (ReH) was determined.

3.4.5 Hardness tests

Vickers hardness tests were carried out on the microsections taken from
the support legs. These tests were conducted in accordance with BS 427:
Part 1:1961 (1981) "Method for Vickers Hardness Test - Testing of
metals" and the following results were obtained:


    Support 3   Front leg      105 - 109 HV
                Rear leg       113 - 125 HV

    Support 4   Front leg      112 - 140 HV
                Rear leg       121 - 141 HV

These results are typical of low carbon steel.

4 ASSESSMENT

Barrier 124A had consisted originally of a horizontal tube and four
vertical supports. The barrier had failed apparently by partial collapse
and fracture of supports 3 and 4, and by fracture of the horizontal tube
at supports 2, 3 and 4. The length of tube which had been located
between supports 2 and 3 (tube 2/3) had been bent uniformly to give a
maximum permanent deflection of 133mm at midspan. The portion of the
tube which been located between supports 3 and 4 (tube 3/4) had been
bent uniformly to give a maximum permanent deflection of 200mm at
midspan. Tubes 2/3 and 3/4 had been deformed in a horizontal plane
towards the pitch. Tube 1/2 and supports 1 and 2 had not been deformed.

Laboratory examination showed that most of the tube had been made from
wrought iron and each support had been made from two lengths of steel
angle section joined at the top by a steel gusset plate. Part of the
original wrought iron tube between supports 1 and 2 had been replaced at
some time by a 2m length of low carbon steel. In addition, the tube had


                                    -10-                                      494

been strengthened at support 2 by insertion of a internal tubular
reinforcement. Thus tube 1/2 was probably stronger than the rest of the
tube and this may, in part, explain the lack of deformation in this
region. In addition, supports 1 and 2 had been strengthened by
reinforcement with angle section at three of the four feet and by
bracing of the rear legs with outriggers.

The tube fractures had occurred in areas which had been located under
the metal straps designed, presumably, to retain the tube. The tube wall
thickness, nominally 4.5mm, had been reduced significantly by external
corrosion tinder each strap. In some cases holes had been present in the
tube at these locations before collapse occurred. Corrosion here
appeared to be a highly localised phenomenon which was confined to a
distance of 30mm to 35mm either side of the centreline of the strap.

In general the appearance of the tube fractures was typical of ductile
failure of wrought iron in a single-stage bending/tensile mode. The
region of brittle fracture, noted in the tube near support 3, was the
last part of the tube to fracture at this location. The change in
fracture mode can be explained in terms of increased constraint as the
fracture entered thicker material and an increase in strain rate as the
fracture propagated round the tube. Both these factors would tend to
promote brittle fracture.

Corrosion at the tube/support junctions was predictable because liquid
would have been retained in crevices under the strap and the surface of
the tube under the strap had not been painted. At the open end of the
tube, near support 4, internal corrosion had also contributed to
deterioration of the tube since there was access for rainwater. Here the
tube wall had been perforated by corrosion under the strap at two
locations producing holes which we estimate would have been
approximately 10mm and 20mm in diameter before the collapse. The centres
of these holes would have been located approximately 50mm from the open
end of the tube at support 4. They would have resembled the hole in the
tube on barrier 125 (Figure 3) and, in our opinion, they would have been
readily visible to the naked eye.

The direction of collapse of supports 3 and 4 appeared to be towards the
front lett-nana corner of Pen 3. as viewed from the pitch. For the most
part the supports had been buckled and bent at locations which had been
weakened by corrosion. Although there was considerable sub-surface
corrosion of these supports, this played no part in the collapse. The
concrete which broke away at the front foot of support 4 did so because
this support had been positioned along the riser of a step in the
terrace.

In all cases the most severe sub-surface corrosion on the feet of
supports 3 and 4 had been located near the lower end of the region of
concrete containing the coarser aggregate. One possible explanation for
this could be that the height of the terrace had been raised at some
stage and the sub-surface corrosion mav have occurred at or near the
original junction between the support feet and the terrace. This would
have reduced the effective height of the barriers.

The use of wrought iron tube, and the method of tube fabrication,
suggests that barrier 124A was many years old. British Standards
governing the use of wrought iron tube were in use in the 1920s and
1930s but are now obsolescent. The discovery of dated sections of
newspaper in the tube indicates that_parts of barrier 124A were at least
58 years old, although clearly this barrier had received several
modifications during its lifetime.

5 CONCLUSIONS

^•1 The tube on the collapsed part of barrier 124A had been made from
wrought iron.

5.2 The tube on the collapsed part of barrier 124A had fractured at
s u pports^, 3 and 4 in regions whereconsiderable localised corrosion    II
Had occurred.                                                            "

5.3 The legs of supports 3 and 4on barrier 124A had been made from low
carbon s'EeeT angle section which had been corroded in some areas.

5.4 Two other barriers in Pens 3 and 4 contained tubes which had been
perforated by corrosion at support locations.

In our opinion,

5.5 The general direction of collapse of barrier 124A was towards the
lower left-hand corner of Pen 3, as viewed from the pitch.

5.6 Two holes, caused by corrosion, had been present in the tube of
barrier 124A at the junction with support 4 before the collapse
occurred and these would have been visible to the naked eye.

1   INTRODUCTION

During the incident which occurred at Hillsborough Stadium on 15 April 1989,
two bays, 2\3 and 3\4, of barrier 124A, Fig 1, were broken down. This report
attempts to calculate collapse loads for the barrier and compares these loads
with the pressures likely to have been generated by the crowd.

Examination and mechanical testing of the broken barrier by staff of the
Health and Safety Executive (HSE), revealed that the upper rail had been
manufactured from wrought iron and was probably over sixty years old. The
vertical supports were made from mild steel (Ref 1). The tube was attached to
the supports by straps, underneath which considerable corrosion of the tube
had occurred.


2   MATERIAL PROPERTIES

Tensile tests from 2 specimens taken from the tube gave average tensile
strength of 366 MPa, 0.2% proof stress 259 MPa and an estimated elastic limit
of 150 MPa. Because of the considerable work hardening which occurs after
yield in this material and the sensitivity of the yield stress to prior load
history, there is an ambiguity about what single value of yield (or flow)
stress should be used to calculate a fully plastic moment.

Two full scale uniform bending tests were carried out on similar wrought iron
tubes from barrier 129, as described in Appendix 1. From the experimentally
determined plastic collapse loads and the geometry of the tube, representative
flow stresses, Of, were determined from each test. The values obtained were
298.2 MPa and 290.9 MPa. The difference in the two values of flow stress
obtained by experiment gives an indication of the reliability of the material
property input to the collapse calculations, i.e. +/- 1.2%. The average of
these values, 294.6 MPa was used in the subsequent collapse calculations. This
value is some 5.7% less than that obtained by using the approximation of the
average of the tensile strength and the 0.2% yield stress obtained in a
tensile test. An average value of Young's Modulus, E, (in flexure) of
190.5 GPa was also obtained from these experiments.


3   SECTION PROPERTIES OF THE BARRIER TUBE

Second moments of area, I, for a tube of outside diameter D and uniform wall
thickness, t, were calculated from the formula:

    irD4             2t ' 4-
I - ---    1 -   1 ---                             (1)
    64                D

Equation (1) and the formulae which follow can be found in standard references
(e.g. Ref 2).

Fully plastic moments Mp were calculated as a product of the flow stress <7 f
and Zp the plastic modulus:

                                                                                509
                                                                    Document No.   89   CG NT’D

The nominal dimensions of the tube, 60 mm outside diameter and 4 mm wall
thickness are used in the preliminary calculations in the bent two sections.


4       ELASTIC DEFLECTIONS UNDER TEST LOADING

The elastic deflection (6) at the centre of a beam of length L, built-in at bot
ends and subjected to a uniformly distributed load w, is given by

          wL4
    5                                             (3)
         384EI

If the ends are simply supported, the deflection is increased by a factor of
five.

For a span between supports (L) of 2.2 *, the length of spans 2\3 and 3\4 of
barrier 124A, subjected to the test loading of 6 kN/m, a figure prescribed by
the Green Guide" (Ref 3), a central deflection of 6.9 mm is obtained. If the
ends are free, the deflection increases to 34.5 mm. In the calculation which
follows, the central span (2\3) of barrier 124A has been treated as having
built-in ends. The outer span (3\4), has been treated as having end 3 built-in
and end 4 simply supported.


5       YIELDING UNDER TEST CONDITIONS

For the span 2\3, the clamping moments are wLz/12. First yield will occur when
these moments equal 2oy x I/D. If Oy corresponds to the measured elastic limit
of the material (150 MPa), then first yield corresponds to 3.4 kN/m, or just
over half of the test load. 0.2% proof stress gives a first yield load of
5.9 kN/m. Thus some yielding occurs on first loading up to the test load of
6 kN/m. Subsequent loading up to this test load will be elastic because of the
strain-hardening capabilities of the material.


6       CALCULATIONS OF PLASTIC COT.TAPSK TOAns

The wall thickness of the tube under straps at 2, 3 and 4 was found to be much
reduced by corrosion. The reduction in thickness was not uniform round the
circumference; calculations of the plastic moduli of the as-measured sections
have been made by area integration, described in Appendix 2. The following
table results:

    The general case of plastic collapse for a beam of length L is shown below:



                                Tr / unit length.




    where M*- and Me are the moments at the supports and Mg is the moment at the


#   centre of the beam. The collapse load is

         4 x (M* + 2M b + Me)
                                                                   (4)


    The standard case we take is for the original beam built-in at both ends, i.e.
    span 2\3 of barrier 124A. Denoting the collapse load for this case as wc and
    noting M* - Me - Mg — Mp, the fully plastic moment at the uncorroded centre,


         16 x Mp   16 x 3.73
    wc - --      -               12.3 kN/m

    Now for the span 3\4, assuming end 4 to be simply supported, the calculation
    above can be repeated with Me — 0, and M* - Me « 3.65 kNm, giving a collapse
    load of 9.05 kN/m.

    For the spans in a corroded condition, the central plastic moment can be
    assumed to remain unchanged, but the appropriate plastic moments in the
    above table can be substituted for end moments. The following table
    results:

                                               Collapse Loads: kN/m

    The figures in brackets are the calculated collapse loads as multiples of the
    test load (6 kN/m).

    For the unsymmetrical calculations in the previous table, the inner plastic
    hinge does not occur exactly at the centre of the span. The effect of this on
    the calculated collapse loads is negligible and smaller than other sources of
    uncertainty.

    Tests performed by Dr Eastwood (Ref 4) on a similar, but not identical
    barrier, after the incident, showed that a load of 9 kN/m (test load x 1.5)
    was sufficient to cause very large permanent deformation of the tube. The
    calculated collapse loads therefore appear to be realistic values.


    7   COLLAPSE MODE

    If we assume the shear strength to be only 50% of the tensile strength,
    then to shear a 1.5mm wall thickness of tube directly, a load of 48 kN/m is
    required. Even the worst corroded end had an average wall thickness of this
    value, yet the shear failure load is many times higher than the plastic
    collapse load. This evidence, together with the bent shape of the tube after
    the incident, supports the view that barrier failure occurred by plastic
    collapse of the tube. Because of its position, span 3\4 would fail before span
#   2\3. If collapse of the legs had taken place prior to the failure of the tube,
    the tube would not have been bent in the manner which was observed. Thus, of
    the loads calculated in Section 6, the value of collapse for span 3\4 in the
    corroded condition governs the problem.


    8   ESTIMATES OF CROWD FORCES ACTING ON BARRIERS

    A theoretical model of the forces generated by a crowd behind a barrier has
    been developed, see Appendix 3. Values from this model are shown on Fig 2, onto
    which values for the various calculated collapse loads have been added. For a
    crowd density of 8/sq m, measured from photograhs (Ref 1), span 3\4 in the
    original condition would withstand a crowd depth of approximately 6.4 m before
    collapse. This would reduce to 6 m if it were in the corroded condition.
    Because span 3\4 of barrier 124A was unprotected by barrier 136, a crowd of 7
    m was able to exert pressure on this part of the barrier. Given that the crowd
    was not of uniform density throughout and the approximate nature of the crowd
    loading model, these figures adequately explain the collapse of the barrier.
    Once span 3\4 had failed, span 2\3 would become simply supported at end 3 and
    the vertical support would twist, causing collapse of span 2\3 at a similar
    load level. If the crowd had been restricted to 5.4/sq m, the crowd depth to
    cause collapse would be 8 m and 7.5 m iiT'tKe~original and corroded conditions
    respectively. This latter value is in excess of the ^ e p t h o f c r o w d at this
    location and indicates that the span would have survived had the crowd density
    been so restricted.              ~                        ~             '

    If barrier 136 had been complete, the crowd depth behind barrier 124A would
    have been limited to 3.5 m depth. The maximum load generated, as predicted by
    the 'leaning crowd1 model, by a crowd as dense as 10/sq m would have been some
    20% less than the test load.

    Given that the gap in the row of barriers behind 124A was greater than that
    recommended in the Green Guide (Ref 5), the test load of 6 kN/m was
    inadequate. At 5.4/sq m the model predicts that a crowd of 7 m depth would
    generate a load some 22% greater than the test load.

        9     CONCISIONS

        9.1     Collapse loads have been calculated for the spans 2\3 and 3\4 of barrier
                124A which was broken down during the Hillsborough Stadium incident.

        ^ •2    If the barriers had been of the original thickness at the supports, loads

                collapse thebarrier at spans 2\3 and 3\4 respectively. With the reduced
                wall thicknesses as measured, these ratios fall to 1.57 and 1.35 x test
                load.

        9.3     These figures have been compared with barrier loads generated from a
                'leaning crowd' model.

        9.4     In the corroded condition for a crowd of measured density 8/sq m, the
                span 3\4 of the barrier would have been broken down by     a     crowdof
                approximately 6 m depth behind the barrier. A crowd ofsome 7 m depth
                existed directly behind span 3\4.

        9.5     If a crowd density of 5.4/sq m is assumed, the same tube would have
    \           required about 7.5 m of crowd to break it down.

SENDING TESTS TO DETERMINE THE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF THE WROUGHT

A1 •1   THE NEED FOR BENDING TF.STS

Calculations of the loading to cause the collapse of barrier 124A requires a
knowledge of the mechanical properties of the wrought iron used in spans 2\3
and 3\4 of the top rail of the barrier.

RLSD's Metallurgy and Materials Section conducted tensile tests on two
specimens cut from the wrought iron tube used in spans 2\3 and 3\4 of barrier
 24A. However, there were reservations about the use of the results of these
tests in calculations of the collapse load of this barrier because:


(i)     tests conducted on small specimens of a material that is known to have a
        heterogeneous structure may not provide results that are representative
        of a large sample;

(ii)    the tubes that had formed spans 2/3 and 3/4 were found to be permanently
        bent when they were recovered after the incident; it is known that the
        yield stress of wrought iron is likely to be affected by its previous
        loading history, and that wrought iron is sensitive to post-yield
        strain-hardening;

(iii) bending moments introduce compressive stresses as well as tensile
      stresses into the tube; we did not have data about the compressive
      properties of wrought iron that could be applied with reasonable
      confidence in calculations of the collapse load of barrier 124A.


It was the opinion of Smith and Games that data obtained from a bending test on
an undeformed sample of a similar wrought iron tube would be likely to be more
representative than the data obtained from tensile tests on small specimens.


A1.2    SELECTION OF THE TEST SAMPT.K

Barrier 129 was a six-span barrier situated in the North-West Pen (Pen 5) of th
West terraces. It appeared to be of a similar construction to barrier 124A and
its top rail was not obviously bent. We assisted in the removal of the
complete assembly of barrier 129 from the West terraces to RLSD's premises.
Mr J G Tattersall of RLSD's Metallurgy and Materials Section confirmed that
the length of the top rail selected for testing was made from wrought iron.

    The elastic bending equation is expressed as:

                   I     y        R

    where M is the bending moment applied to the beam
          I is the second moment of area of the cross-section
          a is the fibre stress on the material of the beam
          y is the distance of a fibre from the neutral axis
          E is Young's Modulus for the material of the beam
          R is the radius of curvature of the neutral axis at the cross-section
          considered

    The second moment of area (I) for a circular section tube can be shown to
    be:

    Equation (4) shows that as the bending moment is increased the outermost
    fibres will be the first to reach the yield stress (ay) of the material. The
    relationship between load and deflection will cease to be linear when the
    outermost fibres are subjected to the yield stress of the material. Plastic
    deformation will be initiated and will spread inwards towards the neutral axis
    if the bending moment continues to increase. The outermostfibres of ahollow
    circular section of outer diameter D are situated at adistance D/2 from   the
    neutral axis, i.e. y - D/2.

     E and I are both constants, therefore R is proportional to H. Equation (1)
     shows that M is uniform over the central span (1) of the beam. Provided the
     loaded beam remains in an elastic condition, its radius of curvature R over
     the central span will also be uniform i.e. the deflected shape of the central
     span will be an arc of a circle.

     From the geometrical properties of a circle it can be shown that if 1 »                       c:

     where       R is the radius of curvature of the central span
                 1 is the length of the central span

     W/c is the gradient of the elastic, linear region of the load-deflection

     The remaining terms in Equation (9) are known constants and therefore E can be
     evaluated.

If an appropriate value is known for a [, then the theoretical maximum bending
strength nay be calculated from Equation (12) and its value compared with the
experimental maximum bending strength obtained from the test to check the
validity of the calculation.


Equipment for conducting the bending tests

We designed and constructed equipment of the type shown diagrammatically in
Fig Al.l that was suitable for installation in RLSD's 1 MN (100 tonf)
tension\compression testing machine. The equipment was designed to accept a
sample with an overall span of 2 m and a central span of lm, the objective
being to minimize the point loads applied to the tube within the constraints
imposed by:

(i)   the overall length of sample available for testing;
(ii) the loading range of the testing machine;
(i-H) maximizing the length of tube subjected to a uniform bending moment
      in order to obtain representative results

A spring-tensioned potentiometric displacement transducer was used to measure
deflections of the tube. The transducer had a range of 760 mm and was actuated
by a flexible wire, the end of which was attached to the mid-span of the tube.
The transducer was mounted on the loading rig so as to measure deflections of
the central span between its loading points.

The output from the potentiometric transducer was connected to a digital
voltmeter and the assembly calibrated and adjusted to provide a direct digital
reading of displacement, in millimetres, with a resolution of 0.1 mm. The
calibrated testing machine was operated on the lowest range of 100 kN, the
force being displayed in digital form with a resolution of 0.1 kN. Fig Al.2
shows a general view of the assembled equipment prior to conducting a test.

The testing machine was controlled manually \rtiilst simultaneous readings were
taken of force and deflection. Fig Al.3 shows a sample in an advanced stage of
plastic deformation. Two samples from the top rail of barrier 129 were tested,
and the force\deflection graphs obtained from the results of these tests are
shown in Figs A l .4 and A l .5.

Values of yield stress, Young's Modulus, and maximum bending moment were
calculated for both samples of tube, using data on the force\deflection graphs
and Equations (6) , (9) and (1) respectively. The theoretical maximum bending

The theoretical maximum bending moments were 15% and 16% less than the
experimental maximum bending moments obtained from Samples 1 and 2
respectively. It was the opinion of Smith and Games that these discrepancies
were .too great to justify using the experimentally determined yield stresses
to calculate the collapse load of barrier 124A.

They decided to use a 'flow stress' in their calculations of the collapse ],oad
   barrier 124A. The 'flow stresses' of Samples 1 and 2 were obtained by
transposing Equation (10) into the form:

         Me    —

where cj is the 'flow stress' for the material

barrier 129 are shown in the following Table:

A2.i     B ffijCTJOj OF THE PLASTIC COLIAPSE OF A   REAM


Bending moments are produced on a beam by the load that it is supporting.
These bending moments are resisted by moments of resistance produced by
tensile and compressive stresses developed on the cross-sectional area of the
beam.

A beam of ductile material, with a span that is large in comparison to its
cross-sectional dimensions, will fail by plastic collapse when the bending
moment creates sufficient plastic hinges along its span to transform the beam
      m a structure to a mechanism. A plastic hinge is formed when the tensile
and compressive stresses exceed the yield strength of the material throughout
the depth of the beam's cross-section.

If the monents of resistance that are developed at the plastic hinges can be
determined, then the principle of Virtual Work may be used to calculate the
bending moment, and therefore the loading, that will cause the beam to
collapse.

Simple plastic theory expresses the maximum moment of resistance (Mp) that can

resistance) as the product of its plastic section modulus (ZD) and a limiting

This relationship makes the following assumptions about the material of the
beam:    ■ /

(i)  an idealized rigid-plastic relationship exists between stress and strain,
i.e. detomation does not occur until a limiting value of stress' (aj) 'is '  ''
reached, after which large deformations are developed whilst this stress
remains constant;

(ii) the behaviour of the material is the same in compression as in tens ion.

The tensile yield stress of the material (ay) is commonly used in Equation (1)
when strain-hardening (work-hardening) of the material may be neglected. When
strain-hardening of the material cannot be ignored then it is customary to use
a 'flow stress' (a f) having a value between the yield stress and the ultimate
stress.

 Experience has shown that this simple plastic theory can predict the failure
 of beams by plastic collapse with an accuracy that is acceptable for practical
'purposes.


A2.2

If the material of a section that is subjected to pure bending exhibits the
same Xdeal rigid-plastic behaviour in both tension and costpression, then Zo
can be shown to be equal to the First Moment of Are*        cross-section
about its neutral axis (or unstrained fibre). Furthermore, iji these
circumstances, the neutral axis will coincide with the centroid of the area of
the cross-section.

The fully plastic section modulus for a hollow circular cross section of ideal
rigid-plastic material and uniform wall thickness can be shown to be either:



Zp -


where D - outer diameter
and   d - inner diameter



                                                                                   (2 )

where t - wall thickness

Mr.>J G Tattersall of RLSD's Metallurgy and Materials Section had made
ultrasonic measurements of the wall thicknesses of the wrought iron tube that
had formed the^top rail of crush barrier 124A. These measurements caused us to
conclude that it was reasonable to use Equation (2) to calculate Zp for the
top rail in the mid-span region of spans 2\3 and 3\4 of barrier 124A The
measured dimensions and their corresponding plastic section moduli are shown
in the following Table.

Both ends of the tubular sections that had formed spans 2\3 and 3\4 had
fractured; the ends of the spans were deformed, severely corroded, and had
variable wall thicknesses. It was our opinion that the variability of the wall
thicknesses rendered Equation (2) unsuitable for calculating values of Z at
the ends of spans 2\3 and 3\4, and that these values would have to be   P
determined by numerical integration.

Mr Tattersall provided us with sketches that showed wall thicknesses at the
fractured ends of spans 2\3 and 3\4. We used a computer-aided draughting (CAD)
system to draw our best Impression of the cross-section at each end of spans
 ' and 3V» before deformation failure occurred. Our re-construction of the
cross-sections are shown in Figs A2.1 to A2.4.

We used the facilities of the CAD system to assist us with the numerical
integrations. Each cross-section was divided into strips of 2 mm width, with
the exception of the last strip whose width was determined by the outer
dimension of the section. A vertical axis was then drawn in the estimated
position of the centroid (neutral axis). Each elemental area of tube
thickness, with the exception of those adjacent to the estimated position of
the centroid was successively magnified by the CAD system and then accurately
cross-hatched. The CAD system then automatically calculated the area of each
cross-hatched element.

The sum of the elemental areas to the right of the estimated centroidal axis
were compared with the sum of those to the left; the centroidal axis beine in
its correct position when it divides the cross-sectional area into two equal
parts. The position of the centroidal axis was adjusted and the process
repeated iteratively until the areas to the right and the left of the axis


Each known elemental area of the tubular wall was then mutiplied by its
distance from the centroidal axis to obtain the First Moment of Area of each
element. A supination of the First Moments of Area for all the elements
provided total First Moment of Area for the complete cross-section. The
results obtained during successive stages of the calculation are tabulated in
Figs A2.1 to A2.4.

The plastic section moduli that we obtained by numerical integration of the
re-constructed cross-sections at the ends of spans 2\3 and 3\4 from barrier
124A are shown in the following Table.

A../LEANING CROWD' MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE LOADS fiRMFRATED BY
A BARRIER                                        ----------

Consider a person on the nth step behind a barrier. The whole crowd is assumed
to be up on its toes, inclined forward at an angle J, in a fashion which would
be adopted to obtain a view of an incident in front of the etrowd. The
spectator is leaning forward on a support provided by the person in front and
is thus subject to supporting force Pn, from the front and to a toppling force
Pn-1 , from the person behind, offset by the terrace step height h.

                                n— i
                                                         h *b     Step Height

For the person immediately behind the barrier, if the barrier is at the push
height, then clearly Pn would be transmitted to the barrier. In general the
barrier is lower than this, and the push is probably transmitted to the
barrier by bending at mid-height for the few rows of people just behind the
barrier. If this were not so, the person at the barrier would be subjected to
a large turning moment. The exact details of this force feed to barrier height
are not yet clear, but for this purpose it is assumed that P^, where n is the
number of steps behind the barrier in question, is the force on the barrier.

If the crowd density is N/sq m, then there are Nw persons/unit length on each
step, thus we obtain the force/unit length on the barrier as:

                         N w mg H sin0           h      n
Force/unit length      - — ----------     1 + -------       - 1

which is the expression evaluated on Fig 2. A 'lean' angle of 10 deg has been
estimated as a reasonable value to use in the calculation; other parameters are
declared on the Figure.

It should be noted that no previous work can be found in the literature
concerning this type of calculation. Existing design rules for barriers appear
to rely on empiricism together with limited experimental testing. Caution
should be exercised in the use of this new model, which requires experimental
substantiation.

       1     INTRODUCTION

      Following the incident at Hillsborough Stadium, Dr Nicholson provided me with
      several albums of photographs. He told me that these had been supplied to him
      by the West Midlands Police. He said that they contained some photographs of
      the spectators in 'pens' 3 and 4 taken at Hillsborough Stadium and that they
      had been taken at about the time that the game commenced. He asked me to
      provide him with a scientifically-based estimate of the number of persons in
      'pen' 3 and in 'pen' 4, and the crowd packing density (number of persons per
      square metre) in these 'pens'.

      I was also provided with a dimensioned drawing showing a plan view of 'pens' 3
      and 4. The drawing had been prepared by Ralph Brade & Associates, Consulting
      Engineers, Sheffield, at the request of Dr Nicholson; it was numbered 1340/02
      Rev A and was dated 3/5/89. I used this drawing to establish the locations of
      the crush barriers in 'pens' 3 and 4 and to calculate the areas of these 'pens'.

      1 was assisted in this work by Mr G A C Games, a Senior Scientific Officer of
      RLSD's Mechanical Engineering Section and Mrs S M Barker of RLSD's Mechanical
      Design Unit.

      2      PHOTOGRAPHS USED FOR COUNTING THE NUMBER OF PERSONS

      2.1      PHOTOGRAPHS TAKEN ON 15 APRIL 1989 SHOWING 'PENS' 2 AND 3 - PR1/7A AND
               PR1/8A

      Two prints of the West Terrace were selected by Mr Games and myself from the
      albums of photographs. These prints were labelled PR1/7A and PR1/8A. West
      Midlands Police informed Dr Nicholson that these photographs were taken by a
      police photographer, Mr P Rich of the South Yorkshire Police, from a fixed
      position in the South"TTtanil'. The photographs were marked with a time of 15.03.
      The field of view on the two photographs overlapped and by identifying the
      same landmarks on each, it was possible to overlay the photographs to form a
      continuous view of the crowd. The prints from the albums were too small for
      further work, and I therefore requested that enlargements be provided. West.
      Midlands Police subsequently provided enlargements of the prints and these
      were overlapped, as described above, and taped together.

      2 -2    PHOTOGRATHS TAKEN ON 22 MAY 1989 SHOWING THE WEST TERRACE WHEN EMPTY -
y p           PR10/A2 TO PR10/A5

      I could not identify the positions of barriers within the 'pens' from the
      combined photographs PR1/7A and PR1/8A. Dr Nicholson therefore requested West
      Midlands Police to arrange for Mr Rich, using the same equipment as used on
      the day of the incident, from the same position, to take a set of overlapping
      photographs which showed the empty West Terrace. Common landmarks were
      identified on these prints and a subset, marked with numbers PR10/A2 to
      PR10/A5, were then overlapped to form a panoramic view of the empty terrace.



      2.3     PHOTOGRAPH TAKEN 15 APRIL 1989 SHOWING 'PENS' 2,3 AND 4 - MPlA-14

      Other photographs taken on the day of the incident showed larger areas of the
      terrace. Photograph MPlA-14, taken from the North Stand, showed a long view of
      'pens' 2,3 and 4 and was marked with a time of 14^2. Dr Nicholson requested
      enlargements of the photograph and these were provSJed by West Midlands
      Police.

      2.4    PHOTOGRAPH TAKEN 15 APRIL 1989 SHOWING AREAS OF 'PENS' 3 AND 4 BEHIND THE
             GOAL AREA OF THE WEST TERRACE - 148.3

     Dr Nicholson provided me with two overlapping photographs, marked 148.3, which
     had been obtained from the West Midlands Police. T ^ ^ n T o m a C l W ' w a s _available
     as regards the time that the photograph was taken. On the basis of my
     examination of "tfie other photographs, the fact that several spectators were
     already on the field and that the players were still on the .pitch, it is
     evident that it was taken at approximately 15.00. It showed a view of the
     crowd in 'pens' 3 and 4 and was taken from in front of the West Terrace goal.
     The photograph appeared to be taken from a position low down, possibly at
     ground level. I considered it to be unsuitable for obtaining an absolute count
     of the number of occupants of 'pens' 3 and 4 but that it 'could be used to
     estimate comparative densities in these 'pens'.

     3     DIGITISING PROCEDURES llsr.n

     Digitising is a means of transferring the positional data of physical points
     shown in graphical material, eg photographs, into a computer file. The
     graphical material to be digitised is attached to the surface of a digitising
     tablet, which resembles a large drawing board. The tablet consists of a
%    plastic working surface, AO in size, over a closely packed grid of horizontal
     and vertical wires. These wires are continually fed with electrical pulses
     from the digitiser controller. To identify the points to be digitised a hand
     held stylus is used; this is a 'pen' shaped device with spring loaded pointer
     set in one end. When the pointer is pressed onto the surface at the point to
     be digitised, a switch contact is made in the stylus enabling the pulses in
     the wire grid to be detected. The time delay between sending a pulse and
     receiving it at the stylus is directly proportional to the distance travelled
     by the pulse and hence the stylus position. These delays are measured by the
     controller equipment and translated into positions in both the horizontal and
     vertical directions. This information is then transferred into a computer
     file.

     The information stored in the file can be accessed by a computer aided
     draughting (CAD) program for subsequent graphical display and manipulation (eg
     scaling).Plotp of the manipulated information can be created using a pen
     plotter; tlie figures in this report were created in this manner, the position
     of each person being shown by an asterisk.
(m
     The photographs were secured to the digitiser surface, in turn, and a sheet of
     transparent plastic film was placed over them. The position of every
     discernible person on the photographs was digitised using the centre of the
     persons head as an identification point. As the position of each person was
     digitised a mark was made on the transparent film at the person's head to
     ensure that no person was digitised twice. Great care was taken in the
     identification of individual persons and only those people that could be
     positively discerned were included in the digitising.

     3.1    DIGITISING THE CROWD FROM PHOTOGRAPHS PR1/7A AND PR1/8A

     The overlapping photographs PR1/7A and PR1/8A were positioned on the
     digitising tablet and the boundary details were entered into the CAD system as
     described in Section 3. The outlines of people outside the 'pens' who were
     'masking' people within were included in thin procedure.

  The head of every discernible person in the crowd was digitised to produce
  the drawing PR178A, Fig 1 is based on this drawing.

  3.2     DIGITISING THE CROWD FROM THE REMAINING PHOTOGRAPHS

  The sane digitising procedures were used with photographs MPlA-14 and 148.3,
  again digitising only positively discernible individuals. Figs 2 and 3 show’
  the digitised information from MPlA-14.

  3.3     DIGITISING THE CRUSH BARRIERS FROM PHOTOGRAPHS PR10/A2 to PR10/A5

  Overlapping photographs, PR10/A2 to PR10/A5, were positioned on the digitising
  surface and the crush barriers, fences and wall boundaries were digitised into
  the CAD system as a separate drawing.


  4     CAD MANIPULATION OF THE niGITISED DATA

  4.1    NUMBER OF PERSONS IN THE WHOLE AREA OF 'PEN' 3

  Drawing PR178A (Fig 1) showed asterisks representing people in part of 'pen' 2
  and part of 'pen' 3. The drawing did not include all of 'pen' 3. because nf
I      limited view in the .photographs , and therefore an overall count for the
» 'pen' could not be made using the drawing shown in Fig 1 alone.

 The editing facilities of the CAD system were used on drawing PR178A to delete
 the asterisks representing the occupants of 'pen' 2, and produced the drawing
 shown in Fig 4. The CAD system was then used to overlay and position the
 drawing made from photographs PR10/A2 to PR10/A5, as summarized in Section
 3.3, on the drawing of Fig 4 by matching common landmarks on each drawing. The
 resulting drawing displayed the full extent of 'pen' 3, but only contained
 that part of the crowd shown on the original photographs PR1/7A and PR1/8A,
 causing part of 'pen' 3 to appear to be empty.

  I used the facilities of the CAD system to estimate the number of persons in
 ^Elils missing part~erf~t!ie~~ercrgd-by cieaLing~a'~*ipaXcTrr of the "ganng-Klzfe and— —
  shape as the apparently empty part of 'pen' 3. fRis”'patch' was superimposed
  on the populated area of 'pen' 3 and the resulting 'crowd patch' copied to the
  apparently empty part of 'pen' 3. The resulting drawing is shown in Fig 5, the
  crush barriers having been omitted for clarity and the 'crowd patch' being
  shown in bold outline. I used the automatic counting facility of the CAD
  system to count the number of heads (asterisks) shown on this drawing.

 4.2     NUMBER OF PERSONS IN ROWS WITHIN 'PEN' 3

  I was concerned about the difficulty in discerning individual heads near the
^ -front of pen' 3. I also wished to have some measure of the variation"ot crowd
  density across the depth of this 'pen'. Therefore 'pen' 3 was divided into
  rows parallel to the front boundary fence. Using the crush barriers, digitised
  from photographs PR10/A2 to PR10/A5, as demarcations to divide 'pen' 3 into
  four parallel rows numbered from Row 1 (front row) to Row 4 (rear row).

 Using the overlaying facility of the CAD system the crush barriers were
 superimposed on the drawing shown in Fig 5. The top rail of each barrier was
 then projected upwards to a common scaled height of 1.7 m, assuming this
 dimension to be a common height to the centre of every head. Identification of
 the occupants of 'pens' 3 and 4 had been undertaken by locating the position
                                                        Document No.   89   CO N T ’D

  of each person by an asterisk at the centre of their head. I therefore assume
  that any asterisk lying between adjacent projections of the top rails on the
  drawing represented a person standing between the corresponding crush
  barriers.

  Asterisks lying outside the appropriate projected top rails were deleted for
  each row in turn, leaving only asterisks representing people in that row. Any
  part of the crowd missing from a row, because of the limited*view on the
  photographs, was estimated using the 'crowd patch' method described in Section
    j       technique was used to produce the drawings shown in Figs 6,7 and 8,
  and the automatic counting facility of the CAD system then used to count the*
  number of persons in Rows 2,3 and 4.

         Estimation of the number of persons in the front row of 'pen' 3

  My uncertainty about identifying the heads of persons in the front row (row 1)
 _of— gen' 3 caused me to use an alternative method to estimate the number of
  persons in this row.

  Some ad-hoc tests had been undertaken on RLSD's premises to assess the
  discomfort experienced by persons in crowds of different packing densities.
  ^creasing numbers of volunteers of both sexes had stood in a closed vestibule
  which had a floor area of 2.8 sq m. The criterion adopted in these tests for
  determining the acceptability of different crowd packing densities was that no
  person should feel physically distressed. Each test lasted approximately 2
, minutes. The tests suggested that a crowd density of 10 persons/sq m could be
J gghjj?Ygd without distress, although the subjects felt they were "packed
  tightly".

 I considered the crowd packing densities that were obtained in Rows 4,3 and 2,
 and the results of RLSD's crowd packing tests. I then decided that the best
 estimate of the number of persons in the front row of 'pen' 3 would be obtained
 by, multiplying the plan area (in square metres) of the front row by a packing
 density of 10 persons/sq m. It is my opinion that this estimate would be
 neither unrealistically high nor unrealistically low.

 4.3   CROWD PACKING DENSITY IN 'PEN' 2

 I estimated the crowd packing density (number of persons/sq metre) in 'pen' 2
 by using similar procedures to those described in Section 4.2. Using the     ~
 drawing shown in Fig 1 a columnar area was created within 'pen' 2 by
 projecting the stanchions of the front boundary fence to the back boundary
 wall, the projection lines defining the width of the columnar area. All
 asterisks outside this column were deleted and the missing part of the column
 filled using the 'crowd patch' method to produce the drawing shown in Fig 9.
 The asterisks within the columnar area were then automatically counted and,
 knowing the ground area (distance between stanchions multiplied by overall'
 depth of 'pen'), it was possible to calculate the crowd packing density within


 4.4   COMPARISON OF CROWD PACKING DENSITY IN 'PENS' 3 AND 4

 I used photographs 148.3 to obtain a comparison of the crowd packing densities
 in 'pens' 3 and 4. Onto the drawing obtained by digitising photographs 148.3, a
 fixed rectangular area was superimposed in 'pens' 3 and 4. This rectangle was
 not intended to represent a specific ground area on the terraces, but rather

       procedure was repeated at different locations until 4 sets of counts had been
       obtained, at the positions shown in Fig 10, taking care to ensure that
       obstructions e.g. persons outside the terrace, did not protrude into the
       rectangular areas.

       5.1    NUMBER OF PERSONS IN 'PEN' 3 OBTAINED FROM PHOTOGRAPHS PR1/7A AND PR1/8A

       5 ** *1   j&iffber of persons identified directly from the photographs

       The number of persons counted automatically within 'pen' 3, on the basis of
       the number of heads directly identified with the digitising method, w a s K o f D
       To this must be added the number of persons in that part of the 'pen' not
       shown on the photographs but estimated by the 'crowd patch' method iej 334 J
       This results in a total figure of 1408. It is my opinion that this total is an
       underestimate of the number of persons within 'pen' 3; lack of clarity in the
       pnotographs made it difficult to identify individual heads near the front
       boundary wall and also people outside the 'pen' obscured parts of this area.

m      51,2      dumber of persons assessed by dividing the 'pen' into rows

       Table 1 shows my alternative assessment of the number of persons within 'pen' 3,
       based on the division of the 'pen' into four rows. Persons in Rows 4,3 and 2
       were identified directly from the photographs using the digitiser and 'crowd
       patch' methods and counted automatically. The number of persons in the front
       row (Row 1) were estimated on the basis of the plan area of the row and a
       crowd packing density of 10 persons/sq m. This alternative and preferred
       assessment of the number of persons in 'pen' 3 is ^ 5 7 6 ^

       Table 1 also shows the crowd packing densities for each of the four rows in
       'pen' 3. The crowd packing densities for Rows 4,3 and 2 are based on the number
       of persons identified with the digitiser and 'crowd patch' methods from
       photographs whilst that for Row 1 is a value assumed on the basis of tests
       made at RLSD.

       5.2    NUMBER OF PERSONS IN 'PENS' 3 AND 4 OBTAINED FROM PHOTOGRAPH MPlA-14

       Table 2 shows the number of persons in 'pens' 3 and 4 obtained by using the
y p    automatic counting facility of the CAD system, after they had been identified
       on photograph MPlA-14, using the digitising method.

       It was extremely difficult to differentiate between individual heads on
      -j>hot°gjaph MPlA-14 and only tKose heaHsTthat ■could'Tie definitely identified
       were digitised. I consider this to be the reason for obtaining a count of[678^
       persons in 'pen' 3 from photograph MPlA-14, a number which is low compare^tb
       the 1408 persons counted from photographs PR1/7A and PR1/8A and to my
       preferred estimate of 1576 persons.

      It is my opinion that the counts of 678 persons in 'pen' 3 and/821]persons in
      'pen' 4 should be regarded as being unrealistically low. It is^Slso my
      opinion that I obtained a much more reliable assessment of the number of
      persons in 'pen' 3 from the counts and estimate based on photographs PR1/7A and
      PR1/8A.

      Whilst the above figures cannot be used as a total count for the 'pens' I

      believe they can be used to compare crowd densities. Hie ground areas of
       pens' 3 and 4 are very similar (see table 1) and I consider that the counts
      o ained suggest that the crowd packing densities in 'pens' 3 and 4 were also
      s m ar. The larger count in 'pen' 4 can be partially attributed to the angle
      and position from which the photograph was taken, which enabled easier
      identification of individual heads in 'pen' 4 than in 'pen' 3.

      5.3     NUMBER OF PERSONS WITHIN A SAMPLE COLUMNAR AREA OF 'PEN* 2

      v                  Persons occupied a sample columnar area taken from the front
      boundary w a T T t o the rear boundary wall of 'pen' 2. The corresponding crowd
      packing density was 5.0 persons/sq m.

      5.4     COMPARISON OF THE NUMBER OF PERSONS IN 'PENS' 3 AND 4

      Table 3 summarizes the number of persons identified within different areas of
      the same size at four locations in each 'pen'. Although the numbers of persons
      should not be regarded as absolute values, because of the difficulty in clear
      identification, it is my opinion that they do serve to compare the crowd
      packing densities in 'pens' 3 and 4.
m
      Making allowance for the difficulty in identifying persons, I consider the
      differences between the numbers obtained in each of the four comparisons to be
      small. Additionally, there is no distinct bias to suggest an appreciable
      difference between the crowd packing densities in 'pens' 3 and 4; this is
      confirmed by the close agreement obtained between the average values of the
      four sample counts made for each 'pen'.

      6     SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

     6.1 I used photographs supplied by West Midlands Police, together with a
     drawing prepared by Ralph Brade & Associates, as the basis for my assessment
     o f ,the number of persons in parts of the West Terrace of Sheffield Wednesday
     Football Club's Hillsborough Stadium. I used the facilities provided by a
     computer-aided draughting system to assist in identifying and counting the
     number of persons within 'pens' on the West Terrace.

    1)6.2 In makiiig my assessment I assumed that a crowd packing density in one
          of pen* 3 was reproduced in another, adjacent part of it Additional Tv I
     was unable to obtain an acceptably accurate count of the persons between the
     front boundary wall and the nearest line of crush barriers in 'pen' 3 by the
     direct identification of heads on photographs. I therefore estimated the
     number of persons in this area of 'pen' 3 from considerations o f t H e crowd
     packing densities in other areas of the 'pen', together with results from an
     investigation of packing densities made on RLSD's premises. It is my opinion,
     based on a study of photographs of 'pens' 3 and 4, that my assumption and
     estimation were justified.

     6.3 My best assessment of the number of persons within 'pen' 3 is that fl576~j
     persons were present at 15.03 hours on 15 April 1989. It is my opinion t W
     1576 persons is unlikely to be an overestimate of the true number. It
     represents an average cr6w<Tp'acking density in 'pen' 3 of 8.4 persons/sq m,
     which exceeds the maximum value of 5.4 persons/sq m recommended in "Guide To
     Safety At Sports Grounds" (ref 1) by 56%

              crowd packing density within 'pen' 3 increased betv~an the rear
     boundary wall and the line of crush barriers nearest to the front boundary

 1   INTRODUCTION

As part of the investigation by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) into the
incident at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club's Hillsborough stadium on 15
April 1989, Mr A L Collins, a Scientific Officer, and Mr D Waterhouse, a
Principal Scientific Officer, of HSE's Research and Laboratory Services
Division (RLSD) calculated the maximum number of persons (the capacity) that
was appropriate for Pens 3 and 4, The calculations were based on their
interpretation of recommendations contained within the Home Office/Scottish
Office publication "Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds" (H M Stationery Office-
1986).                                                               J


2    ESTIMATIONS OF THE CAPACITIES OF PENS 3 AND 4

Dr Nicholson, a Deputy Director of RLSD's Safety Engineering Laboratory (SEL)
provided us with a drawing that he had received from Eastwood and Partners on
24 April 1989. The drawing was labelled Eastwood and Partners, was numbered
8945/lA, had the title "Sheffield Wednesday F.C. PLC Hillsborough Ground
Layout 1987" and was dated 16/4/87 with Revision A dated 21/10/87. This
drawing showed the capacity of one of the two central 'pens' of the West
terraces of the stadium to be 1,200 persons and that of the other to be 1,000
persons, i.e. the capacity of the combined area was 2,200 persons.

The interim report IR/L/ME/MM/89/1 prepared by RLSD for the Court of Inquiry
states that, "if 54 people per 10 sq m is assumed as the allowable packing
density for the West Terrace then the capacity of Pen 3 is 1015 and Pen 4 is
1036 making a total of 2051 for the combined area".

However, Paragraph 221 of the 1986 edition of the Home Office/Scottish Office
publication "Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds" (H M Stationary Office) states
"Where crush barriers meet the strength and spacing guidelines of Chapter 9
the capacity of a terrace or viewing, slope should be assessed from the area
available for standing by allowing a packing density of between 54 and 27
persons per 10 square metres depending upon the condition of the terrace or
slope".

We knew that RLSD's calculation had been made as a preliminary check of the
capacity assigned by Eastwood & Partners to the two central 'pens'. We
therefore examined two drawings that had been prepared for HSE by Ralph Brade
& Associates, Consulting Engineers, Midland Bank Chambers, 3 Sharrow Lane,
Sheffield. Drawing No 1340/02 Rev A, dated 3/5/89, showed a plan view of
Pens 3 and 4 on the West terraces and Drawing No 1340/03A Rev A, also dated
3/5/89, showed a section through part of the West terraces. These drawings are
reproduced, to a smaller scale, in Figs 1 and 2 respectively.

Our examination of these drawings caused us conclude that RLSD's nominal
maximum capacity 2051 persons for the central 'pens' might have to be reduced
to compensate for some departures from the recommendations of Chapter 9 of the
Guide. We therefore calculated capacities for Pens 3 and 4 on the basis of the
areas behind crush barriers and perimeter fences in which a crowd packing
density of 5.4 persons/sq m would be permissible, provided all other aspects
of the terraces conformed with the Guide's recommendations.

 3   MEIHOP OF CALCULATING THE REVISED MAXIMUM CAPACITIES OF PENS 3 AND 4

 The calculation of the revised maximum capacity of Pens 3 and 4 was based on
 our interpretation of Paragraph 113, Paragraph 225, and Table 1 of the Guide.

Paragraph 113 states: "Ideally, crush barriers should be provided along the
full width of a terrace, with gaps only at radial gangways".

Paragraph 225 states "The capacity of the terrace is calculated by multiplying
t e area available for standing by the appropriate packing density. The
following following formula may be used:

                                A
Capacity (Number of persons) - — x (27 to 54)
                                 10

where   A   is the area available for standing in square metres.

Table 1 recommends the maximum horizontal distance that should exist between
barriers conforming to the "greater" and the "lesser" strength requirements
when they are installed on "peak viewing areas" and on "other areas". We
classified Pens 3 and 4 as being 'peak viewing* areas because they were
behind a goal, and the barriers as conforming to the "greater strength
requirement" because this permitted greater horizontal distances.

Pens 3 and 4 did not have radial gangways, nor did their crush barriers extend
the full width of the terraces, gaps being present along the rows. We
therefore calculated the plan area of terrace behind each barrier (or
perimeter fence) by multiplying the length of the barrier by a 'permissible
depth behind it. This 'permissible depth' was either the maximum horizontal
distance between barriers that was recommended for "peak viewing" in Column A
of Table 1 of the Guide, or the existing distance between the barrier and the
next barrier (or wall) behind it, whichever was the least.

Brade's Drawing No 1340/03A showed the slope of Pens 3 and 4 to be 13 degrees
40 minutes. The recommended maximum horizontal distance between crush barriers
that corresponded to this slope was interpolated from Table 1 of the Guide as
being 3.9 m. Brade's Drawing No 1340/02 Rev A showed that the horizontal
distance between the rows of crush barriers in Pens 3 and 4 was usually 3.5 m,
i.e. the existing distance between the rows of crush barriers was usually
within the recommended maximum value.

The heights of the barriers were generally less than the values of 1.02 m to
1.12 m recommended in the Guide. However, we did not discount any of the crush
barriers in our calculations; no barrier had a height less than 81% of the
minimum recommended value, and our intention was to calculate a 'base'
capacity that could be further reduced because of other departures from the
Guide's recommendations.

We multiplied each plan area behind a barrier (sq m) by 5.4 persons/sq m and
truncated the product to obtain the number of persons appropriate to each
area. Fig 3 is a pictorial representation of the method of calculation, the
details of which are shown in Appendix 1. The total capacities of Pens 3 and 4
were then obtained by summing the numbers of persons appropriate to each area
behind a barrier. Our calculations showed the capacity of Pen 3 to be 822
persons and that of Pen 4 to be 871 persons, i.e. the combined capacity of the
central 'pens' was 1     persons.

4   ASSESSMENT OF REVISED CAPACITIES

The white areas of Fig 3 represent those parts of the terrace where, ideally,
persons should not stand, otherwise the thrust exerted on part of a crush
barrier by a crowd of 5.4 persons/sq m might exceed the force intended by the
Guide.

Our calculations did not include any reduction in capacity of the central
'pens' to compensate for departures from other recommendations contained in
the Guide. Brade's drawings indicated that departures from Paragraphs in the
Guide, other than those associated with the continuity (Paragraph 113) and
spacing (Table 1) of crush barriers, existed in the central 'pens', i.e.

Paragraph 92   - "A terrace step should not be less than 280 mm or more than
380 mm wide.   The preferred dimension is between 355 mm and 380 mm". Pens 3
and 4 had 33   terrace steps, of which 28 (85%) were slightly wider, (not more
than 10 mm),   than the maximum recommended width.

Paragraph 96 - "The aim should be to ensure that every spectator on the
terraces is within 12 metres of a gangway or exit so that spectators can move
quickly on to exit routes at the end of an event or in the event of an
emergency. This may be achieved by a pattern of gangways (not less than
1.1 metres wide) linked to the exit system". There were no gangways in Pens 3
and 4 and if the perimeter gates are not considered as exits, then
approximately 40% of the persons in these 'pens' were not within 12 m of an
exit.

Paragraph 110 - "In order to locate the top rail against that part of the body
most able to tolerate pressure the heights of crush barriers should be 1.02 m
to 1.12 m above the nosing of the step immediately behind the barrier, with a
preferred height of 1.1m" . Four of the five barriers in Pen 3 and six of the
nine barriers in Pen 4 did not conform with this recommendation.

Paragraph 114 - " Where barriers are not continuous between radial gangways,
the alignment of gaps in successive rows of barriers on a terrace should form
an angle of leSs than 60 degrees to the line of the barriers. There should be
no more than 2 consecutive gaps in any line of gaps". Two of the four 'paths
of gaps' in Pen 3 and one of the eleven 'paths of gaps' in Pen 4 did not
conform with the recommendation on alignment.

Paragraph 115 - " Where there are gaps in the line of crush barriers these
should be at least 1.1 m and not more than 1.4 m in width". Four of five gaps
in Pen 3 did not conform and nine of ten gaps in Pen 4 did not conform to a
literal interpretation of this recommendation. A more liberal interpretation,
relating the acceptability of the width of a gap to the resulting depth of
crowd that could form between two rows of barriers, resulted in four of five
gaps in Pen 3 and three of six gaps in Pen 4 not conforming, as shown in the
schematic plan of Fig 4.

Paragraph 215 - "For most major stadia, whether used for association football
or other sports, the pitch perimeter fence will be required either to prevent
access to parts of the pitch as mentioned above (Paragraph 214), or at least
to discourage attempts by spectators to enter the playing area. Gates or other
access points (minimum width of 1.1 m) should nevertheless be provided for use
in an emergency and, at those grounds where a perimeter track is used as part
of the exit system, for the departure of spectators at the end of an event.




                                                                        •        559
                                                                   Document No.   89   C O N T’D



Provision of such gates or access points is particularly important to allow
for access to the playing area (or track) where it is likely to be used as a
place of safety in an emergency. Such gates or access points should be
properly stewarded and clearly marked so that immediate access to the playing
area or perimeter track can be ensured". The gate to Pen 3 had a clearance
width of 0.81 m to 0.82 m and the gate to Pen 4 had a clearance width of
0.77 m to 0.79 m. The two gates in the perimeter fence of the central 'pens'
therefore did not conform with this recommendation.

It is our opinion that it might be advisable to reduce the.'base' capacities
of 822 persons for Pen 3 and 871 persons for Pen 4, because of these six
departures from the Guide's recommendations.


5   SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

5.1 We used recommendations contained within the 1986 edition of the Home
Off i-ce/Scottish Office publication "Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds" (the
Guide) to calculate revised maximum allowable capacities for Pens 3 and 4 of
the Vest terraces of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club's Hillsborough stadium.
We calculated the maximum allowable capacity of Pen 3 to beT822lpersons, and
that of Pen 4 to be f87 If persons. It is therefore our opinion tKat the combined
maximum allowable capacityof the two central 'pens' should not exceedfT7693|
persons, provided that all other aspects of the terraces conformed with the
Guide's recommendations.

5.2 Our calculations showed the capacity of Pen 3 to be less than that of
Pen 4. Eastwood & Partners Drawing~No~8945/lA dated 16/4/87 showed The
capacity of Pen 3 to be greater than that of Pen 4.

5.3 Our revised maximum allowable       combined capacity of 1,693 persons for the
two central 'pens' was 83% of that      initially calculated by RLSD, solely on the
basis of the area of Pens 3 and 4,      and was 77% of that shown on Eastwood &
Partners Drawing No 8945/1A, dated      16/4/87.

5.4 Our calculation of the revised capacities of Pens 3 and 4 did not include
any reduction that might be needed to compensate for some departures from the
Guide's recommendations in these 'pens'. These departures were associated
with:

(i)     the   width of the terrace steps.
(ii)    the   Tlistance of persons from gangways or exits:
(iii)   the   ^eights of crush barriers;
(iv)    the   aTjgrtmenc of _gaps in the rows of crush barriers;
(v)     the   width_of_gaps in the rows of crush barriers;
(vi)    the   w idth of the gates in the perimeter fence;

It is our opinion that the revised number of 1,693 persons for the maximum
combined capacity of Pens 3 and 4 should be reduced further because of these
six departures from the Guide's recommendations.

 1    INTRODUCTION

As part of the investigation by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) into the
incident at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club's Hillsborough stadium on
15 April 1989, Mr G A C Games, a Senior Scientific Officer, and
Mr D Waterhouse, a Principal Scientific Officer, of HSE's Research and
Laboratory Services Division (RLSD) visited Hillsborough stadium on 24 April,
   April and 28 April 1989. They investigated aspects of the turnstiles,
particularly those giving access to the terraces at the Leppings Lane end of
the ground.


2     THE SCOPE OF THE INVESTIg a t t nw

We examined a drawing labelled "Eastwood & Partners - Drawing No 8945/1A" that
Dr Nicholson had received from Eastwood & Partners on 24 April 1989 This
drawing had the title "Sheffield Wednesday F.C. PLC Hillsborough, Ground
Layout 1987" and was dated 16/4/87. The drawing showed the number of persons
(capacity) allocated to each designated zone of the stadium and showed the
location and designation of turnstiles around the perimeter of the stadium. In
this report the term 'West terraces' is used as the collective name for
the terraced zones at the West, or Leppings Lane end, of the stadium.

The drawing showed two groups of turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end of the
stadium. It appeared that group A to G could be used for admissions to the
West terraces and the West Stand, and that some of group 1 to 16 could be used
for admissions to the North Stand and some for admissions to the west terraces
and the West Stand.

Our investigation was divided into three parts:

i)     tests to assess the difficulty experienced by an operator in releasing
       the rotary 'gate' of a turnstile when a horizontal force was applied to
       to one of its 'wings' (or 'paddles');

ii)    tests to assess the accuracy of the computerized system for counting and
       recording the number of persons admitted through the turnstiles in
       Leppings Lane;

iii) calculation of the average number of persons to be admitted through each
     of the turnstiles if all zones of the stadium were filled to their
     designated maximum capacity, i.e. calculation of the average admission
     requirement of the turnstiles.

We were assisted by other staff of RLSD working under our supervision and to
our instructions. Our tests to assess the effect of a horizontal force on the
'gate' of a turnstile were observed by officers of the West Midlands Police.
Our investigation of the accuracy of the computerized system for counting and
recording admissions through the turnstiles was supervised by Detective Chief
Inspector Tope of the West Midlands Police.

     3.1      TURNSTILES IN THE GROUP A TO G

    We examined all the turnstiles in the group A to G. Turnstiles   C     to G appeared
    to be of the same type, but turnstiles A and B were of a different pattern and
    were slightly different from each other. However, the principle of operation
    of all the turnstiles in group A to G appeared to be the same,

    Fig 1 shows a view of a typical turnstile in group A to G. Each turnstile had
    four equally spaced 'wings' on its 'gate', which was attached to a spindle. It
    was apparent that a quarter-revolution of the spindle was intended to admit
    one person when the pedal of a pivoted locking lever, shown in Fig 2, was
    depressed by an operator. A counter-weight on this lever normally      causedits
    inner end to engage with one of four teeth on the lower rachet    of   a dualcam
    assembly attached to the base of the spindle, as shown in Fig 3. Depression of
    the pedal raised the inner end of the lever, allowing the spindle to rotate
    until the upper cam drove the inner end of the locking lever back down into
    engagement with the next tooth of the lower rachet. The cam/rachet mechanism
    locked the spindle after each quarter-revolution of the 'gate', the operator
    having to depress the pedal of the locking lever each time that he wished to
    admit a person. The rachet on the upper part of the dual cam assembly
    prevented the 'gate' from being rotated in the reverse direction.

    Our examination of the turnstiles caused us to suspect that a person pushing,
    or being pushed, against a 'wing' of a turnstile might cause the operator to
    have difficulty in depressing the pedal to release the 'gate'. It was our
    opinion that difficulties in releasing the 'gate' might reduce the flow
    through a turnstile to below the maximum notional rate of 750 persons/hour
    that was suggested in the Home Office/Scottish Office publication "Guide to
    Safety at Sports Grounds" (H M Stationery Office: 1986).

    On 24 April 1989 we conducted tests on the turnstiles designated B and C to
    investigate the relationship between the horizontal force applied to a 'wing'
    of a turnstile and the force required on the pedal of the locking lever to
    release its 'gate'.
#   3.2      METHOD OF TESTING

    Fig 4 shows how a horizontal force was applied to the mid-span of a 'wing' of
    a turnstile by means of a baulk of timber, a nylon sling, a tensile loadcell
    and a 'pull-lift' rachet-hoist apparatus. The loadcell, connected between the
    sling and the 'pull-lift', measured the force applied to the 'wing' of the
    turnstile on a digital display unit. We calibrated this display unit before
    making the tests by suspending standard test weights from the loadcell.

    We used the 'pull-lift' to apply a force to a 'wing' of the turnstile and then
    gently placed standard test weights on the pedal of the pivoted locking lever,
    as shown in Fig 5, until the 'gate' was released. This procedure was repeated
    with increasing forces applied to the 'wing'. The results obtained from the
    tests are shown in the graphs of Fig 6.

    The roller-plunger micro-switches on the turnstiles in Leppings Lane were

    probes. The compliant probe on this type of switch was deflected horizontally
    by the vertical tube of each 'wing' as the 'gate' rotated, and the correct

     display a list identifying each turnstile and showing the number of admissions
       rough it, i.e. the number of pulses transmitted from the turnstile. The
     count of the number of admissions through each turnstile was incremented
     continuously and the admissions through the groups of turnstiles allocated to
     the zones of the stadium were displayed as accumulating totals.

     The system was therefore designed to count the total number of admissions
     through each turnstile and to provide a record of the accumulating total

       ,a^ ’ est terraces, etc. Financial information corresponding to the
     admission price at each turnstile was also displayed.

     The rated maximum capacity of each zone of the stadium was displayed on the
     VDU A warning was provided, by means of flashing inverse contrast on the
       splay, when the capacity of each zone was within 1,000 persons of its
     maximum designated capacity.

^   The micro-computer system did not have 'backing' storage in the form of disc
™   or magnetic tape. Long term storage was confined to obtaining a copy of the
     display on the VDU from a printer, although the display on the screen was
     retained in the memory of the computer until a command was typed from the VDU
     to clear this part of the memory. There were no facilities at present to
     undertake any further processing of the data held in the central storage of
     the computer.

    Mr Houldsworth said that on 15 April, when he realised that a serious incident
                 °n the WeSt terraces. ^ had printed three copies of the display
    °D          Apart from the relatively few turns of the 'gates' made by HSE's
    staff whilst examining turnstiles A to G, the data in the computer memory and
    displayed on the VDU was the data that he had copied on 15 April.

    4.2 ASSESSMENT OF THE ACCURACY OF THE COUNTING AND RECORDING OF ADMISSIONS
        THROUGH THE TURNSTILES IN LEPPINGS LANE

    We assessed the accuracy of the system for counting and recording admissions
       rough the turnstiles in Leppings Lane. We concentrated the assessment on
A   turnstiles designated A to G because they were labelled both "Standing Only"
    and "Leppings Lane Standing".

    However, we made some assessment of the accuracy of the counting system on the
    turnstiles in group 9 to 16 because, although they were labelled "West Stand"
    they might have provided access to the West terraces.

    4*2.1   Method of assessment

    Detective Chief Inspector Tope monitored turnstiles A to G whilst we observed
    Mr Houldsworth take a copy from the printer of the accumulated admissions
    displayed on the VDU. The control room was then locked and we accompanied
    Mr Houldsworth whilst he simulated 50 admissions through each turnstile in
    group A to G by rotating each 'gate' through 50 quarter-turns, at a speed
    corresponding to approximately 2.25 sec/admission (1600 admissions/hour).
    Detective Chief Inspector Tope then monitored turnstiles A to G again whilst
    we returned to the control room with Mr Houldsworth and observed him take
    another copy from the printer of the display on the VDU.

    The relationship between the force applied to the 'wing' of a turnstile and
    the force required to depress its release pedal showed consideraS^ 'scatter'
    in“t h r D o s i M n       in^ Vi^Ual t6StS might be attributable to differences ‘
    in the position at which the horizontal forces were applied to a 'wing'
    Fwthermore, we could not ensure that test weights were always placed on the
       li i       exactly the same distance from the pivot of the locking lever and we
    would have preferred to have applied smaller increments of weight to tie

    Fig 6 suggests that, typically, a pedal force - 0.56 x 'wing' force would be

    would be required to release turnstile C, i.e. turnstile C required a force on

     its pedal that typically was 2.8 tines greater than that for turnstile B. We
      ad observed that turnstiles A and B appeared to differ in detail from
     turnstiles C to G.

     turnstiles A and B would be likely to behave in a similar Banner and that
     turnstile C was representative of those in the group C to G.

    Variations about the predicted average force required on the pedal ranged
    between approximately plus 70% and minus 44% for turnstile B, and between
    approximately plus 55% and minus 36% for turnstile C. The stated relationships
    provide only approximate indications of the forces that might be needed to
    release turnstiles in the group A to G.

    6 2 I,*!!?       °F THE SYSTEM FOR COUNTING AND RECORDING ADMISSIONS THROUGH
        THE TURNSTILES IN LEPPINGS LANE

    Table 1 shows that the first set of 50 quarter-turns of turnstiles A to G
    caused turnstile E to record six more 'admissions' than we had counted, and
    turnstile G to record one less 'admission' than we had counted.

    The second set of 50 quarter-turns of turnstiles A to G caused turnstile E to
    record the correct number of 'admissions' and turnstile G to record three
    fewer 'admissions' than we had counted. Turnstile C recorded three more
     admissions' than we had counted, but we were interrupted during the counting
    and it is our opinion that the discrepancy was probably attributable to this
    interruption.

    Wf i”fPected turnstile E and concluded that the discrepancy obtained during
    the first 50 quarter-turns arose from vertical upward 'float' of the spindle
    in its bearings and the position of the roller-plunger micro-switch. The
I   combined effect was that the micro-switch occasionally appeared to be actuated
    spuriously by protrusions on the cast surfaces of the lugs of the upper
    cruciform boss that connected the 'gate' to the spindle. The error only
    appeared during the first set of 50 quarter-turns and we concluded that it
    was likely to have occurred during the first few 'admissions' after a period
    of inaction. It is our opinion that the error would not persist throughout a
    period of continuous operation.

    Turnstile G recorded fewer 'admissions' than we had counted during both sets
    of 50 quarter-turns. We observed that the lugs of the upper cruciform boss on
    turnstile G only just made contact with the roller on the plunger of its
    micro-switch. We concluded that this uncertain contact caused turnstile G to
    record less than the correct number of 'admissions'. It is our opinion that
    this under-recording was likely to persist throughout a period of continuous
    operation and that the number of admissions recorded by turnstile G was likely
    to be less than the correct value.

    Turnstile 14 recorded one more 'admission' than we had counted whilst making
    the 10 quarter-turns on turnstiles 9 to 16. However, we suspected that this

                                                                                        574

discrepancy arose because the 'gate' of turnstile 14 was in a mid-travel
position when the test commenced. Our tests therefore suggested that
turnstiles 9 to 16 would provide an accurate record of the number of persons
admitted through them.

We concluded that the computerized system would be likely to record the total
number of admissions through group A to F of the turnstiles with an accuracy
that was within 1%. In a test turnstile G recorded 6% less than the correct
number of admissions, but we concluded that the uncertainty in the operation of
its micro-switch might cause the under-recording to be more severe than this.

We concluded that the turnstiles in group 9 to 16 would record the correct
number of admissions.

6.3   AVERAGE ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS OF THE TURNSTILES

Table 2 shows that the stadium's maximum capacity of 54,324 persons was served
by 83 turnstiles on 15 April 1989, and that 45% (24,447 persons) of the
stadium's capacity were to be admitted from Leppings Lane, where 28% (23) of
the turnstiles in use were sited.

Table 2 has been arranged in descending order of the average number of
admissions required from each group of turnstiles serving the different zones
of the stadium. The highest admission requirement was 1,443 persons/turnstile
for the West terraces, followed by 988 persons/turnstile for the North Stand
Seating and by 744 persons/turnstile for the West Stand Seating. The admission
requirement of the turnstiles for the West terraces was therefore almost 3.5
times greater than that for the South Stand Uncovered Seating (the lowest
admission requirement) and approximately 2.9 times greater than that for Spion
Kop, the other terrace zone.

Six groups of turnstiles served the stadium and the three groups with the
highest admission requirements were sited in Leppings Lane. The overall
average admission requirement of the 23 turnstiles in Leppings Lane was
1063 persons/turnstile.

The other overall average admission requirements were 500 persons/turnstile
for the turnstiles in Penistone Road and 493 persons/turnstile for those in
the Concourse behind the South Stand. The overall average admission
requirement of the turnstiles in Leppings Lane was therefore approximately
twice that of the turnstiles sited elsewhere around the perimeter of the
stadium.

We have therefore concluded that, if a maximum capacity crowd was to be
admitted, the longest delays would be likely to be experienced by persons
required to enter the stadium through the turnstiles in Leppings Lane;
particularly long delays would be likely to be experienced by those with
tickets for the West terraces. We would therefore expect larger crowds to form
outside the turnstiles in Leppings Lane than at other places of entry to the
stadium.

 7     SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

 7.1    THE EFFECT OF A HORIZONTAL FORCE ON THE 'GATES' OF TURNSTILES SERVING
        THE WEST TERRACES

7.1.1 Our tests suggested that, typically, the force needed on the pedal of a
turnstile to release its 'gate' was 0.56 x the force on a 'wing' for
turnstiles A and B, and 1.56 x the force on a 'wing' for turnstiles C to G.
Variations of up to 70% were obtained in the force required to depress the
pedal and these relationships should serve only as an indication of the forces
that might be needed to release the turnstiles serving the West terraces.

7.1.2 A turnstile operator weighing 750 N (169 lbf or approximately
12 stones) or less might have difficulty in releasing the 'gate' of turnstiles
A or B if the horizontal forceapplied to a'wing' was 1340 N (301 lbf) or
more because he might have toexert a force of more than his weight on the
pedal to release the 'gate'. The same operator might have difficulty in
r^1fo«i«g the ,gate* of a turnstile in the group C to G if a horizontal force
of 480 N (108   lbf) or more wasapplied to a 'wing'.

7.1.3 It is our opinion that the ease with which an operator could depress
the pedal would affect the time taken for a person to be admitted. Therefore a
thrust exceeding 480 N (108 lbf) that was imposed by a crowd on a person at
the 'gate' of a turnstile would be likely decrease the flow of persons through
the group of turnstiles A to G.

7.2     THE ACCURACY OF THE SYSTEM FOR COUNTING AND RECORDING ADMISSIONS THROUGH
        THE TURNSTILES IN LEPPINGS LANE

7.2.1 Our tests suggested that turnstiles &, B, C. D, and F would record the
correct number of admissions. It is our opinion that the error obtained during
the first test on turnstile E would be unlikely to persist during a period of
continuous operation. In otffopinion turnstiles A to F, as a group, would
record the number of admissions within an accuracy of approximately 1%.

7.2.2^ Our tests indicated that a persistent error was likely to occur in the
counting system of turnst^LeG^ During a period of continuous operation this
turnstile could repeateaIy"‘Tail to count some admissions, and the recorded
admissions ~coui<T be signiricantiy less tnan ttie correct number. We concluded
that the error in counting at turnstile G was probably attributable to
uncertainty of contact between the roller of the micro-switch and the four
lugs on the upper cruciform boss of the 'gate'.

7.2.3 Our tests suggested that turnstiles in the group 9 to 16 would record
the correct number of admissions.

7.3    AVERAGE ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS OF THE TURNSTILES

7.3.1 We have concluded that on 15 April 1989 the spectators were intended
enter the stadium through 83 turnstiles, of which 23 (28%) were sited in
Leppings Lane. If the stadium was to be filled to its maximum capacity of
54,324 persons then 45% (24,447 persons) of this capacity would be admitted
from Leppings Lane,"through     ot the turnstiles serving the stadium.

      was approxiaiatelv twi?F            42 turnstiles in Penistone Road and that
      of the 18 Jaim&tiles in the Concourse behind the South Stand. It is our
      opinion that larger crowds would form in Leppings Lane than in ~the other
      entrance areas to the stadium when it was to be filled to its maximum
      capacity.

      7.3.5 It is our opinion that, when the stadium was to be filled to its
      maximum capacity, the longest delays in                 be be experienced bv
      persons required to enter through the turnstiles in Leppings Lane, and that
      those with tickets for the West terraces would experience the most severe
      delays.

 i    introduction


I was told by Dr C E Nicholson, a Deputy Director of the Safety Engineering
Laboratory (SEL) of the Research and Laboratory Services Division (RLSD) of
the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), that on the 15th of April a video
recording had been made which showed people entering the Sheffield Wednesday
Football Club's (SWFC) stadium through the Leppings Lane turnstiles A, B, C,
D, E, F and G and through gate C; the turnstiles served the West Terrace and
North-West Terrace and in this report these terraces are called the 'West
terraces'. It is my understanding that the video camera had been in a fixed
position and had been recording from before 1:00 pm until after 3:00 pm. As
part of the HSE investigation of the incident Dr Nicholson asked me to analyse
a copy of the recording to:

i)     count the total number of people who had entered through these
       turnstiles and compare these counts with the counts registered by the
       Sheffield Wednesday's computerised system for recording admissions.

ii)    measure the rate at which people had entered the stadium through
       turnstiles A to G throughout the period of the video recording.

iii) estimate the number of people who had entered the stadium through gate C.

I was assisted by other staff of RLSD working under my supervision and to my
instructions. Police Constable (PC) R Watson of the West Midlands Police
liaised with me and he provided the copies of the video recordings. He gave me
a copy of a statement by Peter John Wilkinson of West Mercia Police TV Unit
which gave details of the copy and edit procedure that had been undertaken
from the original video tape.


2 VIDEO TAPE RECORDINGS USED FOR ANALYSIS

Dr Nicholson gave me copies of drawings which had been produced by Ralph Brade
and Associates. Drawing No 1340/05 titled 'Close Circuit Television Cameras
Location Plan' shows 'S.W.F.C. CAMERA 2 GATES A-G' and it is my understanding
that the original VHS video tape identified as 'RJH2' was produced from
signals sent by a camera at this location and that all the video recordings
used by RLSD for analysis were copied from this original tape.

The U-matic video tape recordings used for 'turnstile' admission analysis were
delivered by PC R Watson on 15 May 89; the individual tapes were labelled
RJH2/E/Part 1 Copy A, RJH2/E/Part 2 Copy A, RJH2/E/Part 3 Copy A, RJH2/F/Part
1 Copy A, RJH2/F/Part 2 Copy A, RJH2/F/Part 3 Copy A. The tapes showed the
exits of turnstile booths A to G from approximately 12:55 pm until 3:10 pm on
15 April 1989. The '/E/' Tapes showed the exits of turnstiles A, B and C and
the '/F/' Tapes showed the exits of turnstiles D, E, F and G. The two Part l's
covered the first hour, the two Part 2's the second hour and the two Part 3's
the remaining time. The continuous reference timings on the video tapes were
with respect to the start of each tape and not to British Summer Time (BST)
but I determined the relationship between these times and BST using specific
events in conjunction with West Midlands Police.

The VHS video recording used for 'gate C analysis' was a copy identified as
DF1/B and had been produced by Mr D Francis, an RLSD photographer, from a
video recording labelled RJH2, loaned to us by PC R Watson. The copy had
continuous reference timings which related to the start of the tape and not to

    BST. The recording showed the exits of turnstile booths A to G, gate C and the
    general area on the West Stand side of these turnstiles.


    3    kP5ATI0N .AND DESCRIPTION OF TURNSTILE BOOTHS A-G AND GATE C

 Fig 1 is a schematic plan showing the seven turnstiles A to G and gate C. The
  °cat on o the turnstile booths and of gate C is shown on the Ralph Brade and
  ssociates drawing No 1340/04A and the aperture of gate C when open is shown
 as       mm. Gate C, when closed, formed part of the perimeter boundary and was
 a jacent to turnstile booth G and approximately perpendicular to the row of
  u m s t e ooths. Normally gate C was closed and it is my understanding that
 the main function of gate C was to let people out of the stadium after a
 match.


I j ! L ^ nSti^e,b0°th ®XitS consisted of seven doors, designated in alphabetical
order from A to G. When viewed from the video camera location door A was on
the right and furthest away from the video camera. Doors A and B, D and E F
and G were in pairs and Door C was on its own. Within the booths the exit’
doors aligned directly with the appropriate turnstile passage, but the
internal, layout of the turnstile booths did not prevent a person passing
t rough the 'gate' of turnstile A and then emerging from the door of the booth
marked B (and vice versa); similarly for the other paired turnstiles. In my
opinion, this indirect route may have been used on a few occasions, for
example if there was someone standing in the way at the normal 'direct' exit
door. Thus the individual counts for the 'paired' turnstiles may be less
accurate than the sum of the two counts from the two doors of a pair.

The turnstile mechanisms were not identical in design nor in ease of operation
and details are reported by Games and Waterhouse (RLSD report IR/L/ME/89/33)

It is my understanding that on the 15th April these 7 turnstiles served the
West terraces which had a designated capacity of 10,100 persons.


4       THE COUNTING METHOD

4.1      TURNSTILES

The counting method used a specially developed computer program and
micro-computer. The video recording was played at normal speed and the
computer's clock was synchronised with a reference time on the video image.
Whenever a person was seen to emerge from a specific turnstile booth an RLSD
observer depressed a push button, closing an electrical circuit and sending an
electrical pulse signal to the computer. The computer recorded each signal
pulse and the elapsed times from the start of playback. People emerging from
turnstiles A and B were registered together because the shadows on the video
recording image sometimes made it impossible to differentiate between people
emerging from the exit door of turnstile A and those from the exit door of
turnstile B. People emerging from all other turnstiles were registered
separately.

4.2 GATE C

Dr Nicholson was informed by Inspector M Layton of West Midlands Police that
gate C had been opened three times and that the 'First Opening' had occurred
at approximately 2:48 pm for a duration of about 30 seconds and that the


                                        -2-


                                                                            5 8 7
                                                        Docum§nt No.       CO NT’D

 'Second Opening' had occurred at approximately 2:52 pm for a duration of about
   minutes 30 seconds. A 'Third Opening' had occurred approximately one minute
 later when the gate was opened sufficiently to allow the entry of people in
 single file for approximately 8 minutes.

The position of gate C on the video image and the small distance between
adjacent people as they passed through gate C made it impracticable to discern
each person as they passed through the open gate. Therefore the method of
assessment for the first two openings was to count the number of people
passing a reference line drawn on the video display monitor for a recording
period of 3 seconds, and then to repeat this process at intervals throughout
t e period of opening. The reference line was drawn so that any person who had
entered through gate C would cross the line, whilst generally being separated
 rom other people by a greater distance than when passing through the open
        ^ “aking each Per®on more discernable. The path of each person was
viewed to ensure that people emerging from turnstiles were not counted. The
counting process was repeated several times, by rewinding and replaying the
video tape, for each sample, to ensure that the chance of not counting a
particular person was reduced to a minimum. The playback speed on the video
recorder was adjusted to play the recording slowly enough to optimize the
counting.

Four samples were taken during the First Opening and 27 samples were taken
during the Second Opening; the longest interval between samples being 15
seconds. The whole of the Third Opening was analysed in one continuous sample.


5 DATA PROCESSING AND RESULTS

5.1     TURNSTILES

5-1-1     Turnstile Total Coimrc

Table 1 shows how many people had been counted through the turnstiles at
intervals of 5 minutes, the bottom row of the table being the final count just
before the turnstiles were closed. Each row of the table gives the individual
total count for turnstiles C to G, the totals for the three pairs A+B, I>+E
F+G and the total for all seven turnstiles.

Fig 2 shows the total number of people who had been counted through all seven
turnstiles at any particular time and is a graphical representation of the
same data as the final column in Table 1 but every data point.has been
presented, rather than just the totals at intervals of 5 minutes.

5.1.2    Turnstile Rate Counts

Table 2 shows the number of people counted through the turnstiles in each 5
minute interval. Each row of the table shows the individual 5 minute counts
for turnstiles C to G, the 5 minute count for the pairs A+B, D+E, F+G and the
5 minute count for the sum of all seven turnstiles. These counts can be
converted to rates of admission, measured as 'people per turnstile per hour'
by multiplying by 12 and dividing by the number of turnstiles under
consideration.

The last column of Table 3 shows the overall rates of admission for all seven
turnstiles for each 5 min period after 2:00 pm and the average (mean) rate of
admission measured over the 45 w n period from 2:05 pm to 2:50 pm was
approximately 660 people/turnstile/hour.

     turnstile G but emerging from Exit Door F; in my opinion the SWFC count is
     probably accurate for this turnstile.

    RLSD's count for turnstiles F+G was 23.7% higher than that obtained from
    SWFC's computerised recording system. RLSD report IR/L/ME/89/33 concluded that
    there was likely to be persistent under-recording from turnstile G and it is
    my opinion that under-recording on turnstile G is probably the sole cause of
    the discrepancy. I have assumed that the RLSD count of 2,019 is less than the
    true count by the same percentage (3.3%) for turnstiles F+G as for turnstiles
    A to E, and have estimated that 2,088 is the true total for turnstiles F+G.

    My estimate of 2,088 for turnstiles F+G can therefore be divided into a count
    of 1,049 for turnstile F (the SWFC count) and the remainder of 1,039 for
    turnstile G. The SWFC count of 583 from turnstile G is therefore 56% of my
    estimated correct number of admissions through this turnstile.

    5*1-5   Estimate of total number of people through turnstiles A to G

    It is my opinion that the best estimate for the final total of people admitted
    through all seven turnstiles is given by adding the SWFC total for turnstiles
    A to E of 5,406 to my estimate of 2,088 for turnstiles F+G, giving an overall
    total of 7,494 admissions for turnstiles A to G. In my opinion, based on the
    tests reported by Games and Waterhouse (RLSD report IR/L/ME/89/33), it is most
    unlikely that the true total exceeded this value by more than 2% ie a maximum
    of 7,644 for the number of people who passed through the seven turnstiles.

    My estimated total of 7,494 admissions through turnstiles A to G from the time
    that they were opened is 247 greater than the RLSD count. It is my opinion
    that this is attributable to people entering the stadium before the start of
    the video recording.

    5*1*6   Estimate of time at which 10.100 people would have entered
            through turnstiles A to c

    RLSD's count at 2:50 pm was 5,868 but an estimated 247 people had entered the
    stadium before the start of the video recording. Therefore at 2:50 pm the
    estimated number of people who had entered through turnstiles A to G was
    6*H5- Based on a capacity of 10,100 for the West terraces there were still
    3,985 people yet to enter the stadium for these terraces. The average (mean)
    rate of admission, measured over a 45 min period, was 660 people/turnstile/
#   hour. If this rate had been maintained I have estimated that it would have
    taken until approximately 3:40 pm to admit the remaining 3,985 people.

    Prior to the 'Second Opening' of gate C at approximately 2:52 pm the highest
    rate of admission, measured over a period of 5 minutes, for the seven
    turnstiles was 702 people/turnstile/hour (Table 3 Col 5). If this rate had
    been constantly maintained it would have taken about 123 minutes to admit
    10,100 people. For all these people to have entered the stadium before 3:00 pm
    the first entrants would have needed to enter before 1:00 pm and continued to
    enter at this maximum rate.

    Prior to the 'Second Opening' of gate C the greatest number of admissions
    during a period of 5 minutes through turnstile C, a single turnstile, was 76
    people, and for any pair of turnstiles it was 141 people (Table 2). On the
    basis of these values I have calculated a theoretical maximum composite
    admission for all seven turnstiles (single C and pairs A+B, D+E, F+G) for a 5
    min period:

       I assumed that the rate at which people entered through gate C changed
       linearly between successive sampling periods. The counts made during each of
       the 3 second sample periods were therefore used to calculate an estimated
      number of entries between each sample period. The total number of entries
       t rough gate C was obtained from the sum of these estimates, added to the
      counts made during the sampling periods. The total number estimate was 130 but
                *1 v          estimate should be regarded as a minimum because of the
      I     t     tI?aI:«;n0me pf°ple were °hscured by others. My best estimate would
      be that aboutJL50_people entered during the 'First Opening' of gate C and in
        y opinion the actual number was unlikely to have been greater than 180.

      4 A   f ef y         rates of admission for many of the samples during the
 r mainder of the period were about 6 people/second. Drawing No 1340/04A showed
  ate C to be 4115 mm wide and by assuming a shoulder width of 550 mm I
 calculated that it would allow 7 people to pass abreast when it was fully
 opened. The measured rate of 6 people/second therefore corresponds
 approximately to a rate of 1 person per shoulder width per second.

A similar method of analysis was used to that for the 'First Opening' and Fig
   shows a graph of the number of people who entered through gate C during the
 Second Opening ; the asterisks on the graph denote the individual sample
PH           t0tal number estimate was 1800 but in my opinion this estimate
should be regarded as a minimum because of the likelihood that some people
were obscured by others. My best estimate, based on the assumption that 1
person in 10 may not have been counted, would be about t"2500land in my opinion
the actual number was unlikely to have been greater than 2200.

6   SUMMARY OF RESHT.TS

6.1 TURNSTILE COUNTS, ESTIMATES, TOTALS AND RATE OF ADMISSION

The '5 minute totals' and rates for turnstiles A to G are summarised in Table


The third column in Table 3 was obtained from my assumption that the
discrepancy of 247 between the RLSD total and final estimated total was due to
people entering the stadium before the start of the video recording. This
number has therefore been added to all the intermediate RLSD counts to give an
estimated count for the intermediate times.

The total entries shown in the fourth column were obtained by adding, at
appropriate times, admissions through turnstiles A to G from the third column
to my best estimates of the number of entries made through gate C.

6.3       SWFC COMPUTER COUNTS FOR TURNSTILE A TO G

6-3 -l      Turnstiles A to E

The RLSD counts for these turnstiles would indicate that the SWFC counts for
turnstiles A to E were accurate and in my opinion SWFC's record of the
admissions through these turnstiles would not be in error by more than 2%.

6.3.2       Turnstile G

The SWFC count for turnstile G was low and estimates in this report indicate
that the SWFC computer only registered about 56% of the correct number of
admissions through this turnstile. Evidence of the turnstile switch
malfunctioning is reported by Gaines and Waterhouse (RLSD report IR/L/ME/89/33)
and this would account for errors in the total registered by the SWFC
computer.


7     DISCUSSION

7.1       RATE OF ADMISSION THROUGH TURNSTILES A TO G

I consider it reasonable to suppose that, in the absence of crowd forces, the
rate at which people entered the stadium would rise until there were queues at
all the turnstiles. I would then have expected the rate of admission to remain
fairly constant, possibly rising slightly as the match start time approached.

Fig 4 shows that from about 2:05 pm the rate was fairly constant until
2:25 pm, which in my opinion suggests that all turnstiles had queues and
people were not having undue difficulty in entering the turnstiles.

After about 2:25 pm turnstile C generally has the highest rate of admission
and it is noticeable from Table 2 that the paired turnstiles were performing
less well. In particular turnstiles F+G recorded a count of only 86 between
2:45 pm and 2:50 pm and turnstiles D+E a count of 77 between 2:40 pm and
2.45 pm; equivalent to 516 and 462 people/turnstile/hour respectively. The

                                                                                5 9 3

 rate at which people were entering decreased at about 2:35 pm and in my
 opinion a likely cause was crowd forces acting on the people entering the
 turnstiles Even so the lowest overall rate of admission for all seven
 turnstiles for a 5 minute period of 610 people/turnstile/hour and the
 w e ^ Ch o ^ i ^ 16i!St/ V! ra11 rate °f admission of 702 persons/tumstile/hour
 IchieieJ fo           ° ^ e average rate of 660 PeoP 1e/turnstile/hour that was
 achieved for the period between 2:05 pm and 2:50 pm.

 pie theoretical maximum composite rate of admission was 855 people/turnstile/
  our and in my opinion this theoretical maximum may have been achievable for
 these turnstiles operating under ideal conditions, for example with no crowd
 pressure acting on people entering the turnstile booths and with each person
  aving heir ticket ready. In my opinion the maximum measured rate of 702
 people/turnstile/hour, achieved over a period of 5 minutes, would have been
 maintained after 2:35 pm if there had been no crowd forces acting on people
 entering the turnstiles.                                             F v

 7.2 GATE C OPENINGS

I calculated that an estimated 2000 people entered the stadium during the
 Second Opening', during which significant checking of tickets was not
apparent from the video recording. The rate of admission of the turnstiles
increased markedly at about the time of the 'Second Opening' of gate C. In
my opinion this increase may have been due to two possible causes:

a K t h e turnstile operators may not have been checking tickets to the same
extent as they were before the 'Second Opening'.

b) the 'Second Opening' resulted in decreased crowd forces thus allowing
people to enter the turnstiles more easily.

It is my opinion that the number of people who can pass through a given sized
opening in a given time will tend to be self-limiting. If a person moves more
quickly then more clearance between successive people will be required. If
people shuffle through almost touching each other their speed will be limited
because of lack of freedom of movement. For example if people walk at a speed
                l”ph) Snd 3 sPacin6 of 1-5 m (5 ft) then 80 people per shoulder
width would pass a given point in 1 min; if the speed was 1 m/sec (2.2 mph)
an the pacing was 0.75 m (2.5 ft) the number of people passing the point in
1 min would be the same.

7.3 TIMES TAKEN TO PASS THROUGH TURNSTILE C

Fig 5 and Table 4 show that between 2:00 pm and 2:10 pm the most frequent time
of passage was 5 sec. The time then diminished to 3 sec for the
intervals of 2:30 pm to 2:40 pm and 2:40 pm to 2:50 pm, with an approximately
equal numbers of admissions taking 2 sec and 4 sec; however the mean times
for these intervals were 4.3 sec and 4.4 sec respectively, corresponding to
828 people/hour and 822 people/hour. This shows that the asymmetric
distribution °f times, caused by a significant number of people taking longer
than 5 seconds, gives a mean time that is about 50% greater than the most
frequent time for this interval.

The relevance of the difference between the mean time and the most frequent
time is that the capacity of a turnstile cannot be calculated on the
assumption that each person will take the same time of passage.

  8   CONCLUSIONS

    .1 My best estimate of the numbe£_afLDeople admitted through turnstiles A to
  G-isJ7,494(and through gate C is{2,240i i.e. a total of 9,734. It is my opinion
  that the true total is most unlikely to* have exceeded 10.124. i.e. tKe total
  admissions 'were-approximately equal to the designated capacity of 10 100
  people for the Vest terraces.

  8.2 RLSD measured the average (mean) rate of admission through turnstiles A to
  o    —     Pe°P 1e/turnstile/hour for the 45 min period between 2:05 pm and
  2:50 p m .

   8.3 On the basis of RLSD's measured average rate of admission of 660
   people/turnstile/hour through turnstiles A to G, and the number of people who
   had already been admitted through these turnstiles at 2:50 pm, I have
\\ ®s^ mated that if gate C had not been opened it would have taken until about
U          to admit a total of lO.lQQ people through these turnstiles.

 8.4 Using RLSD's measured maximum rate of admission of 702
 people/turnstile/hour through turnstiles A to G I calculated that people would
 need to have been continuously entering through these turnstiles at this rate
 before 1:00 pm to enable 10,100 people to enter the West terraces before
 3:00 pm.

 8.5 The rate of admission into the stadium increased markedly at about 1:45 pm
 rising from about 300 to about 550 people/turnstile/hour. The 5 minute rate
 |;or a11 seven turnstiles peaked at 702 people/turnstile/hour for the period
 2:30 pm to 2:35 pm and remained within about 8% of the average (mean) rate of
 660 people/turnstile/hour between 2:05 pm until 2:50 pm. There was a fall in
 the, rate at,.about 2:35 pm with no recovery until about the time of tKe"' Second
 Opening’ of gate C when the rate of admission increased markedly. At this
 stage the turnstile operators may not have been checking tickets to the same
 extent and crowd pressure outside the turnstiles may have decreased.

 8.6 The distribution of the times of passage through turnstile C, a single
 turnstile, was asymmetric and the mean time of passage was always significantly
 greater than the most frequent time. Between 2:30 pm and 2:50 pm the most
 frequently occurring time of passage was 3 sec but the mean time of passage
 was 4.4 seconds.

 8 •7_Turnstile__C , a single turnstile, achieved a significantly higher rate of
 admission of_830jpeople/turnstile/hour during the period between 2:30 pm and
 2:50 pm in comparison with ,630 people/turnstile/hour for the other six
 turnstiles which were in pairs.

 8.8 Sheffield Wednesday Football Club's computerised system for recording
 admissions to the stadium registered only approximately 56% of the people who
 entered through J:urnstile G~T 'Inere is no evidence Irom the RT-Sn       «-haT
 any of the total counts from turnstiles A to F were registered incorrectly.

        8th June 1989 and in subsequent correspondence and telephone conversations.

      2 EESCRIPnCN OF SYSTEM

        «                    Amible that t ^ PA system at Hillsborough was designed
/ A     and installed by DP Sound Systems Ltd of Sheffield. The principle
V ™     cqiyonents, loudspeakers and amplifiers, were made by TOA Electric Co Ltd a
        Japanese company vhich is a specialist manufacturer of public address
        equipment of seme 55 years standing.

            Ann*blf informed me that the PA system was installed primarily as a means
       ^carmunicati^ with the spectators for crowd control or in an emergency.
                     _?! °gTto?lled 6x111 *** P°lioe control booth located between the
       west and South Stands. In the booth is a control unit (TQA VR 1012) on
       S I K k the microphoie input to the system is located together with a button
       vauch activates the system when depressed. The control unit also has a
       senes of buttons which enable sectors of the ground to be selected so that
                       ^ relvE ? to Speciffc           (see Figure 1) • The PA system has
       been divided into eight sectors; inside and outside of each of the four
       stands (Figure 2). The outside sectors also include the passages leading to
       S?6          seated acxxanmodation in each of the stands. Any combination of
       the eight sectors can be selected or, using the button labelled 'ALL CALL'
       every^sector can be selected. The sector outside the West stand «i<=r>
       ^ l u d e s l<x»dspeakers directed at the approach to the turnstiles at Leppirxrs
                      Xt 13 P0531^    for the police to talk to those inside theljround
C      independently of those approaching it or vice versa. It is also, for
       example, possible to talk to those inside and/or approaching the West
       stand/terracing independently of those anywhere else in or around the
       ground.

                 ^r?3Ut to the PA system has been provided for use by a Disc Jockey
        (UJ) to play nusic and jingles to the spectators and to make announcenents.
                   Uses lpax^ of the 591116 PA system, that directed at all spectators
       ii«ide the ground, ie the four sectors inside the stadium. The Dj's input
       whether nusic or speech, is automatically overridden when the police control
       panel is used* Thus a message frcm the police can be relayed to one portion
       of the crcMi whilst the rest hear the DJ. Die DJ's booth is underneath the
       police control room.

       The location of the loudspeakers in the West stand, inside and outside
       sectors, are shewn in Figure 3. These are controlled by buttons 1 and 7
       respectively. The 12 loudspeakers inside the stand are mounted under the
       mart edge of the roof and are alternately directed into the upper stand and
       dewn to the terracing. These loudspeakers are TQA TZ 201 units. Outside




                                                                                         6 0 7

     the stand TQA TC 194L horn loudspeakers have been used. Using TQA data for
     the loudspeakers calculations were made of the sound pressure level (SFL) at
     various locations inside and outside the ground (see Table 1).

3 NOISE LEVEES IN FDOTBALL GROUNDS

     ^        informatfori 081 typical noise levels in football grounds was found
       t*^ technical literature. Consequently limited measurements were nwrfc> at
    the first available opportunity which happened to be the Liverpool vs
    Arsenal match at Liverpool PC's Anfield ground on the 26th of May 1989.
    Tape recordings were made of the sound level at the pitch side and on the

    in the Kbp'. The sound pressure level was also          logged as l minute averages
    using noise dosesneters in both cases, lhe pitch side microphones were
    located approximately lm frcm the goal line, 8m from the nearest goal post
    and to fran the spectators at the 'Kbp' end of the ground. Hie equipment
    used is detailed in Annex 1.

    Plots of the 1 minute average sound pressure level (SPL) are presented in
    Figure 4. The match kicked off at about 20:15 and finished about 22:00.
    "Ting this period the 1 minute average level in       the Kbpwas always greater
    than 90 dB(A) and above 100 dB(A) for much of the time. The corresponding
    figures at pitch side are about 5 dB lcwer, viz 85 dB(A) and 95 dB(A).

    Unpublished data from a football match at Bristol, and frcm the Rugby League
        Final, at Wembley, were made available to HSE. These data were obtained
    as 3 minute averages and are presented in Figure 5 together with the HSE
    data re-calculated as 3 minute averages. Clearly the HSE Anfield data shows
    much higher levels than at Bristol and Wembley.

    The logarithmic units used to measure noise as a 1 or 3 minute average can
    mask much lower levels which may have occurred during the period. Thus it
    is possible for the sound level to be relatively low for a significant
    proportion of the time whilst the average level is high. A statistical
    distribution analysis of the sound levels illustrates this effect. Table 2
    presents such data for the Anfield recordings for 3 minute periods leading
    up to and just beyond the start of the match. Fran these data it can be
    seen that although the 3 minute average levels in the Kbp were between 97.9
    and 105.7 dB(A), the level was below 91.9 dB(A) for 10% of the total period
     (as shown by I^q ) and below 96.9 dB(A) for 50% of the time (Icn) •
    Figure 6 illustrates the relationship between the various statistical
    measurements of fluctuating sound for a 3 minute period of the Anfield
    recordings in the Kbp. In this period 108.2 dB(A) was exceeded for 1% of
    the time; 105.2 dB(A) for 10% and 97.2 dB(A) for 50%; whereas the average
    level (Leg) was 101.1 dB(A).

    In Figure 6 various crcwd activities which give rise to hitfi levels of sound
    are identified.

4   TESTS ON THE HniSBOROCJGH PA SYSTEM

    Recordings were made of speech relayed by the Hillsborou^i PA system at
    locations inside and outside the West stand and terracing. The locations
    are shewn in Figure 7 and described in detail in Annex 2. The recordings
    were made on the 7th June 1989 in an empty ground. The speech was input
    using either the microphone on the control panel in the police control room
    orthe one in the Qj's booth and consisted of a reading of the team list
    from a match programme and other lists. Recordings were made for two

    different voices, one male the other female. Hie recordings were analysed
    fear their sound pressure level and amplitude fluctuation. The A-weighted*
    SPL at each measurement location is given in Table 1 together with the
    calculated performance of the PA system. As would be expected the measured
    sound levels from the PA system vary depending on hew loudly the passage was
    Spoken, or indeed individual words in the passage. However, it is clear
    that the system is capable of producing the theoretical levels calculated
    frcm manufacturer's data inside the ground (Sector 1). Outside the West
    stand (Sector 7) the levels measured are somewhat less than those
    calculated.

    (* The 'A' frequency weighting is applied to acoustic signals to simulate
    the frequency response of the ear.)

5   INimJGEBILITY OF THE HHISBORDOOS PA SYSTEM

    The 'Green Guide' (Ref 1) states, in Section 12:

    "There should be a ccranunications system capable of clearly relaying
    essential messages to all parts of the ground in both normal circumstances
    and in an emergency."

    and in paragraph 194 iii:

    "Public address equipment should be installed so that broadcast messages can
    be heard tinder reasonable conditions (including emergencies) by all persons
    of normal hearing in any part of the ground to which the public has access.
    The system should be capable of being controlled from a central point and
    should ideally be capable of addressing messages to each major section of
    the ground. The power supply to the system should be such as to enable it
    to operate in an emergency such as fire or failure of the mains supply."

    I understand from DP Sound ltd that the Hillsborough PA system was designed
    to fulfil this requirement.

    Whether a message can be clearly understood will depend on many factors but
    it was not possible to identify from the literature any criteria by which
    the intelligibility of speech frcm public address systems could be assessed
    directly. There are standards for emergency evacuation signals and guidance
    for selecting warning signals but these do not address spoken warnings frcm
    PA systems. Standards for assessing the intelligibility of speech in rocms
    cannot be applied directly to sports stadia PA systems. Therefore it was
    not possible to assess the performance of the Hillsborough PA system against
    defined performance criteria in terms of intelligibility of messages relayed
    through it.

    Typically tests of speech intelligibility require panels of subjects to
    listen to standard word lists against appropriate background noises. Such
    tests were impracticable in this investigation. Instead an ad hoc
    assessment was made using recordings of announcements made at Hillsborough
    and of croud noise made at Anfield.

    In this ad hoc test twelve subjects (HSE staff of age range from 21 to 43
    years) were asked to judge if they could understand the recording from
    Hillsborough when replayed together with the recorded crowfl noise from
    Anfield. It was not possible to reproduce the exact sound field present at
    Hillsborough at the time of the incident. Therefore the recordings were
    replayed in an anechoic chamber through a FA system which had been set to

    produce a uniform diffuse sound field at the listening position (see
    Figure 8). The two recordings were superimposed at known relative levels
    and the listeners were asked if they could hear the PA announcements and if
    they oould understand them. The test was repeated at four relative levels
    of the two signals. Table 3 lists the level of the announcement relative to
    the cxrari noise at which the listener oould understand the announcement.
    Nearly all the listeners oould understand the announcement when its average
    level (Leg) was 10 dB below that of the crowd noise.

6   DISCUSSION

    Mr Annible informed me that in designing the PA system the installers had
    made the follcwing assumptions in respect of noise levels at football
    matches: ambient levels 77-80 dB(A); average levels 85 dB(A); short duration
    levels 90-95 dB(A). The data frcm Bristol and Wearbley would support these
    assunpticns tut the Anfield data would not. Obviously the noise level of
    spectators will depend on many factors such as: number of spectators; design
    of stadium; significance of the match; emotional state of the crowd. Each
    of the crowd noise measurements presented in this report were taken at
    important matches but with very different crowd numbers and in different
    stadia. This accounts for the range of noise levels reported. It should be
    noted that the match at Anfield was the league Championship deciding match
    and Liverpool PC fans are noted for their vocal (choral) support for their
    team. The Anfield ground is very ocxipact with roofing covering all
    spectator areas. All factors which would lead to a high crowd noise level.

    In general a wide range of levels will occur depending on the factors
    mentioned above. During any one match or even any period of a match, levels
    will fluctuate and although the average may be high this will be influenced
    by short periods of very high levels, leaving significant periods at lower
    levels (as illustrated in Figure 6). Messages fran a PA system can be
    understood frcm information received in these periods. The simple listening
    test described illustrates this since’messages with average sound levels
    10 dB (A) below the ambient level oould be understood. Thus, whilst it is
    impracticable to design sound systems to overcome the highest levels, a
    criteria based on exceeding a particular level which it is assumed crcwd
    noise will only exceed for short periods of time is perhaps more realistic
                There is, of course, a difference in the ability to hear and
               a message and actually listening to it. Spectators deeply
    involved in watching the game may not listen to messages they can clearly
    hear. At Anfield, and at a recently televised International rugby match,
    spectator safety messages were preceded by a chime which identified them as
    such. This facility seems a sensible way to attract the spectators'
    attention.

    In the particular case of the situation at Hillsborough leading up to the
    incident I have no information of crowd noise levels on the West terracing.
    Nor do I have such information for the areas inside and outside the
    turnstiles at Leppings Lane. Careful examination of a video tape, supplied
    by West Midlands Police, for the period 14:45 to 15:07 has not enabled noise
    levels at the West terracing to be determined since the 'effects' microphone
    is also picking up crowd noise from other parts of the ground. Up to 14:50
    it is not possible to identify any chants clearly related to Liverpool
    fans. Additionally, when spectators are at their most vocal they usually
    wave their hands, scarves and banners in the air en masse. There is no sign
    of this activity on this section of the video tape. Throughout this period
    music is being played on the PA system and can be heard clearly above the
    crowd noise. At about 14:50 the teams were announced over the PA system.

                                         4                                     6 1 0

          Ftum then cn there were the usual chanting of the fans as their
          membere names were called and as the teams entered the pitch at 14:54 and
          tne me-ch started. Between the announcements of the        and the kick-off,
          nusic was being played and can be heard except during the loudest chants
          fran the crowd.

         The pattern of crc*ri chanting seems much the same as that observed at
         Anfield though visual indications fran the video tape suggest that a
         significant percentage of the Liverpool fans were not joining in the
         wanting. Thus given the open nature of the West terracing and the numbers
         offans there it is reasonable to conclude that crowd noise levels at the
         West terracing would not have been as high as those found at Anfield. In my
         opinion it is probable therefore that any messages relayed through the PA
                      hfye        intelligible to the spectators, it should be noted

<9   7   CONCLUSIONS

         Fran this limited investigation I have made the following conclusions:

         7.1   Ihe^Hillsborough PA system had been professionally installed vising good
               quality ccnponents and meets the performance criteria to which it was
               designed.

         7.2   It is probable that spectators in the West terracing and its approaches
               oculd have heard any messages relayed through the PA system during the
               period encompassing the incident.

         7.3   There is limited information on crowd noise in sports stadia and the
               necessary performance requirements for PA systems to ensure
               intelligible oonraunication.

               shows stepped brickwork at the base and it is possible that this is
     the top of a stepped brick foundation.

     as a structure and was unsafe. It was considered to be liable to topple during
     high winds, or if set oscillating by crowd pressure. Consequently it was
     considered that it should be either taken dcwn and r e c o n s t r u c t e d or stabilized
     by buttressing or other equally effective means.

     Summary



                   turnstiles.A-G confirmed that although old, somewhat worn and in many
                     lubrication/routine maintenance etc all were working satisfactorily
    and vould each allow at least 20 persons per minute throughput.

                       release Pressure tests, throughput and corrputer count tests are
    the subject of a separate RLSD report.

 USER:        SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB, HILLSBOROUGH, SHEFFIELD
 INTRODUCTION



I visited the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club ground during the week cormencing

the 24th of April 1989 to continue investigations at your request and in accordance

with the wishes of the judicial enquiry team headed by Justice Taylor.



I was present on site between the 24th and 28th of April with the exception of

Thursday the 27th of April and on each occasion I was accompanied by Mr C J Pertee,

Principal Specialist Inspector, Construction Engineering, North East FOG.        During

*** week 1 examined turnstiles 17-23 (A-G) and this report contains the results of
this examination.



TURNSTIira



The general layout of the 7 turnstiles A-G which feed the west terrace at the football

ground is shewn in Fig. 1 of my earlier report NE/POG 14/M/18/89 and details are

confirmed in Messrs Ralph Braid & Associates drawing no. 1340/Q^.

                                                                                       641
                                                               Document No.   g<^   CONT'D




 A general view of the turnstiles from the approach side is shown in Fig. 2 and from
 the egress side in Fig. 3.



 All the turnstiles were of considerable age and were noted to have been manufactured

 by Messrs W D Ellison & Co Ltd, Irlam, Manchester.   Details of the turnstiles and

 their method of operation are shown in the makers trade literature at Appendix 1.



All the turnstiles were of the low pattern type and turnstiles A, C, D, E, F and G

were fitted with convex arms.    Turnstile B was fitted with straight arms.



 I took detailed dimensions in all the turnstile enclosures and assisted with irSJ&L
functional tests of each unit.



All the turnstile ratchets were working satisfactorily and although worn, all the

foot pedals and footstep motion cams were working correctly.     Some of the lower

mechanisms were in need of lubrication, however, this did not prevent the mechanisms

from operating satisfactorily and allowing at least 20 persons per minute to pass
through each turnstile.



I noted the patent numbers on the turnstil^(| which were shown as 658191 and 658226

and were marked on several of the mechanical counter cover plates.     The serial

furbers were also marked in this area but were only present on turnstile C (serial

no. 14038), turnstile D (serial no. 13263) and turnstile G (serial no. 14039).



1 noted that all the doors at the front of the turnstile enclosure were approximately

0.63 m (25 inches) wide and the opening widths were between 465 irm and 555 imi

(18.3 inches and 21.8 inches).   The heights of the openings were approximately
2 m (79 inches).

                                                                                    6 4 2
 The passageways through each turnstile were approximately 2 m (6 ft 9 inches) long

 and 0.5 m (20 inches) wide.    The ceiling height in each passageway was

 approximately 2.25 m (7 ft 5 inches).



 The height of the turnstile tables was approximately 1.04 m (3 ft 5 inches).    The

 heights of the turnstile arms and their lower skirt plates etc and the gaps between

 the ends of the arms and adjacent walls in individual passageways are shown in
 Table 1.



Vertical blocks of wood were secured to the walls at the entry side of the

turnstiles in all except passageway C where a box had been constructed on the wall

opposite the centre of the turnstile spindle.    All blocks of wood in turnstiles

except C were approximately 14 an x 14 an x 61 an long (5.5 inches x 5.5 inches x

2 ft long) which were positioned with their lower ends approximately 38 cm (15 inches)

above floor level an: their central axis approximately 30 cm (one foot) forward of
the turnstile axis.



The box mounted on the wall opposite the rotating arms of turnstile C was 46 cm

(18 inches) long on its front face and 61 cm (2 ft) long on its rear face.      The

box was 24 cm (9.5 inches) deep and projected from the wall by approximately 10 cm

(4 inches). The top face of this box was approximately level with the top face of

the turnstile arm.    (See Fig. 6).



Additional vrooden blocks were also fitted on the walls opposite the turnstile arms

in passageways A and B only.   These blocks were mounted on the turnstile side of

the aforementioned vertical vrooden blocks and had curved form varying fran

7.5 cm (3 inches) thickness at the ingress end to 9.5 an (3.75 inches) thickness at

a point opposite the turnstile axis centre.   These blocks were approximately 49 cm

(19.25 inches) long and 14 cm (5.5 inches) deep and reduced the gap at the end of

 the turnstile arm to approximately 2.5 an (one inch).



 Photographs of turnstiles A to G taken from the egress side shew the aforementioned

 features together with the respective footstep cams and pedal counterweights etc.
 (See Figures 4-10).



 I removed several of the foot pedals from the turnstiles and two of these from

units B and C are shewn in Figs. 11 and 12 respectively.



Pedal return action was achieved by a counterwight mounted on the respective arm,

these weights can be seen inrFigs. 11 and 12.



OTHER OBSERVATIONS



Coring ny examination of the turnstiles I noted that an electronic counting system

had been installed and that duplicate switching arrangements were present on the
majority of the units.



Snail roller type limit switches were noted in positions imnediately above the

central boss carrying the turnstile arm adjacent to the main rotating shaft.   These

switches were arranged such that they would be actuated at each quarter turn of

the turnstile.   The oentral switches at units C, D and E were the only ones
connected.



Additional rat-tail switches were seen to have been positioned on the wooden frames

at the egress side of the turnstile bloc* and were actuated at each indexing notion

by the respective turnstile arm.   However, these switches were disconnected and

had broken tails at turnstiles C, D and E, they appeared to be connected and

 functioning correctly at the other turnstiles A, B, F and G.



Ioad/pedal resistance testing and throughput rate testing of the turnstiles together

with checks on the mechanical and computer counting systems are the subject of a

separate RLSD report.



It was also noted that photoelectric emitters and sensors had been arranged in pairs

across each turnstile passageway at positions above the turnstile arms as well as at

table level at the egress side.   Examination of these devices indicated that many

had been either removed or disconnected and in some cases the wiring had been cut.

    latter was noted on the over/turnstile sensors at units C and F.



CONCLUSIONS




Examinations of turnstiles A-G confirmed that although old, somewhat worn and in many

cases in need of lubrication/routine maintenance etc.    all were working

satisfactorily and would each allow at least 20 persons per minute throughput.



Data and load/pedal release pressure tests, throughput      and computer count tests

are the subject of a separate RLSD report.



RECOMMENDATIONS




It is reoomnended that the gaps between turnstile arms and adjacent walls should be

reduced to the minimum practicable safe dimension in order to prevent persons

gaining access without actuating the turnstile mechanism.

                                                                                                                   f
                                                                                                                   L


In my opinion the over/turnstile photoelectric devices should be reinstated to detect

persons clinking over without actuating the mechanism, alternatively, full height



                                                                                               6 4 5

turnstiles (floor to ceiling) should be installed.



Where necessary, individual turnstiles should be repaired at their broken table

supporting pillars in order to inprove rigidity and several of the units required
re-levelling.



End float in all the turnstile spindles should be checked and adjusted accordingly

as many exhibited approximately 4 rnn lift.



All ratchets, pedal mechanisms and cams should be suitably lubricated at appropriate
intervals.

INTRODUCTION

I visitec the Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground on the 16th, l“th and 13th of
April J.3S9 at the request of Mr S Nattrass, Area Director, H & SZ, South Yorkshire
& Humberside Area follcwinc the tracedv which occarred on the 15th of Acril 1989.

The ir.__ia_ purpose or my visit was to assist ir. investigating the incident with
particular reference to the crush barriers.

Other members of K & SE staff present durinq the first 3 days of the site
investigation are shown on the attached list.

During Jie visits I spoke to Mr D Perchon (Director — Health & Consurner Services,
Sheffield M B C ) , Mr P Jackson (SEHO, Sheffield MBC) and Mr M Ford (EHO, Shef f^ ld
MBC).

Mr W Eastwood and Mr R Eastwaod of Messrs Eastwood & Partners, Kingfield Road,
Sheffield were also present on site on the 17th of April 1989 and conducted a nuinber
of tests on the crush barriers which were witnessed.

CRUSH BARRIERS

Two types of barrier were seen in the central area, the older type having half 'A'
frames ennbedded in the concrete steps were reported to have been installed in 1966.

New types of barrier utilizing steel box section support pillars had been installed
at several locations and again the pillars were embedded in the concrete steos.
Both types of barriers carried horizontal tubular type handrails of between 60 and
75 mm diameter.   In general the spacing across each handrail between vertical
supoorts was   pfthe order of 1.23 m (7 ft 6 indies). Barrier heights varied
between O .83 and 1.15 m and the corresponding details for each barrier in the
central pen are given in Table 1 and on Ralph Brade & Associates drawing No. 1340/02.

Barrier height recocnnended by the Code of Practice 'Guide to safety at Sports Grounds'
should be a minimum of 1.02 metres with a preferred height of 1.1 metres.

 " £ls° exam-nec gates     3       4 leading from the central terrace area onto the

 pitch.      These gates were of   similar construction and opened outwards to the

 left as viewed from the terrace.




 The effective width of the gate openings were found to be 0.81 - 0.82 rr.

 <^2 inches approx) for gate 2 and 0.77 - 0.79           m(30.75 inches approx) for gate A

Tne gaps in the low wall at the gate positions were found to be 1.0 rr, wide

 (39.4 inchest and the walls were approximately 1.07 m high (42 inches) fror. tne

^lowest terrace step.




The effective opening heights at the two gates were found to be 2.11 - 2.16 ir*

 (83 - 85 inches).




It was noted that the step configurations at the two gates were slightly

different.      Both level concreted approach areas (plinths) cortmenced at the

third terrace step level but at gate 3, two risers           of 0.165   m (6.5 inches)

and   0.22   in (E.6 inches) with an intermediate tread of 0.480        m (19 inches)

were seen.      (See FIGJ16, Nega &9^4-3r©6/3€).     The approach plinth at gate 3 was

found to be 1.185 m (46.75 inches) wide and the step-up from the lowest terrace step

at each side was 0.340 m (13.5 inches high).
                                                                                              6 7 9

    At gate 4 the level concreted approach area (plinth) again commenced from

    step 3 of the terrace and extended forwards to the wall by a distance of

    0.86 m (34 inches) to a single step up through the gateway which was 0.340 m

    (13.5 inches) high.   The concreted plinth area to gate 4 was 1.125 m (44.25 inches)

 wide and the step-up from the lowest terrace step at each side was approximately

 0.190 m (7.5 inches).      See FIGS 17 - 19 which confirm the step arrangements at

 gate 3 and    4.

 PEN CAPACITY




The area of the central pen was approximately 376 square metres and allowinc
                                    ¥
d4    persons per 10 square metres gives a maximum capacity of 2030 persons.                        Tne

_     a   capa-j. -y -or the pen was statec at       2200   persons on the drawing of the

site provided by the club.




In view of the variations in barrier openings in the central pen, further

calculations have been made of the pen capacity based on the recommendations                          ^

tk.  Para 286 of the Code of Practice.




The total length of barriers in the left-hand side of the pen behind gate 3

including the 14.3 metres      of the front fence was         approximately 45.5 metres,

giving 45.5 x 3.8 x 5.4 = 934 persons.




The total length of barriers in the right-hand side of the pen               behind gate 4

including the 14.4 metres      of the front fence was          approximately 48.3 metres

giving 48.3 x 3.8 x 5.4 = 991 persons.

The revised calculated capacity for the central pen was therefore 934 + 991 * 1925

persons.

HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY - CROWD DENSITIES AND PRESSURES


1   Further to my note of the 1 May.            I have been able to make some progress with
    my enquiries and discuss these below.


A   The capacity of the terraces
2   In correspondence obtained from Dr Eastwood it appears from his report to the
    directors of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd and from the application he
    made on their behalf for a safety certificate dated          12   /1 / 7 9 and 17/1/79, he
    proposed that the numbers of persons using the Leppings Lane terraces should
    be restricted to 7,200.     This is 10% less than the maximum that could be
    allowed in the area using the Green Guide figure of 54 persons to 10 sq m.
    The 10% being deduced because there were no gangways within the terrace area.


3   The rough figures used to calculate the area of the terraces to obtain the
    crowd capacity are also on the file and from these it is possible to plot on
    drawing 1610/64E the area that was considered in making these proposals.                This
    is the drawing I have been given as showing the current position of the
    terrace capacity.   This drawing indicates that the total capacity of the same
    areas of terraces referred to in the January 1979 correspondence is still
    7,200.


4   From drawing 1510/64E the areas of the pens and the numbers of persons who
    could use them at 54 persons per 10 sq m less 10%, are shown in the table
    below together with the capacities given on drawing 1610/64E.

 5       The difference in the area from that given in the correspondence and that
          worked out from the drawing in the above table is partly accounted for by the
          corridor now m    place between the central pens and the NW pen.         From drawing
          1610/64E this has an area of 26.6 sq m.


     6    It should also be noted that the calculated areas of the central pens have
          not been reduced to deduct the areas at the mouth of the tunnel hatched on
          site in yellow.   Presumably this area is so marked to keep it clear of
          spectators.   Therefore the figures in brackets in the table would be the
          areas if this hatched section of terrace was ignored.


 7       From the table it can be seen that the capacities of the two central pens has
         been overestimated by nearly 12% on the basis of Dr Eastwood's original
         figures (or 18% if the hatched area is deducted).           However the basis of these
         original figures, particularly the       10%   arbitrary reduction, is questionable.


 8       Advice given in the Green Guide and also apparently reinforced at a seminar
         given by the Home Office when the Guide was launched in 1972, is that those
         barriers which do not meet the Guide standard should be ignored when
         calculating the area available for viewing.         Although the Green Guide
         only mentions spacing and strength in this respect, Mr Stickley says he
         included references to height in his seminar.


 9       On terraces which slope at around 15°, as at the Leppings Lane end terraces,
         and where the barriers have been tested to the        6   KN/m proof load, then an
         area extending 3 . 8 m max behind the barrier should be used in the
         calculation.


10       Working from the Ralph Brade and Associates drawing 1340/02, the drawing of
         their survey of the central terraces, this shows many barriers are far below
         the Green Guides recommended height of 1.02 - 1.1 m.           If those barriers which
         are lower than 0.92 m high are ignored i.e. allowing barriers up to 100 mm
         low by Green Guide standard, the usable terrace are is 119.51 sq m and
         135.14 sq m which at the full 54 persons/10 sq m would only allow 645 and
         729 persons respectively to use the terraces.


11       Therefore Dy generously applied criteria, using the Green Guide as a basis,
         the designated numbers were 60% more than those which could be regarded as



                                              2                                           709
                                                                    Document Ko.   g   9        CONT’D



       acceptable even when considerable latitude had been given.         For instance if
       only those barriers which meet the Green Guide recommendations were used in
       this calculation, the allowable numbers of persons able to use the central
       terraces would drop to 389 and      5   AO.


 12    A search through the correspondence may throw more light on how the
       designated numbers were chosen and accepted, and on why other barriers were
       installed at later dates as shown in the revision notes on drawing 1610/64E.


13     It is probable that a member of the Safety Committee attended the Home Office
       Seminar in 1972 referred to in para 16 and should therefore have been quite
       clear how the Green Guide was to be applied even though the Guide itself is a
      little ambiguous.        I hope to obtain the delegate list of those who attended
      the Seminar.


14    It is clear that some barriers have been removed from the central pens over
      the last 10 years when Dr Eastwood made his original proposals.         If left in
      place some of these could have increased the area calculated in paras            9   ,   10

      and   1 1   , which could be designated for spectators.   Further searches will have
      to be made to find out their detail and the history of their removal.


15    All which I have said above assumes that the barriers are perfectly adequate
      to carry their loads, and ignores the effect of connecting a downward sloping
      tunnel, of the length noted at Hillsborough, directly into the terraces.


16    From conversations we have had so far with Dr Eastwocd I query whether the
      test procedures used, could categorically guarantee the reliability of the
      barriers.       That is whether the tests would pick up all the weaknesses in the
      barrier.


17    It appears that the test procedure was only nominally as required by the
      Green Guide i.e. in loading the barriers three times.        I do not believe at
      the moment this would be very significant, as the required procedure seess a
      little excessive.       However as an indication of the state of affairs, it seems
      that Dr__Eastwood and his staff thought they were implicitly following the
      Guide.                      ...         .... .—  ■-                -

 18    The procedure as I presently understand it, could have resulted in the end
       frame in bay 1, not being measured for permanent deflection.     (See the notes
       of my telephone conversation with Dr Eastwood, 5/6/89 in reply to
       question 3).


 B    ~ U e^°n,aendatons of the Green Guide in respect of the barriers and
      crowd densities

 19    I have had discussions with Brian Stickley of the Home Office Prison Service.
       He is the structural Engineer who worked out the structural provisions in the
       Green Guide and is probably the most informed person about what was intended
       to be in it and what research or other information was available as a basis
       for those provisions.


20    Mr Stickley clearly believed that both the provisions of the Green Guide were
      exceeded and had they been complied with, then the number of injuries could
      have been greatly reduced, if not avoided altogether.   The basis of this
      comment was not just that the designated crowd densities were too high
      because of the position, number and height of the barriers, but also that the
      Guide's recommendations on stewarding were not followed.     Clearly a huge
      influx of fans down the tunnel, whatever the level of occupancy of the
      terraces, was potentially hazardous.


21    However there are certain inconsistancies with his comments.     Mr Stickley has
      agreed that many of the provisions of the Guide are vague, almost ambiguous.
      (This is further discussed in Appendix 'A' giving abstracts from the Guide
      with comments).   He stated that this was deliberate because there are so many
      grounds with widely different characteristics that it would be impossible to
      give definitive clauses without either unnecessarily penalising some and
      being too lenient with others.   However it was expected in the Guide that the
      engineer working for the club would use the background philosophies from the
      Guide and relate these to any particular ground.   Hence when the Guide was
      launched in 1972 a sesinar was organised by the Home Office for members of
      the safety committees, in which Mr Stickley explained how the engineering
      provisions of the Guide should be applied, in particular how to work out the
      safe number of persons who should use the terraces.


22    While this may seem reasonable, a problem could have been caused because the
      Green Guide does not clearly describe the difference between its general



                                         A
                                                                Document Mo.   $9       CO.NTD


       philosophy and practical provisions (so much so that those dealing with the
       spacing X height of barriers are not stated as being the absolute minimum).
       It is therefore difficult to see how competent engineers like Dr Eastwood,
       can be criticised too much for not strictly following the Guide or because
       they were too liberal in interpreting its recommendations.


 23    In addition, Mr Stickley is now giving support to the Institution of
       Structural Engineers working party which is writing guidance called the
       Appraisal of Sports Grounds’, expressly to give less ambiguous guidance to
      engineers. This suggests some degree of recognition of the Green Guide’s
      shortcomings.


24    The references in the Guide to restraining crowd surges suggests that its
      authors considered its recommendations would prevent these.   Although the
      heights of barriers must have a big influence on this, heights are only
      mentioned in para ilO.   However the paragraph only proposes its the
      recommended height to enable the body to tolerate the crowd pressure.     There
      are other opportunities to refer to height when discussing crowd safety but
      only position and strength are mentioned e.g. paras 118, 221, 226, 227 and
      the preliminary to Chapter 9.


25    From the video pictures it is quite clear that there was a considerable
      amount of sway or surge in the crowd.   This seemed to be related to the crowd
      density, layout of the barriers and presumably barrier height.


26    it is also quite clear that at Hillsborough the barriers failed to break up
      the crowd pressure as recommended in para 21.   However the use of barriers to
      control the exit from an area as recommended in the Guide could allow surges
      in the crowd as the two recommendations may not be compatible.   This
      contradiction also appears in paras 113, and 114, leaving considerable
      discretion to the licensing authorities.


27    In a similar way the design of a layout to help a crowd to disperse when an
      event finishes may result in increasing crowd pressures where there is a
      sudaen ingress of people.   The fanning out philosophy for persons moving in
      one direction can easily form a steadily restricting funnel when they move in
      the opposite way.   In general, ingress will normally be at a trickle so that

                                                                                     712

     the funnelling effect is of little consequence, while egress will nearly
    always be in mass when the fanning out effect is highly desirable.


 28 The guide is reasonably firm about the height of the barriers although the
    stress on the idea that it is a "voluntary code" and "should be interpreted"
    at the beginning of the Guide could weaken the importance of having barriers
    at the correct height.    The Wheatley Report, from which the Guide was drawn,
    expresses the height recommendations much more strongly e.g. the height of
    crush barriers should preferably be 3 ’-6” above the ground".         In all cases
    they should be between 3*-4" and 3’-8’” . Clause 23.5 ‘Report of the Inquiry
    into Crowd Safety at Sports Grounds' by the Rt Hon Lord Wheatley.


29 The recommendations concerning height appear to have been determined "In order
    to locate the top rail against that part of the body most able to tolerate
   pressure" (para 110).     There seems some evidence that depending on the density
   of the crowd, a low barrier allows a body to bend over the barrier, passing
   the force it is subjected to, to those in front.     This action could make low
   barriers largely ineffective.


30 The testing of barriers described in Annex "C" fails to make a recommendation
   about the maximum deflection.    Strict interpretation could result in barriers
   that move 1 mm yet fail to recover 0.5 mm being failed, while those that move
   100 mm and recover 75 mm being passed.    Although the examples given are
   extreme they do illustrate that without skilled examination and interpretation
   of the results, the tests could encourage the acceptance of weakened barriers,
   while rejecting others that were satisfactory.    Paragraph 6 of the Annex does
   point out that barriers should be examined if any doubt exists about their
   strength, but the lack of more positive advice could easily lead to a wide
   variety in the quality of barriers across the country.


31 Paragraph 6 of Annex MC” says that detailed investigations should be carried
   out where there was doubt about the safety of the barrier, such as might be
   indicated by the distortion of connections.    Quite a few of the barriers now
   show distortion and I question when this occurred.


32 When referring to the packing density on terraces in para 221, little or no
  guidance is given on the criteria which should be used to govern the variation
  between 27 and 54 persons per 10 sq metres.

                                                                                          713
                                                                     Document No.    39    CONT’D



 33     In the 1946 Hughes Report on the disaster at Bolten Wanderers Football ground
       a maximum packing density of 6.5 persons per metre was recommended.          This was
       reduced to 5.A in the Wheatley Report.       Dr Eastwood has suggested that average
       densities of around 8.5 were achieved immediately post war,,which is similar
       to that which must   have occurred       on the terraces at Hillsborough.


 34     Examination of the videos appear to show an increasing variation in density
      from the back to the front, while those at the centre of the terrace do not
      appear to be unduly worried by their situation.        Initial estimates from the
      video suggest the density varied from about 6 to 10 or 11 persons per sq
      metre, so that those in the centre were at around 8 persons per sq metre.


35 This raises the question of what are suitable densities?           if 6.4 was
      acceptable in 1946 and 5.4 in 1972, should the Green Guide's criteria be
      revised again?   It might be that people today are generally larger and more
      restless, requiring more space, apart from any trend towards the public
      expecting more comfortable conditions.


Further work

36 The maximum crowd densities for various situations should be more adequately
      researched.   Some work might be possible fro= the photographs and videos of
   Hillsborough, counting the number of persons ir. the situations where they are
   obviously a) contented, b) overcrowded and c) ir. distress.         This work could be
   reinrorcea by packing people into given areas and counting the number of
   teenagers, women and mature men that will accept various densities.


37 Work should be undertaken to check out suitable heights and construction of
   barriers, in particular measuring the most effective height that will stop or
   suitably reduce a crowd surge.


38 Finally, research should be undertaken into modelling the pressures and
  densities in the crowd at Hillsborough so that alternative layouts can be
  tried out and the most suitable layout of barriers and exits can be
  discovered.       I originally considered that a hydraulic model might be suitable

           but having seen the videos, which appear to show a variation in density across
           the terrace, I am now not so sure.       I will try to obtain further advice on
           this.                                                                               ^

    4    The problem of crowd safety at sports grounds
         is complex and cannot be solved simply by       Once again great stress is
         ensuring that each component of a ground,       laid on the need for
         such as stairways, passages or sections of      intelligent assessment of the
         terracing, is satisfactory in itself. The       guide's provisions.
         inter-relation of these and other components
         is essential: none of them can be considered
         in isolation without consideration of its
         effects on the others, and they should all be
         compatible and combine to form a balanced
         unit.

    6    Deviations from individual guidelines are

         variety of type, function and layout of
         sports grounds and the inter-relationship cf
         the different parts of them means that a
         flexible approach should be maintained to
         take account of the particular circumstances
         at individual grounds, for these reasons the
         Guide does not attempt to set a minimum
         standard which would be acceptable for a
         well-attendec stadium but excessive for a
         smaller, sparsely-attended ground; or which
         would be an appropriate standard for the
         latter but insufficient for the former.

    8    It should be borne in mind that, when using
         the Guide to assess whether existing
         circumstances provide adequately for the
         safety of spectators, the criterion to be
         aimed for is that of a reasonable degree of
         safety. It would be unreasonable. even if it    Such terms are meaningless,

16        The second type is far more important and
           involves crowd pressures. When large crowds
           are present and densities are high, pressures
          build up within the crowd either through
          motion or swaying which make it difficult, or
          even impossible for individuals to control
          their won movements. Under these conditions
          crowd pressures can escalate to a dangerous
          level and if a person stumbles or falls the
          crowd cannot adapt to avoid him or to stop to

                    Many of the hazards arising from crowd
                    pressure on terraces can be eliminated by
                    provision of well constructed, correctly
                    positioned and properly mounted crush
                    barriers (paras 110-119).

              110 In order to locate the top rail against that      If this is so then there is no
                  part of the body most able to tolerate            excuse for allowing barriers

                  be between 1.02 metres and 1.12 metres above
                  the nosing of the step immediately behind the
                  barrier, with a preferred height of
                  1.1 metres.

              111 ..... Although a barrier with a top rail of
                  50 mm internal diameter tube has been             Again if this is so then a

                  use of a flat rail of 100 mm vertical depth.

              113 Ideally, crush barriers should be provided        If full length barriers are
                  along the full width of a terrace, with gaps      ideally the best they should
                  only at the radial gangways.                      be forcefully recommended.

              114 Where barriers are not continuous between
                  radial gangways, the alignment of gaps in
                  successive rows of barriers on a terrace,
                  should form an angle of less than 60° to the
                  barriers. There should be no more than 2
                  consecutive gaps in any line of gaps.

              115 Where there are gaps in the line of crush
                  barriers these should be at least 1.1 metres
                  and not more than 1.4 metres in width.

              117         The peak viewing areas are particularly
                    associated with football grounds and are
                    typically behind the goal areas. __

              safely accommodated when taking into account
              interactions between these individual
              features and where there are deviations from

              spacing guidelines of Ch. 9 the capacity of a
              terrace or viewing slope should be assessed
              from the area available for standing by
              allowing a packing density of between 54 and

               guidelines, so as to constitute a possible
               hazard to individuals closely packed.

        223          When the positioning and length of
               gangways do not meet with the recommendations
               of Ch. 8, paras 96-100, an appropriate
               reduction should be made to the area
               available for standing.

               notwithstnaidne the measures in this guide,
               because spectators may prefer to gather in
               certain parts or parts of a terrace. Ground

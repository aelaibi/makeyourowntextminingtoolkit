___________________ about the tragic events at Hillsborough.

As you will be aware, the Home Secretary has undertaken to consider
carefully the points which were made in the programme Hillsborough,
and the representations which have been made to him by the bereaved
families and by others. He has emphasised that he would not take
the decision to reopen the inquiry lightly but would need to be
convinced that it would be in the public interest to do so and that
it would stand a chance of providing a better understanding than
there is at present of what happened on that terrible day.

In coming to his decision the Home Secretary will consider whether
there is any new evidence; he will also consider whether that
evidence appears to be of such significance that had it been put
before Lord Taylor or before the coroner, either the outcome of the
Taylor inquiry or the verdict of the jury would have been different.

The Chiefs Constable of South Yorkshire has undertaken to provide the
Home Secretary with a detailed report of all the points raised by
the programme. The Home Secretary has promised that he will reach a
decision on any further action to be taken as soon as he has been
able to consider all the issues.

___________________ about the tragic events at Hillsborough.


As    you    will       be    aware,          the    Home     Secretary     has    undertaken       to
consider carefully the points which were made in the programme
Hillsborough,           and the          representations which have been made                       to
him by the bereaved families and by others.                                 He has emphasised
that    he    would          not    take       the    decision       to    reopen       the    inquiry

lightly but would need to be convinced that it would be in the
public      interest to do so and that it would stand a chance                                      of
providing      a better             understanding            than   there    is    at    present    of
what happened on that terrible day.


In    coming       to    his       decision          the    Home    Secretary      will       consider
whether      there           is    any    new        evidence;      he    will     also       consider
whether      that       evidence         appears to be of such significance that
had    it    been       put       before       Lord        Taylor   or    before    the       coroner,
either the outcome of the Taylor inquiry or the verdict of the
jury would have been different.


The    Chief       Constable             of     South       Yorkshire      has     undertaken       to
provide      the    Home          Secretary with            a detailed      report       of all    the
points raised by the programme.                            The Home Secretary has promised
that he will reach a decision on any further action to be taken
as soon as he has been able to consider all the issues.

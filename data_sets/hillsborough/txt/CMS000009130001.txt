Dear

Thank you for your recent letter to Mr Moynihan
which has been passed to this department in view of our
responsibilities for the Safety of Sports Grounds Act.  I
apologise for the delay in replying to you.

Thank you for expressing your concern over the cost of
introducing all seated accommodation at football league
grounds.   However, the cost incurred by these clubs may not be
quite so severe as it might initially seem.   As you may be
aware the Chancellor announced in the recent Budget that the
government would be reducing the pools betting tax therefore
making available
£100 million to the football industry over the next five
years.   The Football Trust expects to provide clubs with a
further £75 million over the next ten years, in addition to
almost £26 million provided each year by television and pools
companies.   Consequently there is a considerable amount of
money available to football clubs to make the necessary ground
improvements.

A further reason for the cost incurred by the clubs being less
than may be expected is that current attendances at many
grounds are well below the maximum capacity of the ground.
Lord Justice Taylor commented, in his Final Report, that a
small scale redevelopment possibly involving only part of the
ground, might be sufficient in some cases.

In answer to your other points, under the Safety of Sports
Grounds Act 1975 local authorities are responsible for issuing
designated sports grounds with a safety certificate, the
conditions of which must be met by the certificate holder.

                                                          Yours sincerely

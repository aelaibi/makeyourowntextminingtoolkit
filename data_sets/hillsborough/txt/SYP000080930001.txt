              I am a married man and live at the above address with my wife,                    son and

              daughter.                             ,

              I work in a local                'factory.        I have actively supported

              I am an agent for the Liverpool FC Development Fund in so far as I

              sell   lottery tickets each week at work.

              I travel to some home games and the occasional away game if I like the

              look of the fixture.

              I was present at the Heysel Stadium disaster               in May 1983 (000585) and

              was on the terraces.         Since then I have tried to get a seating ticket

              if possible.

              I. applied to Anfield and was allocated a seat in the North Stand.                        I

              pa id £ 12 for it.
                                                                                      PAGE

 I had arranged to travel to the game with two of my friends, Anthony

 d i d n ’t have a ticket, but b(e was prepared to pay for one and he knew

    that   if we   got there earlier we would be able to get one off a tout.

    The travel     arrangements   were that we were to allgo along            in my car.

    On Saturday the 13th of April      1989 (150489),      I left my house at about

    9.50am (0950).     I was driving my car, a brown Austin Metre                             I

    picked up Tony BLAND from his house and then we picked up

    from his home.

    We drove to Sheffield along the top road, Halifax, Huddersfield,

    Barnsley and Rotherham.       We came across no noticeable traffic: delays.

    We arrived     in Sheffield at about    11.15am   (1115).       We drove towards the

    ground and     parked about a mile away outside a public          house,      I don't

    know the name of it.                                        /                     i

    We then walked to Hillsborough and                bought y £& ticket off a tout

    who was standing not far from the gates at Lej/pings/Ln.                  We then
---------------------------------------------------
    walked back to the pub and remained there unti 1y^about 1.43pm

    (1345).    There were   plenty of people in the             both sides of

    supporters.     The doors were locked just a’ftffe r we got thgre.

    Everyone was good natured with no sign of any troubla^ at all.                    I had

    about 3 pints,    I think the other 2 had about the same.

    We walked down to the ground and arrived at the Leppings Ln e nd at

    about 2pm.

    We all agreed that after the game we would meet outside the main gates,

    I found my seat and just watched the pre-match build up.                   From where     I

    sat    I could see probably the 1st 20 rows of supporters           in the pens.

    I only became aware of a problem at about           1455.   I saw several         fans

    being lifted from the terraces         into the North Stand.       I could see some

    Policeman standing at the front of the pens waving his arms to tell
                                                                                    PAGE
                                                                                    S2519
          I



              the fans in the pens to move back.

              I saw the game start at 3pm (1300) and I was half watching that and

              half watching the problem in the pens.         I could see people being

              lifted over and spilling onto the pitch.

              I then saw a Policeman run onto the pitch and then the game was

              stopped.    I could see people     in distress and also some being

              resuscitated.    I realised then that it was a serious problem.

              I realised there was nothing       I could do and decided to leave the

              g r ound.

              I walked back to the      car and waited for       and Tony.         came back

     .cSS. about 5pm      (1700),    but there was no sign of Tony.    I was listening to
 §
              the car radio and was aware of the enormity of the tragedy,

              ye tried to ring home,      but couldn't get through.   We then drove home.

              i   rang          as soon as we got to Kei a hley.

              I was very shocked and distressed along the journey home.

                                                                                    IIGNED

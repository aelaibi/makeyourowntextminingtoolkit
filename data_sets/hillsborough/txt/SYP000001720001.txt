              Further        to my previous             s t a tement      I made      on   15 April          1989   (150489)      I

               was    not made        fully aware          of what was           required apart              from a      formal

               i d e n t i f i c a t i on of my son.,            In relation        to the        incident      itself     I would

               like       to make the f o l lowing               o bs e r v a t i o n know.

               At a p p r o x i m a t el y      14.55 on S a t u r d a y       15 April       1989     (150489)       I was

fJH'*          sea t e d    in the N or t h S t a n d seat No 97,                 Row 43 whi ch is in the                 se c o n d

               row before          the top of the stand.                      I had an e x c ellent           veiw of the West

               s tand terraces           from a b o v e .         I could see         the area         behind the        goal

               m ou t h    in the standing a rea was                   fully     packed w i t h s u p p o r t e r s      to the

               degree       that    some of them we re climbing                     out and up into             the West

               S t a n d above      t h e m , whi ch looked to me as                  if they were            vastly

               over crowded.            S u p p o rt er s were also            climbing       over     the    internal     fences

               whi ch enab l e d them to get                 into      the othe r pens either                 side w h e r e    the
                                                                                                                PAGE
                                                                                                                S1   7 2   B

crowding was            less     severe.

At about 3.00            pm     ( 1 5 0 0 ) Inter       or just       prior     to the Kick         off      I saw

numerous         supporters         climbing           over    the first        perimeter        fence and          on to

the    p i t c h.      I then began              to think that         som e t h i n g was      s e r i o u s l y wrong

in that area and the                   only thing            I could think           of was     that    the    cause

was    severe         over    crowding       by the s u pporters               who were        being    p e rmitted

to enter         that    part     of the ground.                 1 could not u n d e r s t a n d why the

s up p o r t e r s    in that a r e a were             not    permitted        to move       to either        side

where       I could see that             there a p p e a r e d       to be      plenty of open space

a v ai la bl e       to them.       I could not              see any official              stewards     or Police

Offic e r s      inside       the West S t a n d t e r raced are a or anyone                       in there         doing

any s upervising w h a t s oever.                      I then saw the           perimeter        fence       gate    open

w hi c h    leads      directly        on to the         playing are a and a number                    of

s upporte rs          came t h r o u g h on to the field.                     The    gate was     t hen      closed as

the mat ch was           still      in progress.              There was a lot of spect a t o r s                by
                                                                         f
this       time,      on the     playing area and                I noti c e d       that    the Liverpool

Players       nearest         the goal       m o u t h at the L i v e r p o o l        end s u d d e n l y s t o p p e d

playing        football         and then the            referee      stop p e d the g a m e .          P e o p l e were

climbinq         over fences and             coming          thro u g h the     open       perimeter        fence

gate.        I saw      part of the          front       perimeter           fence    bing     pulled down

a ll owing       people to        come on to the               pitch.          Pe o p l e were being carried

who a p p e ar ed to be             uncons c i ous and              lifeless and           were be i ng laid down

on the turf            in and a r ou nd          the    goal m ou t h area.          There       was a lot      of

the supporters               carrying      people        on to the            playing area and a lot            of

Police O fficers              s tamping a r o un d the field doing                     n o t h i n g other     than

wa t ching       what was        taking      place.           The   s u p p o r t e r s were     doing more          to

help       in the situation,             than were any              of the      stewards        or Pol i c e

O ff i c e r s who were          on duty          inside      the ground.            I w ould    estimate       there

was a p p r o x i m a t e l y    150   - 2 0 0    Police O f f i c e r s inside            the ground,         the

maj o r i ty of these            be i ng s tat i onary across                 the    centre     of the       pitch and
                                                                                                              PAG E
                                                                                                               S1728

            d i r e ct ly   in front       of the N or t h Stand.

            In my opinion there was a total                     lack of s u p e r v i s i o n or control       of

            supporters         by an y o n e   in a u t h o r i t y or control    inside H i l l s b o r o u g h

           Fo o tball       S ta d i u m w h i ch    includes S t e wards   and Police O f f i c e r s     who

            could have a s s i s te d but             for   reasons   best known     to thems e l v e s    didn't.

           The    paragraph         relates         to the i,„epping Ln End      of the    ground.

            11    o' clock     in the m o r n i n g we used the mo to r w a y to get there                but    I

            d o n ’t know w hi ch m o t o r w a y system of          roads we used,        we went straight

            busy but       I didn't see any            problems at the        time we were using           them.

            We a r r i v e d   in S h e f f i e l d at about 2pm and we           parked in a fact ory

            carpark      near to the ground,               it took about      10 minu tes     to get      to the

            ground.        When we got to the ground                I saw    people milling about            near         the

            t u rn st il es    but that was         not unusual,        there w e r e n ’t any queues at             the

            other     than them I did see              people drinking        but not to excess.             When I

            ent e r e d the ground the fans                seemed to be heading for a tunnel,                   we

            f o l l o w e d as we thought          that was    the way to go,         nobody was dir ec ti ng              us

            and    I had not been there              before an d so I fo ll owe d the            crowd.      I went

        •          down the        tunnel w ith my mates,           I wa lk ed down      it and I had a          clear an

            unobstructed           passage along        it, wh en    I got    to the end I went           to the

3   v       right of the g o a l, the              pen was    full at this        p o i n t , I wo uld say      it was

            about 2.30 a n d            I had no problems working            my wa y down to the          place       I

    ^^VM'anted to stand,                  I was aware as time went on that the                   pen was     getting

            fuller     but     it didn't      bother me at that time.               I remember whe n the

            teams     came out there was a big                cheer from our end an d just after                     that

            there was a surge              fo rw a r d but after     the surge      I ex pe cte d to go back

            but we didn't we stayed by the fence,                        it was at that       point    I realised

some th in g was very wrong.                I was being         crushed,        I couldn't move my

arms,     they were stuck ac ro ss my                  chest.       I m a n a g e d to stand on tip toe

an d    lift my head up.            I was having di ff i c u l t y         in breathing.          I thought

that     I was      going to die.         I was        really sca red      I just thought         I w a s n ’t

going     to get out,        all    the time          I had my head up       in the air      looking          at

the sky.           I didn't even know the game had kicked off.                        I noti ced that

the top of the fence was a b o v e me,                    I dec id ed that       if I could free my

arms,     I w o u l d try and       climb out of the            pen onto the        pitch.     I tried to

get my arms          free but they were stuck ac ro ss my chest.                       I s t r u g g l e d for

ages an d after about              10 min ut es a gap must have a p p e a r e d and               I

rele as ed one of my arms and                   I made a grab for the fence,             ev en t u a l l y     I

m a n a g e d to free my other arm.                   I then lifted myself         up over   people           in

front     of me,      I s t r u g g l e d but    I    m a na ge d to get onto the top of the

fence.        I re alised then that my shirt had been                       ripped and was hanging

off me.           I was also     covered from head to toe                 in sweat,    my remaining

clothes were a b s o l u t e l y soaking.                I lay on top of the fence for a

short     time to      catch my breath an d              I was so      r je ti i eved to be out       of the

crush.        I looked back to where                  I had be& jf an d    I could see two men

lying on top of each other,                     I just kn^w they were dead,             they w e r e,both

w hi t e ag e d about 30ish,           o ne was wear ing a beige jacket thats all                        I can

remember,         one may have been stocky but thats                      it.

After     that      I rolled off the ffop of the fence an d on to the                        pitch side

of the fence.           I got up I d a s in a daze, I was having dif f i culty                           in

breat hi ng        I remember war ni ng aw ay onto the g r a s ^ a n d through the                       crowd

of     people,      I then    c o ll ap se d onto the g r ou nd y^ next          I remember a

Li ve r p o o l    fan te lling me that              I wo ul d be/klright,       he called someone

over.       I was then

              I did not a t t e n d the same m a t c h last year   in fact   I have not been to

              that ground before.

              I think that the fences at the front of the            pens were too high and

              sho ul d not be spiked    in fact   I think the front fences      should all   be

              removed and replaced w i t h other     types of fences     like the ones they

              sh ow ed on television.

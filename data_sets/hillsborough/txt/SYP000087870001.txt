         whilst       en    route          to     the     g r o u n d we       were     instructed            to        change over            to

         at   the     rear       of the           North       S t a n d a nd was           told      that     we       should join             other

           * Leppings           Ln   en d      of    the     ground.            My    serial        went    to    that       e nd   of    the

             ground        on the P o l i c e             c o n tr o l    box    side       of    the     goal.        I sa w a small

             number        of    fans,         who       were     obviously           dead and           others    wh o      were    being

                                                                 Ffic&rs        and    fans          My Serial          began       to a s s i s t

             and    I assisted              Inspector             PURDY with           one       fan,    who     was    obviously          badly

             injured           until      he w a s        removed         from       the    pitch.         I then attempted                to    get

             those        who    were       not      injured        to     sit at          the    side     of    the    pitch       out    of    the

             way,     but       many      of    the       fans     were     obviously             in a s t a t e       of    shock       and

             some    were        openly aggressive.                        I arranged             vi a   the     SWFC apprentices                for

             water        to    be   brougf                 ,o    the     pitch       for     the    uninjured.              I eventually

             •formed       part      of     the      cordon        across        the       pitch a n d a s s i s t e d        in    clearing

             the    g r ou n d .       Many         of    the     fans     were       very angry and              I believe          the       cordon

             was    necessary             in o r d e r       to    prevent           further        trouble.




             At    6 pm    (1800)         I returned              to W Bar,           but     I had       been    separated          from       the

             rest    of m y S e r i a l .                I went     off     d u t y at       8pm     (2000).

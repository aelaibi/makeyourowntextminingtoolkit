        Dear Sirs

        RE: ARLINGTON v DUCKENF1ELD AND MURRAY

       I note the proposal to seek a judicial review of the decision of the Crown Prosecution
       service not to intervene in this case.

       hSrf Kl]llb° ^       amily Support GroiV *** n0w pressing for disclosure of material
       Held by the CPS They requested this several months ago, but we indicated we would
       not disclose until after we had decided whether to intervene in the prosecution We
       nave now considered this question further.

       From correspondence with the solicitors for South Yorkshire Police it is apparent that
       the current view of the Assistant Chief Constable is that the police will not consider
       vo untary disclosure until such time as the judicial review proceedings are concluded
       I have written to the solicitors today indicating that I propose to give voluntary
       disclosure at this stage. I await their response.                            vuunraiy

       I attach a copy of a letter I have sent to the HFSG and you will see from it that the
       « t V1CW * } ■ should make v°tofltary disclosure. We do not consider that the
       S ! ! ! 06 a JudlC!al. rev!ew Proceedings provides proper grounds for withholding
       disclosure. Appreciating the need to be fair to all parties, we will deal with disclosure
          anTr en      f ,™ay- Therefore if we copy material to HFSG, we will copy it to
       you. If we give facilities for inspection, we will make the same material available to

       Yours faithfully

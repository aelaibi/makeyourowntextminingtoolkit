Mrs Maureen Hicks (Wolverhampton North East): To ask the
  Secretary of State for the Home Department, if he will make a
  statement on the estimated costs of the Hillsborough police
  enquiry and the means of funding the West Midlands police
  responsible for that enquiry.

regard to the means of funding the West Midlands police I would
refer my hon Friend to the answer [-!■)■[my rt hon Friend^ gave to
my hon Friend the Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak, on 28 April
at [Col No].
BACKGROUND NOTE


Mrs Hicks is concerned that the costs incurred by the West
Midlands police in their inquiries following the Hillsborough
disaster should not fall on the West Midlands police authority.
The Secretary of State wrote to all West Midlands MPs on 27 April
giving an assurance that wherever the costs fall, they should not
and do not fall to the West Midlands.   He also answered a
Parliamentary Question from Mr Beaumont-Dark on the same subject.
[Copies of the letter and Parliamentary Answer are at Annexes A
and B .]


As the letter states, it will take some time to sort out the
precise mechanics of how the West Midlands police should be
reimbursed and it has been suggested in Mr Addison's submission
of 28 April that the best way forward would be an early meeting
between the Home Office and the South Yorkshire Police Authority
initially as the force in whose area the tragedy occurred.

          We have        spoken in the House              about    the costs      incurred by the West
Midlands police in their inquiries following the Hillsborough disaster.                                  You
and other West Midlands MPs are understandably anxious that these should not
fall on the West Midlands police authority.


          It     seems     to me       quite      clear   that,     wherever      the    costs   fall,   they
should not and do not fall to the West Midlands.                          The Chief Constable of the
West Midlands was initially invited by the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire
to review all aspects             of     the     police    operation.       And    subsequently      it was
agreed    that    the results of these inquiries should be made available to the
public inquiry which I announced on 24 April to be conducted by Lord Justice
Taylor.



          It will        take a while          to sort     out the precise mechanics of how the
West Midlands police should be reimbursed.                         But I can guarantee now that at
the end of the day no additional costs will be borne by the West Midlands.

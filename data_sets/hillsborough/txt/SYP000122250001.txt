                     gates are opened by re1easing bo 11s at the top and bo11om.                                                           The

seven of        these       gates    in use and each one                is m a n n e d    by a Steward.



Type two        is easy to          operate     and    gaves     quick access             to the          p itch   i

the     case of emergency.



Lateral        fences are        only used        to divide         standing/seating                 areas.

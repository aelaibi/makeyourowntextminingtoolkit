By hand


Dear Richard,

DAVID ALTON MP: HILLSBOROUGH

      Thank you for your helpful advice yesterday by telephone.

       I enclose the papers we have received from No 10 on this case, and the
provisional draft submission and draft replies we have prepared. I am expecting
a contribution very shortly from the Charity Commission, who are providing me
with a copy of the Attorney General's guidelines on disaster appeals, but I am
already aware of the general line they are taking (ie that the main trust is non-
charitable and therefore not a matter for the Commission or charity law).
Indeed, the case may not really be for this Department to handle either, but time
is too limited to argue about who else might 'lead'!

       Please could you let me have any comments on the proposed advice,
ideally today but if not by 1lam tomorrow (Friday). I am sorry to have to ask
for such a quick reply.

     I am copying this also to Caroline Price, Home Office Legal Adviser's
Branch (273 3151), and to Elizabeth Shaw, Charity Commission (210 4414, fax
210 4604).

                                        Yours sincerely,




                                        Frank Smith

DAVID ALTON MP: HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER APPEAL (PO 18997/94)

Issue

Correspondence to the PM from David Alton MP about the Hillsborough Disaster Appeal
rustees: in particular reference to their management o f funds in relation to his constituents



Timing

2.    PM's office have asked that a draft reply for the Prime Minister's signature reach them
by Monday, 15 August.

Summary

3. The correspondence refers to the Trustees' management o f funds in particular, and in
general to the principles on which the funds are based. The money raised was placed into
two separate funds. The smaller fund (£2 million) was registered as a charity and the larger
fund (£12 million) was not. It is the use o f the larger fund, and the division o f funds in this
way in general, to which Mr Alton and his constituents object. The essence o f the draft, put
forward for PS signature and transmission to the PM's office is that the management o f funds
which are not registered as charities is essentially a private matter. Any dispute between the
trustees and Mr Alton's constituents is not for Government (including the Charity
Commission) to resolve, but for the individuals concerned and the courts.

Recommendation

5. PS/SofS to write to the PM's Office as in the draft enclosed.

Consideration/presentation/handling

6. This is obviously a case o f considerable sensitivity, as the consituents'
_________________________________________ Wherefunds are held by a charity, the Charity
Commission have a locus in seeking to ensure they are administered appropriately. However,
with a non-charitable trust as here, the matter is a private one involving general trust law and
the trustees and others directly involved. The principal issue is the operation o f the main trust
in question, not the adequacy o f the law on trusts as such.

DAVID ALTON MP: HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER APPEAL


Thank you for your letter o f 1 August.


As requested, I enclose a draft reply for the Prime Minister's signature. This takes into
 account views expressed by the Charity Commission and the legal secretariat to the Attorney
 General, whom we have consulted.


 The principal point is that since the main fund which is being complained about is not a
 charity, the Charity Commission have no locus and its administration is a private matter
 involving the individuals concerned.
Draft letter PM to David Alton MP. House of Commons               (Draft 11.8.94^


Thank you for your letter o f 28 July. I have the utmost sympathy for


                                                               and I have the great admiration
for the bravery and dedication they have shown.


There was enormous public sympathy following the Hillsborough disaster, in consequence o f
which such a very substantial and impressive sum o f money was donated. As you appreciate,
in such a situation those responsible for administering the money have some discretion over
the terms under which a trust or trusts are established. The Attorney General has published
guidance which can be o f assistance in these circumstances, and this may have been taken
into account by the trustees o f the Hillsborough funds.


One option is to establish a charitable fund, which would bring the monies within the remit
o f the law on charities, and would place the organisation concerned (which would bew a
charity) under the supervision o f the Charity Commission. However, as the trustees explained
to you (as recorded in your letter o f 28 July tq___________________, that can have significant
limitations in the way the money can be applied. A considered decision is necessary, taking
the advantages and disadvantages o f both into account.


Where a non-charitable, discretionary trust is established, the distribution o f money is not a
matter in which the Government could or should interfere. As a non-charitable private fund,
the use o f the money is the responsibility o f the trustees under the law o f as it relates to
private trusts. The trustees are responsible for the administration and distribution o f the
money, and do have the authority, within the trust deeds and trust law, to make judgements
about how the money is used. The allocation between short term and long term needs, for
example, may well be an issue the trustees should properly consider. Where someone who
considers he or she has a claim to the money disputes how it has been administerd, the proper
course o f action would be to pursue the matter in the courts. With this in mind, I am afraid
it would not be right for me to comment on their actions.


I am    sorry that I cannot be o f more assistance to                           in this case.

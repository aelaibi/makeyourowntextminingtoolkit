    A    man,      late             5 0 ’ s,            early          6 0 5s , w e a r i n g           a    Notts          Forest           cap       and       scarf

    slow.         He        was           carrying                 a       plastic           carrier             bag    and        a    tan       coloured

    ladies         purse.                     I Upojk'e            to        him       and    told          him    that        he      was        at    the       wrong

    end      of    the          ground,                  he     seemed             a    bit    confused.                    I asked           him       for       his

    ticket         so       I       could               direct             him.         He    said          he    h a d n ’t       got       one.           He    pointe

    to    his      purse             and            said,          “ I ’ve         got       ten       pounds,          do     you       know          where          I       can

    buy      one".              I    directed                   him          to    the       Penistone             Road        end.      but       advised                him

    to    go      home.

    became         aware             of            ever       growing              groups          of       people,          youths,              late       teens

    early         twenties,                        stood        about,             a    lot    sat          on    walls        near          the       bridge.

Suddenly          Leppings                Lane       is       full       of    people,             just          a    mass       moving        towards

us.     I ’ve      worked                dozens          of    matches            at     Hillsborough?                      a    few    of     the

other       s e m i ’ s,        but       i ’ve      n e ^ e ^ r ^ ^ e ^ ^ n y thi ng               like             that.        Next       thing,

the    q ueues         have          d i s a p p e a r e d / there                was     just          a    w£ss          of    people        in    the

enclosure,             a       lot       had       got    the       wrong         area.            People             with       tickets        for          the

North       Stand          and       standing             tickets              in      our     enclosure, getting                        bad    now.

People       pushing                to    get       in    and       out        of      the     enclosure.




Found       myself             right          in    the       corner           next       to       the      large metal                fence,            I

could       see    through                a    small          gap     of       about          4"    next             to   the    wall into           the

standing          terraces                queues,             people          were       getting             squashed             badly.            It       must

have    been       2,45             p.m.       by    now,          but     i ’m     not       sure.              Young          lads,    teenagers

had    c 1 iflLbetf^on              top       of    the       barrier          to       escape          the          crush,       some       came        into

our    enclosure,                   others          clLtffbed         onto        the     brick             wall          over    the    top        of       the

turnstiles             into,the                ground.              I ’ve      no       idea       how       many          climbed       over        into

the    ground,             but       a    lot       did       so.




The    horses          outside                were       totally           ineffective,                     it       looked       like       they        were

being       pushed             by    the       crowd          instead          of       the    other             way       round,        I    got        some

young       lads,          early          teens          off       the     barrier,            they          had          tickets       for     the

terraces,          I       pushed             them       to    the       f/ont          and    through                turnstile          No.        16

into    the       ground             to       get    them          oM,     of' t h e      crush.                 The       man    on    the

turnstile          appeared                   not    to       be    checking             tickets,                he       had    his    foot        on       the

pedal       and    the          turnstile                was       just       going          round.              It       seemed       that     if

someone        had         a    ticket             they       were       in.        I    saw       no       one       refused          entry.

our     enclosure,                      I    suddenly             became       worried                and    concsr^d.                for jny^own

safety.               I managed                  to    grab       Jeff       and       together             we       pushed          along        the

barrier             to     the      front             of    the       enclosure.                Together              we       tried        to.close

the     gates            at    the          front,          no    chance.              A    mounted          officer                saw     us    and

moved        his         horse          over          in    front       of    the          gates.           The          right       hand        gate       was

pushed           shut         and       after          a    struggle          the          bolt       put    into             the    floor.          We

tried        to       close         the          other       side?       got       thumped             by    a       fan       for    my     trouble,

beer,        one         or    two,          nox       many,          still    d r i n k i ng          f r om        c a n s , not          soft

drinks,             beer       and          lager.           Saw       one    drinking                from       a       brown       bottle,         it

looked           like         P i Is        lager,          c o u l d n ’t    stop          them,       I    c o u l d n ’t          get     them.           I

were       totally             swamped                with       people.           I       knojw      the    others             were        there       I

just       couldn't                see       them.           The       crowd       jusjs         kept       coming,             pushing           and

shoving             forwards.                    The       turnstiles          cSq A I d n " t         cope.              I    d i d n ’t    know       what

to    do,        we      c o u l d n ’t          stop       them       coming.              I    thought             to       myself        (someone             is

going        to       get         hurt       here).




I    then        saw       Gate                   to       the    North       Stand,            open,       people             pourej              !p u g h .


After        a      couple          of       minutes             the    crush          eased          but    there             were       s^uTl

hundreds              of      peopled about.                      I could          see          some    of       the          other       officers

near       the        turnstiles.                      The       plastic       dust             bin    that          I    had       been     putting

cans       in       was       still          in       the     corner,         but          it    was     squashed               flat,        the     cans

that       had        been         in       it    were        strewn         all       over.           Someone                nearby        shouted,

"Get       inside             t h e y ’ re        on       the    pitch".               1 went         through                one    of     the

turnstiles,                   I    don't          know        which      one,          I    followed             some          other        lads.

O n ce    inside              I    saw       a    large       number       of       officers                   running          towards                the

fifty       officers.                    I       followed          into    the       South                stand.           I    saw          people             on

the      edge        of       the       pitch          and    the       last    couple                of       players             leaving.                 There

were      quite           a       few    officers             on    the    edge          of       the          pitch       near             to    the       goal,

fans      were           climbing                over    the       perimeter             fence             onto       the          edge          of    the

pitch       area.                 I got          down    to       the    edge       of       the          field       but          I    c o u l d n ’t          see

or    tell       what             was    happening.                 Police          Sergeant                   J^ohrM^organ                  ran       passed

me    back       towards                the       South       Stand.           He    shouted,                   "Come          on       round          the

back".           1       followed,                as    did       Jeff.        We    ran          back          round          to       the       rear          of

the      Leppings                 Lane       stand       and       into    t \-yi c e n t r e              tunnel          which             was       just

about       empty.                 There          were       no    injur/ed         people                in    the    tunnel.                    John

Morgan,          myself                and       Jeff    got       to    the    end          of    the          tunnel.                 There          were

three       or       four          other          officers          with       us    but          I       d o n ’t    know             who       they          were.




I    started             grabbing                hold    of       people       pulling                them       back          and          shouting             at

them      to     get          back       and       go       out.        People       in       the          stand       above                me    were

hysterical,                   shouting             and       pointing          to    the          front          of    the             terraces,                 1

c o u l d n ’t       understand                   them,       it    was    like          a    foreign                language,                   but       I

realised             that          something             was       very    w r o n y              I       pushed       forwards                   pulling

^so^juj^Jaack                 and       shouting             for    them       toVleave                   to    go    back             as    1    did.           John

Morgan         was        near          me       and    was       doing    th4       same.                 I    got    to          the       first

barrier,             I    found          a       man    in    his       m i djtwenties,                                                      the

ba r r i e r .           He       was    on       the       bottom       s/de       near          the          pitch,          I       pulled          him       up,

he    had      blood              coming          from       hi s^jrmutJn, q u i t e                  a    bit,       he       was          h a v i ng

'd 1 f f i c u l t y      b r e a t hing.               He    was       pale,       crying,                asking          for          help          and

saying,          "Get             me    out".           I    pushed       him       under             the       barrier                and       as    I       did

two      fans        came          from          the    back       got    hold       of       him          and       dragged                him       oft

towards          the          tunnel.

                   I    turned           to       go    towards                the       front        and         went       under          the       barrier.                     I was

                   still       pulling                 people             back.           I was                                             three             times           on       the

                   legs,       it        was       not       by       accident.                                                                                   f rom       just       a

                   Suddenly              I    lost       my       footing                on    the      steps           and       fell,          my       helmet              came

                   off.        I was              terrified                for       a    few       seconds.                 I    got       to       my       feet           faster

                   than       I ’v e         ever       done          before,             someone             pulled             me    up       as    well,              1    d o n ’t

                   know       who.            I was          confronted                   by    a     man         screaming             at       me,          1    c a n ’t

                   remember              what,          but       I       got    the          gist.           I    remember             one          sentence,

                   "people           are          dying       down             there,          do     something".                      He       grabbed             me,           my     tie

                   came       off,           my    jacket             was       pulled           open.             I    pushed          passed                him        and       pushed

                   him    towards                 the    tunnel.                 I       still         c o u l d n ’t        see       the       front             of        the

                   terraces,                 people          were          still          climbing                the    perimeter                   fence.




                   I    saw    three              or    four          Police             Officers             pulling             at    the          fence           from          the

                   pitch       side,              trying          to       pull          the    wire          mesh       from          the       frame.              I       looked

                   iown,       there              were       two          fans       knel/t,           one        was    giving             mouth             to    mouth              and

                   blue,        I    felt          sick.              I    shouted             at      them        to    move          him       back,             give           him

                   air.        People              around             me       had       started            to     move          back       a    little.                     There        was

winded        for      a     bit.         I       looked       up,         people           all       around,          people                 laid

everywhre,             some        dead        many          injured.              I    realised                he    was       too        far          gone?       I

c o u l d n ’t    help        him,        thought             (sorry          pal       you're             dead).




I went        back         down     the        tunnel          and         got     to       the       Terraces.                 Someone                 in    the

to    carry       another           to        the       b^ckr u p          the     tunnel,                went       back,        another                one,

then    another,              both        dead          and    injured.                 I       thought          (this           is       not

down     the      tunnel,           the           playing          area       was       a       mass       of    people.                  I    c a n ’t

remember          what        happened,                then.           I wanted             to       go    home,       run        a w a y , my               legs

 Kenneth Edward Horsfield P.C.1171* F2 EcclesfieleU Serial No 15

9am on duty at Ecclesfield, 9.^5am in North Stand at Hillsborough for briefing,
nice sunny day for a football natch. 11.15 am at rear of Leppings Lane Stand
for a short briefing with Insp Sykes. ll.ifOam outside ground on turnstiles
to Lerpings Lane Stand,centre portion,     took turnstile No 16, turned out to
be a bad move. 12.0^om my turnstile opened up had a chat with the opnerator.
no supporters going into the ground and only a handful in the road,
lpm. very quiet, half a dizen oeople passed through my turnstile          , coaches
dropped fans off right infront of the turnstiles, I didnt count the coaches
maybe six, perhaps a dozen,,the fans did not enter the ground, I didnt se                on-e
go to the turnstiles,    they all walked off along Leppings Lane in both dirrectio m
1 just stood around with Jeff Alexander and the others,
       By 2pm there were a f w    more people about,   some going through the
tarnstiles into the ground , no problems, no queues, 2.15pm now an endleso
stream of People small orderly queues forming at the turnstiles.
A man lat- 50s early 60s wearing a Notts Forest cap and scarf approaches the
area outside the turnstiles , he appeared to be a bit slow, he was carrying
a plafetic carrier bag and a tan coloured ladies purse. I spoke to him and told
him that he was at the wrong end of the ground, he seemed a bit confused.
I asked him for his ticket so I could dirrect him, he said he hadn't got one
he pointed to his purse and said "Iv'e got ten pounds, do you know where I
can buy one", I dirrected him to the fienistone Road end but advised him to go
home. By now it was about 2.30 pm it was very buisy alot of people about,
I sooke to several youths who were Hanging about in small groups and told
 toem to go into the gcound, they didnt, they hadnt got tickets, I told them to
 go away, I was wasting my breath. I became aware of ever growing groups of
 people, youths late teens early twenties, stood about, alot sat on walls near                  .
 the bridge. Suddenly Lepring Lane is ful’ of people,      just a mass moving
 towards us. Ive worked dozens of matches at Hillsborough, a few of the oth^r
 semi's but Ive never seen anything like that. Next thing,         the queues have
 disapeared there was just a mass of people in the enclosure,         alot had got
 the wrong area,    people with tickets for thr NorthStand and standing tickets
 in our enclosure,    getting bad now, people pushing to get in and out of the
 enclosure. Found myself right in the corner next to the large metal fence.
 I could se- through a small gap of about' k" next to the wall into the standing
 terraces queues,    people were getting squashed badly, I must have been 2.*+5pm
 by now, but 14 not sure.Young lads, teenagers had climbed onto? of the barrier
 to escape the crush some came into our enclosure others climbed onto the
 brick wall over the top of the turnstiles into the ground, Ive no idea how
 Bany climbed over into th« ground but alot did so. The horses         o u t s i d e   were
totally ineffective, it looked like they were being pushed by the crowd
instead of th- oth-r way round. I got some young lads early teens off the
barrier,   they had tickets for the terraces, I pushed the>;i to the front and
through turnstile No 16 into the ground to get them out of the crush. The
man on the turnstile appeared not to be checking tickets he had his foot
on the Dedal and the turnstile was just going round, it senmed that if somone
had a ticket they were in, I saw no one refused entry. I was trapped in the
corner,    couldnt move easily,   people,   grown men now climbing over the barrier
from the crush at th° other side, not much better this side, heard people
crying out and shouting for help,      people standing on my head and shoulders
as they climbed over into our enclosure. I suddenly became worried and
concerned for my own safety, I managed to grab Jeff and together we pushed
along the barrier to the front of the enclosure,        together we tried to close
the gates at the front, no chance, a mounted officer saw us and moved his
horse over infront of the gates, the right hand gate was pushed shut and
aft-r a struggle the bolt put into the floor, we tried to close the other
side , got thumped by a fan for m y trouble, couldnt manage to close the gate
Leooings Lane seamed full of peopl-- as far as I could see, fans now climbing
over the gate we had shut. Some fan'        smelled strongly of beer, one or two
not many, still drinking from <£ans, not soft drinks, beer and lager,          saw one
drinking from a brown bottle, it looked like Dils lager, couldnt stop them,
I couldnt get to them. I couldnt see any other police officers exept the
mounted lads who were total !y swapped with people. I know the others were
there I just couldnt se^ them. The c-owd just kept comming pushing and
 shoving forwards, the turnstiles       co Ldnt cope. I didnt know what to     do,we
 couldnt stop them comming. I thought to myself (someone is going         to   get hurt
 here). I then saw gate A* to the North Stand open, people poured through.
After a coupl'    of minutes the crush eased but there were still hundreds of
 tieo ole about, I could see some of the other officers near the turnstiles,
 The elastic dust bin that I had been putting cans in was still m         the corner
 but it was squashed flat the cans that had be-n in it were strewn all over.
 Someone nearby shouted "Get inside their on the witch" I went through one of
 the turnstiles I dont know which one I follower some other lads.
 Once inside I saw a large number       of officers running towards the South Staid
 end behind the Lepoings Lane stand,        there were forty or fifty officers,
 I followed into the South Stand. I saw people on the edge of the pitch and the
 last couple of players leaving,      there were quite a few officers on the edgw
 of the pitch near to the goal,      fans were climbing over the perimiter fence
 onto the edge of the pitch area. I got down to the edge of the field but I
 couldnt se? or tell what was happening.        P.S. John Morgan ran passed me back
4




                                    .3 .
towards the south stand, He shouted "Come on round the back" I followed as did
Jeff, we ran back round to the rear of the Lept?ings Lane stand and into the
centre tunnel which was .just about emoty, there were no injured neotile in the
    tunnel, John Morgan myself and Jeff got to the end of the tunnel, there were
    thre? or four other officers with us but I arimt know \vh~> there were.
    I started grabbing hold of peoole pulling them back and shouting at them to get
    back anc’ go out. Peot>le in the stand above me were hysterical,   shouting and
    ■pointing to the front of the terraces. I couldnt understand them it was like
    a foreign language,   but I realised that sonething was very wrong. I pushed
    forwards pulling neople back and shouting for them to leave to go back as I
    did. John Morgan was near me and was doing th£' same. I got to the first barrier
    I found a man in his mid twenties slumped over the barrier,     he was on the
    bottom side near the pitch, I pulled him ut>, he had blood conning from his
    mouth, quite a bit, he was having difficulty breathing, he was pale, crying
    asking for help and saying"get me out” , I pushed him under the barrier and as
    I did two fans came fro’n the back rot hold of him and dragged him off
    towards the tunnel. I turned to go towards the front and went under the
    bar ier, I was still pulling peoole back. I was kicked two or three times
    on the legs, it was not by accident     one man spat in my face from just a
    couple of feet away, I thought (wh-°t's wrong with these people). Suddenly
    I lost my footing on the steps and     f 11 my helmet came off. I was terrified
    for a few seconds. I got to my feet     aster than Ive ever done before,
    someone Dulled my up as well I dor.t m o w who. I was confromted by a man
    screaming at me, I cant remember w-v.t but I got the gist, I remember one
    s-nt-nce "peoole are dying down ther -•, do something" he graboed me, my tie came
    off, my jacket was pulled open. I pucned passed him and pushed him towards the
    tunnel. I still couldnt see the fr^vt of the terraces,     people were still
    climbing the perimeter fence. I saw threeor four police officers pulling at tne
    fence from the pitch side, trying       pull the wire mesh from the frame.
    I looked down, there were two fans knelt, one was giving mouth to mouth and
    the other was doing heart massage or; what I think was a young lad, he looked
    very dead to me, ashen, I bent to h*: Ip, his lios were blue. I felt sick.
    I shouted at them to move him back,     give him air. people around me had started
    to move back a little there was an areatowards the tunnel starting to clear
    I again turned to the front,OH HELL, bodies under the wall ten,     fifteen, I
     oushed forwards, to my right, bodies almost to the toi> of the wall, ten
     feet back from the wall,   the ones on too were dead, ashen, blue lips,
     eyes ooen, all young, one at my feet wearing a red scarf , I grabbed him
     ■nulled, dragred,carried him out ut> th° tunnel to the rear of the stand,
     there was noise, shouting confusion everywhere. I put him down, he didnt
seem dead, I got on my knees and attested to give him mouth to mouth, I
dont know how long for, not long,    someone run inr passed kicked me on the right
side of my stomach, I was winded for a bit, I looked        up   , people all around
oeoole laid everywhere some dead many injured, I realised he was too far gone
I couldnt help him, thought ( sorry Dal your dead). I went back down the tunnel
and got to the terraces,   someone in the stand above spat at me >it landed on
my right shoulder,   someone threw a drink cup, I was splashed with what I
thin!: was cold tea. I helped to carry another to the back         up   the tunnel,
wemt back, another one then another both dead and injured. I thought ( this
is not happening its not real) I felt numb, brain not working at all, got to
the bottom of the tunnel again. A big guy in a black toD and with a moustache
similar to mine approached me, he was crying he put his arm round me and said
" Its not your fault kid" he had a real scouser accent. I felt exhausted
I went to the back of t.ie stand arnin, I looked back down the tunnel, the
playing area was a mass of people.    1 cant rememoer what happened then, I
wanted to go home run away, my leg were like jelly, I couldnt stop shaking
I went out of the ground to the fen: e next to the river and lit a cigarette
I cant remember what happened then,,     joined a line of police officers
outside the gate to the rear of the i.epoings Lane stand. The injured were being
put into ambulances, a dozen bodi«n      :,ere laid on the road next to the fence
and behind our line, how did they r-      there?      Some fans were in the toilets
in the Leppings Lane staild, their rr 3 were waiving out of th-          windows and
they wre making two fingered signs        -rected at us, the line of police
officers, they were shouting at us,,     couldnt tell what but I dont think it
was praise. Inspector Sykes asked          had dealt with a body, I was given a
Form GEN 13, I looked round, a lac’       th a red    scarf on was laid behind me,
he looked like the lad I had resnov- -. I cant remember what he looked like.
Dr Ashton examined him then wrote         the Gen 13 4.27pm and handed it back to
me. That coaldnt be the right time,       'here had   the last hour and twenty
 minutes gone, I checked my watch th-     time was     right. I was then transported
 to the gymnasium along with my b o d - ■ Twelve dead out on the road how many more,
 got to the gym , lines of bodies, r. ' many, mines No 75 and more to come from
 Leo^ings Lane. I looked round at my •riends and coleagues in the gym, They
 looked like I felt, sick. Nobody s r ,d a great deal that evening. Berhaps
 the worst time:- sat in the gym all night, waiting for a relative to identify
 your body, no one came for mine. No 75 believed to be D.G.GOD.IN, he had
 a rail card in his pocket. Official.'    unidentified. Got to go home at ? am

 Sunday morning.

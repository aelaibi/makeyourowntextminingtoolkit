Thank you for the copy of your note of 12 September to
Mr Addison, in the penultimate sentence of which you seek
Mr Mullarky's views on the practicality of early payment,by   a
couple of days, of the monthly grant advance to the South
Yorkshire Police Authority.

In his absence on annual leave, perhaps I can reply on
Mr Mullarky's behalf, by saying that Accounts Branch would be
able to do this. I must point out, however, that payment would
probably have to be by Payable Order (involving postal transit
and bank clearance time) rather than BACS (with almost
instantaneous credit to the recipients bank account).  It
might also be necessary to make provision at the Bank of
England for the early issue of funds.

Having said that Accounts Branch could, if so requested,
accommodate an early payment of this type, I must say that I
have considerable doubts in my mind as to the propriety and
wisdom of the action now under consideration which could leave
the Department open to criticism from either its own Internal
Auditors or N.A.O.

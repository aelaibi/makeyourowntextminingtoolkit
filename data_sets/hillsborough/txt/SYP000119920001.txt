a dmittance.)                 At 2 . 5 0 pm    <1450)    t h er e was a minor                 disturbance          in, this

pub but on o ff icers                   gaining       entry    it was all            over.

At 3 . 0 5 p m          (1505)      my serial     star te d to walk               to C l a y w h e e l s    for

    refreshment            but    ins tr uc ti on s    came over           the    radio for all             serials       to

parade L ep pi ng s Lane                 end of the ground.                  An    Inspector         took     charge and

we made our way to that                       end and     paraded           in serial          order.        The

Inspector               r ep o r t e d our    position    then      i nstructed my serial                    to go       into

the        ground a n d as si st             in any way we         could.          The    outer      gates        on

L ep p i n g s Lane were               open and on going            inside we saw that                     there were

about            12 bodies         laid on the floor outs id e and at the side                               of the

tunnel.              Police       o ff ic er s were giving m o u t h to m o u t h a n d a rt if i c i a l

r es pi ra ti on to some               of these,        others were              covered by        coats.          There

were            some o n l o ok er s    shouting and          s we ar in g at the P o l i c e              officers and

blaming             them for        this,     some were       the w orse          for drink        but o b v i ou sl y

were            in shock.         We tried to         pac'i fy these.             At this t i m e          other       bodies

were            being    carried from the tunnel                 an d      stood near          the entrance.              Some

bodies were                 carried to the entrance                so there          could be        remo ve d without

a m bu la nc es            coming    into     the ground.

■PC Robinson,                2 8 4 8 and PC     1130 B inns        then went           down the tunnel                 a nd on

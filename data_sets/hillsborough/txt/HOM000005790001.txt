CLASS XI, VOTE 3: HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER

As you know, provision of £900,000 has been included in the
Revised Estimate for this Vote to finance Lord
inquiry into the Hillsborough Stadium disaster. I fe*r           in .
the urgency to establish the Inquiry in April we ?ver3;°°^e^o^h®
foreseeable need to make a call on the Contingencies Fund for the
costs of the early work of the Inquiry. It is, however, now
estimated that expenditure of £100,000 will need to be incurred
in respect of the Inquiry before Parliament has approved th
Revised Estimate. I should therefore be grateful if you could
a g r e e to a repayable advance of £100,000 from the Contingencies

Fund to meet these costs.
You will be aware that the Home Secretary has asked Lord Justice
T a y l o r to proceed with the Inquiry with all possible speed;
indeed it is hoped that the initial findings will be made known
before the new football season begins in August.
Subject to your agreement to this request, I enclose for Y°™v
consideration a draft Parliamentary Question and answer informing
Parliament that the Fund is being used for this purpose.

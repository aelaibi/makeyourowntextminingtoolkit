        I, DR. WILFRED EASTWOOD, F.Eng., D.Eng., Ph.D., F.I.G.E.,
        F.I.Struct.E., of Whirlow Park Road, Sheffield Sll 9NN will say”
        as follows


        1.             I         submitted                              a          Statement                               to           the                 Inquiry                    into                  the
                       Hillsborough                                    Stadium                     disaster                         chaired                       by         Lord             Justice
                       Taylor. Subsequent to that Inquiry, Civil proceedings have
                       been              instituted                               which                  involve                      my          firm.                       I      make                this
                       statement supplemental to the Statement submitted to the
                       Inquiry in the                                       light of the                                    allegations made against my
                       firm             in both                        the            pleadings                          and           also the List of                                             Issues
                       served by the Chief Constable for South Yorkshire.


        2.             Retainer of Eastwood & Partners


                       I commented on my firm's retainer in paragraphs 8 - 13 of
                       my Inquiry Statement.                                                       I also gave evidence about my firm's
                       retainer to the Inquiry.                                                                    My firm was initially retained
                       by the Club in 1978 in connection with the designation of
                       the Stadium under the terms of the Safety of Sports Grounds
                       Act 1975.                                 My firm reported on the layout and structural
                       parts of the Stadium in 1979 in connection with the grant
                       of          the                    initial                     Safety                   Certificate                                  by           the            Licensing
                       Authority                            (South Yorkshire County Council at that time).
                       Thereafter                               my          firm                 has               advised                     the               Club              on         various
                       structural matters                                                from time to time.                                                     We do not have a

       general retainer for safety or crowd control.                        All matters
       relating to these were the responsibility of the Club in
       conjunction     with     other       bodies     such    as     the    Police     as
       appropriate.



  3.   The     Introduction__ af           Radial Fences           without      Separate
       Turnstiles


       In my    statement     to     the    Inquiry    I referred to my firm's
       rearrangement        scheme    at     theLeppings           Lane   end    in   1981
       (paragraph 81 - 84).           During the course of the Inquiry I
       discovered     for    the    first     time    that    there was       a meeting
       between the police and Mr. England, the Club secretary, on
       28 April 1981.         The discussions are recorded in a police
       memorandum     from      Chief        Superintendent          Herold      to    the
       Assistant Chief Constable (Operations).                       See page 136 of
       the Core bundle of the Inquiry (’’the Inquiry Bundle").                          In
       the    discussions,     the police        acquainted Mr.           England with
       their view that radial barriers should be provided to form
       pens    "to   enable    more        accurate    crowd       control".           The
       memorandum     says    that     Mr.     England       was    already      actively
       considering     that        possibility.          Mr.       England      was   also
       considering using           turnstiles 1-4 for one part of the
       terracing and 5-6           for another part, and controlling the
       crowd entering these turnstiles by the placing of safety
       barriers in the open area between the turnstiles and the
       back of the West stand.


       Mr. England did not inform my firm of the discussions with
       the police, but he requested us to look into the proposals
       for radial fences and the shepherding of spectators by


                                                                                        3.

       portable      barriers,       My      assistant,         Mr.     Strange        wrote     a
       memorandum for consideration within Eastwood & Partners
       (pagesl47-l48), and             produced        two     schemes       for   allocating
       turnstiles       to     different     parts       of    the    Leppings       Lane      end
       (pages    150      and    151).       These      two    schemes        developed       Mr.
       England's concept significantly.                      Two new walls in the area
       behind     the     turnstiles         would       create       three        routes      foi
       spectators       entering       the     West     stand     and       terrace.           Two
       radial fences would divide the terrace into three a r e as .
       Four new turnstiles would serve the south west terrace.
       Seven turnstiles would serve the large north west terrace.
       The remaining ten turnstiles would serve the seated part of
       the West stand plus the central part of the terrace via the
       tunnel.


       The   scheme,      if     adopted,      would     have     made      it possible         to
       control accurately the number of spectators in each of the
       three pens.              Only six turnstiles were allocated to the
       North Stand (to cater for four thousand spectators).                                 Hence
       there would be 21 turnstiles                    for the approximately 14500
       spectators using the seating and terracing at the Leppings
       Lane end, and these 21 turnstiles would have been divided
       into groups which approximately matched the capacities of
       the individual p e n s .


       At that time (1981) the Green Guide (1976) gave no guidance
       on the     likely capacity            of   turnstiles.                It merely said
       "Turnstiles should be of such numbers as to admit at a rate
       whereby       no       unduly      large          crowd        are     waiting          for
       admission...."             The proposal by Eastwood & Partners that
       an    extra     four      turnstiles           should     be   provided         was     not
       therefore        the     result    of      a    calculation,          but     simply      a
       solution which enabled a separate entry route to be created
       to the south west terrace.                     If this 1981 scheme had been
       carried out, and used in the way envisaged by my firm, the
       14,500 seated and standing spectators at the Leppings Lane

       end would have been served by 21 turnstiles which gives one
       turnstile for 690 spectators.                    Mr. Strange had a meeting
       with Mr. England, the Club Secretary at which Mr. Strange
       presented the sketch showing the embryonic scheme.                          My firm
       was    instructed to proceed with providing the two radiaL
       barriers shown on the sketch, but the                    Club decided not to
       proceed with any other part of the scheme.


       No further progress was made until 1985.                           At the time of
       my initial Statement I could not recollect how the matter
       then arose.          However,   having had a chance to look at the
       minute     of   the     "winter"     inspection of           the   Ground by      the
       Officer Working Party which took place on 23 January 1985
        (pages 184 and 185 of the              Inquiry Bundle)             my memory has
       been refreshed.          The Club was represented by the then Club
       Secretary,      Mr.     R.   Chester and Dr.           Eastwood.        There was a
       general discussion regarding the policy of the Police with
       regard to sharing of the West                   stand and Terrace betweea
       home    and     away    supporters.         I    took    the       opportunity     to
       suggest     again      the   possibility        of    channelling        spectators
       entering the various parts of the West stand and terrace.
       It will be seen from minute B(i) that it was agreed "the
       Club    would     consider      at   some       future    date      a    scheme   for
       permanent barriers at the rear of the Stand, subject to any
       proposals being submitted for prior approval by the Officer
       Working Party in the usual way".


        I note that when I received the minutes of the meeting I
        passed them to Mr.           Strange with           a manuscript note added
        saying "We need to discuss briefly so that work can be put
        in hand".       (See page 184 of Inquiry bundle).                       The events
       which occurred thereafter are covered in my evidence to the
        Inquiry      (see     paragraphs     85-107      of    my    statement      to   the
        Inquiry).

  4.   The Removal of Barrier 144


       I knew nothing about the request by Inspector Calvert of
       South Yorkshire police to remove Barrier 144 until after
       that a decision had been taken by the Officer Working Party
       on 7 August 1986.      That meeting was attended by      my
       Assistant, John Strange, and not me.                  I discovered during
       the Inquiry that the Club had been informed about this
       proposal in June 1986, but the information had not been
       passed on to my firm.            A day or so after 7 August 198 6,
       John    Strange      informed    me    of   the    Licensing     Authority's
       requirements.        I did not consider the Licensing Authority's
       decision to be unreasonable.


  5.   Width of the Perimeter Gates


       I commented on the perimeter gates in my Statement to the
       Inquiry      in    paragraphs 53-61.        As    I explained    in that
       Statement,        both the Police and the Fire Service (both of
       whom are represented on the Officer Working Party) have a
       particular interest in the gates                  in the perimeter fence.
       At    the   time     of   the   initial      application       for   a   Safety
       Certificate in 1979, the Fire Service took the lead role in
       dealing with ingress and egress from the Ground.                     I recall
       that they regarded the Leppings Lane end of the Ground as
       being well served by exits already and further emergency
       exit routes onto the pitch was not considered necessary.
       One    of the      main   purposes    of    the   perimeter gates was to
       enable      the    Police   to enter        the    pens   in   the   event of
       disorder.         When a further gate was suggested for pen 3 in
       1985, Superintendent Moseley indicated at a meeting I had
       with him at the ground on 13 June 1985, that it should be
EASTWOOD fr PARTNERS




       about the          same size as the           gates which already existed,
       because       if    it were too        wide,       it was       difficult       to   stop
       hooligans getting out when the Police opened the gate to
       get    into    the     terrace.             We    obviously       had     in mind       the
       provisions          of the     current           (1976)    Green       Guide      and    in
       particular paragraphs 7.9 and 18.3.


       Having    the       gates     onto    the    pitch       openable only          from the
       pitch    side,       entirely        under       Police   Control,        was    part    of
       making access to the pitch                    "as difficult as possible                  in
       normal circumstances".                  It also ensured that the police
       had "effective access to the terraces for the purpose of
       crowd control" because the gates were in accordance with
       what they had asked for.                These gates were not seen by the
       Fire Service as being part of an emergency exit route.


       The     1986        edition of        the         Green     Guide        introduced         a
       recommendation          that     the    perimeter          gates       should     have      a
       minimum width of 1.1 metres (see paragraph 215).                                I recall
       that    the        various    new     green       guide    recommendations           were
       referred to during the next walk round the ground by the
       Officer       Working        Party     which       was    held      in    1987.         The
       representatives of the City Building Surveyor's department
       and the       Fire Service had clearly studied the new guide.
       The width of gates in perimeter fences was discussed and it
       was reasonably concluded that the existing perimeter gates
       had in practice proved satisfactory for their purpose and
       did not require to be widened.                      The gates did provide the
       Police with some capacity to allow spectators to leave the
       terrace.           To the best of my knowledge the gates were                            in
       good    condition        on    15    April        1989    and    the     quick-release
       device enabled them to be opened quickly even under intense
       pressure.            It was, of course, a matter for the Judgement
       of the Police whether and when to open them.

  6.   The Testing of Crush Barriers and the Collapse of Barrier
       1£4£

       I explained my firm's method of testing the crush barriers
       and the tests which had been carried out during my firm's
       retainer   at paragraph 32 -          40 of my Statement to the
       Inquiry.     I would like to          make the following further
       comments :-


       I have always regarded it as standard practice when testing
       structures in which there is soil/structure interaction, or
       where the carrying capacity of the structure is determined
       by a plastic hinge mechanism, for 'bedding in' loads to be
       applied,     before    the   test    proper   begins.      Hence     the
       deflections in the first cycle of loading are ignored.


       The crush barriers have initial deflections associated with
       soil structure interaction.          The ashes beneath the barrier
       foundation    are     bio-degradable.         The   degrading   of   the
       organic matter results in a permanent settlement, or
       rotation in the case of a crush barrier, when a test load
       is first applied to a barrier which has not been tested for
       some time.      Indeed it may take two loading cycles before
       the ashes beneath the barrier base become packed down.


       The barrier rails where they are continuous over two or
       more spans behave plastically with successive formation of
       plastic hinges, one or more of which may quite safely occur
       even under working load.            Where the legs of the barriers
       also form a portal frame, they also will develop plastic
       hinges which give permanent deflection on first loading.
                                                                                                    8
EASTWOOD fr PARTNERS




        The    permanent          (non-recoverable) deflection occurs                        either
        due to soil compression on the initial loading                                  cycles, or
        occurs due to the partial development of plastic
        hinges.        I would expect            both these kinds of deformation in
        old crush barriers.                In other words I believe one may
        reasonably          regard       the   first      loading       as    a    'bedding        in'
        operation.            The    test      proper     does     not       begin       until     the
        'bedding in' has been completed.


        The    Building           Surveyor's         Department        of     Sheffield           City
        Council have closely monitored the testing of barriers at
        Hillsborough since 1979 on behalf of South Yorkshire County
        Council and later Sheffield City Council.                                  The Building
        Surveyors Department have a considerable role in checking
        and testing a large number of buildings as part of their
        duties as Building Control Officers for the fifth largest
        city    in     England       under     the     Building        Regulations,          and    in
        dealing with Dangerous Structures Notices.                                   They agreed
        with Eastwood & Partners method of testing.


        Schedule        2    of     the    Safety       Certificate          for     the     ground
        requires        at    clause      25     the    representatives            of     the     City
        Council       be     present      when    the     crush    barriers          are    tested.
        Each    year        when    my    firm    was     due    to    carry       out     testing,
        advance written notice was given to the City Council                                        of
        that testing.               After the testing was completed, the test
        results were submitted to the City Council as required by
        Clause 25.


        Various interpretations of the method of load testing in the
        Green        Guide    are    possible,         but   I    am    satisfied          that    our
        interpretation is a reasonable and professionally sound one.


        As     Mr.     Andrew       Collins       Q.C.,      Counsel         to    the     Inquiry,
        indicated,          my firm's method            of testing is used by other
        members of the engineering profession.
                                                                                          9.

                     I have noted the suggestion made on behalf of the
          Police that thre6 spans should be tested simultaneously,
          but I have not come across any firm which uses this method.



  7.      Adequacy of Turnstiles used on 15 April 1989


          The entry systems which were proposed for the Leppings Lane
          end   by    my    firm   in   1981     and   1985   would    have       provided
          additional turnstiles for each section.                 A comparison with
          the number which existed throughout the period 1979-89 is
          given in the following table :-

          I now know that on the day of the disaster, the twelve
          turnstiles at Penistone Road which were intended to serve
          the North stand were closed.                  Therefore,     an additional
          6,000 spectators, making a total of 24,000 spectators, had
          to use the 23 turnstiles at the Leppings Lane End.                           This
                                                                                           10.

       was a decision with which my firm was in no way involved
       and    about    which we     were    neither       consulted      nor        informed
       until    after    the    tragedy.            It    was    never       part    of    our
       retainer to advise the Club about the number of spectators
       who     could    be   admitted       through      the     turnstiles          at    any
       particular time, or what number of turnstiles they should
       provide.        However,    I had,     and     have,     no doubts       that the
       turnstiles which were available for use (not all of which
       were    in fact used)       were     not    such as to cause a risk to
       safety in terms of their mechanical efficiency.


  8.   Signs


       Advice on signposting of the ground was never a part of my
       firm's responsibilities.              At no time either in our initial
       reports      or thereafter        did we     offer      advice    orally       or    in
       writing nor were we ever asked for advice.                      This was one of
       the areas, like stewarding, closed circuit television, the
       automatic       counting    system     to    monitor      spectators         passing
       through the turnstiles,            and the general arrangements made
       with the police for match days, in which we played no part.
       At     the   Leppings      Lane    end,     the    routes       for     spectators
       entering the ground were changed from one match to another
       depending on which parts of the terrace and the West stand
       were reserved for visiting supporters and home supporters.
       The Club clearly recognised that we had no responsibility
       for signposting because they did not on any occasion inform
       us about the proposed division of the Leppings Lane end for
       the next game.


       At    various    times     between    1979     and      1989,    and    since       the
       disaster,       the Fire    Service have          requested that the Club
       should provide emergency exit signs, and we have then been
       asked by the Club to include the signs which had been
                                                                                      11
EASTWOOD fr PARTNERS




       requested       in    the    works    programme.        But   we   were   merely
       carrying out instructions and were not offering advice ox
       designing the system of signposting.


  9.    Exit Routes and Means of Escape


       Lord Justice Taylor's Interim Report       (paragraph 250)
       confirms that the emergency evacuation of the pens had been
       considered       by    the    Officer      Working     Party.       Eastwood        &
        Partners were not members of the Working Party and did not
       take part in its deliberations.                  The Police were of course
       members.


        Firstly, the route through the tunnel had effectively six
       unit widths so that it could discharge 6 x 60 = 360 persons
       per minute (para 234).       Thus, with their permissible
       capacity of 54 persons per 10 sq.m. the pens 3 and 4 could
       be evacuated in less than six minutes via the tunnel alone
       which is well within the eight minutes allowed by the Guide
        (para   56).         Even    if     we   were    to   take   a    conservative
        calculation based on five unit widths,                   pens 3 and 4 could
        still   be   evacuated       comfortably        within   the eight minutes
        allowed.



        Secondly, if the tunnel route were not available because of
        say a bomb being planted (fire risk is minimal) it was the
        view of the Fire Service who were the principal arbiters of
        evacuation procedure that the alternative route would be
        along the back of the terraces,                 through the gates in the
        radial fences and round the sides of the West stand.                        The
        fire brigade were           satisfied     that    this   alternative route
        would also enable the pens to be evacuated in less than six
       minutes without relying on the gates to the pitch.
                                                                          12.

         To summarise, the tunnel was a very adequate escape route
         by itself to serve the two pens 3 and 4.         If the tunnel was
         not usable, the exit gates through the radial fences were
         by themselves adequate.      The gates through the perimeter
         fence were not part of the designed means of escape,            but
         provided a bonus which was available at the discretion of
         the Police.


   10.   Certified Capacity of Terrace


         My firm prepared a thorough and detailed report to the Club
         dated 12 January 1979,     and also a report to the S.Y.C.C.
         (the licensing authority) dated 17 January 1979.


         The   recommendation   contained    on   sheet   9 of   the   report
         submitted to S.Y.C.C.     (page 56 of the Inquiry bundle) was
         the "following upgrading of the barriers and the carrying
         out of such other works as may be required "the capacity of
         the ground would be made up as follows"


         Seating approximately              24,000
         Standing on Spion Kop              16,000
         Standing at Leppings Lane
         end (total including
         N.W. corner)                       10,100


                                            50,100



         After several meetings and inspections at the ground, and
         meetings of the Officer Working Party in private (the Club
         and Eastwood & Partners were not invited to these private
         meetings) spread over almost six months the Licensing
                                                                                    13.

       Authority wrote to the Club on 8 June 1979 setting out "the
       detailed comments of all of the disciplines represented on
       the Working Party" (see page 91 of Inquiry bundle).                        The
        comments referred to were very detailed (pages 91-96 of
        Inquiry bundle) and dealt in turn with the requirements of
        the Licensing Authority for each part of the ground.    The
        Working Party and the S.Y.C.C. had clearly taken great care
        in deciding what safety measures were required.


        Following     the   six   pages    of     detailed     requirements,        the
        Licensing Authority gave its decision on the final page
        (sheet 97 of Inquiry bundle) as to the number of spectators
        they would then permit within the ground, as follows


        Spion Kop                         16,850
        South stand upper                  5,567
        South stand lower                  3,310
        West stand                         4,465
        West terrace                       7,200
        North west terrace                 2,900
        North stand                        9,882


        Total crowd
        capacity                          50,174



        It    will   be   noted   that    the    Working     Party   had   agreed       a
        slightly greater number of              spectators    in total than         had
        been    suggested    by   us.     They     had   reduced the       number    of
        seated spectators by 776, but had increased the number of
        standing spectators to be admitted to Spion Kop by 850.
        The number to be admitted to the Leppings Lane terraces was
        the    one   item   on    which    they     agreed     exactly     with     our
        assessment.
                                                                                    14.

        In assessing the          standing      capacity at the Leppings           Lane
        end, we had taken account of the fact that after the West
        stand had been constructed in                 1965,    the capacity of the
        Leppings Lane terraces,            including the North West corner,
        had been set at 11,600.                 We had advised a reduction of
        1500 in the capacity, and that safety would be improved by
        a major increase in the number of crush barriers, by the
        strengthening of existing barriers, and in other ways
        required by the licensing authority.


        It is recorded by the licensing authority (SYCC) that the
        Club and the Police had agreed the new capacity                        for the
        terrace containing pens 3 and 4 at 7,200                    (see page 92 of
        Inquiry bundle).            This    figure was then accepted by the
        Officer Working Party which included representatives of the
        Fire   Service     and    the    City     Council's     Building    Surveyors
        Department.


        It will be clear from the foregoing that the decisions
        regarding the capacities of all the various parts of the
        ground were clearly made by the Working Party, acting on
        behalf of the Licensing Authority.


        Paragraph    101     of    the     guide      is    concerned   with     "major
        sections" of the ground.                It uses the words "for example,
        each   end   or    si d e " .      It    is   not     appropriate   to    apply
        paragraph 101 to pens 3 and 4.                     Nevertheless, we had on
        two occasions,in 1981 and 1985, drawn up plans for self-
        contained exits and entrances for the various parts of the
        Leppings Lane terraces.            One of the three plans prepared in
        1985   was   submitted      to     the Licensing Authority.              A self
        contained set of turnstiles with automatic counting would
        have   served pens        3 and     4 if      any of    our plans   had been
        adopted.
                                                                                         15.

        I   should   draw    attention    to     the       fact    that     the    pre-1979
        capacity of 11,600 was based on drawings prepared by our
        predecessors,       Husband    & Co.     a     firm       of    high   repute    and
        considerable experience in this field.                     My firm considered
        it reasonable to use that plan as a basis in preparing its
        calculations.        The   same   plan       had    probably       been used      in
        earlier negotiations between the Club and the Police                              in
        1970.    Unfortunately, subsequent measurements on the Ground
        shows that the upper north-west corner was over-stated in
        size as explained in my letter to Sheffield City Council
        dated 4 January 1990.


  11.   Gradient of the Tunnel


        I considered this at length in my Statement to the Inquiry
        at paragraphs       62 - 80.       I do not wish to add anything
        further.


  12.   Height of Crush Barriers


        I now deal with one matter which has been raised by the
        Police in their List of Issues, but which has not (at the
        date of this        Statement)    been    included             in the pleadings,
        namely the height of the crush barriers.


        In 1978, shortly after being commissioned by the Club, my
        firm carried out a visual survey of the crush barriers, and
        made detailed measurements.     It was found that if the
        height of the barriers was measured from the nosing of the
        step above that in which the barrier was placed, many were
        lower than is recommended           in paragraph 110 of the Green
        Guide.       This applies to both the Spion Kop and the West
        terrace.      This     information       was       reported       orally    to   the
        Sheffield City Council Building Surveyor's Department who
                                                                                              16.

       were represented on the Officer Working Party. The exact
       date is not known but it was during one of the preliminary
       informal      inspections which were                 made prior to the              first
       formal visit of the Working Party to the ground which took
       place on 2 April          1979.        Minute B2 of that meeting which
       deals with the West terrace records that "the question of
       the    ........... height          of     some       of    the       existing      crush
       barriers.......... be the subject of detailed discussion
       between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor"                                 (see page
       71 of Inquiry bundle).


       The second formal visit of the Working Party to the ground
       took place on 18 April 1979.                        Arising on the minutes of
       the    first meeting       it    is recorded           in Paragraph             6 on the
       second page, referring to the Kop, that "It was AGREED that
       the question of the height of some of the crush barriers be
       considered again after it was seen which of these failed on
       testing".          (See page 74 of Inquiry bundle).


       On 8 June 1979, the Chief Executive of S.Y.C.C. wrote to
        the   Club      saying   that    the    detailed          comments        of    all   the
       disciplines represented on the Working Party had now been
        received.          Attached      to     the    letter         was   a    schedule      of
       matters       requiring    "attention          so    as to      secure reasonable
        safety     at    the   ground".              (Pages      90    to   97    of    Inquiry
        bundle).


        Detailed requirements for the West terrace are set out in
        section E of the schedule.                    No mention was made of the
        under-height barriers.                   I    recall      that members           of the
        Officer      Working     Party,        and     particularly             the    Building
        Surveyor's        representatives            who    had       taken      considerable
        interest in the barriers, had said that they considered it
                                                                        17.

       was reasonable to accept the existing barriers, during
        informal   discussions   prior   to   the   requirements   of   the
        Licensing Authority being made known formally in the letter
        of 8 June 1979.

Q36.    HAVE YOU ANY COMMENT TO MAKE ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF FANS IN THE

        STANDING AREA TO THE FRONT OF THE WEST STAND?

037.    DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS ON THE WAY THIS DISASTER WAS CONTROLLED

        FOLLOWING THE RECOGNITION OF THE INCIDENT HAPPENING?



 There did not appear   to be any co ordination or resources.

Individuals were doing what they could apparently without direction.

Only one Ambulance entered the ground and there were no Public

announcements which created tension because the fans did not know what

was happening.

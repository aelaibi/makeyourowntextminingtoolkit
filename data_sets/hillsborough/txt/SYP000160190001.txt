COMPLAINT 10/89

This complaint is made by a Liverpool Supporter who stated that he was involved in the
crush outside the turnstiles. He started to get chest pains, but remained calm and eventually
made it through the turnstile. Once inside the concourse area he spoke to the Police
Constable to complain about the situation outside the ground. The officer allegedly told him
to go away or they would be locked up.

He was unable to identify the uniformed officer involved.

Enquiries by West Midlands Police traced two males who had accompanied the complainant
to the ground. Both saw their friend approach an officer but could not describe the officer
and did not hear what was said.

OUTCOME

Extensive enquiries by West Midland Police including examination of CCTV and statements
from both supports and police officers failed to identify the officer involved. The CCTV
footage only provided fleeting views of the location and provided no evidential value in
locating either the complainant or the alleged incident.

The Taylor enquiry established that there were 1122 officers deployed for the match.

there        were       no    stewards           outside/the                   ground.

There        was    a    lad       sitting           on y w a l l            at     the       corner       of      the      turnstile             roof

3 . 0 2 pm    1502,          the       game     had    started               by then.               I s aw      people           start      to

climb        up the          fence       in the        front            terraces              and    o v er     o n to      the    pitch.

Police        Officers             were       trying        to get            them        off       the    pitch,           I then        saw a

Police        Officer             run    up     to    the     r e f e re e ,         the       game       was      then      stopped.

I had a        clear          view       of     the    pens         behind           the       goal       posts,         the w o r s t        area

the    fence        and       climbing           o v er     onto             the    pitch.

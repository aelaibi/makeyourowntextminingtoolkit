           I am a single person residing at the above address.

           On the afternoon of Saturday 15 April                1989 (150489),   I atten de d the FA

           Cup Semi Final football match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest

           at the Hi 1lsborough ground in Sheffield,

           I attended as a Liverpool             supporter and have supported them all my

           life.      I am a season ti cket vfiolder and regularly attend home matches

           at Anfield.

           I obtained my match t i c k           by using a voucher from my season ticket,

           The match ticket was for the Leppings/Lane terracing and cost me six

           pounds.

We travelled to Sheffield in my fathers private vehicle.             We travelled

to Sheffield via Manchester and the M67 m ot or wa y .       We were he 1d/up at

the end of the M67      appyoachi ng the traffic island where the M4s7 and

the M56 meet.     We were delayed there for between thirty andyforty five

minutes due to the volume of traffic.         We travelled direcvly to

Sheffield without making any stops.

We arrived in Sheffield and parked our car in a side street off the

main road,    the A61   I think.    The street was near    to a hospital about a

mile away from the      ground.    We parked the car at   about ten to two

(1350).

We walked along the main road towards the ground and each bought some

chips at a shop not far away from where we parked.            There were traffic

policemen directing vehicles as we were walking along the main road

and at the junction of the A61 and Leppings Lane there were a large

number of Police and Police transits.         They were near to the shops,

presumably to deter any trouble.        We did not receive any Police

directions or any escoryKs, but we all knew the way to the ground

anyway as we had atteqroed the corresponding semi final a t

Hillsborough in 1982

There were a number of other supporters also making their way towards

the ground.     I saw supporters standing outside pubs drinking and the

odd supporter with a can or two of beer in the street.             I did not see

any fighting or any sort of disorder        X did not/see any drunkeness.

We arrived at the Leppings Lane area at about/twenty past two (1420).

Myself           and          had earlier   left rriyj fa t h e r on the way to the

ground.   This was because he hap a ticket for the stand seats.              It was

very crowded in the turnstile area when we arrived.            The crowd at the

turnstiles stretched back t o W r d s    the outer perimeter gates,      but not
                                                                                               PAGE       3
                                                                                               S3511
       %
                quite as far as the actual gates.            It was an unorganised crowd a nd

                there were no queues.

                There were five or six Policemen standing by the perimeter gates who

                were shouting to the crowd to get back,            but it was a waste of time,

                that crowd weren't going to move back.             We joined the rear of the

                crowd on the right hand side as you look at the ground.                  We aimed to

                get to the second turnstile        in from the right.           There was one mounted

ft      , Policeman by the perimeter gates who I heard shouting " C a / *t you qet
rS.Svn^-^ ’                                                        ~t
          some more out here."  I presume he was using his radio inn an effort to

,               get more officers to help at the turnstiles.               The mounted Policeman
    a-~
                is a Sergeant from Merseyside.           I knew his face f rom >Aat ches at

                Anfield.    It was a constant push and shove as we moved nearer the

                turnstiles.    It was very packed in the crowd,            but I had been in worse.

                As we got nearer the turnstile                  was in front of me and                m

                front of               This was to protect               w h o ’s only fifteen and

                slightly built.    After about fifteen minutes we got to the second

                turnstile   in from the right and we all entered the ground at the same

                time.    I handed my ticket in to the turnstile operator and was given

                the stub portion back.        I. do not recall seeing any stewards outside

                the ground.    While    I was outside the t u r ^ t i l e s ,    I remember seeing two

                   three youths    climbing on top of the/blue gates to my left              (Gate B)
ojc,cj£&>   •
                I d o n ’t know if they actually got intfo the ground though.

                Once    inside the ground we bought a match programme and used the toilet

                to the left of the central tunnel.            At that time the central tunnel

                was clear and we decided to use the tunnel,             thinking that we would be

                able to spread out towards the sides along the back of the terraces.

                We wanted to watch the match from the open bank/on t h e 'corner of the

                West Stand and the North Stand.           There were no/signs directing us

                towards that corner so we assumed that we coujwd get there by walking

                along the back of the terraces.           At the same match in 1988, we had

                 Jbeen in the opposite corner, between the West Stand ^ South Stand
         'V^-o
                 but it was much too packed in there and we didn't want to go in that

                 corner again.

                 We used the        central tunnel and had a free passage         towards the

                 terraces,    I     did not see any stewards or Policemen         either at the

                 entrance to        the tunnel or anywhere      inside it.

                 Once inside        the ground,    I did not see any fighting or disorder,

                 neither did I see any people drinking or any drunkeness.                 It was quiet

                 inside the ground th ou g h, most people were sti/1 outside trying to get

                 in .

                 At the end of the tunnel we went to the leftf hand side, expecting to

                 be able to walk across to that open bank next to the North Stand.   We
        Hr
                 went    into what    I now know to be pen number four/ at about quarter A o

   &             three    (1445).     At that time it was fairly crowded but t h e c r o w c ^ w a s

                 static and you could move through the crowd without too much

                 difficulty.        We worked our way through the crowd and reached the

                 dividing fence between pen four and pen five.                 By this time we were

                 about a third of the way down from the rear of the pen.                 Having got

                 there we realised that the fence went all the way to the wall and that

                 we couldn't get across to the corner.                We decided to stay where we

                 were and took up a position about six to ten people in from the

                 dividing fence and in between two crush barriers in case there was any

                 pushing.     I have marked this position on the separate grid plan using

                 the figure one.        We took up this position at shortly after quarter to

                 three    (1445),    it only took about a minute between entering the pen and

                 taking up position one.             At that time there was still sufficient room

                 to be able to look at the match programme.

                 At about ten to three            (1450)   I started to feel    pushing and shoving.

                 This    is normal    for a Liverpool        crowd,   its normally caused by the late

                 arrivals from the pubs looking to take up their usual                positions.     I
                                                                         PAGE

remember seeing the players taking the field and having a kick about.

While they were doing this,       it was still the normal football     crowd

pushing and shoving.        At about two minutes to three    ( 1i/58) as the

players were preparing to line up.       I suddenly felt neally squeezed in

I found it very difficult to draw breath as my rib's were being

crushed.     I remember saying to          and          to try and keep their

arms in the air.     I had my arms slightly above my body,       but was unable

to control them.     At about the time that the game kicked; o f f , the

pressure seemed to give and suddenly the crowd around m e seemed to

swirl around.     I was    carried backwards and to my left, being turned

round by the swirling movement.        I ended up in the rear corner of pen

four,    next to pen five,    looking across towards the North Stand.          The

game was now in motion but I could not see anything off the pitch.                   1

have marked this second position using the figure two.           I could not

see          or           after that movement,   I don't know where they ended

up.     While in the second position I managed to turn myself around and

face towards the pitch again.        The game was still being played.          A

short time later,    I felt myself being jostled forwards again,        nearer

to a crush barrier.        As I got towards the barrier,    I put one arm out

to try and keep myself off the crush barrier.         By now a number of

people were climbing over the dividing fence and dropping           into pen

five.     Some were standing on the crush barrier and climbing up.             By

this time,    there were a number of people climbing over the front

perimeter fence as well and escaping onto the pitch.           The game was

still being played.        There was slightly more room in the pen now due

to the amount of people who had got out.          I could see there was more

space at the front of the pen,       but also a number of people lying

injured.     I assisted people to climb over the fence into pen five.

While I was still    in the second position I became aware of a person

who was being pushed up towards the top of the perimeter fence,            by
                                                                             PAGE       6
                                                                             S3511

people on the inside of the pen.          There were people leaning from the

outside,    over the top of the fence,         trying to pull him up.   The person

was being pushed up just a few feet away from the dividing fence

between pen four and pen five,         virtually on a straight    line from where

I was standing.      The person was then left temporarily lying on the top

of the perimeter fence, and appeared to be lifeless.             The time by now

was about five or six minutes         past three,    the game was still being

played.     Shortly after,   I saw the person start sliding slowly back

down the fence and drop back inside the pen.             I think whoever was

trying to assist on the outside of the pen must have lost their grip.

The person then disappeared from my view and I did not see him again.

The person that I saw slumped on top of the perimeter fence and

apparently lifeless was a white male and about five feet ten inches in

height.     I would estimate his age to be late twenties.          He had sandy

coloured hiar, which was thick and bushy.             The hair was towards

shoulder length.      I ’m pretty certain that he was       clean shaven.     He did

not wear glasses.      The man wore a light coloured T shirt, white I

believe, with round neck and short sleeves.             I think it may have had a

motif on the front.       I can't say what the motif was,       but the T shirt

was very dirty on the front.          I noticed this because the person was

lying on his back on the perimeter fence.             He wore light blue denim

jeans which were the stonewash type.             He wore canvas type training

shoes,    I c a n ’t remember what   colour.

I eventually got out of pen four some fifteen minutes            later via the

gate in the front perimeter fence.             Just before leaving the pen,     I had

seen my brother            on the track outside the pen and we were

reunited on the track.                said that           A>as safe and well.    I

was still    in a state of shock on the pitch.                and I then spent

ten to fifteen minutes       looking up at the stand to see if we could see

our father.     After we spotted him we spent some minutes trying to
                                                                            PAGE     7

attract his attention.        We eventually did and we met up by the exit

gate in Leppings Lane     an4 left the ground. We left the         ground at

about twenty to four    <1540).

Throughout the course of the afternoon I did not witness anything that

I would consider to be a criminal offence.

As a result of my experiences at Hillsborough I sustainedycruising and

soreness tp my rib cage.        The injury became prominent on/the morning

of Monday' 17 April   1989.     I also sustained general     sorafness to my legs

I did not see a crush     barrier break whilst atHillsborough.          I   only

became aware that a barrier had broken from reports           in newspapers.

I feel that the match m4s badly organised,          beg i nni ng outside the

ground, with insufficient Police to control the cro wd .          Once the

extent of the disaster became apparent,         the Police didn't    really seem

to know what to do/     There were a number of Police vans and iof f i cers

near to the turnstiles,       but they w e r e n ’t called to help eatse the

pressure.   There seemed to be an overall        lack of co-ordffiation inside

the ground with some Policemen standing on the pitch with their backs

to the Leppings Lane end and others with jackets off and getting stuck

in.

Just to clarify how I got out from pen four,          I actually went through

the hole in the bottom left hand corner where tjne wire mesh had been

ripped away,   not the gate as previously stat'sya.

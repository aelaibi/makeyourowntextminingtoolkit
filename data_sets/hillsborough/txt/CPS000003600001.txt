           HILLSBOROUGH - INTERIM REPORT II

           I have pleasure in enclosing an interim report we have prepared which
           you may find of interest. It is forwarded to you on a strictly private
           and confidential basis.

           The report, which is a revised copy of one prepared for Lord Justice
           Taylor in June, represents our best understanding at this time, of what
           occurred at Hillsborough. Consequently it should not be viewed as the
           definitive statement on the incident, but rather as a guide. It will be
           noted that at present we have been able to position eighty eight of the
           ninety five deceased mainly by video and photographic evidence, but also
           by plan and statement evidence.

           We are still continuing to process the evidence already obtained into
           the HOLMES computer. This is likely to continue into early December.
           Shortly after that we should be able to draw more definite conclusions
           and subject to advice and direction you give, be ready to identify those
           to be interviewed and the questions to be addressed.

          In forwarding the report may I once again invite you to visit our
          Incident Room at Nechells in Birmingham at any time and see at first
          hand the work being undertaken by our staff. I am sure you will find it
          most useful.

           In the meantime if there is anything with which you think I can help
           please do not hesitate to contact me.

           I have copied this letter and the accompanying report to the Police
           Complaints Authority.

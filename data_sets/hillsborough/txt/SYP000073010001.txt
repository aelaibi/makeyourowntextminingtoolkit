            I live at the above address with my wife.

            On Saturday d S A p r i 1,    (150489),      I attended the football match between

            Liverpool and Notts Forest,            at Hillsborough Football Ground,

            Sheffield.          I personally am    a Livei*^ool supporter and season ticket

            ho 1d e r .

            I left Skelmersdale just after            1000 am on that morning after being let

            down by people who were travelling to Sheffield in a Mini Bus.                           I

            managed to gain a lift in a            car which left my local          pub car park.         I

            d o n ’t know the names of the         people I travelled to Sheffield with

            On route to Sheffield we didn't stop anywhere but we were subjected to

            slow moving traffic but no undue delays.

           We arrived in Sheffield at about              12.30 pm (0030)      parking on the car

            park of the^jytfirse and Jockey Public House,            Mi <kt! p\frtmd Rd, S h e f f i e l d .
                                                                                     PAGE
                                                                                     SI 727

    I then went into the pub with                   and had a beer.    I had

    one pint and three small         cans of lager.        I did see others drinking a

    few of which were a little drunk,               but the vast majority were just

    having a normal drink.

    I left the pub at about 2.20 pm (1420) and walked towards the ground

    which was ab^rtjt half a mile away.

    I had a tncket to enter the Leppings Ln standing area.                  I had

    purchased this from Anfield Liverpool and paid £6 for it.                  I wish to

    retain my ticket stub.  I walked to the ground with a friend named
    n iCj ~i i
a                I had met him in the pub.  Whilst walking to the ground I

    d i d n ’t n o t i c e any policemen,   or stewards and I w a s n ’t given any

    directions.      We just followed the other fans walking that way.

    I arrived in Leppings Ln,          from the south side.       Upon our arrival which

    was at about 2jX(3 pm (1440),           there was no/<fueiies.    Just a mass of

    peoffie trying to get in, which were out to the edge of the roadway.

    I made my way towards the entrances by being               pushed there by the

    crowd.     I was not directed a policeman or a steward.               In fact I only

    remember seeip^/^ne Policeman on a horse,               who was backing his horse

    ■'i-cito fans and shouting.      I don't know what he was shouting.             I did not

    see any'''S.,Rewards outside the ground at this time.              I was eventually

    pushed towards Irke turnstiles and at one point I and                              fell

    to the ground.       We werehxthen picked up and pushed on towards them.

    Upon reaching the turnsti!              I was    crashed against a wall    to such an

    extent,   that I thought       I was going to pass out.          In fact a man next to

    rne shouted,    "Give this man some room,           h e ’s going to pass out."

    All   I know is that he is a big man about 30+ with glasses.                 I was then

    pushed into a turnstile by the crowd.

    Inside the turnstile        I was bent over the bars.          I had my ticket

    clenched in my fist and threw it at the man in the turnstiles who

    returned the stub to me and let me through.                Immediately behind me was
                                                                                PAGE      3
                                                                                S1727

my friend                 , who was also trying to come through the

turnstiles,      but the man working them w o u l d n ’t let him through.        I know

         had got a ticket.     I shouted at the man to let him in,         but he

just said I c a n ’t.     I in fact was shouting at him through the gate to

let him in because of the crush outside.             In fact         had to climb

over the top of the turnstile to get in.             I did not see anyone else

get in through that turnstile and I ’m sure it stopped working after I

had got    in.    I did remark this to

  on getting through the turnstile,         I and            started to walk

toward#'^ he tunnel ,^^ h i c h was the only entrance to the terrace that I

saw.     i "nratie Tfiyway just a few feet inside the tunnel.         It seemed a

normal    crowd to me and I was walking.        Suddenly I was hit from behind

by a mass of people and carried forward in like a wave to the

terraces.        I was unable to control the movement of my feet or return

up the tunnel or go left or right.

I was then forced out into the terracing ending up in Pen 3 a t about

3F within the diagram.        I was bought to a halt against a barrier.

         was forced further down the terracing.            The barriers   I was up

against was across my hips and stomach it was              low.   I was being

^ n s t a n t ^ y^TruThed^against the barrier and I was trying to force my

way to the right but in fact I was forced to the left by the crowd.

The    crushing got harder and harder.        I was now having to fight for my

life and screaming for help.         I was also begging people to push me off

the barrier who were in front of me.           At one point I asked the man in

front of me for help and he said,         “I c a n ’t,   I think your gone."

I then thought      I was going to die.

I then looked towards the ground,         the front fence was at my eye level.

I could see people       climbing over the fences and policemen pushing them

back into the crowd.        The people were screaming at them to let them
                                                                              PAGE      4
                                                                              S 1727

I don't    remember the match being stopped.           I ’ve no idea how long I was

being   crushed on the terraces,         everything has gone into a haze in m y

meixurry at this point.

fhe next thing I remember        I was    limping back along the tunnel out of

the ground to behind the stand and I saw people lying on the floor and

people giving first aid to them.              I stood by the wall for a while

until   I saw a man who       appeared to me to die.      I saw mucus come out of

his mouth.       I did not    know who he was.     A Policeman   then came up to me

and asked me if I was         injured, I just looked     at him and said nothing.

He said no y o u ’re not      and then he grabbed my arm and pulled me out and

p u s h e d me out.    I then left the ground and slowly made my way back to

the Horse and Jockey Pub.          At the pub,     there was a nurse or a least I

was told she was,        but she was treating      people for shock.      In fact she

gave me some sugar.          I then made my way to the van where               was and

they bought me home.

At no time either on my way to the ground or upon my arrival

inside the ground did I witness anyone             causing a disturbance

or fighting.          I did not see anyone drinking either on the way to

the ground or inside the ground.              I also did not see at any

time anyone      commit a criminal offence.         I also did not see any

police or stewards when I went           into the ground and I c a n ’t

remember seeing any at the entrance to the tunnel.

I/believe thaV'the) Pol i ce after the match was stopped w e r e very

lax in realising the gravity of the situation and helping to

relieve    it.    They seemed not know what to do or c a r e .      I could

not understand why some policemen were pushing fans back off

the top of the front fence         into the crowd when policemen next

to them knew what was happening           .    I also saw that the fire

brigade arrived at Leppings Ln end before the ambulance service

which seemed wrong to me.

        I think at the outset there was a lack of organisation or

        consideration for the fans on their arrival and in putting such a

        large following as Liverpool     fans   in the smaller end of the ground.

        Also   I wish to express that at Anfield the match organisation is

        second to none and Liverpool     fans are not accustomed to such a lack

        of organisation.     I also think that the lack of sensitivity after the

        incident   could have provoked another serious     incident because feelings

        were   running so high.   I also thought that the Sheffield people were

        marvellous    in the consideration of us after the match.     I feel    they

        would not have been like this if we had be e p harllv behaved J^efore the

        mat ch.

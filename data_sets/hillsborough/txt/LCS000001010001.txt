Dear
       I write following our telephone conversation earlier today.

     Apart from having to organize some regional training for
social workers about their roles in major incidents or disasters,
I also have to produce an ethnographic essay for the course I am
currently undergoing at Liverpool University. One possible
subject area for this essay is social work with people affected
by traumatic stress. I would like to be able to talk individually
to staff who have done your kind of work about what they have
been doing, and to ask them in particular about how the job
differs from more conventional fields of social work.

     I appreciate, of course, that under your present
circumstances meeting this kind of request may be the last thing
you and your colleagues feel like doing. On the other hand I
thought it possible you might take the view that talking about
the jobs you have been doing would serve a useful purpose in the
process of adjusting to the new situation. I think it would
probably take about twenty minutes for me to talk with each
person and the end product would, of course, be made available to
the participants.
     I would be much obliged if you were able to put this request
to your colleagues.

       Thanks for your time,

       Yours sincerely,




P.S. Please find enclosed some signatures for the petition.

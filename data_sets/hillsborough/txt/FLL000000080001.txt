 Dear David,


       At our Executive Committee meeting on Tuesday, 18th April
 it was agreed that the proceeds of the Cup Final, assuming it
 takes place this year, will be given entirely to supporting the
 Disaster Fund.


       This means, of course, that the competing Clubs will not
 receive their 32.5% share of the gate, neither will the 10%
 payable to the Pool be available.


       While this decision is final, it would be wrong of me if
 did not inform you on an official basis so that your Management
 Committee are aware of the action being taken.




                                                                                        Yours sincerely




                                                                                        Chief EjfretTutive

The FA Cup Semi-Final between Nottingham Forest and Liverpool took place

at the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club ground on Saturday 15 April.

In order to ensure orderly access the gates were opened at 12.00 noon.

The match was due to commence_a$-2.00’p m ’
                                          .""



At 2.30 pm most of the Nottingham    Tsne were in the ground but many of

the Liverpool fans were still arriving and it was clear to the police

officers in charge that there was ample capacity still to be filled in

the Liverpool sections of the enclosure.



At about 2.1)5 pm there was a large crowd uf Liverpool supporters at the

turnstiles in Leppings Lane behind the West Stand.        Thf’re are only seven

Lurns tiles and there, was difficulty in coping with the pressure.      Tolice

vehicles with loudhailers were used to urge the crowd to be patient.



At about   z . 5 0 pm more Liverpool supporters arrived until there were

about 3,000 to i),000 in this same tirea.   Gome speciaiors started to

nil mb the walls and turncti-lcc      those it the1                'ttbVd Were

under considerable pressure from those behind.        The police resources -

mounted and foot officers - were unable to relieve this pressure.        -----



The senior officer present considered    th ere was the possible danger to

life in respect of spectators at the front of the crowd and arranged for

an exit gate near the turnstiles to be opened to let a section of the

rrnwri through and raliovo the dangerous pressure referred lo.



Shortly afterwards there was a surge in two pens on the Leppings Lane

terrace which crushed fans at the front against the safety barrier and

this accounted for practically all of the fatalities and injuries.         The
latest confirmed figure is^.^Jdead with at laast 70. injured persons

still detained in hospital in a serious condition.

                         V■


The connection between the opening of the gate and the surge on the

terrac^has not been established but the time scale is such as to make

the connection possible^^

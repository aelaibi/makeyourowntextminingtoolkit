COMPLAINT MAINS? ASSISTAMT CHIEF CONSTABLE WALTER JACKSOM

I acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 30 March 1090 and I write to accept
the appointment m Investigating Officer in respect of the complaints made
against police officers arising, out of the Hillsborough disaster*

I take particular note of the complaint made by Mr Trevor Hicks in which he
alleges that Mr Walter Jackson, Assistant Chief Constable in the South Yorkshire
Police, along with Chief Superintendent Duckenfield of that force colluded
to present a false statement*

I also note that the complaints are being supervised by the Police Complaints
Authority to which I shall submit my report with appropriate copies to the
South Yorkshire Police Authority.

It seems eminently sensible for me to use the existing inquiry team in West
Midlands and 1 agree to that*     Of course, any unresolved questions of police
expenditure must be a matter for resolution between the Police Authorities
in South Yorkshire and West Midlands.


Yours sincerely




Chief Constable

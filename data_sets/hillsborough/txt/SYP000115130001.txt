              INCIDENT AT HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL GROUND

                SHEFFIELD ON SATURDAY 15 APRIL 1 9 8 9 .

POLICE CONSTABLE 2298

MEXBOROUGH SUB-DIVISION     -    BENTLEY SECTION



At 8.00 am on Saturday 15 April 1989» I commenced duty at Bentley

Section for football duties at the Hillsborough Football Ground.

I was instructed that I would be performing duties with other officers

in Serial No. 32 under the Supervision of Police Sergeant 1295 Potts,

however Sergeant Potts was                         and serial 32 was supervised

by P.C. 2895 Thomas.

Having been briefed at the Hillsborough Stadium, P.C. 2103 Frost and

myself were deployed the Niagara Road junction with Pennistone Road

preventing uneccesary parking of vehicles and supported vehicles from

entering the Niagara Sports area.       We were still in this position when

shortly after 3.00 pm a call for assistance was overheard on a personal

radio being carried by a local member of the Special Constabulary.        At

that time P.C. Frost and myself went immediately with other officers $ 0

the Leppings Lane end of the footbi.ll ground.      On arrival at the ground

entrance I could see two ambulances inside the gates, towards the rear of the

stand.   There were appx. 6 people lying on the ground in close proximity

to these vehicles, k of these people appeared to be in a state of unconcious-

ness but all of them were being attended to by at least two other persons.

(Ambulance and police personnel).       At this time there were numerous police

officers in the vicinity.       Whilst we were, which was only a matter of secongd

we were instructed by a uniform Inspector to form a cordon at the front

of the gates at the Leppings Lane end to prevent other supporters from

entering the ground and to leave access for emergency vehicles.

Whilst we were standing in this position, P.C. Frost and myself were

approached by a young boy, appx. 8 years old, who was in tears.                                                          He

told me he was frightened and asked if we could take him home.                                                          I

ascertained that his home was somewhere on the estate beyond the

Worsley Bridge Railway Station.

At this time supporters were beginning to come away from the ground,

with the young boy, PC Frost and myself walked back along Leppings

Lane where we were met by three other                                                          young boys (appx. 12 years) who

were friends of the 8 year old and                                                          at that    time they escorted himback

to his home.               With P.C. Frost I resumed duty on our static point at the

Niagara Road end, supervising the supporters coming away from the ground.

We remained in this position until                                                          we were    stooddown (appx. 5»50pm) and

told to return to Claywheels Lane.

At 7.00 pm we were stood down from the detail and returned to our own

Division.

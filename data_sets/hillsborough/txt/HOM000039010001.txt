     EVIDENCE OF MR. R. I. McROBBIE




                       1
 1                                                Tuesday.    11 November 1997
 2   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         I do not know whether you have had
 3          a chance recently to read through the evidence that you
 4         gave at the Taylor Inquiry, have you?
 5   MR.   Me ROBB I E :   Yes.
 6   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        And the statement that you made?
 7   MR.   McROBBIE:       Yes.
 8   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        What I am interested in
 9         particularly at the moment is the question of the cameras
10         and the videos that were taking place in the control box.
11         As I understand it, you went to the police control box
12         some time shortly after 2 o'clock.           Is that right?
13   MR.   McROBBIE:       Yes.
14   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        You will say "Yes", won't you?
15   MR.   McROBBIE:       Yes, of course.
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        And you stayed there until just
17         about 3 o'clock?
18   MR.   McROBBIE:       That is correct, sir.
19   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Where were you standing?         I have
20         got some photographs of the police box which might help
21         you.     Were you standing or were you sitting?
22   MR.   McROBBIE:       I was standing, sir.      Yes, that is as you are
23         looking out on to the pitch.           I was standing there part of
24         the time and then out of the way just round the back of
25         the camera operators h e r e .
26   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        What you are indicating is that
27         part of the time you were in front of this bench.
28   MR.   McROBBIE:       I was to the side of it.
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         To the side,    I see.
30   MR.   McROBBIE:       The operators were there.         I was at this end of
31          it out of the way.
32   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         On the right hand side.
33   MR.    McROBBIE:      I was not actually working.
34   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         We are looking at photograph number
35          48.    Then you came back behind this bench here?




                                             2
 1   MR.   McROBBIE:     Yes, there is like a little step raised area,
 2         because that is raised above the front section and I just
 3         stepped again to the right hand side of that raised area.
 4   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        In your evidence to the Taylor
 5         Inquiry (I am referring to day 20, page 16)       - you did not
 6         give evidence at the Inquest, did you?
 7   MR.   McROBBIE:     Not to the Inquest, no.
 8   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        You are talking about the position
 9         prior to Mr. Marshall's request, about the time of the
10         request to open gate C you remember. You say:         "It was at
11         that stage that I was looking on the monitor because you
12         can't see the area direct from where I was positioned.            I
13         alerted the control room staff saying that the gates had
14         been forced."     You are talking about the first time the
15         gate had been opened?
16   MR.    McROBBIE:      Yes.
17   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Just show me which monitor you were
18         looking at?
19   MR.    McROBBIE: I am afraid I can't.         It was the first time I
20         had been in this control box. I am aware all the monitors
21         were working.     Whichever monitor it was, I saw the
22         concertina gates - or       I believe that is what they are
23         now - open. I had      no   reason to believe there was any
24         reason for those to be opened other than their being
25         forced at that time.
26   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        It may not be very important, but I
27         don't know whether you realise that these 1, 2, 3 , 4 ,       5
28         are what is being photographed by the particular cameras.
29   MR.   McROBBIE:     I wasn't aware of that at the time, sir, no.
30   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        So you would have five different
31         things being shown on there on those five things?
32   MR.    McROBBIE:      Yes.
33   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        And then these two screens here on
34         the right hand side, one above the other and one below the
35         other, were recording what is being seen on two of the
36         other screens.     Do you follow?
37   MR.    McROBBIE:     I do.


                                           3
 1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        And you therefore could see what
 2         was happening out of Leppings Lane either by looking at
 3         screen 1 here which is the number 1 camera which was
 4         covering that area, or you could have seen it on one of
 5         these two monitors on the right hand side.            You cannot
 6         recall now which it was?
 7   MR.   McROBBIE:     I am afraid I cannot,     sir.    All I can see is
 8         watching the activity happening but on which screen I
 9         could not honestly say.
10   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        At page 20 you are asked about your
11         statement and a reference,       and I think we can go to the
12         statement about t h i s .   This is an incident when the
13         Assistant Chief Constable was there, Mr. Jackson, and he
14         or somebody noticed what he thought was bad behaviour just
15         in front of the police box.        Do you remember that?
16   MR.   McROBBIE:     The truth is I remember the incident having
17         refreshed my memory by reading the statement.            If you are
18         referring to the person dropping their trousers,           just
19         under the police box there was really quite a bit of room
20         and these people were dancing around.            I remember that
21         now. I had forgotten it until I refreshed my memory from
22         my statement.
23   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        We will look at the video of this
24         because we have got this on video.         Again,    I am wondering
25         whether you can help me at all as to whether you were
26         seeing that on what I might call the recorded videos,
27         these two on the right, or whether you were seeing it on
28         the screen.     It would have been screen 5?
29   MR.   McROBBIE:     I am sorry, sir,     I cannot remember.     I remember
30         the incident.     I had forgotten about the incident because
31         it was so minor in the enormity of everything, but when I
32         refreshed my memory prior to seeing you,           I remember
33         reading it and yes that did happen.            How I observed it, I
34         cannot remember.     I am sorry.
35   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        You could presumably also see out
36         of the window, could you?
37   MR.   McROBBIE:     Yes, sir.


                                          4
 1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Were you able to observe that
 2         particular incident out of the window?
 3   MR.   McROBBIE:   I can't remember,      sir,   I am sorry.
 4   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       It is not altogether clear - may be
 5         when you look at the video you may be able to help - which
 6         pen those people were in.      I think it is probably pen 2.
 7   MR.   McROBBIE:   Whichever pen it is, it was immediately            under
 8         the control box.      It is one of these two       areas.
 9   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       The trouble is that there are two
10         pens immediately under?
11   MR.   McROBBIE:   Yes,   I realise that now.
12   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       If I show you the       plan from the
13         Taylor Report, here is the police control box.              There is
14         the CCTV camera which was taking the films of these
15         people, and I think it must be down there, you see.               They
16         are in pen 1.      It looks as if these people are somewhere
17         about thereâ– 
18   MR.   McROBBIE:   It was certainly in that area but as to which,
19         sir, I cannot recall.       Certainly that area was fairly
20         clear at that time.
21   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I do not know whether you can help
22         me about this.     What I am particularly interested in is
23         camera 5 and what that camera,        if anything, was doing
24         between half past two and three o'clock.            Most people
25         during that time were concentrating on what was happening,
26         so far as the monitors are concerned,         in Leppings Lane on
27         the turnstiles.      That is right,    isn't it?
28   MR.   McROBBIE:   Yes.
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        And there is no recorded footage of
30         everything from camera      5 until about 3 o'clock when people
31         started coming over the top.           One of the questions which
32         may be of some importance - and I don't know whether you
33          can help me, but since you were there you might be able to
34          - is what that camera was pointing at between the time of
35          the incident with the     man dropping his trousers and the
36          time when that camera     was then focused on to people




                                          5
 1         climbing over the fence.         You may not have seen that
 2         switch possibly.     You may have left by then.
 3   MR.   McROBBIE:     I can't help you with that, sir.          There were no
 4         blank screens, but as far as the recording goes,             I can't
 5         make any observation and really I do not think I can
 6         answer the question, not with what the camera was doing in
 7         that half hour period.          I really couldn't say, sir, at
 8         that stage.     I am sorry about that.         I wish I could help.
 9   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        It is of some importance because it
10         is now said that various things ought to have been
11         appreciated from that camera,           so I am interested to know
12         what was happening.       I can quite see that other things
13         became much more important later on.            I think really we
14         are not going to get a lot more help from you, Mr.
15         McRobbie, on this.      I think it might be helpful if we were
16         to show you the video of that particular incident in case
17         it stimulates your memory at all.
18   MR.   BONE:    This is tape T B 2 .     [14:18:30]
19   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       That is at the kop end.          That is
20         camera 3.     This is what you saw, presumably, was it?           I
21         think this is the incident you referred to.
22   MR.   BONE:    Just after it.    You cannot see anybody with their
23         trousers down.      The camera is pointing at what appears to
24         be the corner of pen 2 looking into pen 3.
25   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       There is clearly a great deal of
26         space in what is being show there, and quite a lot space
27         in the one beyond as well.            The camera is being
28         manipulated by Mr. Bichard this time.
29   MR.   McROBBIE:     Do you wish me to continue watching this
30         because there is just one observation I can make.
31   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Yes.
32   MR.   McRO BBIE:    As I say, it is purely an observation that          as
33         the camera we are referring to was pointing to the kop
34         end,    if Mr. Jackson had said this incident had occurred,
35         they would then have switched.            The mere fact that they
36         are now focusing just on four or five people in that area,
37         bearing in mind the pan that camera can give,            I think that


                                             6
 1         would be as a result of observing it not on a camera, and
 2         they are now looking at what we observe.
 3   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I am sure that is right.              Somebody
 4         saw something happening and then the camera ---
 5   MR.    McROBBIE: Focused in in case there            was more activity.
 6   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       It is a different camera from the
 7         one that was focusing at the kop end.
 8   MR.    McROBBIE: That will be a recording             then.    For the camera
 9         operator to be focusing on these people alone at that
10         time,   that would be as a result of the observation which
11         was m a d e .
12   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Yes,       I follow that.      You will see
13         in a moment that it switches.
14   MR.    McROBBIE: There has been about three or four minutes
15         without any further activity that is causing problems,                 so
16         I think that follows on with the observation I have made.
17   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       [14:23:40]      It switches to the other
18         end.
19   MR.   BONE:   And this is another camera.
20   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I don't think we need trouble with
21         this.    We can fast forward it if you like, Chris.                Let us
22         go through to some of the Leppings Lane stuff.
23   MR.   BONE:   This is the kop end.         [14:31]
24   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      We are obviously very interested in
25         what was happening at that end.           [14:35]       This is the
26         colour camera.
27   MR.   BONE:    Camera 2.   This is Leppings Lane here.
28   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       This goes outside Leppings Lane.
29         You can fast forward this,       I think.        But this is probably
30         what you were seeing?
31   MR.    McROBBIE: Yes.
32   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I am going in fast forward.             If you
33         want to slow it down ---
34   MR.   BONE:   We are not actually;         it is normal       speed.
35   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Oh, is it.          This is time lapse.      It
36         gives a photo every half second or something.




                                            7
 1    MR.   McROBBIE:     Yes.   Actually viewing that it would be
 2          staccato presumably.
 3    MR.   BONE:   Gate C has just opened.            [14:52:54]   It has just
 4          been opened by the police.             Large numbers of people coming
 5          through.
 6    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        You were looking at this,        I
 7          imagine, were you?
  8   MR.   McROBBIE:     Yes.
  9   MR.   BONE:   He is waving people through,           isn't he?
10    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Yes.
11    MR.   McROBBIE:     Yes.   Obviously to take the congestion away
12          from the front.
13    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        This is better definition.
14    MR.   BONE:   This is camera 1 - [14:54].           Now we are back on
b.5         time lapse.
16    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Do you remember seeing it like
17          this?
18    MR.   McROBBIE:     I remember seeing all this happening.           This
19          seems faster than when I was viewing i t .
20    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        That would suggest to me that you
21          were viewing it on the      actual number one screen rather
22          than on the monitor.
23    MR.   MeROBBIE:     Right, sir.    I would have remembered if I had
24          seen that.     It is like someone has put it on fast forward
25          and it is certainly not my recollection that that was the
26          case.
27    MR.   BONE:   Had you been seeing in on a monitor it would not
28          have been fast and jerky.
29    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        We are switching over to inside
30          now.    You had probably left by 15.04 hadn't you?
31    MR.   McROBBIE:     Actually,   I would probably be somewhere in
32           front of where those people are because my recollection is
33           it was very full behind the goal pens, and where the
34           camera was previously viewing it, that was 14.23, there
35          was still a lot of space there, and I actually went out of
36           the control room to tell the policewoman on the gate to
37           allow people back into the area where it wasn't so


                                               8
 1         congested.     By that time I would have thought the game
 2         would have just about stopped if it had not already
 3         stopped.
 4   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        It finished between 5 and 6 minutes
 5         past.
 6   MR.   McROBBIE:     I would still be in the ground but not actually
 7         in front of there.
 8   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I don't think there is any more of
 9         this.   I would like to look at this afterwards.      That
10         suggests that you were actually watching the number one
11         screen of what was happening at Leppings Lane rather than
12         the monitor, because otherwise you would have noticed this
13         fast forward effect?
14   MR.   McROBBIE:     Yes.

15   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Can we get any clue from that fact
16         as to when you saw what was being recorded on camera 5,
17         that is the one just by the police box.        Was that six
18         minutes or so at 14.18.      Does that give you any indication
19         whether you would be looking at screen 5 or the monitors
20         on either side?
21   MR.   McROBBIE:     I am sorry, sir, no.    I could not say with any
22         certainty.
23   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I do not think there is really
24         anything else.       I am very grateful to you for coming.     I
25         am afraid you have not been able to help me as I hoped you
26         might be able to.       I am not in the least surprised that
27         you cannot. You obviously thought that the facilities of
28         these cameras were pretty good?
29   MR.   McROBBIE:     I did at that time, sir, yes.    That was my
30         first visit to that control room, and I did at that time
31         think they were good, sir, yes.
32   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        So far as you were concerned,
33         obviously you were looking at screen 1 a good deal of the
34         time in the build up to 3 o'clock when you went
35         downstairs.     Can you recall at all looking at the screen
36         which was being photoed by camera 5?
37   MR.   McROBBIE:     What would that be showing at the time?


                                          9
  1    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    I do not know but it was pointing
  2          towards the Leppings Lane end terraces.   It might be still
  3          in the position it would have been.
  4    MR.   McROBBIE:   My recollection is most of the discussion at
  5          that time was focused outside the ground, so it was quite
  6          natural that one would be looking at the cameras which
  7          were showing the scenes you have just been relaying there
  8          of the congestion outside rather than inside.
  9    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:   There is no occasion so far as you
10           were concerned for anybody to switch to the Leppings Lane
11           terraces themselves until people started coming over the
12           top?
13     MR.   McROBBIE:   Probably not, sir, no, because as I say, the
             main problem at that time was perceived to be outside the
*114
   5         ground from what I can recall.
16     LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:   Thank you very much indeed.   That
17           is very helpful.

“For a start the microphone system was next to useless and I and others around me could hear very
little o f what was actually said. We kept asking the senior officers to speak up, but still only heard 2
words in 4. This lead to a bit o f confusion among officers in the stand and match orders had to be
checked to see exactly what we were supposed to do”, (p.220) (Pre match-briefing), changed to:
“From my position it was difficult to hear some o f what was being said but I subsequently referred to
match orders to verify the instructions given to me”, (p.231)

             from M ai n Street.            T ra nsport was                   laid on at R o th er ha m and we          were

             taken to H i l l s b o ro u gh a rriv in g at a bo ut 9.15am.                              We went   into the

             N o r th S ta nd for briefing w hi ch s t a r t e d at about                           10atri.   For a start

             the m ic ro ph on e     system was next                  to u s el es s and I and others               round me

             could hear very little of what was                                 a c t u a l l y said.     We kept asking the

             senior officers           to speak up,               but still           only heard 2 words          in 4.      This

             lead to a bit of confusion a mong                                officers     in the stand and m atch

             orders had to be             checked to see e x a c t l y what we were supposed to do.

             We then had our snack of crisps,                                 etc,   and went out on patrol shortly

             afterwards.          Our serial,             t ogether w i t h Serial 37, were deputed to go

             to W ad sl ey Bridge S t a t i o n to escort                        the Liverpool           supporters arrivinc

             by train to the ground.                      We a r r i v e d at about            11am at the station,            anc

             all went onto          the     platform out of the way.                         We were told shortly

we had to go a n d stand about             in the s id er o ad next to the station from

11am,    until     the train arrived.         I was    surprised to find that only 1

train was     due an d that was s c h e d ul e d for 2.02pm.              This meant that 22

officers w ere       standing a ro un d kill in g      time for 3 hours doing

a b s o l u t el y nothing.

Whilst at our        point awaiting        the train,        I spoke to several         supporters

m o s t l y f r o m L iverpool who were w a lk i n g a wa y from the ground.                They

b as i c a l l y w o u l d not turn a r o u n d w h e n asked,   and   continued up Halifax

Road.

N um erous   of these had cans of beer w i t h t^rfsm a l t h o u g h to begin with

t hey did not appear           drunk.     I also     spoke    to ^several    people who were

wiJth^ f a m i l y who w an t ed food a nd d i r ec t io n s     to the ground.         One family

consisted of 2 men a n d a young              boy.     The b o y ’s father had a home made

stand for his son to use                inside the gr ou nd but shortly before I had

heard a m e s s a g e    stating that milk         crates were to be banned in the

ground.      As this stand had o b v i o u sl y had some care taken into its

 construction.          I a d v i s e d the father    to    return it to the        car to avoid

 loosing     it.     This     he did.     As he was    doing this,        I was   talking to his

 son and the other m a n who were             both eating        chips and fish.          I asked

 if I could have one,            and then we spent          the next     10 m inu te s eating

 these a n d ha v i n g a good laugh.          On the fathers          return,     I gave them

 directions        to the Liver pool       end of the ground w here they had tickets.

B y now,     due to the hot weather,           I was       beginning        feel very hot,          but

 no drinks wer e a v a il a bl e nearby.

 The    influx of supporter s both on foot a n d / i n vehicles was gradually

 increasing,        a n d it was noti ce ab le     t h at /l ot s of the pedestrians had

 with them 4        packs of beer etc,        and^^e        noise   level was T n c r e a s ’i h g .

 and spoke to us.             As he was at our       location,      a radio message was

 of Halfords S to re on,Kilner Way.                 Mr.    M ar sh a ll a n d several of our

 serials went u p * 6        the    location,    and    I saw the G a te wa y Supermarket

    -Tim— >■'   *■“
 these as he left the store.   The p r o b l e m outside Halfords was sorted

 a short time       later,    an d we returned to the              station.        I was surprised

 to see so m a n y y ou th s       etc sat on the         g r as s e d a re a outside Halfords

 drinking.       The     grass was     covered in cans a n d bottles as we walked

  through the      crowd.      A short time       later,      at a bout 2pm,         the train

  arrived,    a n d we    lined up by the steps as              the fans got off.          Mounted

  officers had by this             time arrived,     a n d we     s t op pe d the fans until all

  were off the s t at i on a nd in a large              but m a n a g e a b l e   group.   I togethei

  with several       other    officers s ea rc h ed       r an d om fans as they left the

  station, a nd this was            received w i t h a goo d deal           of fun and amusement

  by the supporters.

  The procession then set off an d               I f o un d m ys el f      in a good natured bit

  of banter w i t h several          of the s u pp o r t e r s who     seemed to think the

  whole thing was a huge joke.                No n a s t y n e s s at all.

  I must say now that up to this                point     I thou gh t      everything was going

  quite well an d we seemed to be w i nn i n g               over     the supporters        we were

   talking to by having a laugh an d a joke a n d                     it seemed to be paying

   off.
   The supporters were taken to the g r ou n d w it h ou t                   incident and taken t

   the turnstiles.          I found that t r af fi c was           still     running along

   Leppings Lane w h ic h seemed daft as               it was only adding             to the

   congestion.         At the elbow of the         road     right outside          the ground,   the

   situation was so bad that I went                into the        road an d began to work

longer.           Buses wer e     trying to plough t hr o ug h and the situation was

tense.

I sorted out the              initial    problem a n d went                                        back onto the footpath on

the opposite side of the                 road from the g ro un d where                                                       I saw dozens of

people just h a n gi ng           round drinking a n d sitting on the wall.                                                             These

w ou l d not move        towards      the ground w h e n asked.                                                      In other words we were

wasting our time talking                 to them.                         It also                      became a p p a r ent that lots

of people ar»d^I_mean lots w e r e _ l o o k i n g                                              for tickets.                  I was asked

a sk e d about tickets.

The     crowd outside          the ground was                    now g r ow in g                              to such an extent that

it was beginning              to swell    onto the                        r o ad wa y from the forecourt.

                             in a mo n g them and see what                                             the problem was because

w ere    immediately s w a m p e d by people w a nt i n g                                              to know w here to go.                Thev

had tickets,           but    could still     not fin d out w here to go.                                                        This   raised «

point as far as              I was   concerned              in that the signs above the

turnstiles were              f o un d to be tota ll y                         inadequate.                                 They are too small

for     people to read until             they are                    10 y ards a wa y from the turnstiles

a n d by that time            if they found they wer e                                            in the wrong                 section of the

crowd,      they faced a n almost           i m p o s s i bl e                                  task     to swop to another part

of the crowd w h e r e          they should have been.

The tickets were              coloured,    so w h y the hell                                           not           put up very large

signs m e a suring           10 feet x 5 feet,                      or s o m et h i n g similar,                                 with arrows

pointing down to the t u rnstiles                          p a i nt e d                          in the same                 colours as the

a n d 2 stewards ope ne d this up and the                 boys were admitted.        The gate

was then shut.

As    I made my way back to the forecourt,                  I was    confronted by a man of

about 3 5 - 4 0     who was       nearly hysterical.         He was a cc o mp a ni e d by a

w o m a n and an older gentleman,           and the y had tickets for the North

Stand.      He began shouti ng about how             crushed he was and how badly

o rg a ni s ed things were,         and ge ne ra ll y how he was a pp au l ed by the

whole situation.            He    insisted that    I open the concertina gate again

to admit        everyone w i t h a N or th S t a n d ticket and to stop the           crush,

e xplained to him that             this was not     possible at that time.          Wit h     this

he became very a g g i t a t e d and I i nf or m ed him             that   if he felt so

strongly about the si tu at io n that he                 should write to the FA,       the

football        club and the       Chief C o ns ta bl e    on his    return home to make his

feelings known.            This    he said he w o u l d do.      He then stor me d off        back

to the queues and the              lady w ith him a s k ed me to forgive him as he wa<.

upset by everything.               I spoke to the        lady for about 2 minutes and sh»

the n left me thanking me for my help.

The     crush for the 5 N o rt h S tand t u rn s ti l es was by now getting very

bad.      I went and took up a position agai ns t                the wall      of the sweet

shop where        the fo re co ur t of the g r o u n d joins        it.    M y back was to the

wall and the        crowd were       pressing up to me,         passing from      right to lef

in front of me.            O n several    occ as io ns    I had to speak       to young men wh<

  I d o n ’t kno w what    time   it was    by now,       some time between S.3 0pm and

 3.00pm    I r ea li se d that things were           g et t in g     totally out of hand.         Wher

  I ware I was having        to pull young       lads a nd their fathers out of the

  c/ush due to the y oungsters           being      c r u s h e d a n d feeling faint.      One

  young   lad I had to literally           put m y    foot      into the crowd to force a

   pace before      pulling the lad out w i t h one ar m and holding him to me

  whiflst he came      round.     His father        p u s h e d his way out also,         and then I

itt^ot them out of the         crush and onto         the f o o t pa t h outside the shop,

         so saw g rown me n coming out of the                crush     pale faced and one in

  particular was saying           "Fucking mad.          I ’ve had enough of that.            T h e y ’r

  fucking mad.*'       He stood beside me until                he    regained a bit of his

  colour an d got his breath back             be fo re      going     out of the forecourt and

  out onto L e p p i n g s Lane to wait       for     the    crush to stop.I      can remember a

  lady of about 5 0 wearing a faw n o v e r c o a t who was crying due to being

  crushed.      She was     crushed w i th her        h e a d facing me and could not even

  turn her head forwards due to the                 p r e s su r e   she was under.       She shoute

  to me    "Help me,      I ’m going to f a i n t . "       I pushed into the crowd and

  got hold of her         coat by the front a n d           the      left shoulder and pulled he

  towards me thro u g h the crowd.            Onc e     m y back was to the sweet shop

  wall    I pulled the w om a n to me as         she     had       lost nearly all    her colour a

  held her to me wit h my arms a r o u n d            her until         she regained a bit of

  composure.I      t hen stood her beside me             to m y right so that her back was

  a gainst the shop wall.            I d o n ’t k n o w what         happened to her then as I w

    etting     crushed myself      by this    time,      as the        crowd swelled and became

   Lntent on forcing a way thro u gh to the                  turnstiles.       I looked around ir,

  k t this time a n d I saw Supt.          Marshall         s tood on a brick wall         to my rig

  next to the      river.      He was t a lk i ng     into     his     radio and I caught a

  mess a g e   t h r o u gh my radio about o p e n i n g a gate before a "catastrophe"

   phrase however.

F rom what   I could see the s it u at i on was              chaotic all aro un d the area.

P eople were     pushing,        chanting,    s i ng i n g an d the position was useless

from a control        point of view.          Y o u n g m e n were actually climbing over

the wall a bove       the West S ta nd s ea t in g       turnstiles and into the ground

By now people were          getting h ys te ri ca l     a r o u n d me both male and female

and begging      for help.         I deci de d that      someone was going to get

s e riously hurt        in the    crush before m u c h       longer,   and there was nothin

anyone    could do to stop trouble              happ en in g.       (By trouble   I mean

someone    being     crushed.)       The s i t u a t i o n was    literally out of control.

I made a d e c i s i o n to seek advice          r e ga rd in g    opening the    concertina

 oor leading        to the N or th stand to a l l o w         people to just       rush through

the larger       opening,    and possibly save              life as that*s how bad I

thought    it was.        I tried 3 times        on my       radio to contact ground

control    but    r ec eived no answer.          I t h e n tried.to..scantact Supt.

Marshall     via t a lk - th r ou g h 3 further       times       to ask his   permission to

open the gate.           I a g ai n received no       reply.        I then pushed my way

through the f orecourt            of the g r o u nd a n d across       to where Mr. Marshall

was.     I t hen spoke to him,          told him a b o u t        the crush,   and a sked

permission to open the conce r ti na gate.                    He said "Yes go on Gary."

then pushed my way back thro u g h the                crowd to the gate and banged on

it.    The s t e w a r ds a pp ea re d at the w i n d o w s an d told them to open the

gate up a n d     let the     crowd in before         s o me on e was killed.       T h i s t hey

did a fter    I ha d     repeated myself.

i mmediately      the    crowd surged f o r w a r d    to this gate and went through.

The    presure    e ased w it h i n 30 seconds,        but     still   people were     pushing

and I a dmit      that    I t ook hioId of 2 y o u n g        idiots of^about      17-18^years

who were     just    going wil d to 9 e ^ *n k no ck i ng           people everywhere.^

The whole m e n t a l i t y seemed to be not           to miss the kick off at any

price.     It was       frightening.         I b o l l o c k e d the 2 lads and then let the:

            tired due to all         the    pushing,    shoving,         etc.     plus the war m weather a m

            having to wear         tunics    in hot weather.              I was s h at te re d to be frank.

            I was wiping my s e l f down wit h my h a n d k e r c h i e f as I heard a radio

            m essage   to the effect         that all o ff ic e rs were to go onto the perimete

            at the L e p p i n g s Lane     end.   I ran into           the gr ou nd by the gate I ’d jus

            o pened an d then under the N orth Stand.                      I ran up through the first

            gangway and      into the stand itself.                    I saw the Liverpool       players

            trooping     off the     pitch on the other                side of the ground from me and

            then I saw the L e p p i ng s Lane T e r r a c e            (from now on called the L.L.T.)

            There were       people all       over it,   bobb ie s and civilians.               I ran down th

            steps,     over the wall,         over the a d v e r t i s i n g h oa rdings and onto the

            pitch.      I ran to the fence and s to o d on the wall.                        The first thing

            that struck me was             the noise,    a mixture          of squeals and shouts.          Next

            the smell.        Yo u could smell         beer strongly.             I saw how crushed things

                  e/in the    pen and my first          instinct was            to climb up the fence and

            (n*mp into the         pen to help,       but as     I b e g a n climbing up I realised tha

             I ’d land on someone           inside and hurt            them,    so I stopped where     I was

             a nd tried to kick,           pull and tug the            fence    down.     I even threw myself

             at   it s h o ulder    to wire to try and k nock               it down but of course nothin
?
             happened.       People were screaming             for hel p only           18 inches away on the

             other side of the            line but I c o u l d n ’t do a bloody thing.              Then bodie

             a n d injured came over the top and the                      first    person   I saw was shaken

             a nd totally out of breath.               I laid h i m down on the             pitch and asked

             hi m what hurt        etc,    but he was only s h a k en up.               I o bt ained his detail

                                                                                                            I ’m
             as Anth o n y Leigh,         24 years,

             not sure but he         could have hurt his               right ankle.         I helped to get hit

             over to the a d v e r t i s i n g hoardings at              the N o r th S t a nd side of the

towards      it and    I saw a limp figure              passed over the fence.            I got this

body onto the         pitch and began m o u th to m o ut h and cardiac massage with

a young girl from the St. Johns A m b u l a n c e who seemed totally shocked

but did a good job.               A man in a L i v e r po o l     shirt then came to me and

he had a green stretcher.                 He a s ke d    if it was any use and I said

’y e s ’.    We   loaded this young man onto                 the stretcher and then we ran

the    length of the         pitch as fast as we             could to the First Aid Post at

the back of the stand but w he n we got there                         a nurse told          ushe was

dead and to take him              into the gym.          This we      did.      I then      went back tc

the LLT and we f et ch ed out 2 people,                   a man and a young         lad who were

injured but alright.                These we d u m p ed at the First Aid Room and ran

back.        I realised at this          point that          I ’d lost my helmet.         Funny how

yo u think of things              like that at s uc h a time.

Me and the Liv er po ol            lad were    running        back to the LLT with the

 stretcher a gain w he n           I saw 4 lads         carrying another        lad on a board.

 They were        "Help us."        I saw that      the      lad on the board was blue in the

 face and his eyes were               half open.        He    looked about      18— 19.    I said

 "Come on I ’ll show y ou where               to go."         I then grabbed part of the boar

 they were        carrying and we ran to the F irst Aid Room.

 A man looked at the y o ut h and said                   "Sorry    i t ’s too   late",     and moved

 on.        I knew where     to take the body but the board w o u l d n ’t go through

 the door,        so I picked the body up in my arms and carried it into the

 gym and laid him down.                No one s e em e d to know what was happening and

 so I ran back out an d back towards                     the LLT.

 The next         person   I help ed was a y ou ng w o m a n          who was totally shaken anc

 I sat her down at the               pitch side.

 I ’d stopped getting             details as things were well              out of control by nou.

 and names and a d dr es se s were            the   last      things on my mind.

 One thing that            I do   remember was      that      t hroughout all the chaos^and

 shit,       only one gaffer was           (as far as        I was   concerned)     doing anything
                                                                                           PAGE
                                                                                           R360
and WiafT was C hief Supt.           Nesbit and he was doing a brilliant job.                       He

was everywhere at once.              Fantastic.

I then ran to hel p a bobby who was s t r u g g l i n g wit h a stretcher and

f ound it to be PS Turner            (late of C1 D i v i s i o n and newly promoted).                    I

helped him to take another body to the gy m where we laid him out

before    running and back to the LLT.

It seemed that by now more dead than a l i ve were being                         carried to the

gym from the LLT.           E ve ry time    I went    there      someone w an te d a hand with

a stretcher       or board to carry,         on the main,         a mate to the First Aid

Room,    and    I took another 3 bodies           into    the gym in a short space of

time.     The    gym was    to    put it bluntly      'fucking awful'           and I'll never

forget the sight of the bodies du mp ed all                     over.       I'm just glad I didr.

get stuck w it h staying with a body in the gym that's all.

Wh en I went      back onto the       pitch a ga in      I saw a man who appea red to be

a doctor going from body to body.                   Thi s was     on the      pitch at the Kop

end of the gro un d where the bodies ha d been                    carried by friends etc.

I gave m o u t h to m o u th on a man who the doctor                 thought he could save

but to no avail.           He had been carrying           out    cardiac massage       on the

               Police Constable 2910



               At 8.30 a.m.                Saturday            15 April 1989 I commenced duty at Main Street Police                   J

               Station,        Rotherham                 for    duties   in   relation   to   the   FA   Cup   Semi   Final   at

               Hillsborough, Sheffield.                                                                                  .     ; •■

               I was shown on the order as being in Serial 36 under the command of PS 1829

               France.         Our Serial comprised almost totally E Group officers from Main Street.
                                                                                                                                   ■ op
               Transport was laid on at Rotherham and we were taken to Hillsborough arriving at

               about 9.15a.m.               We went into the North Stand for briefing which started at about

               10.00 a.m.

               From my position it was difficult to hear some of what was being said but I

               subsequently referred to match orders to verify the instructions given to me.

               We then had our snack of crips etc and went out on patrol shortly afterwards.

               Our Serial, together with Serial 37 were deputed to go to Wadsley Bridge Station

               to escort the Liverpool supporters arriving by train to the ground. We arrived at

               about 11.00 a.m. at the station and all went onto the platform out of the way. We

               were told shortly afterwards by Chief Inspector Purdy that this was not allowed

                and so we had to go and stand about in the side road next to the station from

                11.00 a.m. until the train arrived.                            I was surprised to find that only 1 train

                was due and that was scheduled for 2.02 p.m. This meant that 22 officers were

                standing around killing time for 3 hours doing absolutely nothing.

                Whilst at our point awaiting the train, I spoke to several supporters mostly from

                Liverpool who were walking away from the ground. They basically would not turn

                around when asked, and continued up Halifax Road.

                Numerous of these had cans of beer with them although to begin with they did not

                appear drunk.                I also spoke to several people who were with family who wanted

                food and directions to the ground.                             One family consisted of 2 men and a young

                boy. The boy's father had a home made stand for his son to use inside the ground
                                                                        ■        PAGE 2

but shortly before I had heard a message stating that milk crates were to be

banned in the ground. As this stand had obviously had some care taken into its

construction, I advised the father to return it to the car to avoid losing it.

This he did. As he was doing this I was talking to his son and the other man who

were both eating chips and fish.   I asked if I could have one, and then we spent

the next 10 minutes eating these and having a good laugh.       On the father's return

I gave them directions to the Liverpool end of the ground where they had tickets.

By now due to the hot weather I was beginning to feel very hot, but no drinks

were available nearby.

The influx of supporters both on foot and in vehicles was gradually increasing

and it was noticable that lots of the pedestrians had with them 4 packs of beer

etc and the noise level was increasing.                     »

Superintendent Marshall arrived at our location some time around 1.00 p.m. and

spoke to us. As he was at our location a radio message was received that a group

of supporters were causing problems at the rear of Halfords Store on Kilner Way.

Mr Marshall and several of our serials went up to the location and I saw the

Gateway Supermarket appeared to have closed the entrance doors. Coming from the

exit door were numerous males with cans of beer under their arms, 1 youth I

remember had what appeared to be a pack of 12 cans or bottles of beer/lager in a

green covering and he was already drinking one of these as he left the store.

The problem outside Halfords was sorted a short time later and we returned to the

station.   I was surprised to see so many youths etc sat on the grassed area

outside Halfords drinking. The grass was covered in cans and bottles as we walked

through the crowd. A short time later, at about 2.00 p.m. the train arrived and

we lined up by the steps as the fans got off. Mounted officers had by this time

arrived, and we stopped the fans until all were off the station and in a large

but manageable group.    I together with several other officers searched random

fans as they left the station and this was received with a good deal of fun and

amusement by the supporters.                               ”

The procession then set off and I found myself in a good natured bit of banter

with several of the supporters who seemed to think the whole thing was a huge

joke.                 No nastiness at all.

I must say now that up to this point I thought everything was going quite well

and we seemed to be winning over the supporters we were talking to by having a

laugh and a joke and it seemed to be paying off.
        .... ; /             ... : ;                                 . .y.
The         supporters                 were   taken   to   the   ground without   incident and taken to the

turnstiles.                   I found that traffic was still running along Leppings Lane which

seemed daft as it was only adding to the congestion. At the elbow of the road

right outside the ground, the situation was so bad that I went into the road and

began to work traffic and pedestrian control off my own"bat, because people were

 milling everywhere and someone was going to get hurt before much longer.                               Buses

 were trying to plough through and the situation was tense.

 I sorted out the initial problem and went back onto the footpath on the opposite

 side of the road from the ground where I saw dozens of people just hanging round

 drinking and sitting on the wall. These would not move towards the ground when

 asked.                  In other words we were wasting our time talking to them.               It also became

 apparent that lots of people and I mean lots were looking for tickets.                                 I was

 asked myself, and anyone who was sat on the wall or standing' nearby, was asked

 about tickets.

 The crowd outside the ground was growing to such an extent that it was beginning

 to swell onto the roadway from the forecourt.                               I decided to go in among them and

 see what the problem was because there appeared to be no recognised queues. PC

 25^7 Ramsden from Serial 37 went with me, and we went into the centre of the

 crowd. We were immediately swamped by people wanting to know where to go.                                They

 had tickets, but could still not find out where to go. This raised a point as far

 as I was concerned in that the signs above                                  the turnstiles were found to be
                                                                                      PAGE 4     >?j
    GARY CAMMOCK      .. . ;                                                       \ *,.,?$§ , •vjpp

    totally inadequate. They are too small for people to read until they are 10 yards

    away from the turnstiles and by that time if they found they were in the wrong

    section of the crowd, they faced an almost impossible task to swop to another

    part of the crowd where they should have been.

    The tickets were coloured so why not put up very large signs measuring 10 feet x

    5 feet or something similar, with arrows pointing down to the turnstiles, painted                  ;

    in the same colours as the tickets.        This would have stopped all or most of the

    problems with people wandering around causing problems merely by their presence.

    It was as I was directing people that a young lad came up to me and asked if I

    could help get his friend into the ground.         His friend and he had tickets for the

-   North Stand and his friend was in a wheelchair.              I pushed my way through the

    crowd assisted by another officer who I think was PC 2405“Morton and made a path

    through   the   crowd   through which    the   2 lads    passed.    I then banged on the

    concertina style gate and 2 stewards opened this up and the boys were admitted.

    The gate was then shut.                                                             ' ”ty

    As I made my way back to the forecourt I was confronted by a man of about 35~^0

    who was nearly hysterical.        He was accompanied by a woman and an older gentleman

    and they had tickets for the North Stand.          He began shouting about how crushed he

    was and how badly organised things were, and generally how he was appalled by the

     whole situation.       He insisted that I open the concertina gate again to admit

     everyone with a North Stand ticket and to stop the crush.              I explained to him

     that this was not possible at that time. With this he became very agitated and I

     informed him that if he felt so strongly about the situation that he should write

     to the FA, the football club and the Chief Constable on his return home to make

     his feelings known. This he said he would do.            He then stormed off back to the

     queues   and   the   lady with   him   asked me    to   forgive   him as he was upset by

     everything.     I spoke    to the lady for about 2 minutes and she then left me

     thanking me for my help.

      speak to young men who were just pushing into the backs of people and surging and

      being bloody daft.

      I don’t know what time it was by now, some time between 2.30 pm and 3*00 p.m. I

      realised that things were getting totally out of hand. Where I was I was having                                                                        I

      to pull young lads and their fathers out of the crush due to the youngsters being

      crushed and feeling faint. One young lad I had to literally put my foot into the
-■A
 -    crowd to force a space before pulling the lad out with one arm and holding him to

      me whilst he came round.                             His father pushed his way out also and then I got them

       out of the crush and onto the footpath outside the shop.                                                  I also saw grown men

       coming out of the crush pale faced and one in particular was saying "fucking mad,

       I ’ve had enough of that, they’re fucking                                            mad.”        He stood beside me until           he

       regained a bit of his colour and got his breath back before going out of the

       forecourt and out onto Leppings                               Lane           to wait         for the     crush to stop. I can

       remember a lady of about 50 wearing a fawn overcoat who was crying due to being

       crushed.          She was crushed with her head facing me and could not even turn her

       head forwards due to the pressure she was under. She shouted to me ’help me I ’m

       going to faint.’                      I pushed into the crowd and got hold of her coat by the front

       and the left shoulder and pulled her towards me through the crowd.                                                     Once my back

       was to the sweet shop wall I pulled the woman to                                                  me as she had lost nearly all

       her colour and held her to me with my arms round her until she regained a bit of

       composure.            I then stood her beside me to my right so that her back was against

       the shop wall.                    I don’t know what happened to her then as I was getting crushed

       myself by this time, as the crowd swelled and became intent on forcing a way

       through         to        the         turnstiles.         I   looked                 around me at       this    time       and I     saw

Superintendent Marshall stood on a brick wall to my right next to the river.         He

was talking into his radio and I caught a message through my radio about opening

a gate before a ’catastrophe’ happens.        I do not know if Mr Marshall was the

person who used this phrase however.

From what I could see the situation was chaotic all around the area. People were

pushing, chanting, singing and the position was useless from a control point of

view.    Young men were actually climbing over the wall above the West Stand

 seating turnstiles and into the ground.       By now people were getting hysterical

 around me both male and female and begging for help.     I decided that someone was

 going to get seriously hurt       in the crush before much longer,    and there was

 nothing anyone could do to stop trouble happening.       (By trouble I mean someone

 being crushed).   The situation was literally out of control.

 I made a decision to seek advice regarding opening the concertina door leading to

 the North Stand to allow people to just rush through the larger opening, and

 possibly save life as that’s how bad I thought it was.        I tried 3 times on my

 radio to contact ground control but received no answer.      I then tried to contact

 Superintendent Marshall via talk-through 3 further times to ask his permission to

 open the gate.     I again received no reply.     I then pushed my way through the

 forecourt of the ground and across to where Mr Marshall was.         I then spoke to

 him, told him about the crush and asked permission to open the. concertina gate.

 He said "Yes go on Gary."        I then pushed my way back through the crowd to the

 gate and banged on it.        The stewards appeared at the windows and told them to

 open the gate up and let the crowd in before someone was killed. This they did

 after I had repeated myself.

 Immediately the crowd surged forward to this gate and went through.      The pressure

 eased within 30 seconds but still people were pushing and I admit that I took

 hold of 2 young idiots of about 17-18 years who were just going wild to get in,

 knocking people everywhere. The whole mentality seemed to be not to miss the kick

    off at any price.         It was frightening.         I bollocked the 2 lads and then let them

    go. To be quite honest I was sweating like a dog and was physically tired due t

    all the pushing, shoving etc, plus the warm weather and having to wear tunics in

    hot weather.        I was shattered to be frank.                 I was wiping myself down with my

    handkerchief as I heard a radio message to the effect that all officers were to

    go onto the perimeter at the Leppings Lane end.                      I ran into the ground by the

    gate I ’d just opened and then under               the North Stand.        I ran up through the first
                                                                                                            &
    gangway and       into the stand itself.           I saw the Liverpool players trooping off the

    pitch on the other side of the ground from me and then I saw the Leppings Lane

    Terrace (from now on called the LLT).               There were people all over it, bobbies and

    civilians.       I ran down the steps, over the wall, over the advertising hoardings

    and onto the pitch.           I ran to the fence and stood on the»wall.              The first thing

    that struck me was the noise, a mixture of squeals and shouts.                       Next the smell,

    you could smell beer strongly.                I saw how crushed things were in the pen and my

    first instinct was to climb up the fence and jump into the pen to help, but as I

    began climbing up I realised that I'd land on someone inside and hurt them, so I

    stopped where I was and tried to kick, pull and tug the fence down.                      I even threw

    myself at it shoulder to wire to try and knock it down but of course nothing

^   happened.       People were screaming for help only 18 inches away on the other side

    of the line but I couldn't do a bloody thing.                     Then bodies and injured came over

    the top and the first person I saw                was shaken and totally out of breath.       I laid

    him down on the pitch and asked him what hurt etc, but he was only shaken up.                      I

    obtained      his    details      as   Anthony    Leigh,    24    years,

    Liverpool.       I'm not sure but he could have hurt his right ankle.                 I helped to get

    him over to the advertising hoardings at the North Stand side of the pitch and

     left him there with his mate or a man who said he'd help I.can't remember which.

     I then turned back to the stand LLT and it was awful.                      I walked towards it and I

     saw a limp figure passed over the fence.                   I got this body onto the pitch and

Ambulance who seemed totally shocked but did a good job.         A man in a Liverpool

shirt then came to me and he had a green stretcher.        He asked if it was any use

and I said "yes."       We loaded this young man onto the stretcher and then we ran

the length of the pitch as fast as we could to the first aid post at the back of

the stand but when we got there a nurse told us he was dead and to take him into
                                                                                - ;     -V-v
the gym.   This we did.     I then went back to the LLT and we fetched out 2 people,

a man and a young lad who were injured but alright. These we dumped at the first

aid room and ran back. I realised at this point that I'd lost my helmet.              Funny

how you think of things like that at such a time.

Me and the Liverpool lad were running back to the LLT with the stretcher again

when I saw 4 lads carrying another lad on a board.         They were saying "Help us."

I saw that the lad on the board was blue in the face and his eyes were half open.

He looked about 18-19.       I said "Come on I ’ll show you where to go."         I .then

grabbed part of the board they were carrying and we ran to the first aid room.                 A

man looked at the youth and said "Sorry it’s too late." and moved on.                 I knew

where to take the body but the board wouldn’t go through the door, so I picked

 the body up in my arms and carried it into the gym and laid him down.                No one

 seemed to know what was happening and so I ran back out and back towards the LLT.

The next person I helped was a young woman who was totally shaken and I sat her

 down at the pitch side.

 I ’d stopped getting details as things were well out       of control by now and names

 and addresses were the last thing onmy mind.

 One thing    that I do     remember was that throughout   all the chaos that          Chief

 Superintendent   Nesbit    was   doing a brilliant job,    he was everywhere   at once,

 fantastic.

 I then ran to help a bobby who was struggling with a stretcher and found it to be

 PS Turner (late of Cl Division and newly promoted).       I helped him to take another

    It seemed that’by now more dead than alive were being carried to the gym from the

    LLT.     Every time I went there someone wanted a hand with a stretcher or board to                                                                                                 ■-I

    didn't get stuck with staying with a body in the gym that's all.

    When I went               back onto the pitch again I saw a man who appeared to be                                                            a doctor

    going from body to body. This was on the pitch at the Kop end of the ground where

    the bodies had been carried by friends etc.                                          I gave mouth to mouth on a man who

    the doctor thought he could save but to no avail.                                                                  He had been carrying                out

    cardiac massage on the same man.                                     We then went to another man and swopped roles.

    Both died and were taken                                  away by friends etc to                             the gym.

    By now I was feeling rough.                                     I'd carried dead, worked on dead and felt shocking.

    I was sweating and totally shattered.                                     My shoulders were burning and I felt sick.                                                                 I
    I just felt               useless to be quite honest. I've never worked as hard                                                          inmy life      and

    got nothing               out of it, that's what made it worse.

    By now the worse was over and I went back towards the LLT and began to console

    people on the pitch who                                    were crying etc.    One lad just passed out in my arms                                            as

^   we sat talking.                        He'd                lost his mate in    the crowd and couldn't find him.                                                   I

    brought him round and gave him a drink and he came to and went away.

    We eventually left the pitch when all the supporters had gone and were told to

    sit in the stand.

   Dear Sir

   Thank you for contacting my investigation team at Nechells dealing with the
   disaster at Sheffield Wednesday’s Football Ground, Hillsborough, on 15th April
   1989, concerning information you have as the result of a detailed study of
   safety at football grounds, with particular reference to evacuations and the
   need for perimeter fencing.

   As evidence on these aspects is currently being taken in writing and will later
   be taken orally in some cases only, by Lord Justice Taylor under Phase 2 of his
   Inquiry, may X suggest that you write to the Inquiry Secretary in the first
   instance detailing the information you have. The address you require is as
   follows:

   R M Whalley Esq
   Secretary to Inquiry
   Hillsborough Stadium Disaster
   56 Queen Anns Gate
   London SW1H 9AT

   May I take this opportunity of thanking you for your interest in the inquiry
   and if I can be of any further assistance please do not hesitate to contact me
   at the above address/telephone number.

   Yours Faithfully




  I J M JONES

           Dear Sir,

           Ve wish to put forward the following observation to the Inquiry which
           hopefully may be of assistance.

           From time to time we are instructed to make games "All tickets". The
           last occasion was on March 10th for the visit of Wolverhampton
           Wanderers, Although they failed to sell all the tickets provided, we
           were advised by the Police that they were expecting up to 400/500 to
           travel without tickets. Apparently, they travel without tickets, knowing
           that if they cause difficulties outside the ground they will be let in.
           Our Inspector, who is most helpful, warned us of this prospect and told
           us to have a gate ready should he have to order them to be allowed in.

            Whilst we understand the Police problem, this clearly negates the aims
            of "All ticket" matches and, as it has become known to the hooligan
            element, has become an attraction for them and increased the prospects
            of problems initially outside and ultimately inside the grounds.

            This is doubly dangerous where an area has already reached capacity
            under the Safety Certificate restrictions, but regardless of this, we
            understand Police instructiosn are to put people into grounds from
            outside to make control problems easier. It should be borne in mind that
            stringent calvulations are made in drawing up by experts the limits to
            the allowed numbers in seperate areas of stadia and by disregarding
            these for whatever purpose, the safety of innocent spectators is placed
            in jeopardy, the protection factor given to them by the Club, County
            Council and Safety Certificate being removed in one fell swoop.

            We imply no criticism of the Police generally nor indeed of our own
            Essex Constabulary but feel it Is an element which should be considered
            by the Inquiry in its deliberations, the outcome of which will have far
            reaching consequences for al1 Football Clubs.

                                                                                                                              contd.   ....

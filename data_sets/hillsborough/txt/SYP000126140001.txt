TURNSTILES WERE OPENED AND THE CROWD SURGED FORWARD. NO-ONE STOPPED US TO
CHECK TICKETS. THERE WERE TWO OFFICERS TRYING TO CHECK THEM, BUT THERE WERE
TOO MANY PEOPLE. I TOOK MY PLACE IN THE STAND, AND AT FIRST WE THOUGHT IT WAS
AN OVERSPILL FROM THE LEPPINGS LANE END, THEN IT BECAME APPARENT TO US THAT
PEOPLE WERE BEING INJURED. POLICE WERE TRYING TO GET PEOPLE OUT BUT THE
RAILINGS WERE STOPPING THEM FROM GETTING PEOPLE OUT. THE ONLY GATE IN THE
RAILINGS WASN'T OPEN. AS TIME WENT ON WE COULD SEE PEOPLE BEING LAIN OUT ON
TH^PITCH - I SAW ONE PERSON WITH A COAT OVER HIS FACE SO HE WAS OBVIOUSLY
Df l. WE COULD SEE PEOPLE TRYING TO REVIVE OTHERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. AT
ABOUT TWENTY TO FOUR WE LEFT THE GROUND AND FOUND OUR FRIEND WHO WAS SUPPOSED
TO HAVE BENN IN THE LEPPINGS LANE END.

I WAS ASKED 3 TIMES TO SHOW MY TICKET. THERE WERE NO PUBS OPEN ON ROUTE TO
THE GROUND. THERE WERE YOUNG PEOPLE DRINKING CANS OF BEER. THEY HAD NOT COME
ON THE TRAIN AND WERE NOT DRUNK.
AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE GROUND AT 2PM THERE WAS A GENERAL GROUP OF PEOPLE
THERE WAS NO ORGANISATION TO FORM PEOPLE INTO GROUPS. LAST YEAR POLICE WERE
IN CONTROL OF AREA OUTSIDE GROUND. POLICE WERE OUTSIDE THE GROUND AND THEY
WERE SEARCHING AS YOU PASSED THROUGH TURNSTYLES. THERE WERE PEOPLE WITHOUT
TI^pTS OUTSIDE AND THEY WERE NOT MOVED ON .
INSIDE THE GROUND BY TURNSTYLE A AND HANDED IN MY TICKET. AND WENT TO MY SEAT
AT 2:30PM I BECAME CONCERNED ABOUT PEOPLE CRAMMED INTO THE SIDE STAND
DIRECTLY BEHIND THE GOALS. THE LEFT AND RIGHT WAS STILL EMPTY.
AS A SAFETY OFFICER I CAN SAY THAT AT THIS POINT THE SITUATION SHOULD HAVE
BEEN NOTICED....
SOMETHING WAS SAID OVER THE TANNOY BUT WAS NOT VERY GOOD.
WHEN YOU GO THROUGH THE TUNNEL THERE IS ONLY ONE SIGN SAYING STANDING THERE
SHOULD HAVE BEEN ONE SAYING LEFT AND RIGHT ALSO
PEOPLE WERE COMING OVER THE TOP. A POLICEMAN RAN ONTO THE PITCH AND STOPPED
THE GAME NOT OTHERS POLICE AND AMBULANCE JUST STOOD THERE EITHER UNWILLING
OR UNKNOWIING.
THERE WAS NO CALL FOR FIRST -AIDERS.
ONE PERSON DID RUN UP THE PITCH TOWARDS NOTTS. THE POLICE MADE A CORDEN.

I GOT THERE AT ABOUT 12.30 WITH MY SONS. WE WENT INTO THE STANDS AND AT THAT
TIME THERE WERE THREE OFFICERS ON THE TERRACE OPPOSITE THE TUNNEL INTO THE
GROUND AND TWO STEWARDS. AFTER A SHORT WHILE THE STEWARDS DISAPPEARED AND
LEFT THE POLICE SO THERE WAS NOBODY THERE TO TELL PEOPLE WERE TO GO OR STOP
PEOPLE GOING IN. THE POLICE THEN DISAPPEARED, SO THERE WAS NO SUPERVISION AT
ALL AFTER A WHILE. THE CROWDS THEN BEGAN TO COME IN AND PEOPLE BEGAN PUSHING
AND SHUVING AND WERE LITERALLY CLIMBING OVER EACH OTHER TO GET TO
THE FRONT OF THE TERRACE. AS I LOOKED OPPOSITE I COULD SEE THAT THE WEST
TERRACE WAS FULL OF PEOPLE AND NO OTHERS COULD GET IN YET THE TWO STANDS
BEHIND THE MIDDLE TERRACE WERE LITERALLY EMPTY. THERE WERE CHILDREN ON THE
MAIN BARRIERS AND SITTING ON ADULTS SHOULDERS.
WHEN THE WHOLE INCIDENT OCCURRED THERE APPEARED TO BE TOTAL LACK OF
COMMUNICATION AND SUPERVISION, THE POLICE HAD LOST CONTROL.

RIGHT BEHIND THE GOALS. LAST YEAR IT WAS FULL BUT WERE SPREAD ACROSS THE
TERRACING BETTER. AS THE GAME STARTED FANS WERE CLIMBING THE FENCES TO GET
ONTO THE PITCH. I THOUGHT AT THIS TIME THAT THEY WERE TRYING TO GET TO WHERE
THERE WAS SOME SPACE. IT WAS WHEN THE GAME WAS STOPPED I REALISED IT WAS MORE
SERIOUS THAN THAT. THE POLICE WERE JUST STANDING THERE THEY DID NOT SEEM KNOW
WHAT TO DO. WHEN SOME OF THE FANS GOT OUT SOME OF THE POLICE REALISED WHAT
HAPPENED AND WENT AND GOT MAKESHIFT STRETCHERS AND PROBABLY SAVED A LOT OF
LIVES. BUT STILL THERE WERE SOME POLICE WHO DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO. IT WAS
CHAOS THEN .THERE WAS NO PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT TO TELL THE CROWD WHAT WAS GOING
ON WHICH WOULD HAVE HELPED.

 THE POLICE CAME AND STOOD FACING THE NORTH TERRACE . THIS WAS BOTH
INTIMIDATING AND UNECCESSARY. THE Y COULD HAVE BEEN PUT TOP BETTER YOUTH.IT
TOOK SOME TIME FOR THE POLICE TO HELP THE CROW TO USE THE ADVERTISING
HOLDINGS AS STRETCHERS. THIS WAS INSTIGATED BY THE CROWD NOT THE POLICE THERE
WAS NO INITIATIUVE SHOWN BY THE POLICE.DOG HANDLERS WERE ALSO PLACE IN FRONT
OF THE NORTH STAND AS THE INCIDENT WAS GOING ON WHICH AGGRIVATED THE
SITUATION EVEN MORE.AS I CAME OUT I DID SAW ISOLATED INCIDENTS OF FANS
PUNCHING POLICE OFFICERS, BUT I THINK THEY WERE CAUSED BY FEAR AND
FRUSTRATION.

INFO      »    ON ROUTE TO THE GROUND THERE WAS A LARGE TRAFIC HOLD UP WHICH I
               THINK COULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PEOPLE ARIVING LATE. I ARRIVED
               OUTSIDE THE GROUND AT ABOUT HALF PAST TWO AND THERE WAS A GREAT
               MASS OF PEOPLE WHO WERE LIKE SUFFLEING. THERE WAS A POLICE OFICER
               AT THE TURNSTILES WHO CHECKED MY HUSBAND TICKET AND LET US
               THROUGH. THERE WAS A STEADY FLOW OF PEOPLE INSIDE OF THE GROUND

TELEPHONE NUMBER GIVEN
THERE APPEARED TO BE TOTAL LACK OF POLICE AND STEWARD SUPERVISION.
WHEN YOU TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE POLICING ON PREVIOUS OCCASSIONS THERE
WAS NONE THIS TIME.
WHEN THE INCIDENT OCCURRED THEY APPEARED NOT TO KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON AND
THEY ALL STOOD ABOUT WATCHING WHAT WAS GOING ON ...THERE WAS NO COMMUNICATION
AT ALL.
I KNOW MY FRIENDS WERE IN PEN 3 AT FIRST BUT THEY MOVED WHEN IT BEGAN TO GET

<< WHO WITH      >>

...WERE STANDING AROUND DOING NOTHING. I FELT THAT        THE CROWD ON THAT DAY WAS
NO DIFFERENT THAN ANY OTHER BIG MATCH CROWD THAT I        HAVE EXPERIENCED OVER THE
PAST 10 YRS. IF THE ORGANISATION HAD BEEN CORRECT         FROM THE START IN TERMS OF
ORDLEY QUES, MORE DIRCECTIONS AS TO WHERE TO GO, I        FEEL THE INCIDENT WOULD
NEVER HAD OCCURRED.

INFO      >>  ARRIVED AT PITCH AT 1445 DUE TO VERY BAD TRAFFIC, WE WENT TO
              SPION KOP END, THERE WERE ALOT OF YOUTHS WITH LIVERPOOL ACCENTS,
              AT THE NOTTINGHAM FOREST END ASKING FOR TICKETS, THERE WAS NO
              PROBLEMS THOUGH THEY DID NOT CAUSE ANY TROUBLE. JUST AFTER THE
              KICK OFF, I COULD SEE A COUPLE OF LIVERPOOL SURPPORTERS ON THE
              PITCH BEHIND THE WEST STAND GOAL POST. AFTER A COUPLE OF MINUTES
              LIVERPOOL PLAYERS...

<< WHO WITH      >>

WERE ATTACKING THE NOTTINGHAM FOREST GOAL. THERE WAS A CORNER AND I THINK IT
WAS PETER BEADSLEY WHO HIT THE CROSS BAR, IT SEEMED THAT THAT IS WHEN THE
TROUBLE REALLY STARTED. I COULD SEE LOTS OF LIVERPOOL SURPPORTS CLIMB OVER
THE FENCE AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS A PITCH INVASION, THEN THE PLAYERS WENT
OFF THE PITCH, IT WAS SOMETIME BEFORE WE REALISED THAT SOMETHING SERIOUS HAD
OCCURRED.
THE P.A. SYSTEM WAS VERY POOR, I ONLY HEARD TWO ANOUCMENTS OVER THE PUBLIC
ADDRESS SYTEM, ONE WAS FOR EVERY ON ETO CLEAR THE PITCH, THE OTHER AT ABOUT
   50 TO TELL YOU TO KEEP YOPUR TICKETS THAT THE MATCHY WAS CANCELLED.
   5N A POLICE MAN OR SOMEONE CAME ROUND WITH A LOUD HAILER, BUT PEOPLE AT THE
Tilt
BACK COULD NOT HAVE HEARD WHAT WAS BEING SAID, I THINK WE ALL SEEING WHAT WAS
HAPPENING OVER IN THE WEST STAND FELT A SENSE OF HOPELESSNESS, NOT ABLE TO
HELP.
I WENT WITH A FAMILY OF FRIENDS

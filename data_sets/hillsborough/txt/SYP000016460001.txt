       Lord Justice Taylor                                               21st April, 1989


       Dear Sir,

       re: Hillsborough disaster public enquiry


       I am the Managing Director of                                      and feel
       I have information which may be of assistance in the above enquiry, which
       you are about to chair.

       I am not a football supporter and have no vested interest in either of the
       teams involved.   Also, I have no connection whatsoever with the Police
       Forces of either Sheffield or Liverpool.

       However I am of the opinion that my observations on that day would be of
       help in this enquiry, a^d should you wish to contact me then please do so.


       Yours

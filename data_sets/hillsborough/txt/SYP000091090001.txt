              On S at u r d ay     15 April       1989   (150489),      due to 2 x 10pm        <1400)     <2200)

              officers        being      posted to work at the FA Cup Semi-Final                   at

              Hillsborough,            I had been pre-warned to work 6pm                  (1800)   to 6a m   <0600)

              (Sunday       16/4/89>         <160489)    at B e n t l e y Police S t at io n on Sub -D iv is io na l

              routine       cover.



              Prior    to     coming      to work     I had been at home during             the a f t e r no o n and   1

              had heard        radio      broadcasts      relating      to problems at the H i ll s bo r ou g h

              Ground.



              I am trained           in procedure        for C as ua l ty Bu re au d u t i e s and having

              a rri v e d   in good        time   for my tour      of duty,         I found a message waiting

              for me to report              s t r ai gh ta wa y to M e x bo r ou g h Sub-Div is io na l
                                                                                                              PAGE
                                                                                                              S3535

H e a d q u a r t e r s where    I w ould be required to work                      in the C as ua l ty Bureau

w hi c h had been set up at E c c l e sf i el d Training Centre                             to    co-ordinate

casualty       i nformation         following           the H i ll s bo r ou g h D i s a s t e r .



I w ould estimate            the    time to bsy\about fc.3Qpm                    (1830)    when      I a r r i v e d at

E cc l e s f i e l d where      I joined a i r o u p          of other          officers and we ware

briefed by Inspector QUINISM,                         whom     1 know,         and whom    1 took       to be      in


charge of the Bureau.                    Lnspector QUIN TO N outlined the                    i nformation such

 s was known anSkmy                r e c o llection        is that he said there were                    in excess

 f 50 dead and tliat d e c e a s e d                casualties we re being                kept    in the

gym n a s i u m at    the ground as a t emporary mortuary.



I n s p e c t o r Q U I N T O N o ut lined that the scene was                     pretty grim and           that

some young        children were also                  involved.         He asked for three               volunteers

to go to the gym with                casualty forms,                in order       that officers           obtain

the fullest          possible       descriptions             of deceased          persons    themselves,

their      clothing and          personal         effects.         Subsequently,           this      information

w o u l d be returned to the C a s u al ty Bu re au to be m at ch ed with                                incoming

e nquiries and des c r i p t i on s              of persons missing               by their       friends      or

relatives.



I volunteered,          t o g e t her wi t h another              policewoman who           I did not know,

but whom       I called                   i/he third volunteer was a />a 1 i c e m a n , again,

who m      I didn't    know,       but    introduced himself as                             we    trave l/ed

together       to the ground             in              car and       reported to the            gymna sium



A ga i n    it is an estimate             but my re col lections are that the time would

now be about 7pm             (1900).           At the gym n a s iu m we made              our way to the only

desk which was          o b viously           the a d mi n i s t r a t i o n    point.     I could see          that a

logging system was               in o peration wit h each body being a l l o c at e d a
                                                                                                   PAGE         £
                                                                                                   S3535

number     in the margin,          together with any          information about            the deceased

w hi ch may      identify them,         in other    cases     there was a d e sc ri pt io n of the

person,        clothing and any other            property.       S i m u i t a n e o u s l y , I looked

ar ou n d the     g ymnasium and took          in the scene.         O b vi ou sl y    it was    chaos     in

some    respects,        due to the sheer         scale of the        casualties and deceased,

but    I was     struck     by the    fact    that there was        order and a system to the

identif ic at io n and security of/ithe deceased.



Near    the desk      I saw an        In/pector who was          identified to me          by another

officer as        Inspector fcffiRLES.           He was organising an d delegating

respo ns ib il it ie s      to officers and was          o bviously      in charge there,



I could see that            d ec eased bodies had been           laid out        in rows and that a

police officer was             in atte nd an ce w i t h each body.           Some     officers were

standing whilst            others were       seated by     ' t h e i r ’ body.    A number       of the

officers were         engaged      in filling      out   the Gen      18 Sud de n Death Report.



iiy two    colleagues and          I made     ourselves     known to Inspector C HA RL ES and

the job w e ’d been given             from C as ua l ty Bureau.



Together        the C a s ua l ty Bureau      d c es cr ip ti on forms were       handed by the

three     of us to each officer              in charge    of a deceased.              In the first

instance        it was     the o f f i c e r ’s r e sp on si bi li ty to fill      in this C as ua lt y

B ur e au form,      but    I could see that        some officers were very young                   in

service        or were     distr es se d themselves,        so   I and my two          colleagues

as si s te d    in various ways.          A common       problem was that eye             colour    of

deceased was missing              from the form.          In a number       of    cases    this was       due

to the eyes having             been    closed.     To    correct    these     it was      n ecessary for

        and myself         to go through each sheet.               Where    the eye       colour was

not    shown             opened the eyelid and            called out the eye            colour whilst
                                                                                           PAGE
                                                                                           S3 33 3

I entered these on the               form.



I am unable       to say       which bodies       this was     necessary for.



A further       omission       on some forms was          that ages were    not shown.      A gain

______ m d    I made a number         of ad di ti on s    to the forms,     w he r eb y we viewed

Po laroid     photos which were           d isplayed of all      the d ec eased and together

we e stimated the ages            of those w hi ch were        unknown.     It was    ne cessary

for us to do this             from the    photographs      because   at about this      time    all

the   bodies were        in    the   process     of being     placed in   ’body b a g s ’ and   made

ready for       id en ti fi ca ti on viewing      fay relatives.



During all       this time       I was aware      that the bodies        of d ec eased had been

laid out      in rows of ten.            1 cannot   say for sure how many         rows of ten

there were,       but my       r ec olle ction   is there were about        eight.      1' am

unable    to say at what          stage during      the    process of adding      eye    colour

and age      estim a t io n that a further          reception of a number        of bodies      came

in.     Again    I cannot       be specific about         the number,     but another     row of

ten was made.         I can say that after           going     the same    routine with these

further      receptions and their            casualty forms,      that there was a total             of

94 bodies       laid out and a c c o un te d for         either by name or description.

Some were       in the    process     of being      identified by relatives.



Our work was       then       completed      in so far as the g ymnasium was          concerned

a nd the three       of us t ravelled back          to E c c l e sf i el d together   to start

processing       the forms.



There    had been a diffi cu lt y with the forms                themselves w hich had not

s e l f - c a r b o n a te d as they should have      done.     It was    n ecessary to

photocopy them all,             to produce s ufficient         copies and    I then s tarted
                                                                                                            PAGE
                                                                                                            S3535

               work matching             them against       incoming      enquiries and descriptions.



           V* O n e , m a t c h I. w$« able to make was of a deceased young boy, John Paul
n              1 Afjr         '                                     --------------------
                  ' 3 L E Y . y I was able
               GILHO                                to m atch a Missing Person Report with a good

               de s c r i p t i o n    provided by a relative          to Woman Police Sergeant

                          (Child Abuse Unit,            W a t h , Near Rotherham),        together w ith the

               d es c r iption form of C as ua l ty Bureau,               whi ch by this time     had been

               t ra ns ferred onto a dry--wipe board.



               This was the             only one which       I was able to match there and then.



               I was able             to throw up a number       of    possibles which       I passed to other

               officers        to do further work on.                I. cannot   recall    the names    of any of

               those      possibles.



               I continued             in this way until       the end of my tour          of duty and    I was

                                      0600 hours    (0600)     Sun d ay    16 April   1989   (160489)

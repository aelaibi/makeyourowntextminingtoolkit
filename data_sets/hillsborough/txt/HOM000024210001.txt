HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY


I confirm our arrangement for you and colleagues to give a
presentation to Lord Justice Taylor about your proposals for
technology to meet the National Membership Scheme under the
Football Spectators Bill, to be given here on 29 November at 11
am.

From our side, there will be present Lord Justice Taylor, his two
Assessors (Mr Brian Johnson, Chief Constable of Lancashire, and
Professor Leonard Maunder, Professor of Mechanical Engineering at
the University of Newcastle upon Tyne), me and Jonathan Sweet (my
assistant).

We have set aside two hours for the presentation. There will be
no problem about letting you have a large room with tables, power
points and a screen to show slides. Let me know if you would
like a projector as well. I mentioned that it would be helpful
if you could let my secretary have in due course the names of
those who will be attending, and the registration number of the
vehicle. Then we will be able to make arrangements for your
admission to the building here, however early you arrive.




                                        R M WHALLEY
                                   Secretary to the Inquiry

    The   three of us also               tra ve ll ed    to the game          t o g e t h e r .We   picked up           the

    go ac h at    1045 hrs        (1045?        at C h i I d w a l 1 Five     W a y s . The coach was         full

    w i t h aro un d 50       persons      on board.

  Once       on the     coach we t rave 11 ed di rectly to                    Sheff i e 1d w i thout

v    s Q lay Wheels L n ,

     n route      the     coach was        de lay ed on the tffig m o to rw ay             by a road

      affic acc ide nt          this      delaye d us for about 20 minutes.                         Just    before we

    akrived      in S h e f f i e l d    the    coach was      stopp ed by the           p o l i c e . An officer

    got   on and said,          that      there sho ul d be no alcohol                 on board and

    ev eryone     should have a ticket.                  I did not see anyone wi t h alcohol                          on

    the   coach and the Poli ceman d i d n ’t searc h                       i t . This     delayed         us for

    abo ut    10 m i n u t e s . The      coach was again s t opp ed by the Pol ic e                        just

    near to the         coach park and an officer                  got      on and spoke wi t h             the

    driver.      I d o n "t know what was               said but     I think        he was just            giving       the

    driver     di rections as            to where       to park    the      coach.     That     d e la ye d us

    about 2 m i n u t e s .

    The   time we ar riv ed at the                 coach park was           1245 h r s .

  Once we got           off   the       coach we w a lk ed to the ground.                  I did not see

  anyone       consuming alcohol                or any drunke ne ss w h i 1st            I was walking.

the    road,      we were      sitting       on the bridge wall.

After about           15 mi nu te s a P o l i c e m a n       came up to us to move off the

wall.       We then w a l k e d over and stood near to the                        turnstiles.          We had

only been sta ndi ng            there wh e n a mo u n t e d officer               told us to get          in the

gr ou n d      if we had a ticket            or    clear      o f f , if we    hadn't        he was quite

rude to us.

I w ou ld       like to say at          this      time   the Police were            telling      everyone       to

st ay on the gro un d side                of the      r o a d . The y didn't        tell      people    to queue

but    just      stay on that          side of the         road.        I did see a lot of             people

di sob ey these           ins tructions        and    cross      back over       the    road to stand by

the wall and also              go    into a shop.          I wo ul d also        like to- say that

whi lst        walkin g    to the gro un d there were                 lots of     people       trying    to buy

tickets         but   I d i d n ’t see any at the e n t r a n c e /

I did not see any ste wards                    at the turnsti>j./s. Once                I had e n ter ed the

gr ou nd       I saw 2 just         inside     selling        p r o g r a m m e s . I also    saw about 8_

I went         to the toilet and then a g a i n w a it ed for                                           this    time

by the ent ranee            to the tunnel            under      the West S t a n d .

I had had no di ff ic u l t y             in finding          my entry point           or getting       into the

gro und and enterin g               via a t u r n s t i l e .

I did see a gate             opened just          to the        right    of the turnstiles,             but    that

was m a nn ed by a stewar d and he was                        only al lo wi ng Pol ic e Off ice rs             in

u n a u th o r is ed entry either            c 1imbi ng the walIs             or jumping        ove r the

turnstiles.

When     I entered         I handed my ticket              in and       I have    lost       the stub.

Once     inside        the groun d          I did not see any signs                 or any     people giving

di rections           onto     the te r r a ci ng      I just     pr esumed the tunnel                 led

onto    the      terraces           becau se    everyone       else was          going    that way. We w a it ed

until a b o " t/1 41 5 hrs              (14-15)           did not show up,                so we wa l k e d along

the tunne              there were           no o b str uc tio ns      in the       tunnel a l t h o u g h      it w

crowded.         I exited from the tunnel and tu r n e d to the                             right       into Peri

T her e were          no Po l i ce     or S t e w ar ds   evident at             this    point.        As soon as            I

en t e r e d    the t e r r a c i n g , I ob se rv ed         it was a l r e a d y full,          so    I tried to

turn a r ou nd a nd            return back down the t u n n e l . This was                     imposs i ble           owing

to the volume             of    people       still     pouring       onto    the terrace          from       it.

I was     just        pushed until           I ended up near           the front          of the       right -h an d

side     of     pen 3 .        At    this    time    it was     r ea so na bl y empty an d all 3 of us

found space            in order        to view the game.              It became more and more

crowded,         u n t i 1 by ab out         1445 it was        packed full,             although       not

da ng e r o u s l y    so.      I was       not subject        to an y      crowd       crush at       that    time.         I

was    still      standi ng wi t h my brother and                     fri ejnd.     I did not witnes s a ny

fights         or dis or de rl y beh av iou r at              that    po/nt.

Just after Li verpool                  came     onto    the    p i t c h / the    crowd surged          forwards

but did not            return back as             it would      nor mal ly h a d .        This     left me and all

those     near        to me     crushed and unable              to br e at h properly.             From this

point     onwards         I and all          those     in my    immediate area s t art ed shouting

a nd screa min g          for       help.

The ^i.r.^ di rect ly in front                    of me   passed out and a man was                      trying        to

hold her         up.    I couldn* t see             thei r faces       but       the girl    s 1 i pped       r i ght

I was     unable to move my                  left arm     it was       trapp ed down by my s i d e . The

same ma n that was                  holdi ng   the girl        up told me          to lean on him but                I

d i d n ’t because he was al r e a d y s tr ug gl in g                   to keep the         girl       up.    All       I

can say about            him was        that he was white,               stoc ky build 5'8,              mou se y

, br o w n short        h a i r . I cannot      remember what           he was w e a r i n g .

  At    this     stage    I could see my b r o t h e r had been                  pushed down a few steps

  in front me and                          was a few behind m e .                        a p p e ar ed    to be

  al ri g h t    but    I could hear                    s crearm ng .

  A fter    that       it got worse and worse              for several minutes.                  I did not see

  any    barrier        break.      I did see       that    some_ 4 |ieopjb/nfear the front and to

  my    left had m a n a g e d      to get a gate open on#D                 the    pitch,      but a Police

  officer        kept    closing        it a nd wo ul dn' t    let      them onto        the pitch u n t i 1

  ab ou t 5 minut es           later w h e n he must        have     re al is ed what was h a p p e n i n g .

  S o o n after        this    the m a t c h was stopp ed a n d           the    crush became            less

  intense.         I looked over           to my    left and a bo ut 5 metres away                       I saw some

  bodies        of men    lying     on top of each other.

  As/ the       crush became        easier      I moved to the            fence    separa ti ng P en 3 with

   en 2 a n d I was .helped over                  into that.       We     then went       to go onto the

  pitch but        it was       very busy with the dead and                     injured being            taken onto

  the    pitch throu gh           it.

  I then went           onto the        pitch and sat down.               I was    in a severe            state    of

  shock and        I just st a r t e d       crying.       A few     people       came over a nd helpe d me

  over     towards       the S o u th S t a n d where       the Notti ngham suppor te rs w e r e .

  Some     of them then gave us some drinks.

       haven't     seen the girl           that    past out since and              I don't       know      if she

  is dead or alive.              H o w e v e r , we did get an a d v e r t i s i n g        b o a r d and use          that

  as a s tretcher             to assist.

  I left the ground at a b o u t                1625 hrs      (1625).           I left of my own accord.

 After      the game had been s to ppe d the                  police a c t e d q u i c k l y in a s s i s t i n g

  the    crowd.

  I think        the    cause was        that   there were       just      t oo ma n y    people a l l o w e d

  th r o u g h the tunnel and             if the side       fences were           not there we would

  have     been able          to spre ad o u t .

  I did not witne ss any                 criminal   offences         or    person stealing               property

            After      leaving the        groun d we went         to the    coach and   then returne d home.

           INCIDENT HILLSBOROUGH FOO ■BAL.I          fiRnUND.

           15 APRIL 1989



           At 9.00 a.m., on Saturday,        15 April       1989,    I paraded for duty at

           Ecclesfield Police Station,        and was subsequently conveyed to

           Hillsborough football ground for briefing                   re the Semi-Final.                I

           arrived at the ground together with other officers at ap pr ox imately

           9.40 a.m.         At this time there appeared to be very little activity

           around the ground apart from that of Police Officers.

           Briefing for the event subsequently took                  place       in the North Stand at

           approximately 10.00 a.m.

           My duties that day were         plain clothes foot patrol                 in Middlewood Road,

           together with Temporary Detective Constable O ’Brien,                          paying

           particular attention to teams of pick pockets and theft of and from

           motor vehicles.         My supervisory officer being               Inspector Scaife.

           At the conclusion of the briefing TDC O'Brien and myself made our way

           along Penistone Road and into Parkside Road,                     this would have been

           about      11.00 a.m.

           I saw that within the last hour there had certainly been an increase
                                                                               PAGE
                                                                               R 159

in pedestrian activity with large groups         of youths wandering around

aimlessly with a few shouting the usual         football   chants.     We both

made our way along Middlewood Road in the direction of the hospital.

When nearing the Texaco    petrol   station we decided to walk back            in the

opposite direction towards Hillsborough         shopping   centre.

At about    IE midday as we approached the junction of Middlewood Road

and Wadsley Lane,    our attention was caught by Police Sergeant

          who was on mobile Transit   patrol.     He stated that one of the

pubs situated further up Wadsley Lane was full to capacity and that

there was a large number of people outside on the frontage and road

drinking beer.     He appeared concerned that they may get out of hand.

Also situated at this junction are a number of shops where a large

number of Liverpool    supporters had gathered for what        can only be

described as a drinking session.      There were numerous       cans of beer

and lager being and had been consumed.          I continued to walk along

Middlewood Road and into the shopping      centre.     Whilst walking along

this road I again saw large groups of youths drinking from cans of

beer and lager.     Those that I did not see drinking        I could hear       pass

comments as to "Where    is the nearest   public house?"

Once TDC O ’Brien and myself had patrolled the precinct,             we decided to

visit Parkside Section House via the park grounds.           At about

•1.00 p.m. - 1.15 p.m. whilst walking along Parkside Road,             I was

approached every five yards by a Liverpool        supporter asking for a

ticket.    On eventually reaching Parkside Section House,            I saw a

large number of youths standing behind the Section House and around

vehicles in the parking bay situated adjacent         to the Section House,

the majority of whom were drunk and were subsequently removed.                 Again

by the accent    I believe these to be Liverpool      supporters.

I recall that whilst    inside the box/Section House       I heard footsteps

on the roof.     On inspecting this I saw about four youths          to be

                                                                                       2
                                                                            PAGE
                                                                            R 1 59

standing on top of the Police Station Station drinking           cans of beer/

lager.   Needless   to say,   I took prompt and necessary action and

removed the youths who were again from Liverpool.            Whilst engaged in

this   I saw one youth emerge from the     rear of the building holding a

can of lager   in one hand and holding his exposed person         in the other,

intending to walk along the road in this manner.            This youth was

spoken to and advised accordingly.

TDC O'Brien and myself    thought   it best to inform ground control         of

the situation at the Section House,      so that further attention         could

be paid to it.

We were some fifteen minutes at the box before        resuming    patrol    in

Middlewood Road.

At 2.15 p.m. TDC O'Brien and myself      returned to the Police area at

the/rear of the North Stand via the Penistone Road entrance.               Whilst

e r f route we were again approached by dozens of Liverpool fans looking

 or tickets.     On arriving at the gym I mealed.

At about 2.45 p.m.    I resumed patrol together with TDC O'Brien and

^regether with Police Constables Hiles and Moulding we made our way

along Penistone Road into Vere Road and into Leppings Lane.            This was

the first and only time during the day that      I vi si to r this side of
                                                         /      m
the ground and to be honest,      I was taken back by Jfne sight.    The

crowd appeared to be sol yd from                               to near the

centre of Leppings Lariat     The first thing   I said was., "Where are all

the bobbies,   there's Jnardly anybody there."      I saw numerous     people

climbing over the tarps of the turnstiles and the few Police Officers

that I saw appeared? to be doing nothing about       it.    My main

observation at thi/s point was the lack of Police          presence.   I couldn't

unde r stand how suJch a large   crowd could have   possibly gat he re d ^ ^ ^ ^
                                                                             PAGE
                                                                             R '159

cordon.     It did not however    cross my mind that       people may be injured

as a result of such a crowd forming.

We continued to walk       past Leppings Lane and through the car park

situated in Hills bo ro ug h Park,     intending to go back into the precinct

in Middlewood Road.

It was whilst walking       in the park that    I decided to listen in on the

channel    used by ground control whilst Policy Constable Moulding

monitored the C.I.D.       channel.   I recalX^ffearing at about 3.00 p.m.        the

request for an ambulance,       the reports of somebody seriously         injured.

Throughout the following five minutes or so there seemed to be chaos

and confusion.     The transmissions were       clear,    but everybody seemed to

be requesting ambulances at the same time.           I recall    seeing two or

three travelling along Penistone Road.           To be honest,   at this time I

thought somebody was over reaching until          I heard a voice on the radio

who I recognised to be Chief Inspector Sumner who stated that there

were a number of bodies and something about a temporary mortuary.                 On

hearing this all four of us immediately returned to the gymnasium.

On my arrival my stomach churned as I saw them bringing             in the first

of the bodies on advertising boards.        One after the other for some few

minutes    I was in shock.     I just stood there saying nothing,         doing

nothing.    I recall   seeing six Liverpool     supporters    carrying a dead

body into the gym,       three of which were    crying.    As they got to the

door the body just dropped off the board.           It was on seeing this that

I tried to pull myself together.          I do not know where TDC O ’Brien had

got to or the other officers.

I grabbed hold of a board and ran onto the pitch with the

supporters.     again,    I was in disbelief.    I saw people still    being

pulled out of the West Stand some unconscious,            but the majority

appeared dead.    I just did not know what to do.          I saw people    injured,

people dead and people in grief.         I at first tried to see to all
                                                                                             PAGE
                                                                                             R159

        three at once.       I recall most    if not all    of^^fhe injured were being

        seen to by ambulance       crew, Police Officers and St. John's.           I

        resigned myself to removing thos^'who were obviously dead from the

        pitch.    I recall   there werfg J ^efrgsJ, f-ans still   chanting    obscenities as

        bodies were being      carried in fro.nt of the S p i o n :Kop.      This was soon

        to stop.

        I carried some three or four bodies from the pitch.                  I recall

        thinking    I was fortunate to be in plain clothes,           seeing    the abuse and

        bad feelings being directed towards the uniform lads.                  In most       cases

        understandable as a grieving heart          sees no barriers.        Each journey to

        the gym the amount of bodies         increased two fold.       I recall when I

        brought in my last body,         just standing and looking,       thinking      that this

        should not have happened.          I was upset,    confused and did not know what

        to do next.       At this time    I saw that   I was not by myself.

        I eventually directed my attention to assisting the uniform Police

        Officers with the searching and identification of the bodies.                    I

        assisted some three or four officers           in this task.    I cannot say that

        I can give any descriptions of these bodies.               I merely as sisted the

        uniformed officers who       completed the reports.

        I was subsequently conveyed to Hamm er to n Road Police S ta tion where,

        together with other officers,         I took missing      person reports from

        relatives and friends.       It was only at this stage that          I recalled any

        descriptions of the bodies         I had handled.    This was disturbing

        knowing that      the person they were looking for was        in fact dead,          but

        still    having   to complete the report.

        At 1.00 a.m.      that morning the temporary enquiry room was           closed.       I

        was subsequently conveyed to         Ecclesfield Police S ta tion where          I

        signed off duty.

           INCIDENT HILLSBOROUGH F O OT BA L L GROUND

      (    15 APRIL       1989

opposite direc tio n towards H i l l s b o r o u g h shopping         centre.

At about    12 midda y as we a p p r o a c h e d the junction of M i d d l e w o o d Road

and W ads le y Lane,      our a t t e n t i o n was    caught by Police S er g ea n t

lager.   Needless to say, I took prompt and necessary action and

removed the youths who were again from Liverpool.    Whilst engaged in

this I saw one youth emerge from the rear of the building holding a

can of lager in one hand and holding his exposed person in the other,

intending to walk along the road in this manner.    This youth was

spoken to and advised accordingly.

TDC O'Brien and myself thought it best to inform ground control of

the situation at the Section House, so that further attention could

be paid to it.

We were some fifteen minutes at the box before resuming patrol in

Middlewood Road.

At 2.15 p.m. TDC O'Brien and myself returned to the Police area at

the rear of the North Stand via the Penistone Road entrance.    Whilst

en route we were again approached by dozens of Liverpool fans looking

for tickets.     On arriving at the gym I mealed.

At about 2.45 p.m. I resumed patrol together with TDC O'Brien and

together with Police Constables Hiles and Moulding we made our way

along Penistone Road into Vere Road and into Leppings Lane.    This was

the first and only time during the day that I visited this side of

the ground and to be honest, I was taken back by the sight.    The

crowd appeared to be solid from the turnstiles 1-16, to near the

centre of Leppings Lane.

It did not however cross my mind that people may be injured




                                                                                  a

                                                                                           R159
as a result of such a crowd forming.

We    continued to walk       past Leppings Lane a nd th ro ug h the            car    park

situated    in H i l l s b o r o u g h Park,    intending to go back       into the     precinct

in Mi d dl e wo od Road.

It was whilst w al ki ng        in the park that           I d ecided to listen       in on the

channel    used by ground         control whilst Poli ce Const abl e M o ul di ng

monito re d the C.I.D.        channel.         I recall    hearing at about 3.0 0 p.m.           the

request for an ambulance,             the reports of somebody seriously                injured.

Throughout     the following         five minutes         or so there seemed to be         chaos

and confusion.        The transmissions were               clear,    but e verybody seemed to

be requesting a m b u la n ce s at the same time.               I recall    seeing two or

three t ra velling along Penistone Road.                    To be honest,    at this time         I

thought so me bo dy was over          reaching until         I heard a voice on the           radio

who    I recognised to be Chief            Inspector Sumn er who         stated that there

were a number of bodies and something about a t emporary mortuary.                               On

hearing this all        four of us immediately returned to the gymnasium.

On my arrival my st omach churned as I saw them bringing                        in the first

of the bodies       on a d ve rt is in g boards.      One after the other        for some few

minutes    I was    in shock.        I just stood there         saying nothing,        doing

nothing.    I recall      seeing     six Liverpool        supporters     carrying a dead

body    into the gym,       three of which were            crying.    As they got to the

door the body just dropped off the board.                      It was on seeing this that

I tried to pull myself            together.        I do not know where TDC O' B ri en had

got to or the other officers.

I grabbed hold of a board and ran onto the                     pitch with the

supporters.        again,    I was    in disbelief.         I saw people still        being

pulled out of the West Stand some unconscious,                       but the ma jo ri ty

appeared dead.       I just did not know what to do.                   I saw people     injured,

people dead and        people     in grief.        I at first tried to see to all

three at once.         I recall most           if not all    of the injured were        be-ing



                                                                                                 9

        seen to by ambulance        crew,   Police O f fi c er s and St. J o h n ’s.     I

        resigned myself to removing those who were              obviou sl y dead from the
                                %


        pitch.    I recall   there were Forest       fans still      chanting o b sc en it ie s as

        bodies were being      carried      in front of the Sp io n Kop.          This was        soon

        to stop.

        I carried some three or four bodies from the                 pitch.      I recall

        thinking    I was fortunate to be in plain clothes,               seeing the abuse and

        bad feelings being directed towards              the un iform    lads.     In most        cases

        understandable as a grieving heart            sees no barriers.          E a c h jo urney to

        the gym the amount of bodies           increased two fold.          I recall w he n        I

        brought    in my last body,      just standing and      looking,      t hinking      that this

        should not have happened.            I was upset,    confused and did not know what
  ('
        to do next.      At this time       I saw that    I was not by myself.

        I eventually directed my at te n ti on to assist in g            the u nif or m Police

        Officers with the searching and           identi fi ca ti on of the bodies.           I

        a s sis te d some three or four officers          in this task.       I cannot     say that

        I can give any descriptions of these             bodies.      I m e r el y a ss i s t e d the

        uniformed officers who        completed the       reports.

        I was su bsequently conveyed to H a m m er to n Road Police S t a t io n where,

        together with other officers,           I took mi ss in g    person reports from

        relatives and friends.        It was only at this stage that              I recalled any

  ^     descriptions of the bodies           I had handled.     This was      di st urbing

        knowing that the      person they were       looking for was       in fact dead,          but

        still    having to complete the report.

        At   1.00 a.m.   that morning the temporary enquiry             room was      closed.      I

        was subsequently      conveyed to E c cl es fi el d Police S t a t i on where         I

        signed off duty.

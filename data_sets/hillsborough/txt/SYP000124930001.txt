 THE PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT SYSTEM WAS DIABOLICAL, AS IT WAS THE PREVIOUS Y E A R .

 LACK OF COMMUNICATION TO THE CROWD INFORMING THEM OF THE GRAVITY OF THE

SITUATION.       NO EXCUSE BECAUSE THE OFFICER WHO STOPPED THE MATCH WAS WELL

 AWARE OF THE SITUATION.

 NO MEDICAL FACILITIES.           BILLBOARDS WERE USED FOR STRETCHERS.              THEY SHOULD

 HAVING BEEN THE PREVIOUS YEAR TO HILLSBOROUGH,                THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR QUEUEING

 OUTSIDE THE GROUND THIS YEAR WERE TERRIBLE.                 LAST YEAR WE            STOPPED BY

 POLICE A HALF MILE FROM THE GROUND                ON ARRIVAL TO THE GBOUND WE WERE AGAIN

 ASKED TO PRODUCE OUR TICKETS.               WE WERE THEN PUT INTO        ERLY QUEUES &

 SUPERVISED BY THE MOUNTED POLICE.               H O W E V E R , THIS YEAir WE WERE NOT ASKED FOR

 OUR TICKETS AND WERE ALLOWED INTO THE VICINITY OF THE GROUND AND THERE WAS

 NO ATTEMPT BY POLICE TO PUT US INTO ORDERLY QUEUES.

 I WOULD LIKE TO ADD THAT THE ORDINARY PC WAS DOING HIS BEST UNDER

 I ® FT I C U L T CONDITIONS,   BUT IT WAS APPARENT THAT THE WHOLE EXERCISE LACKED

 LEADERSHIP.

 (i)         CRUSHING OUTSIDE WAS OBVIOUSLY HARD TO HANDLE,       THERE BEING SO MANY

PEOPLE IN SUCH A SMALL AREA, BUT THE POLICE D I D N ’T SEEM TO HAVE A

 STRATEGY.

 0})         THE POLICE OFFICER WITH LOUD HAILER SAID THE GAME HAD BEEN DELAYED

 15 MINUTES ATTEMPTING TO ELIVIATE PROBLEM.

 < ii i )    FANS & POLICE WERE RIPPING ADVERTISING B O ^ D S OFF & CARRYING INJURED

 PEOPLE ACROSS GROUND.        MEANWHILE I COULD NOT SEjTWHY THERE WAS A NEED

 FOR SO MANY POLICE OFFICERS ACROSS FIELD.           /

 (iv >       IT SEEMED TO TAKE A LONG TIME FOR / m       AMBULANCE TO ARRIVE.     THE

 ST. JOHNS AMBULANCE WERE VERY YOUNG AND WHILST THEY DID THEIR BEST

THERE WAS TOO MANY TO COPE WITH.

CLEARANCE OF THE PITCH.                  ^

JUDICIAL     INQUIRY?

(i)          TICKET ALLOCATION - LIVERPOOL AS EVERYBODY KNOWS REGULARLY ATTRACT

AVERAGE GATE         OF AROUND 36,000.   MORE THAN NOTTS FOREST YET

 < ii )          LIVERPOOL SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN SPION KOP END           WHICH WAS AT THE TIME

 FULL BUT THERE WAS PLENTY OF ROOM TO M O V E .

 (iii)           HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM IS BADLY DESIGNED.           ALL LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS

 HAD TO GO THROUGH TURNSTILES AT LEPPINGS LANE WHETHER THEY HAD

 TICKETS FOR TERRACES OR NORTH STAND.

 (xv)            A DECISION SHOULD HAVE BEEN MADE TO DELAY KICK           OFF BY 30 MINUTES.

 PREVENTING THEM FROM GETTING ONTO THE PITCH,      IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT

 HE THOUGHT IT WAS A PITCH INVASION, HE ONLY DELAYED THEM FOR A SHORT

 TIME,   IT WAS NOT A DELIBERATE ACT TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM RECEIVING

 TREATMENT.

DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS H A N D L E D ,

AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

THERE WERE OFFICERS STANDING AROUND THE PENALTY BOX AREA IN FOU                CKETS, SOME

OF THEM DRINKING TEA. THE SUPERVISION WAS NON-EX ISTANT TO DIREC               EM. THERE

WERE NO INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN OVER THE TANNOY.          THE POLICE D I D N ’T REALISE THE

SERIOUSNESS OF THE INCIDENT AT FIRST. AS SOON AS THEY DID REALISE,             SOME OF

THEM STARTED TO PULL AT THE FENCE.       THERE WAS A LACK OF COMMUNICATION FROM THE

POLICE IN THE GROUND TO POLICE OUTSIDE, BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE STILL SURGING IN.

ALSO AFTERWARDS THERE MUST OF BEEN A TOTAL BREAKDOWN OF COMMUNICATION.

^THERE      ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU F XEEL IS V!              THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

I'VE GOT TO SAY THERE WAS A LACK OF SUPERVISION AND COMMUNIC                  ITHIN THE

POLICE FORCE THERE WERE SO MANY UNSUPERVISED POLICEMEN THEY                   HAVE BEEN

DEPLOYED B E T T E R .

SPECTATORS SHOULD HAVE BEEN INFORMED BETTER AS TO WHAT WAS GOING ON VIA THE

PUBLIC ADDRESS S Y S T E M .

I ALSO THINK THAT THE SEGREGATION        PENS     SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM INSIDE THE

TERRACING AREAS SO THE CROWDS CAN SPREAD AND DISTRIBUTE THEMSELVES

COMFORTABLY.

!/j(l W A S N ’T ANY DOGS USED OUTSIDE THE GROUND TO CONTROL THE CROWDS I ’VE

POLICED SEVERAL GAMES AT OLD TRAFFORD AND MAIN ROAD DURING THE 7 0 'S AND

WITHOUT DOGS FOOTBALL MATCHES CANNOT BE POLICED AT ALL PROPERLY.

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY.
 1.   THE D E S I G N   OF THE T U R N S T I L E   ENTRANCES AT L E P P I N G S   LANE COULD BE A FACTOR

                         ANS,    COUPLED WITH THE LACK OF            DIRECTIONS      OF   POLICE   TO FORM

 ORDERLY QUEUES.

 2.   CHOICE OF VENUE WAS TO BE A FACTOR E S P E C I A L L Y HAVING S I N C E S E E N OLD

 TRAFFORD GROUND, MANCHESTER WHICH HAD FAR BETTER FACILITIES.                               WITH THE

 KNOWLEDGE OF A MASSIVE FAN SUPPORT FOR LIVERPOOL TO HAVE THE MATCH AT

 HILLSBOROUGH AND GIVE THEM THE LEPPINGS LANE END WAS A POOR DECISION.

 YES BECAUSE OF THE CROWD.

AT THE TURNSTILE AREA,     THERE WERE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE,   WE WERE PENNED IN

BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE GATES WENT AROUND AREA A.      THERE WERE FATHERS AND SONS

 IN THE CRUSH,    AND THE KIDS WERE GETTING CRUSHED AND HAD TO BE LIFTED UP AND

PASSED OVER PEOPLE'S HEADS.      I AM NEARLY 14 STONE AND I WAS ABLE TO LIFT MY

FEET OFF THE GROUND AND I WAS BEING MOVED AROUND WITH THE CROWD.          THERE WAS

NO ORGANISATION AT ALL, WITH THE POLICE.      THE SITUATION WAS OUT OF HAND AT

    THERE WAS A TOTAL LACK OF COMMUNICATION WITHIN THE POLICE.           THERE WERE

    OFFICERS OUTSIDE THE GROUND WHO WERE ILLINFORMED OF EVENTS INSIDE THE

    GROUND.

    I WAS ON THE PITCH FOR ABOUT AN HOUR, AND THE THING THAT STRUCK ME THE MOST

    WAS THE LACK OF URGENCY WITH ALL THE OFFICIALS.          THERE WERE FANS CARRYING

    INJURED PEOPLE AND TRYING TO GET THROUGH THE LINE OF OFFICERS ACROSS OF THE

    HALF WAY LINE.

 THE POLICE WERE VERY SLOW IN GETTING PEOPLE OUT.        NOBODY TOOK CHARGE OF T HE

POLICE AND ORGANISED THEM PROPERLY.        WHEN ONE OF THE FIRST FANS/HAD GOT OVER

THE FRONT FENCE, A PC WENT UP TO HIM AND REALLY STARTED SHOVING HIM AND

PUSHING HIM AROUND     (THIS WAS ABOUT 3.05)   (1505).   ABOUT 3.10     (1510) A SERGEANT

JOGGED SLOWLY ACROSS THE PITCH AND BROUGHT BACK ONE STRETCHER.               HE HAD NO

SENSE OF URGENCY.      THE FANS WERE DOING MORE TO HELP THAN THE POLICE,            SOME

POLICE OFFICERS WERE PULLING PEOPLE OUT AND ADMINISTERING FIRST AID, SOME

POLICE OFFICERS,     THE ONES THAT CAME OUT ONTO THE HALFWAY LINE WERE UNAWARE OF

WHAT WAS HAPPENING.      I SPOKE TO SOME OF THEM AND THEY SAID THEY HAD BEEN

BROUGHT ON FOR CROWD TROUBLE.       THEY COULD HAVE BEEN USED TO GET PEOPLE OUT AND

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 YES.     I FELT THERE WAS A LACK OF SUPERVISION OUTSIDE THE GROUND, LACK OF

POLICE CONTROL OUTSIDE THE GATES,          THE/WHOLE OF THE LEPPINGS LANE END.              THERE

SHOULD HAVE BEEN SOME TYPE OF FILTER SYSTEM.                 THERE IS ONLY ONE ROAD IN AND

J P     OF THE GROUND SO PERHAPS ANOTHER GROUND SHOULD HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED FOR

THE MATCH.

 NO.

 G53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY jfiE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 YES.       IT APPEARED TO BE UTTER CHAOS,   THE P O V X E   DID NOT SEEM TO KNOW WHAT

 TO DO.       I FEEL THERE WERE NOT ENOUGH EME       ENCY SERVICES PRESENT AT THE GROUND,

 THE AMBULANCES WERE NOT ALLOWED TO GO         CROSS THE PITCH, THEY HAD TO DRIVE

*     jND   THE GROUND WHICH PROBABLY CO     TIME.     THE LOUDSPEAKERS SHOULD HAVE BEEN

 USED MORE TO ANNOUNCE TO THE FAW5 THAT AN EMERGENCY SITUATION WAS GOING ON.

 THE SEGREGATION PLAN WAS/TOTALLY WRONG AND PERHAPS THIS

just     a mas s . a sea of               people.           1 would        think        over          over 300 0 and             that

was at £. 40 pm           (1440)        and a lot of               p& 6 pie were              still      i n the      pub,,

T here       just w a s n ’t enough              turnstiles.              There       was       only 2. o r 3 m o u n ted

pani ck because             of their         inadequacies.                 The      crush            in t h i s     crowd was

mass i v e     and     increasing,,          and         people were           be g i n n i n g       pani c k .      A number             of

smaller        kids     had    passed        out         and were     passed overhead,                        out    of    the

crowd to the            side.        T e n s i o n was also           increasing                as      it was       getting

near     to kick        off    time and           the      crowd wasn't moving,,                         There were           no

s tewards about             to help w ith the                 crowds       and      people were                climbi^nci o v e r

the walls.             After about           15 minutes             I got       t h ro u g h t h e t u r n s t i 1 e          just

by brute        force,        because        it would appear                that        the          crush had        decreased

to a marginal             degree,,        Once           through,,    the       crush          had gone and               1 had

time     to bend down and tie my shoelaces                                 .

At    no time        did    1 see any gate            open other          than       the    turnstiles,              where

the    ste ward took all             of my ticket.               The worst           part       of the whale              story

is the        fact    that    betw e e n    the    turnstiles           and the turtle!                      the     terraces

there was           no official          presence,         stewards           police             or anyone,           nor

were    there any           notice       boards.        By that        time     the    players w ould                be on

the    pitch and there was a surge                         through the          tunnel          but    not an out            of

order     surge,,          If there       had been semi            o f f icials       at    the tunnel,              they

could have           d i r ected    fans    elsewhere w hen             the     pen 3 4 4 were                 full.

When    I was        t h r oug h tha      tunneI      there was         no    fan disorder              and     I knew

that    there would           be    others       coming       behind me         so    1 pushed          forward

away    from the           back    to get a better             viewing        position as              central

as    possible        .     The    crush was       great and           inc r e a s i n g    all       the    time,

nobody        could move          the i r arms and there was                  certainly           no d r i nking           in

the    crowd.         Pani ck was         sett i ng     i n as     people were             having       di f f i c u 11y

breathing          and were        shouting       to those at           the     back       to    push back           and

stop more           people    coming       in.     I was       unaware        that any           barriers          had

broken at          the time        and    it was      o'                                                rowds        had

and    crush be came          so    great       I got      s,urnea a r o u r m ana          cquiq m o v e , to see

the    pitch.         All    I could hear was               people      shouting           and sc reaming             for

help and to be              let    out   and shouting            for    the     gate       onto       the    pitch to be

opened.            I also    saw    people       being      lifted up         into     the       stand.         The

expres s i o n s      on the / a c e s      of those          in the      stand show ed how bad                      it

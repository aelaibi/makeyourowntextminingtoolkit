     they were           j u st      climbing              o ve r     the    fences.              As    I got        half       way    across

     the     p i t c h a fe w L i v e r p o o l                fans      ran      passed         towards         the H o p a n d        started

     taunting           the     Nottingham                 Forest        F an s .         Myself        a n d P O L PC W e l c h            started

     to    go    towards          them         to    bring          t h e m a way.             One     fa n    started          to

     run    b a ck      and     was       tackled           by a       policeman and                 led awa y,           the    others

     followed.                I was        then        directed             by P O L P S J e s s o p ,           wh o     was    in    control

     of    my    serial,          to      get       t he    f an s     1/6 go b a ck t o w a r d s the L e p p i n g s L n

     terraces.                It w a s         still        not/clear             what      was      happening.                 I then        saw

     some       fans     l y in g      on the          flo«fr h a v i n g           difficulty              breathing.                I started

     trying        to    help        the       f a n s ./        Someone          said,        ’T h e r e ’s d e a d

\x   people        at    the      front."             /£ t h e n       saw       stretchers            going      passed         with       f an s     on

     with       covers        over        them/but             I could           see     that     their        f a c es

     were       p u rp l e.




     I w as      again        told        to    get        the      fans     to     go    back       towards         the      terraces.                I

     carried          on h e l p i n g         the     fans         l ying       on the        fl o o r .      Other       fans       were

     tearing          down      the       hoardings              and     using         t h e m as      stretchers.                   I tried         to

     get    people        to m o v e           to    th e      sides        of    the     pitch        so     that      the     stretchers

                                                                                                                                S1868

could      get    through,          a    lot      of    the     f an s      w o u l d n ’t mov e,            they wanted          to

shout      an d argue.



A   sergeant          then     came      up a n d a s k e d me              to    help        him      to    c lear    a tunnel         for

stretchers            to   get    out       of    the       ground.              As       I was       going    to     help      I saw a

man      laid    on the        f lo o r ,     his      f a c e wa s      purple            w i t h s i c k all        over      it a n d

another         man    trying       to      revive          him.         I went            with       the    sergeant,          close      to

the      police       control       room and            helped         to    keep a way                clear     for    stretchers.

Numerous         stretchers             were      brought          Ufrough            by    firemen.



When      it a p p e a r e d     that       theyf*njured a n d                dead         had    been       cleared        I went

b a ck    onto    the      pitch a n ^ a s              told       to m a k e         a    line       with    the     other

officers         across        t/e / e n t r e         of    the     pitch.




It was       then a n n o u n c e d         that       the    ga m e     wa s     going          to    be a b a n d o n e d .       The

g r o u n d was       cleared.           I then         we nt,       under        the       direction           of    Inspector

Booth and Sergeant                  Jessop,            to     Pennistone              R d to w h e r e        the     buses      were

being      lo a ded.           When      the      area        wa s    cleared             Iw e nt     back     to     the    north

stand      for a d e b r i e f          and      to    be     stood      down.




I then       went      back      to W o o d s e a t s         Pol    Stn where I went                    off    d u t y at       7pm.

        Thank you for your letter dated 23rd May.

 to the police assisting in Justice Taylor's Inquiry and I have provided all
 documents requested by the police with regard to Sheffield Wednesday Football
 Club.

      In view of the above the Trustees do not wish to offer any further
 submissions to the Inquiry. However, if we can be of any further assistance
 please do not hesitate to contact me.


                                               Yours sincerely,

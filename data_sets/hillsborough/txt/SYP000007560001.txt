                  Fu rth er    to the s ta te me nt s         I made       dated 5 May         1989      <050589)      and 7

                  S e p te mb er    1989   (070989)      I wou ld       now     like to says-               I en ter ed      the

                  gro und via Ga t e *C * by the Le pp i n g s Lane                      turnstiles.           I was with

                 G r a h a m R O B E R T S at   this    time.        We were         in the    crowd enteri ng              the ground

                  via this         gate and we wo uld          be quite         near     to the front.             I was      still

                  with him as we en te re d             the tunnel            that    leads    to the        pens.     At the

                  start      of the tunnel        eve ryone was w a lk in g al t h o u g h               it was      very     crowded.

                 As we went          throug h the       tunnel       the      pace    increased and when              I got to

                 the end       I was almos t         running      due      to the      people       behind     pushing.            Whilst

                  coming      throug h the       tunnel       I became         se pa ra te d   from Graham.            As     I came

                  out      of the tunnel        into    pen 3     I looked a r o u n d and             I just      caught a

                  glimpse      of Graham.         I was       then    pushed down the               pen towards        the front

                 and       I stopped about        15 feet       from the fence.                I did not         see Gra ha m
                                                                                                            PAGE       2

             a g a i n and e ve nt u a l l y wh e n the    pressure     in the     pen eased.       I went     out

             back    th rou gh the    tunnel.

             In the state me nt       I made      on 3 . 3 . 8 9   (050589),     the    last   line of the

             stat em en t when     I said,       "the   last time      I saw Gr a h a m R O BER TS was      prior

             to en tering      the t u nn el "    I meant      that was    the    last time      I spoke    to him.

             The    last time    I actually        saw him w a s as       I said       in the st atement     dated

             7.9.89     (070989)     wh e n   I caught a gl imp se        of hi m as      I en ter ed the     pen in

             the    position    I marked       on the     plan.

           BRIEFING NOTE ON HILLSBOROUGH

                                YBF/3341/89


1.    ISSUE

1.1   Following the recent committal of Duckenfield and Murray to the Crown
      Court on counts of manslaughter and misconduct in a public office, ACC
      Daines of the South Yorkshire Police has written to the Casework Directorate
      at York to ask if the Director will be reviewing the case to determine whether
      the CPS should now take over the proceedings and conduct the prosecution.

1.2   He expects that the HFSG will make further requests for material from the
      archives under SYP control and he considers it inappropriate to give this
      disclosure if it was our intention to take over the case.

1.3   In the event that we do not intervene, the police wish our advice on how to
       respond to HFSG requests for further disclosure. See letter of 21 July 1999
       attached at Annex A.

1.4   The HFSG have written to York and requested our views on the custody of the
      archive held by the SYP now that the case has been committed. They invite us
      to advise the SYP to surrender the possession of the archive, and to inform
      them of any disagreement we may have with their legal arguments. They
      enclose a copy of their letter to the solicitors acting for the Chief Constable
      where they repeat their views that the archive should not be held by the SYP.
      Their letter of 22 July 1999 is attached at Annex B.

2.    ACTION REQUIRED

2.1    A substantive response is required to the linked requests of ACC Daines and
      of the HFSG. As the decision on non intervention in the private prosecution
      was taken by the Director Casework, he should have the opportunity to
      consider the level at which this decision should be taken.

2.2   Holding letters were sent to the police and the HFSG on 23 July.

3.    TIMING

3.1   We have been informed that Mr Justice Hooper, the trial judge, has a PDH
      listed for 3 September 1999. He has had the trial listed for 8 weeks in June
      and July 2000.

3.2   The HFSG expect a comprehensive reply from the police by 6 August 1999
      and have asked us to deal with their requests swiftly so that their preparation
      for the trial can begin.




                                                                                    1
4.    BACKGROUND

4.1   The Director Casework is well aware of the detail of this case up to and
      including the Divisional Court's decision in the application for judicial review
      by the two defendants. In particular his decision that we should not intervene
      at the request of the defendants in order to take over the private prosecution
      and then discontinue it.

4.2   The CPS has previously considered requests by the HFSG to advise the Chief
       Constable of SYP that he should not hold the Hillsborough Archive. These
       requests have been refused. It has been considered that the CPS does not have
       the authority to advise the police on this point. The Hillsborough chronology
       schedule at items 34,40, 56, 68, 73 and 81 refers.

4.3   On 20 July 1999 Mr N Cadbury, the stipendiary magistrate sitting at Leeds
      Magistrates' Court, committed Duckenfield and Murray to the Crown Court on
      charges of manslaughter and misconduct in a public office. The previous
      week he had rejected the defence submission that the proceedings were an
      abuse of the process of the court.

5.    KEY CONSIDERATIONS

      SYP Request re Intervention

5.1   On 18 December 1998 the Director Casework informed all the parties to the
      private prosecution of his decision not to intervene. This decision was based
      on the policy which appears in the CPS Prosecution Manual at chapter 7 of
      volume 1.

5.2   Paragraph 7.18 of the chapter Private Prosecutions shows the change in
      circumstances that may occur following a committal and the acceptance by the
      court that a prima facie case exists. It is also said that the public expectation
      of a case being pursued has been raised. The guidance is that, if requested to
      do so by the private prosecutor, we should take over the case and continue
      with the prosecution unless it is clear that there is no realistic prospect of
      conviction or the public interest factors tending against prosecution clearly
      outweigh those factors tending in favour. We are exhorted to consider the
      evidence very carefully before concluding that there is not a realistic prospect
      of conviction.

5.3   My understanding of the CPS deliberations on the case is that we were
      satisfied that there was no realistic prospect of conviction on any of the
      charges, but, except for the allegation of perverting the course of justice - the
      'disgraceful lie', we could not say that there was clearly no case to answer.
      That was based on all the evidence which had been brought to our attention for
      the purposes of the original case decision of 1990 and of the subsequent CPS
      reviews in 1997 and 1998. The 1997 review decision as to the sufficiency of
      evidence was endorsed by the report of the scrutiny conducted by Lord Justice
       Stuart-Smith, and that of 1998 by the judgement of the Divisional Court on the
      judicial review application. In giving the judgement of the court Lord Justice


                                                                                     2
      Laws said "The DPP might, in my judgement, lawfully have decided to
      discontinue". This could be considered to be a judicial recognition that a CPS
      decision to intervene and then to discontinue all the charges would not have
      been unreasonable.

5.4   Since the Director of Casework reviewed this case further material evidence
      has come to light. This is noted in the Hillsborough Chronology as items 210,
      215, 219, 220, and 231. The SYP were forced to disclose notes of three
      briefings given to senior and other police officers shortly after the disaster.
      These are attached at Annex C.

5.5   Prior to the commencement of the abuse of process hearing I had received
      information from the Hillsborough Coroner (now retired) concerning a
      statement that had purportedly not been seen since the inquest. It was the
      statement of an Inspector White dated 25 February 1991. In April 1997 Dr
      Popper contacted the BCP of the Police Complaints Division at York about his
      concern re the differences between the evidence of Inspector White and that of
      Supr Murray as to when the latter became aware that the gates to the tunnel
      entrance had been closed in 1988. The Taylor Enquiry had found that in 1988
      entry to the tunnel had been blocked of by police shortly before kick-off
      because the pens were deemed to be full. It was said that this closure seemed
      to have been unknown to the senior officers on duty at the time, it did not
      figure in the de-briefing notes and therefore had no influence on the planning
      for 1989. However, the coroner's recollection was that White had told Murray
      of that closure prior to the 1989 disaster. This would be in complete
      contradiction of Murray's evidence that he did not learn of the earlier tunnel
      closure until after the disaster. At that time in 1997 the police instituted a
      search of the database on my advice. The statement which the coroner
      remembered was not found and it was presumed that his recollection was
      wrong.

5.6   It was only on 21 June 1999 that the coroner gave me further information
      about the statement, that is, the date that it was made and the existence of a file
      note that he had written at the time. I then advised the police to conduct
      another search of the archive. This they promptly agreed to and although there
      was no record of the statement on the Holmes database, a manual search of the
      archive papers unearthed it in a file dedicated to the inquest. The statement
      was received by the CPS on 6 July , the second day of the abuse hearing. It
      was immediately disclosed to all parties. It was apparent that the HFSG,
      myself and the present archivist had not seen this evidence before. The
      statement is attached as Annex D.

5.7   The prosecution made use of the contents of the statement in order to show
      that Murray knew about the 1988 tunnel closure before the disaster. Counsel
      for Murray argued that the new statement proved no such thing. On
      examining the document I am satisfied that Inspector White's evidence is of
      his personal knowledge of a procedure at league matches that he would follow
      in order to close off temporarily the gates to the tunnel when the central pen
      was full. Although this officer discussed the above procedure with Murray in
      April 1988, he does not say that he told Murray about the 1988 problem that


                                                                                       3
       required the closure of the tunnel. The statement is evidence of the senior
       officer's policy that the fans should be left to find their own level.

5.8    The notes of the briefings of police officers after the disaster are also new
       evidence that had not been seen by the HFSG or, to my knowledge, the CPS.
       While these notes bring up interesting points about the tactical procedures and
       policies, it does not in my estimation provide the basis for the submission that
       either Duckenfield and/or Murray must have known that there had been a
       requirement to close off the tunnel in 1988 because the central pens were full.

5.9    The note of the first briefing shows the discussion between senior officers,
       including the two defendants and Inspector White, concerning the opening of
       gate C and what went through the minds of officers as the disaster unfolded.
       There is nothing in that note that supports the allegation that the defendants,
       especially Murray, knew of the 1988 tunnel closure which was done in order
       to alleviate the crush in the pens. If there had been such knowledge the HFSG
       would have stronger evidence for the assertion of gross negligence.

5.10   The second note again concerns a discussion between the senior officers,
       including the two defendants. There is a comment that "Top of the tunnel
       solid with horses - that procedure happened last year". The comment may
       refer to the 1988 tunnel closure mentioned by Inspector White , although he
       did not speak of the use of horses but of officers. Again it does not show that
       either Murray or Duckenfield knew of the previous year's closure so that it
       should have been to the forefront of their minds when Gate C was opened.
       The general discussion touches upon a contingency plan to shut off the tunnel
       when it became full. There is contradictory evidence from officers about
       whether the tunnel was full or not in 1989 after Gate C was opened.

5.11   The third briefing was attended by some of the more junior management
       officers and the note shows a discussion of tunnel control. The second
       paragraph refers to a Sergeant Burman stating that pens 3 & 4 were filled by
       2.00pm. His exact words were "The area that filled the quickest was Pen 3 of
       the Leppings Lane terraces and I saw that by 2.00pm (1400) the fans were
       cramped in this section of the terraces". Further on it is said that there was
       nothing in either the operational order or at the briefings re police protection
       of the tunnel to restrict or prevent spectator entry. However officers
       remembered that in previous years this had been done by the use of horses and
       static police lines. This was known as Superintendent Freeman's policy.
       There is no evidence that either of the defendants knew of this policy which
       appears to have been disseminated by word of mouth only.

5.12   The HFSG have provided me with copies of the following documents:-

       •   Depositions taken at the committal hearing
       •   Witness statements read out at the committal

5.13   The deposition of Moneypenny describes his entry through Gate C and then
       down a crowded tunnel. It may be the prosecution argument that as the tunnel



                                                                                     4
                                                          »


       was crowded Supr Freeman's policy noted above should have been brought
       into play. Both depositions are copied at Annex E.

5.14. The statements read out during the committal proceedings tell the story of the
      crush outside the turnstiles, the opening of the gate and the rush through the
      tunnel into the stands and the eventual disaster. Except for that of Mr
      Moneypenny, all the statements featured on the Master Witness list of the
      Taylor Inquiry and have therefore been reviewed before.

       The Hillsboroueh Archive

5.11   The possession of this archive has been considered previously at Senior Civil
       Service level. Mr M Kennedy had written to the HFSG on 27 August 1998 in
       answer to their concern about the SYP continuing to hold the archive. In the
       absence of any impropriety he did not feel it was appropriate to request the
       SYP to make alternative arrangements for the safekeeping of the papers.

5.12   While the HFSG have made many allegations about the suppression of
       material evidence by the SYP from 1989 to the present day, my 1997 review
       and the later scrutiny found no support for their submissions of suppression of
       evidence by the police. They are now saying that the police have misled the
       DPP from day one and that the scrutiny was not shown all the evidence in
       police possession. For that reason the archive should be taken away from the
       SYP. Although new material is coming to light, I am still not persuaded that
       we have the authority or reasonable cause to advise the Chief Constable that it
       is in the interests of justice that at this late stage of the proceedings he should
       surrender up the archive. Neither the late Lord Taylor or Lord Justice Stuart-
       Smith expressed concern at the SYP being in control of all the papers.
       Without evidence of impropriety I would find it difficult to support a change
       of our view.

5.13   The police are concerned at the amount of work and time involved in giving
       full disclosure of the archive to the HFSG. The CPS policy on disclosure in
       private prosecutions was made clear to the police in our letter of 15 July 1998
       (see item 17 in the chronology). Our guidance to them was based on that
       contained in paragraphs 7.29 to 7.41 of the chapter on private prosecutions.
       We have given full voluntary disclosure of all non sensitive documents in our
       possession to all parties. It was suggested to the police that they should
       consider doing the same. We are now at the stage where the duty of
       disclosure can be forced upon the police by way of the Crown Court granting
       the private prosecutor a witness summons to secure the production of relevant
       material.

5.14   There is some force to the argument that the SYP have been less than
       forthcoming in the giving of voluntary disclosure. When the HFSG learnt of
       the existence of the briefing notes made following the disaster, the SYP
       strongly contested their production until ordered to disclose by the
       Magistrates' Court. In 1997 the SYP had difficulty in finding the missing
       statement of Inspector White, and it could be surmised that the archive
       harbours any number of previously undisclosed but material documents.


                                                                                        5
6.    RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1   I am satisfied that this new evidence, comprised of the briefing notes, the
      statement of Inspector White and the depositions, is not so material as might
      have affected our decisions in 1990 and 1997, or the decision of 1998 for non
      intervention. Except for the fact of the case having been committed to the
      Crown Court, the evidential and public interest considerations remain the
      same as they were in December 1998. In which case my careful consideration
      of the evidence still leads to the conclusion that there is no realistic prospect of
      a conviction. I therefore recommend that we inform the Chief Constable that
      having considered the circumstances of the committal we have decided that
      there are no grounds for us intervene.

6.2   If the above is accepted then I recommend that we can advise the Chief
      Constable that it would be in the interests of justice for him to make available
      all the non sensitive documents in the archive to both defence and prosecution.
      This should be done without regard to applying the Keane test of materiality
      under the common law. The police would have more problems in trying to
      divide the papers into relevant and non relevant piles than in supervising
      unfettered access to non sensitive material. While access to sensitive material
      subject to PII considerations can be initially restricted, a schedule of those
      documents could be provided to the parties so that they can, if they wish, make
      an application to the court. This is preferable to using the old common law
      procedure of ex parte applications to the judge. However I do not believe that
      there is any large amount of such documents. Otherwise it might be
      acceptable to all parties that I be allowed to examine sensitive documents as to
      materiality and make recommendations to the police for disclosure where
      necessary.

6.2   I also recommend that we decline to advise the Chief Constable on the hand
      over of the Hillsborough Archive to any other party. It is not for us to enter
      into a contentious discussion as to the ownership of the property rights in the
      archive papers.

7.    CONCLUSION

7.1   That the above recommendations be considered to enable a swift response to
       the police and HFSG.

            BRIEFING NOTE ON HILLSBOROUGH

                                 YBF/3341/89


1.    ISSUE

1.1   Following the recent committal of Duckenfield and Murray to the Crown
      Court on counts of manslaughter and misconduct in a public office, ACC
      Daines of the South Yorkshire Police has written to the Casework Directorate
      at York to ask if the Director will be reviewing the case to determine whether
      the CPS should now take over the proceedings and conduct the prosecution.

1.2   He expects that the HFSG will make further requests for material from the
      archives under SYP control and he* considers it inappropriate to give this
      disclosure if it was our intention to take over the case.

1.3   In the event that we do not intervene, the police wish our advice on how to
       respond to HFSG requests for further disclosure. See letter of 21 July 1999
       attached at Annex A.

1.4   The HFSG have written to York and requested our views on the custody of the
      archive held by the SYP now that the case has been committed. They invite us
      to advise the SYP to surrender the possession of the archive, and to inform
      them of any disagreement we may have with their legal arguments. They
      enclose a copy of their letter to the solicitors acting for the Chief Constable
      where they repeat their views that the archive should not be held by the SYP.
      Their letter of 22 July 1999 is attached at Annex B.

2.    ACTION REQUIRED

2.1    A substantive response is required to the linked requests of ACC Daines and
      of the HFSG. As the decision on non intervention in the private prosecution
      was taken by the Director Casework, he should have the opportunity to
      consider the level at which this decision should be taken.

2.2   Holding letters were sent to the police and the HFSG on 23 July.

3.    TIMING

3.1   We have been informed that Mr Justice Hooper, the trial judge, has a PDH
      listed for 3 September 1999. He has had the trial listed for 8 weeks in June
      and July 2000.

3.2   The HFSG expect a comprehensive reply from the police by 6 August 1999
      and have asked us to deal with their requests swiftly so that their preparation
      for the trial can begin.




                                                                                    1
4.    BACKGROUND

4.1   The Director Casework is well aware of the detail of this case up to and
      including the Divisional Court's decision in the application for judicial review
      by the two defendants. In particular his decision that we should not intervene
      at the request of the defendants in order to take over the private prosecution
      and then discontinue it.

4.2   The CPS has previously considered requests by the HFSG to advise the Chief
      Constable of SYP that he should not hold the Hillsborough Archive. These
      requests have been refused. It has been considered that the CPS does not have
      the authority to advise the police on this point. The Hillsborough chronology
      schedule at items 34,40, 56, 68, 73 and 81 refers.

4.3   On 20 July 1999 Mr N Cadbury, the stipendiary magistrate sitting at Leeds
      Magistrates' Court, committed Duckenfield and Murray to the Crown Court on
      charges of manslaughter and misconduct in a public office. The previous
      week he had rejected the defence submission that the proceedings were an
      abuse of the process of the court.

5.    KEY CONSIDERATIONS

      SYP Request re Intervention

5.1   On 18 December 1998 the Director Casework informed all the parties to the
      private prosecution of his decision not to intervene. This decision was based
      on the policy which appears in the CPS Prosecution Manual at chapter 7 of
      volume 1.

5.2   Paragraph 7.18 of the chapter Private Prosecutions shows the change in
      circumstances that may occur following a committal and the acceptance by the
      court that a prima facie case exists. It is also said that the public expectation
      of a case being pursued has been raised. The guidance is that, if requested to
      do so by the private prosecutor, we should take over the case and continue
      with the prosecution unless it is clear that there is no realistic prospect of
      conviction or the public interest factors tending against prosecution clearly
      outweigh those factors tending in favour. We are exhorted to consider the
      evidence very carefully before concluding that there is not a realistic prospect
      of conviction.

5.3   My understanding of the CPS deliberations on the case is that we were
      satisfied that there was no realistic prospect of conviction on any of the
      charges, but, except for the allegation of perverting the course of justice - the
      'disgraceful lie', we could not say that there was clearly no case to answer.
      That was based on all the evidence which had been brought to our attention for
      the purposes o f the original case decision of 1990 and of the subsequent CPS
      reviews in 1997 and 1998. The 1997 review decision as to the sufficiency of
      evidence was endorsed by the report of the scrutiny conducted by Lord Justice
      Stuart-Smith, and that of 1998 by the judgement of the Divisional Court on the
      judicial review application. In giving the judgement o f the court Lord Justice


                                                                                     X
      Laws said "The DPP might, in my judgement, lawfully have decided to
      discontinue". This could be considered to be a judicial recognition that a CPS
      decision to intervene and then to discontinue all the charges would not have
      been unreasonable.

5.4   Since the Director of Casework reviewed this case further material evidence
      has come to light. This is noted in the Hillsborough Chronology as items 210,
      215, 219, 220, and 231. The SYP were forced to disclose notes of three
      briefings given to senior and other police officers shortly after the disaster.
      These are attached at Annex C.

5.5   Prior to the commencement of the abuse of process hearing I had received
      information from the Hillsborough Coroner (now retired) concerning a
      statement that had purportedly not been seen since the inquest. It was the
      statement of an Inspector White dated 25 February 1991. In April 1997 Dr
      Popper contacted the BCP of the Police Complaints Division at York about his
      concern re the differences between the evidence of Inspector White and that of
      Supr Murray as to when the latter became aware that the gates to the tunnel
      entrance had been closed in 1988. The Taylor Enquiry had found that in 1988
      entry to the tunnel had been blocked off by police shortly before kick-off
      because the pens were deemed to be full. It was said that this closure seemed
      to have been unknown to the senior officers on duty at the time, it did not
      figure in the de-briefing notes and therefore had no influence on the planning
      for 1989. However, the coroner's recollection was that White had told Murray
      of that closure prior to the 1989 disaster. This would be in complete
      contradiction of Murray's evidence that he did not leam of the earlier tunnel
      closure until after the disaster. At that time in 1997 the police instituted a
      search of the database on my advice. The statement which the coroner
      remembered was not found and it was presumed that his recollection was
      wrong.

5.6   It was only on 21 June 1999 that the coroner gave me further information
      about the statement, that is, the date that it was made and the existence of a file
      note that he had written at the time. I then advised the police to conduct
      another search of the archive. This they promptly agreed to and although there
      was no record of the statement on the Holmes database, a manual search of the
      archive papers unearthed it in a file dedicated to the inquest. The statement
      was received by the CPS on 6 July , the second day of the abuse hearing. It
      was immediately disclosed to all parties. It was apparent that the HFSG,
      myself and the present archivist had not seen this evidence before. The
      statement is attached as Annex D.

5.7   The prosecution made use of the contents o f the statement in order to show
      that Murray knew about the 1988 tunnel closure before the disaster. Counsel
      for Murray argued that the new statement proved no such thing. On
      examining the document I am satisfied that Inspector White's evidence is of
      his personal knowledge of a procedure at league matches that he would follow
      in order to close off temporarily the gates to the tunnel when the central pen
      was full. Although this officer discussed the above procedure with Murray in
      April 1988, he does not say that he told Murray about the 1988 problem that


                                                                                       3
       required the closure of the tunnel. The statement is evidence of the senior
       officer's policy that the fans should be left to find their own level.

5.8    The notes of the briefings of police officers after the disaster are also new
       evidence that had not been seen by the HFSG or, to my knowledge, the CPS.
       While these notes bring up interesting points about the tactical procedures and
       policies, it does not in my estimation provide the basis for the submission that
       either Duckenfield and/or Murray must have known that there had been a
       requirement to close off the tunnel in 1988 because the central pens were full.

5.9    The note of the first briefing shows the discussion between senior officers,
       including the two defendants and Inspector White, concerning the opening of
       gate C and what went through the minds of officers as the disaster unfolded.
       There is nothing in that note that supports the allegation that the defendants,
       especially Murray, knew of the 1988 tunnel closure which was done in order
       to alleviate the crush in the pens. If there had been such knowledge the HFSG
       would have stronger evidence for the assertion of gross negligence.

5.10 The second note again concerns a discussion between the senior officers,
     including the two defendants. There is a comment that "Top of the tunnel
     solid with horses - that procedure happened last year". The comment may
     refer to the 1988 tunnel closure mentioned by Inspector White , although he
     did not speak of the use of horses but of officers. Again it does not show that
     either Murray or Duckenfield knew of the previous year's closure so that it
     should have been to the forefront of their minds when Gate C was opened.
     The general discussion touches upon a contingency plan to shut off the tunnel
     when it became full. There is contradictory evidence from officers about
     whether the tunnel was full or not in 1989 after Gate C was opened.

5.11   The third briefing was attended by some of the more junior management
       officers and the note shows a discussion of tunnel control. The second
       paragraph refers to a Sergeant Burman stating that pens 3 & 4 were filled by
       2.00pm. His exact words were "The area that filled the quickest was Pen 3 of
       the Leppings Lane terraces and I saw that by 2.00pm (1400) the fans were
       cramped in this section of the terraces". Further on it is said that there was
       nothing in either the operational order or at the briefings re police protection
       of the tunnel to restrict or prevent spectator entry. However officers
       remembered that in previous years this had been done by the use of horses and
       static police lines. This was known as Superintendent Freeman's policy.
       There is no evidence that either of the defendants knew of this policy which
       appears to have been disseminated by word of mouth only.

5.12 The HFSG have provided me with copies of the following documents:-

       •   Depositions taken at the committal hearing
       •   Witness statements read out at the committal

5.13 The deposition of Moneypenny describes his entry through Gate C and then
     down a crowded tunnel. It may be the prosecution argument that as the tunnel



                                                                                     4
       was crowded Supr freeman's policy noted above should have been brought
       into play. Both depositions are copied at Annex E.

5.14. The statements read out during the committal proceedings tell the story of the
       crush outside the turnstiles, the opening of the gate and the rush through the
       tunnel into the stands and the eventual disaster. Except for that of Mr
      Moneypenny, all the statements featured on the Master Witness list of the
      Taylor Inquiry and have therefore been reviewed before.

       The Hillsboroueh Archive

5.11   The possession of this archive has been considered previously at Senior Civil
       Service level. Mr M Kennedy had written to the HFSG on 27 August 1998 in
       answer to their concern about the SYP continuing to hold the archive. In the
       absence of any impropriety he did not feel it was appropriate to request the
       SYP to make alternative arrangements for the safekeeping of the papers.

5.12 While the HFSG have made many allegations about the suppression of
     material evidence by the SYP from 1989 to the present day, my 1997 review
     and the later scrutiny found no support for their submissions of suppression of
     evidence by the police. They are now saying that the police have misled the
     DPP from day one and that the scrutiny was not shown all the evidence in
     police possession. For that reason the archive should be taken away from the
     SYP. Although new material is coming to light, I am still not persuaded that
     we have the authority or reasonable cause to advise the Chief Constable that it
     is in the interests of justice that at this late stage of the proceedings he should
     surrender up the archive. Neither the late Lord Taylor or Lord Justice Stuart-
     Smith expressed concern at the SYP being in control of all the papers.
     Without evidence of impropriety I would find it difficult to support a change
     of our view.

5.13   The police are concerned at the amount of work and time involved in giving
       full disclosure of the archive to the HFSG. The CPS policy on disclosure in
       private prosecutions was made clear to the police in our letter of 15 July 1998
       (see item 17 in the chronology). Our guidance to them was based on that
       contained in paragraphs 7.29 to 7.41 of the chapter on private prosecutions.
       We have given full voluntary disclosure of all non sensitive documents in our
       possession to all parties. It was suggested to the police that they should
       consider doing the same. We are now at the stage where the duty of
       disclosure can be forced upon the police by way o f the Crown Court granting
       the private prosecutor a witness summons to secure the production of relevant
       material.

5.14   There is some force to the argument that the SYP have been less than
       forthcoming in the giving of voluntary disclosure. When the HFSG leamt of
       the existence of the briefing notes made following the disaster, the SYP
       strongly contested their production until ordered to disclose by the
       Magistrates' Court. In 1997 the SYP had difficulty in finding the missing
       statement of Inspector White, and it could be surmised that the archive
       harbours any number of previously undisclosed but material documents.


                                                                                      5

    6.    RECOMMENDATIONS

    6.1   I am satisfied that this new evidence, comprised of the briefing notes, the
           statement of Inspector White and the depositions, is not so material as might
           have affected our decisions in 1990 and 1997, or the decision of 1998 for non
           intervention. Except for the fact of the case having been committed to the
           Crown Court, the evidential and public interest considerations remain the
           same as they were in December 1998. In which case my careful consideration
           of the evidence still leads to the conclusion that there is no realistic prospect of
           a conviction. I therefore recommend that we inform the Chief Constable that
          having considered the circumstances of the committal we have decided that
          there are no grounds for us intervene.



    n     If the above is accepted then I recommend that we can advise the Chief
          Constable that it would be in the interests of justice for him to make available
          all the non sensitive documents in the archive to both defence and prosecution.
          This should be done without regard fb applying the Keane test of materiality
          under the common law. The police would have more problems in trying to
          divide the papers into relevant and non relevant piles than in supervising
          unfettered access to non sensitive material. While access to sensitive material
          subject to PII considerations can be initially restricted, a schedule of those
          documents could be provided to the parties so that they can, if they wish, make
          an application to the court. This is preferable to using the old common law
          procedure of ex parte applications to the judge. However I do not believe that
          there is any large amount of such documents. Otherwise it might be
          acceptable to all parties that I be allowed to examine sensitive documents as to
          materiality and make recommendations to the police for disclosure where
          necessary.

    6.2   I also recommend that we decline to advise the Chief Constable on the hand
          over of the Hillsborough Archive to any other party. It is not for us to enter
    \J    into a contentious discussion as to the ownership of the property rights in the
          archive papers.

    7.    CONCLUSION

    7.1   That the above recommendations be considered to enable a swift response to
          the police and HFSG.

            Dear Mr Croston

            Private Prosecution by Anne Adllngton o f David D uckenfield and Bern ard Murray

            The stipendary m agistrate at Leeds has committed Mr Duckefield and Mr Murray to Leeds
            Crown Court for trial on alleged offences of m anslaughter and neglect of duty. The
            prosecution has been brought by a private individual, Ms Anne Adlington.

            Now that the m atter has been committed 1 wonder if the Director of Public Prosecutions will
            be reviewing the m atter to determine whether he will take over the prosecution and conduct it
            himself.

            In the months leading up to the commital I have received numerous requests from Ms
            Adlington for material held in the South Yorkshire Police archieves. I expect Ms Adlington
            will be contacting me again in the very near future to seek further material to sustain the
            prosecution. Clearly, if the Director of Public Prosections takes over the proseuction then it
            would be inappropriate for me to furnish her with that material.

            I will be obliged if you would advise me of the Director of Public Prosecutions intentions. If
            the Director of Public Prosecutions does not take over the prosection I will be obliged to
            receive your advice on how to respond to the requests I am likely to receive from
            Ms Adlington.

   Dear Mr Metcalf,

   R v. D ucktm fieid and M urray

   1        The defendants in this case w ere committed for trial on 20* July on charges o f
            manslaughter and misfeasance. The stipendiary magistrate, Mr Nigel Cadbury, had
            heard five days o f argument, and sworn oral evidence from me, before rejecting the
            defence argument that the prosecution was an abuse o f process o f the court and
            oppressive. He then rcjccted a defence argument that there was no case to answer
            after a mere three days o f evidence and argument.
                     t
   2        We understand that the Presiding Judge o f the North-Eastern Circuit, Mr Justice
            Hooper, wishes to hold a preliminary hearing soon, probably on 3* September, but
            possibly on 20th August. We shall wish at that hearing to raise the important question
            o f access to the Hillsborough archive.

   3        As you know, we have been arguing for nearly a year now that there is no lawful basis
            for South Yorkshire police to hold the papers. By virtue o f the fact that on 16* April
             198s> K.t ^m ef Constable o f the South Yorkshire police asked the Chief Constable o f
            the W est Midlands police to conduct an inquiry into the policing at the Hillsborough
            disaster, it appears that the fiction has been maintained that South Yorkshire police
            “own” the information, o f which, it has been said, they are "principals'*.

   4        Therefore, it is apparently argued, the South Yorkshire police were the primary
            commissioners o f evidence and inquiry, and other investigative and legal bodies were
            subordinate. Accordingly, the South Yorkshire police has been able, upon your own
            advice, (a) to decline to disctosc material to the bereaved families at the Inquest in
             1990, and (b) to deny it to the prosecution in 1998-9,

   5    For the same reason, the South Yorkshire police was, on your advice, able to
         influence, in its own favour, the supply o f information and evidence to the CPS in
         1989-90, when a decision whether to prosecute wad under consideration, and, no
         doubt, to influence the supply o f information to the Police Complaints Authority.

   6    Although we have repeatedly deployed these arguments in the course o f the various
        applications by the defendants to have the proceedings stayed or discontinued, and in
        the course o f their applications for public fUnding, we have never heard an answer to
        them. Neither have you offered any rebuttal or contradiction at all over the last twelve
               !
   7    A conspicuous feature o f the case in the last twelve months had been the support that
        the South Yorkshire police has given to the defendants. The Chief Constable has
         urged the South Yorkshire Police Authority, successfully, that it should pay the entire
        legal fees and out o f pocket expenses o f the defendants on the ground that they acted
        “reasonably and in good faith” at the time o f the Hillsborough disaster, and that it was
        necessary to do this to maintain the morale o f officers who have to take “split-second**
         decisions.

   8    it is obviously absurd that the Crown, in whose name the prosecution will now be
        conducted, is denied access to evidential material which is obviously relevant to the
        case by a body which is actively supporting the defence. Furthermore, as you will
         know, the. prosecution has duties o f disclosure to the defence, namely, to disclose any
         material in the possession o f organs o f the state that may arguably assist the defence,
         subject to public interest immunity considerations and legal professional privilege.

   9    Wc shall raise these m atters with Mr Justice Hooper at the first hearing. We invite you
        meanwhile to explain in writing;

        (a) die   m oasis on which you contend that the papers belong to , or are possessed by,
        the South Yorkshire police;

        (b) whether the Chief Constable is prepared to hand the archive over to a neutral third
        party;

        (c) what other steps the Chief Constable proposes to take to co-operate with the
        Crown.

   10   In the past you have failed to assist the prosecution. We believe that this refusal was
        influenced by the mistaken view expressed by M r Daines in 1998, before the
        summonses were issued, that any private prosecution was likely to “fall at the first
        hurdle.” We invite him now to take this case seriously. Since the arguments are well
        known to you, we suggest that we can reasonably expect a comprehensive reply by 6*
        August.

 Chief Constable:       I'ra nor in the business of quasciont-nj decisions,
                        questioning graphics, I Vinow that everything that was cone
                        was dene in the prttsr spirit ar.d trtper attired? cf
                        csa2.i*£ with a v^ry Very dif*icu.i.-            cut it i5 c.*e
                        chror.oLogy of events which it seems to me are essential
                        for rae to 5 9 c in my mind.  I thought the best way we cauid
                        co this is tc go through the events as I understand* tneni
                        and to get the individuals who car. cccwent on these events
                        as I understand then to say so. Don't be concerned about
                        disagreeing with ise and if you disagree with my
                        understanding cf what I think happened say so but it’s
                        really an ability to grasp the overall picture. I think
                    .    I've sot a gooa idea of it now b)it there will be ditail.
                         Each of you will have irt your Kind the detail of events
                         you witnessed ar.d we kr.cv ths parasetars of what you
                         sg£ are very narrow when tires and therefore con't try and
                      ■ adjust your aiind to what someone else is saying. Stick to
                         -hat you know, sties to what you saw and don't attempt to
                         aid explanations cf it or try and zaic* logic of it because
                         there are so many illogical aspects. So we open the gates
                         as 12.00 noon and by 2.30 pm the Kottinsham section of the
                         ground was fairly full but at that time I think.it's true
                         that the control in the ground realised that there wer* a
                         lot of gaps and a lot of areas to fill

                            of fans ar.d ir. both directions and were drinking and we
                            had to close the road but there was a de^sy in tnat

                            from th%'read down into the Lappings Lane terrace.


       ur.^ec uonstabie:    So we've got a picture of people froa Liverpool in the
                            vicinity of the ground. Htfris we got any erffig<aL.6i»s

                            Halifax Roai and Langsett Road that they were completely

                         nia.n in the control room changing radios and chare was a
                         delay. Mr Marshall was asking Tor help and the gate to be
                         opened and for one or two reasons he didn'C set ic. either,
                         firstly because we didn't receive Che message from the          '

               ADUNGTON V DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

              I refer to your letter of 25 June 1999 addressed to Mr P eter Me11calf. Solicitor of Hammond
              Suddards. Leeds, relating to the above prosecution and in particular to a witness statem ent made
              by former Police Inspector White on either 25 February 1990 or 1991

              On the instructions of the Chief Constable I have today earned out an extensive manual search of
              the Hillsborough Archive and in a part of tha archive dedicated to the Inquests
                                                                                     h        I have found a hand
              written original and typed copy of a statement taken by W est M.%         ,
                                                                                       dlands Police from former
              inspector White on 25 February 1991. I enclose a copy of both for yodr information.

              I would like to em phasise that until today I was not aware of the existejnice of this statement, nor is
              there any record of it on the HOLMES database relating to the Hillsbor n•ugh Disaster.

              I am responding to your correspondence with the agreem ent of Assistant Chief Constable
              lan Daines and Mr P eter Metcalf of Hammond Suddards in order to ixpedite your recsipt of the
              copy statement.

              Yours sincerely

      My occupation is local government officer. My address is
      I                         I travelled to Hillsborough on the I5th April I989
cm
      to see the football match. I was with four friends. I had a ticket for
      the Leppings Lane terrace. I had been to the ground on four or
                   i
      five occasions before.           I arrived in Sheffield about Ipm to avoid
      traffic. We went to the ground sr.d ‘^.cn to a public house for a
      drink. We returned to the ground at about 2.50pm or 2.55pm. I am
      referred to plan DPPI07 (Div I3).liiav e been able to familiarise
      myself wiV'i the pjan and remember going to the Leppings Lane
      end. Conditions were chaotic and completely disorganised,. There
      was no queuing system. There was a huge crowd of people milling
      about trying to get into the ground, and as far as I could see very
      few police or stewards outside. When I arrived, there was only one
      way to get into the ground and that was through the turnstiles. We
      initially thought we would have to stand and wait and that it may
      take aboLft half an hour but things rapidly changed. To the right
      hand side^of the turnstiles we noticed movement. People were not
      going in through a turnstile but through a gate. I refer to the plan, it
      was gate C. There was no stampede, it was an easier way to get
      into the around. We went in, no one was checking the tickets.
      Because pf the problems outside by the turnstiles, I had lost track
      of my friends.        Later I discovered that they went into the West
      Stand. I was on my own and it was a couple of years since I had
      been in that part of the ground, but I hoped to meet up later with
      my friends at the car. I was present at the ground at the 1988 semi
      final, but not at that part of the ground. I was in the press box the
      previous year and used a completely different entrance. I had an

     The Examination of
                                                                      continued

      idea that the best place to go was Pen 7. I specifically did not want
     to be behind the goa(. Because of my age, I wanted to be where I
      thought there would be more room and believed that there would
      be more room in Pen 7 rather than behind the goal where the
      younger ones usually went.      Because I had forgotten the layout
      and in particular the radial fences at the side and because there
                i
      was not a single policeman or steward in the concourse area, nor
      any other signs towards any other part of the terrace, I took the
      only entrance available down the tunnel which is depicted on the
      plan. Even as I started down the tunnel my plan was to turn left at
      the bottom and head towards the north west corner. Matters were
      then taken completely out of my own hands within a few yards of
      entering the tunnel, which had a very steep gradient (see plan
      divider 8j. There were an enormous number of people heading
      down the! tunnel, and I was carried off my feet for maybe forty or
      fifty feet, maybe more. I then ended up near the front of Pen 3
      near the barrier that I later believed had collapsed. I came to a
      stop wheh I had my toes faintly touching the ground. This was
      almost exactly kick off time.     The conditions around me were
      terrifying (and I immediately realised I was in a life or death
      situation. With one of my toes on the ground I could feel a body.
      The only thing I could do was to shout and scream and to wait for a
      chance to get out. People seemed to be disillusioned about the
      lack of response from people on the other side of the fence,
      primarily the police and some of the people including me, turned
      our attentions to the supporters at th« back of the terrace, to shout
      at them to move back. Something must have happened because
      after not being able to move a centimetre for ten to fifteen minutes,
      a few of ys were able to eventually move back towards the tunnel.

          Eventually I was able to get out through the tunnel going the way I
          had come.     I have been shown the photograph (exhibit number
          RHH1/6I) which shows pens 3 and 4 I consider my position to have
          been abovit ten to fifteen feet behind the perimeter fence in front of
          the collapsed barrier.


          CROSS EXAMINATION BY MR. CLEGG Q.C. ON BEHALF OF
          DAVID DlilCKENFIELD


          Before I989 the area behind the goal was a popular place to stand.
          When perimeter fences were introduced they obstructed the fans*
          view of the ground and I therefore agree that some supporters
          would prefer to stand back to have a view over the perimeter
          fence. That would include me and that is part of the reason why I
          wanted to go to pen 7 and stand at the back.


          On the day of the match, I had a spare ticket which I sold to a
          supporter at about Ipm outside the Leppings Lane end. When I
          returned to the Leppings Lane end       about ten to three I do not
          remember seeing any mounted police officers. I have been shown
          DPPI07 again. My attention has been drawn to the metal fencing
          and gates .between the road and the turnstiles. When I first arrived
          at ten to three, I think I joined the crowd and this was outside the
          metal fencing and gate. I do not actually remember the metal
          fencing and gates because of the crowd. I was not one of the first
          to go through Gate C. but believe that I went through a minute or
          two after it must have been opened. I was able to walk through the
          gate quite freely. I am sure there were no policemen or stewards
          in the concourse area. If there had been anyone in authority telling

        me not to go down the tunnel, I would not have gone down it.
        There was no difficulty in me walking across the concourse and
        going the first few feet down the tunnel. Then the sheer volume of
        people and the gradient of the tunnel combined to take me off my
        feet.   People entered the tunnel in an orderly fashion, they just
        wanted to see the match. I was swept off my feet to a position not
        far from the front of pen 3.

        At the moment of entering the tunnel I believed it was feasible to
        go down the tunnel, turn left and make my way to pen 7.


        RE EXAMINATION BY MR. JONES


        There were no radial fences at ttw Kop at Anfield. The terraces
        were completely different.            There weren't many first division
        grounds which had radial fences of this kind. I had forgotten that
        there we .'a radial fences in this part of the ground as I had not
        been in this part of the ground for about three years.

   EXAMINATION IN CHIEF


     am                          pf the force headquarters Nottingham. I was on
   duty in uniform at the semi-final football match on 15th April 1989 with two
   uniformed colleagues. I was part of the overall police operation with South
   Yorkshire police.   I attended a pre-match briefing during the course of the
   morning attended by Nottingham and South Yorkshire officers. It took place in
   the North Stand. There were hundreds of us present.          That was the only
   briefing I attended and Mr Duckenfield was In charge. I recall that officers that
   were policing at the Leppings Lane end were asked to collect a meal ticket
               c
   and that was for a hot meal at a quarter to three. It was during the course of
   the briefing p a t this was said. I don't recall who said this. To the best of my
   recollection Mr Duckenfield was present tnroughout the briefing.        I do not
   know the names of any of the other senior officers present at the briefing.


   I was on <futy outside the ground in the area of the Pennistone Road
   turnstiles, t had a radio and I could hear m essages going to and from the
   control room. I do not recall being tuned to a particular channel. I recall
   shortly before kick-off time that there were problems at the Leppings Lane
   end. I do not recall one way or the other whether there were any interruptions
   or whether It was a steady stream of conversation. There was a build-up of
   supporters at the Leppings Lane end and I recall hearing people asking for
   the gates to be opened In a very concerned manner. I cannot recall any
   specific orders but, because of the radio transmissions I could hear, I decided
   I would enter the ground with my colleagues. It was the tone of the voice in
  the m essages that made me go into the ground and there was a specific
  m essage requesting all available officers to go Into the ground. I can’t recall
  the time of the specific m essage other than to say that when I entered the
  ground the j players were still on the pitch.        I have been referred to
  photographs In order to familiarise myself with the ground.          I remember
  walking from the Spion Kop end towards the Leppings Lane end. Once I had

       I do not recall w hether David Duckenfield read from a p rep ared script during
       the briefing. I have been referred to DPP DOCl94(Div 17 at page 1148).
       Serial 1 containing a number of police officers would be facing the Leppings
       Lane terrace, amongst others, from the perirjjejenrack. The document says
       that this serial was to take its meal, staggered tor the match, in the gym. I am
       referred to page 1157. Serials 14 and 15 were to police the Leppings Lane
       terrace and rear enclosure south and north, and, according to the document
       serial 14 was to take its meal after kick-off in the gym, with serial 15 taking its
       meal in the gym after half-time. I cannot say that it was to be serial 1 and not
       14 or 15 which was to have its meal before, kick-off. I thought it strange at the
       time that any serial would have its meal before kick-off, but what I heard might
       have been a reference to serial 1.


       Dealing wit»!i the radio transmissions requesting the opening of the gates. I
       cannot recall whether the request was to open the gate or the gates. I have
       no recollection of any particular gate or gates at the Leppings Lane end being
       identified by letter or number.

              Dear Mr Croston

              Private Prosecution by Anne Adllngton of David Duckenfield and Bernard Murray

              The stipendary magistrate at Leeds has committed Mr Duckefield and Mr Murray to Leeds
              Crown Court for trial on alleged offences of manslaughter and neglect of duty. The
              prosecution has been brought by a private individual, Ms Anne Adlington.

              Now that the matter has been committed I wonder if the Director of Public Prosecutions will
              be reviewing the matter to determine whether he will take over the prosecution and conduct it
              himself.

              In the months leading up to the commital I have received numerous requests from Ms
              Adlington for material held in the South Yorkshire Police archieves. I expect Ms Adlington
              will be contacting me again in the very near future to seek further material to sustain the
              prosecution. Clearly, if the Director of Public Prosections takes over the proseuction then it
              would be inappr9priate for me to furnish her with that material.

              I will be obliged if you would advise me of the Director of Public Prosecutions intentions. If
              the Director of Public Prosecutions does not take over the prosection I will be obliged to
              receive your advice on how to respond to the requests I am likely to receive from
              Ms Adlington.

              Yours sincerely s

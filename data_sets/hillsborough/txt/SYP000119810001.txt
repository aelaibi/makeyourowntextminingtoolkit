    I,     GRAHAM     HENRY    MACKRELL,    of
                     Derbyshire, WILL S A Y :-


    My date of birth is


    I am employed as the Secretary of Sheffield Wednesday Football
    Club.     My employment history is as follows


    After completing my O-levels at school I joined Thornton Baker
    (as     they     were then known), a firm of Accountants,          at     their
    Bournemouth office.            I qualified as an Accountant and became a
    Fellow of the Association of Certified Accountants in 1976.


    In     the interim I left Thornton Baker in about August 1974                        to
    join     the     staff    of   Bournemouth Football     Club,     and     I         was
|   appointed Club Secretary shortly after that.


k   At    that time Bournemouth were a Third Division Club but                     they
    were     in fact relegated to the Fourth Division the year                 after
    I     joined     them.     The facilities at the Club      were       therefore
    fairly     basic, but when the Safety of Sports Grounds Act                     1975
    ("the     Act")     became     law I was aware of it and of        the     Green
    Guide     that     was    subsequently issued.      The Club    was      not         of
    course     a designated Club within the terms of the Act                 because
    of     its status, but certainly work done at the Club thereafter
    had     regard to the provisions of the Act and the Green                 Guide.
    One     of the Directors of Bournemouth F.C. at that time was                        an
    Architect,        and he took a lead part in organising         alterations
    and     improvements to the Ground, but I worked closely with him
    throughout that time.

                                                                                  . .   I.   .
’   In     November        1981     following         an    approach          from       Luton        Town
    Football Club I resigned my position at Bournemouth and became
    Secretary        to Luton Town F.C.               I remained with that Club until
    I     resigned in November 1986, and virtually immediately there­
    after     joined Sheffield Wednesday Football Club in nv                                      present
    position.


    When I joined Luton Town Football Club they were in the Second
    Division        and     won the Second Division championship that                                 year
    becoming        promoted to the First Division.                      At that time                First
    and     Second Division Clubs were designated under the Act,                                           and
    as     Secretary        to     the Club I had           responsibility               for       safety
    matters.             Assuch     I   was    the        Club's        representative                      at
    meetings        of     the Committee set up by the Local Authority                                     for
    the     purpose        of     licensing         the    Ground       under          the    Act.              I
    reported        on     safety       matters       to    the     Board,         and       the      Club
    retained        a firm of Consulting Architects who dealt                                with          all
    matters        relating        to    safety requirements.                 I    dealt          with          a
    particular           Partner in that Architectural Practice, one
             who     would        inspect the Ground and the facilities                              on         a
    regular         basis         to ensure      that      we     did    comply          with              the
    requirements of the Act and the Green Guide.


    When     I joined Sheffield Wednesday Football Club as                                   Secretary
    the     Club     had already an estabished system for                              dealing        with
    safety     matters,          licensing by the Local Authority and require­
    ments     of     the        Act and the Green Guide generally.                           The      Club
    retained         Consulting          Engineers,         Eastwood          &    Partners,               who
    performed        the same       role      for    Sheffield          Wednesday            as            the
    Architects retained by Luton Town F.C. had performed for them.
    Similarly        in     my     position as Secretary I am                     in     effect            the
    Chief     Executive           of the Club, and I have overall                        control            of
    safety matters reporting to the Board on that as well as other
    topics connected with the running of the Club.


    Since      my        appointment       the       composition         of       the        Board          of
    Directors        has not changed.               The Chairman is Mr. Herbert McGee

                                                                                                     . .   I.   .
and        there     are 6 other Board members.             They are in           effect            a
non-executive              Board who take nonetheless a close interest                          in
the     affairs        of     the     Club and   who 'regularly            attend        Board
meetings.            There     are regular Board meetings, perhaps 9                      each
year.         The Club is, to my knowledge, a little unusual in that
the     members        of the Board between them hold only 4.8% of                             the
issued        share        capital and there is in fact no                single     entity
who     has        anything     approaching       control of        the     Club.         Each
member        of     the     Board, in his non-executive             capacity,           takes
special           responsibility        for a particular activity.                Thus         for
example           Matthew Sheppard, the Vice-Chairman,               is an Accountant
and     responsible           for      financial matters.          Keith     Addy        is         a
builder/developer              with     responsibility       for     the     Ground            and
oremises.


Insofar as the full time management of the Club is concerned I
am assisted by 6 departmental heads as follows:-

        Team Manager                             Ron Atkinson

           Sports Hall Manager

Douglas           Lock has special responsibility for security matters.
I     have . seen and read a copy of the Statement he has                           already
prepared, and it accurately describes his position and role as
Chief        of     Security.         He has primary responsibility                for         the
recruitment, training and supervision of Stewards and Gatemen,
I     am     aware     of     the fact that       Stewards     are        given     written

                                                                                         . .   I.   .
instructions                 at     the commencement of each Season, as                 to         the
duties        they are required to perform etc.                       Furthermore, at the
start        of     each Season, Mr. Lock organises training                         evenings.
There were 2 successive training evenings for the commencement
of      the         1988/89             Season,     on   one    of   which      “here         were
instructions, demonstrations etc. laid on for Stewards, and on
the     second          evening for Gatemen, Car Park Attendants and                               the
Like.         I    was present throughout the first of those                          evenings
and for part of the second evening but I had to leave early on
the second evening to attend a Board meeting.                                At the training
evening video films dealing with emergency procedures etc. and
produced          by one of the country's Police Forces were shown, as
well as demonstrations given on First Aid techniques, mouth to
mouth        resuscitation                etc. and talks also by the Fire               Brigade
personnel as well as Mr. Lock himself.


I     have        always considered Douglas Lock to be a very able                                 and
reliable Security Officer, perhaps uniquely experienced in the
sense        that he was previously a Superintendent with the                                South
Yorkshire Police Force in which capacity he had a good deal of
responsibility                    for    supervising      the    policing      of    Sheffield
Wednesday           Football             Ground at Hillsborough.         He is a man .who
has written and had published articles on policing of football
matches           and        because        of his background he has also            been           of
assistance to me in liaison with the South Yorkshire Police.


                        is        the    Club     Caretaker     in   charge     of      general
maintenance.                  He has been with the Club some 40 years and                           is
in     fact        approaching retirement.                 Essentially he carries                  out
running           repairs of a maintenance nature, and will often carry
out     small           works           requested    by Mr.     Eastwood.       He    has          the
assistance of 2 men who work in his team,                                            and
         and there are also about 10 cleaners who are employed on
a regular part-time basis


The     Groundsman is                                    and he- has a number of             staff
working with him in keeping the pitch in good condition.

                                                                                             . .   I.   .
In     my     capacity              as Secretary to the Club                          I        have     executive
responsibility effectively for the overall organisation of the
Club's        activities.                 As         such I am the              person           with        overall
responsibility                    for     safety matters, and liaise directly                                      with
the     Working              Party        set        up    under the            aegis           of     the        Local
Authority.                  This        Working Party consists                       of        representatives
from         the        Police           and     Fire           Brigade,        and        also        from         the
Surveyors/Structural                            Engineers'                Department                   and          the
Environmental                 Health           Department              of the        City        of     Sheffield
(formerly               the South Yorkshire Metropolitan County                                         Council).
These        meetings              are held on an annual basis for the                                      purposes
of     licensing the Club under the Safety of Sports Grounds                                                        Act
1975,        and the Safety Committee make a thorough inspection                                                     of
the     Ground              each year for that purpose.                          In the              past,        those
inspections                  would        normally              take     place        in        about        August.
However           in        1988 we brought the inspection forward to May                                            of
that        year, and the same is happening this year, the intention
being        to        give        the     Club plenty of time                       to        carry        out     any
necessary              work        that        might       be required as                  a     condition           of
issuing the License.


Prior        to        the        annual meeting of the Safety Committee                                      it     is
usually           the        practice           for Eastwood & Partners to                             carry        out
their own thorough inspection of the Ground to make sure that,
so     far        as we can, it is in first class condition before                                                  the
Safety Committee inspect.                             In fact as part of that process the
Consulting              Engineer will issue a Certificate confirming their
inspection,                 and     they are also required to carry out                                      certain
tests - for example tests on crush barriers.


If     Eastwood              & Partners, upon carrying out their                                      inspection,
came        across           any matters upon which they needed a decision                                            I
would        be the person with whom they would liaise at the                                                     Club.
Similarly               if        there        was        any     member        of        the        Club     staff,
including              Mr.        Lock, who thought that there was                                   some     matter
relating               to     the        structural              integrity           of        the     Ground        or
otherwise           relating to the Green Guide or the Act, “hey                             would
draw        it to my attention and I would then deal with Eastwood &
Partners.           Thus, for example, Douglas Lock wouid not                          normally
have        direct contact with the Consulting Engineers -                             anything
he had to do or say would be done through m e .


I am also primarily responsible for liaison with the Police in
relation           to the policing of matches at the Ground.                          The     Club
signs       an      annual          Contract with the        South      Yorkshire           Police
Authority           for the provision of Police Officers on match days.
There         is     an    annual           meeting     called    by    the     Police        with
representatives                of     all 5 Yorkshire Clubs who come under                        the
jurisdiction              of        the     South     Yorkshire     Police.       They            are
Sheffield            Wednesday,             Sheffield     United,      Doncaster        Rovers,
Rotherham           and Barnsley F.C.               At that meeting there is usually
a     general        discussion relating to policing and football,                                and
it     is     invariably my practice to attend with a member of                                   the
Board       of Directors. In addition to that annual meeting                                 there
is     regular        liaison             with the Police throughout            the     Season.
Thus,       for example, when the Fixture List is published in June
of     each        year I send a copy to the Police for                       their     comment
prior       to      commencement             of     the Season and they         may     have        a
particular           request          in     relation to matches         on     the     Fixture
List.         I     recall,          for     example, that last Season            we        had     a
fixture           against Newcastle United on Boxing Day and the Police
asked       us to bring the kick-off forward to 12 noon and we                                    did
so.         I do not recall them giving a particular reason for that
      the position is that if the Police, with their knowledge of
policing           matters, ask me to co-operate with them in                          relation
to     particular matches I will always attempt to do so in every
way     possible and I would not, for example, require a detailed
explanation           from          them     as in that instance, as to               why     they
wished a particular change to be made.


For     matches played at Hillsborough the Police Liaison Officer
(Inspector           Sewell)          would normally contact me a week or                     more
before        the match was to take place.                   For a normal match where
an     unusual        crowd was not expected the contact would be                              made
probably        to     find       out such details as            which     turnstiles            we
intended        to     open, what time they were to be opened                         etc.       so
that     he     could        be    sure     that     our   plans     for       manning          the
turnstiles            and     stewaraing       the     Ground      complied          with       his
knowledge        of arrival times for visiting fans etc.                            If it were
a particularly large match where we would expect,                              for example,
a     large number of Away supporters as well as Home                               supporters
then     the degree of liaison will naturally increase as a                                    good
deal     of more detailed planning has to go into the policing of
it     from the point of view of providing extra Police                               Officers
and,     from        the Club's point of view, deployment of                         Stewards.
Inspector            Sewell       is     assisted     in   his     liaison          duties       by
Detective        Constable Charlesworth stationed at Hammerton                                 Road
Police        Station, and I would have a degree of contact with him
as     well.         For example it would be my normal practice,                            prior
to     a Home fixture, to speak to the Secretary of the                               visiting
Club     for     information             as to the number of Away              fans       to     be
expected        having regard to their ticket sales etc. and I would
pass that information on to the Police to assist them in their
planning.


The     average        gate       this year at Hillsborough has                    been     about
20,000        fans.         For    the     normal     or   average       attendance             the
Contract        with        the Police will lay down the number of                        Police
Officers         who are deployed.                  That   number        can       however       be
increased        at     the discretion             of the Police Authority                if    a
particularly heavy gate is expected, for example, or indeed if
the     Away fans are expected to be unruly.                       Where the number is
being increased it is not the practice of the Police Authority
to     discuss and agree with me beforehand how many extra Police
they     will involve.             I have never required them to agree extra
numbers         with me or                queried a Police invoice for manning -the
invoice        is in fact related tothe size of the gate as set                                 out
in     the Contract with them, save for some matches such as                                    the
F.A.     Cup     semi-final, which would be charged on                         a     different
basis.         The Accounts for the Club indicate that for the                                 year
ended     May 1988 the Club paid a total of £97,731 to the                                 South
Yorkshire Police for policing the Ground.                        Of that sum a total
of     £39,800 related to the policing costs of the 1988 F.A. Cup
semi-final between Liverpool F.C. and Nottingham Forest F.C.


I am aware of the fact that the South Yorkshire Police draw up
an     operational           plan for each Home game at              Hillsborough              and
thev do not normally provide a copy of that plan to a Club.                                      I
have however in the past asked for one if only out of interest
to      see     how        they       organise    the   deployment       of        Police       in
controlling crowds, and when I have asked I have been provided
with a copy.


In     mv dealings with the Police over the y e a r s , in relation to
Hillsborough              policing,        I   would say that they have             made        it
plain     that        they regarded the function of Stewards                        from       the
Club     as     directing people to their seats, and                     manning           gates
around        the Ground.             They very much regarded the Police                   being
in     charge of crowd control generally, both inside and outside
the     Ground,           and indeed the written instructions to                     Stewards
which     we        issue every year take these factors                  into        account.
Thev     were       drafted by Douglas Lock and approved by me, and                              I
have     no     doubt           he    drafted them having       regard        to     his       own
experience           as     a        Superintendent     with   the    South         Yorkshire
Police.


I     would say that in my experience in the context of                              policing
within        the     Ground, the Police are most concerned                        about       the
question        of segregating Home and Away fans.                    It is my           belief
that they regard that as the primary means by which they avoid
crowd trouble.


There     are        contingency plans agreed with the Police, to                             deal
with     an emergency situation at the Ground. Arrangements                                   with
the     Police        basically           cover evacuation of the Ground                 in     an
emergency           and     all        Stewards are trained in        that         procedure.
Their     task        is        simply     to man and open the        gates         to     allow
people        out of the Ground in an orderly fashion.                                     Before        each
game     the        Police meet with the Referee and discuss                                  with         him
the     emergency procedures which would be involved in                                        stopping
the     game        and evacuating the Ground.                       To my knowledge                    these
emergency           procedures                 have been tested during match days,                          to
ensure        that        they work properly, and the test procedure                                     will
involve           the     broadcast cf a message over the tannoy,                                  by      the
Police        Operator,           which will act as a signal to the                            Stewards
and     the        Police Officers to take their positions for                                     dealing
with     an emergency situation.                             In that context I would explain
that     the        tannoy system is one where the Police Control                                        Room
has     the        ability        to           operate it as well          as        the     Club        Disc
Jockey/Announcer,                 but the Police have an override facility so
that     they can cut across any announcements being made by                                               the
Club     Disc           Jockey        in           order to    broadcast        a     message.            The
procedure           for emergencies involves the Police control of                                        the
tannoy            system        and        I        cannot    envisage     a        situation           where
emergency           messages would be broadcast by Club staff.                                     If, for
example,           I became aware of an emergency which necessitated                                          a
tannoy        announcement,                    I    would report that to the                 Police         so
that     thev           could make the announcement, rather than                              make          it
myself.


As to contingency plans for coping with spectators coming into
the Ground, this is done on specific occasions when the Police
would        be     aware that visiting supporters who may have an                                        all
ticket        arrangement, might have a contingent arriving                                        without
tickets           or,     for     example, where they might                         expect     a        large
number        of        spectators to arrive who would be seeking                                  to     pay
cash     at        the turnstiles.                    They would then          have        arrangements
with     us for turnstiles to be opened to admit such                                        spectators
or,     in        the     case        of an all ticket match,                   they       would         have
arrangements              made        to remove spectators without tickets                               from
the     vicinity of the Ground.                          That, for example, happened very
recently with the Middlesbrough game where the space available
for     Middlesbrough                 supporters was severely restricted due                                to
the     closure           of the west stand area following the                               events         on

                                                                                                        . ./ . .
15th        April.           The Police anticipated there might be a lot                            of
Middlesbrough                supporters and had contingency plans in                       place,
to     my knowledge, to hold spectators arriving wit hour,                                tickets
at     a     nearby Police sports ground.                     Other than “hat I am                not
aware of any other contingency plans to deal with the question
of a mass of spectators arriving for entrance sucn as happened
at the semi-final on 15th April.


I     have       stated that Stewards are instructed to man                          all        exit
gates        from the Ground, but the exception to that is the gates
in     the       perimeter fencing which allow access onto the                             pitch.
During        the period that I have been with Sheffield Wednesday I
cannot        remember any instance where those gates were manned by
Stewards          - it is Police who are normally stationed along                                 the
perimeter and I believe that the numbers of people standing on
the        perimeter          would        be     kept as low as     possible        to        avoid
obstructing the view of spectators behind the fence.                                  I cannot
remember              however        any        instance    where   there     was         express
discussion             and        agreement with the Police that they would                        be
responsible             for manning those perimeter gates instead of Club
Stewards          -     it is just something that has always happened                              in
practice          during          my time with the Club.            Overall I would               say
that       there        is        very close liaison between the Club                 and         the
Police        and       this        is     particularly so having           regard        to      the
relationship between Doug Lock and the South Yorkshire Police.


On     a     match          day     the Police will          have   their     own     briefing
sessions         with         the        Ground, both a general briefing              for         all
Officers              and     specific          briefings     for   Officers        posted         to
different             sections around and within the Ground, as far as                               I
am aware.           They also brief our Stewards on a sectional basis -
i.e.       the Officer dealing with policing in the west stand area
will brief the Stewards who are working in that area and like­
wise       the      Officer in charge of the Spion Kop will                         brief         the
Stewards          in        that area and so on.             The Stewards will also                be
briefed          by Douglas Lock on match day, and since he has direct
supervision             of        those     Stewards I leave that           aspect     to         him

                                                                                               . ./ . .

from     time to time attended briefing sessions.


F.A.     Cup           semi-finals have been held at Hillsborough in                          1987
(Leeds        v. Coventry City);             in 1988 and 1989.          These latter two
games         have        both     involved        Liverpool     F.C.    and      Nottingham
Forest F.C.               In     1987 the match was moved to a Sunday at                       the
request        of the Police because they anticipated there might be
difficulties              with     Leeds     United     supporters.         Chief         Super­
intendent              Brian Mole was in charge of the policing as                        indeed
he     was     for         the 1988 game.           For the 1987 game I do          in        fact
have     a     copy of the Police operations mannual                       which      is       the
writtan            instructions issued by the South Yorkshire Police                           for
policing           the     game.         I cannot now remember          exactly      when       I
obtained           a     copy     of    that - it may well have been           after           the
fixture            took        place and to the best of my recollection I                      was
given        a copy        when I requested it because I was interested                        to
see     how they           were organising thematch from their end.                           That
match         took        place        on Sunday,    12th April,    1987       and        a    few
weeks        before        there       was a briefing meeting arranged                at       the
request        of        the     Police.     The earlier briefing           was      on       20th
March        and        involved Brian Mole together with                                      and
                               of Leeds United, and                          of      Coventry
City.        I attended, with my assistant,


For     the        1988        semi-final, which took place on 9th                 April        of
that     year,           the     early     briefing meeting took           place      in      the
Boardroom              at Hillsborough on 23rd March with Mr. Mole present
and     with           Peter     Robinson        of Liverpool    and                            of
Nottingham             Forest..          It involved discussion with the                  Police
and     the        participating Clubs as to which areas of the                           Ground
their        supporters           would     be attending, how tickets              would       be
colour-coded              and marked for each set of supporters, where car
parking            arrangements            and    parking   of     coaches        would        be
organised and matters of that nature.
For     the 1989 semi-final there was no such prior meeting                             with
the     Police - I understood they felt one was not necessary                                as
the     game        involved effectively an action replay of                    the     year
before,        when     the     same teams were involved        and        once        again
Nottingham           Forest     fans were to be accommodated in the                    Spion
Kop and the south stand areas, and the Liverpool fans would be
accommodated in the north and west stand areas.


My own recollection of the semi-final which took place in 1988
is     that everything went extremely smoothly, and indeed I have
referred           to the file I kept for that fixture and the                    records
indicate           that we had comparatively little by way of damage to
the     Ground        afterwards.          There   were in   fact     a     couple           of
letters        from     supporters         afterwards, including          one     from        a
Liverpool supporter who expressed his appreciation for the way
in     which        the game had been organised and stewarded.                    My        own
recollection           is     that there were no problems in              getting           the
fans     into        the Ground on time for kick-off that year, but                          my
memory        is     that     the     Liverpool fans    in   particular           arrived
earlier that year than they did for the 1989 semi-final.


The     draw        for the F.A. Cup semi-final took place                 on     Monday,
20th     March.        I was telephoned by Steve Clark, the Competition
Secretary of the Football Association, that morning before the
meeting        of     the F.A. took place.          He asked me to contact                  the
Police       to     confirm         that   if Hillsborough   were     awarded               the
semi-final          between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, that they
would        once again insist upon the Nottingham Forest fans being
accommodated           in     the Spion Kop and south stand areas.                     As     a
result        I spoke on the telephone to Chief Superintendent Brian
Mole     who confirmed that that would be the case.                       I was        aware
of     the     Police reason for so insisting - it enabled                      them         to
have     more        effective control over the flow of fans                    into        the
Ground,        since the Nottingham Forest fans, in journeying                          from
Nottingham,           would     normally arrive at the Penistone Road                       end
of     the        Ground via Junction 34 of the Ml, and Liverpool                           fans
would        exit the Motorway so as to arrive at the Leppings                              Lane
end via the A61 from Junction 3 6 of the Motorway.


I    telepnoned            Steve     Clark and confirmed        what      Chief        Super­
intendent            Brian        Mole   had   told    me.     The     semi-final              at
Hillsfaorougn was later confirmed by telephone and this enabled
us     to     put arrangements in hand for the printing                     of        tickets
et c .


I    recall “hat a couple of days before the semi-final the F.A.
telephoned           to     enquire whether the Club would be providing                          a
Doctor        positioned           near the playing area.            Arrangements             had
already           been made by                        for the Club Doctor,             Doctor
Bill        Purcell,        to attend and he had been allocated                  a     ticket
which        would seat him in the south stand in the pen behind the
dug-out.           I believe the F.A. were concerned about the presence
of     a Club Doctor because of a recent event which had received
some publicity, where a Bristol Rovers player had been injured
on the field and had swallowed his tongue and needed emergency
treatment.


I    now      turn to events that occurred on the day of the                          match,
15th       April,         1989.      I arrived at the Ground           between         7      and
7.30 a.m.           Immediately after arriving I walked right round the
Ground,           as is my normal practice before a game, to check                            for
myself        the     general state of things.               I would be     looking            to
see, for example, that the Ground was generally tidy.


I    had      a     number        of tasks to perform that           morning         such      as
finalising          T.V.      arrangements, including means of access                         for
television            crews,         dealing   with     the    issue      of         passes,
co-ordinating arrangements for a luncheon to be held involving
Management           of     the 2 competing Clubs, and F.A. Officials                         and
local dignitaries.                 The guests started to arrive shortly after
II a.m.


                                                                                           . ./ . .
I     recall, during the course of that morning, that I met                                            with
Douglas           Lock in the reception area in the south stand offices
and        talked to him about the arrangements for the day.                                      It      is
normal           for Doug Lock to seek me out on a match day to enquire
whether           I     had        any     special instructions           for        him     and         the
Stewards.               On     this        occasion I needed to talk to                    him        about
arrangements                 for opening the turnstiles.                 That arose              because
originally              we had agreed with the Police that the                             turnstiles
would open at 12 noon, and a potential problem had then arisen
as     a        result        of some information that was                    inserted           in      the
Liverpool              Programme,              for Liverpool fans, the previous                       week.
That        arose           because Sheffield Wednesday played                       Liverpool            at
Anfield           on Saturday, 8th April, and the Sheffield Police                                       had
arranged              for     an     article        to be inserted        in        the     Liverpool
Programme              giving        instructions to Liverpool fans as to                             their
journey               from     Liverpool           to     Sheffield     for     the        F.A.         Cup
semi-final,                 arrangements           for     car parking etc., and                 it     was
stated           in     that        document        that "Gates will           be     opened           from
II a.m.,               with         pre-match           entertainment     and         refreshments
available               inside           the    Ground."       Subsequently           the         Police
realised              that this information clashed with the                          arrangements
that they had made with me, for the turnstiles to be opened at
12     and I was asked by Inspector Sewell, as I recall,                                         whether
we     could assist by having Turnstile Operators there to open a
few        of     the        turnstiles           early if there        was     a     build-up            of
spectators outside.                       I had confirmed there would be no problem
with that,             since Stewards and Turnstile Operators had standing
instructions                 to be at the Ground no later than 11 a.m. on the
semi-final day.


During           the        hours leading up to the start of the game                             I     was
busy        dealing with a variety of organisational matters.                                         As is
my normal practice I would,                         from time to time, walk out of the
office and check the position in the Ground itself.                                         Thus, for
example,              on more than one occasion I walked down the players'
tunnel           to     see        how the spectators were building up,                          and      my
principal              recollection is that Nottingham Forest were filling

                                                                                                      . ./ . .
up     their         end    of     the Ground at a quite      early         stage, but
Liverpool            supporters were not.        As I recall that          in fact was
remarked           an by several members of staff during the course                         of
that     day.        From time to time I would also walk outside to see
how     matters        were outside the Ground.        I remember walking                   up
the     private        road       that   runs alongside the     river        from          the
Directors'           entrance to the Leppings Lane entrance.                The Police
had     created        a    sterile area along      part of that       roadway,             by
erecting barriers just beyond Gate C at Leppings Lane end, and
a     further series of barriers near the "dog-leg" corner                            close
to Gate E.           I did in fact have to speak to the Police there to
arrange for some cars to be allowed to park within the sterile
area,        since     visiting dignatories from Nottingham Forest                         had
been     allocated parking spaces there.              As I recall there was a
group        of foot officers of the South Yorkshire Police                      manning
each     of        those    2 barriers - perhaps of the order of 8                    -     10
Officers at each barrier.


The     last occasion when I visited the Leppings Lane end before
problems built up later was probably shortly after 2 p.m., but
I     cannot        put anything like an exact time on it.                 However          my
recollection           of     the situation at Leppings Lane at that                      time
was     that        the number of Liverpool supporters was starting                         to
build up - there was a substantial group of them present but I
would        net say that the area was packed solid.              I can say that
nothing        about the scene at that time struck me as unusual                            or
potentially dangerous.


Subsequently           I    was     in and out of the office     (I        had    placed
myself        in                         office that afternoon)       at     intervals
and     on     more than one occasion I would have walked                    down          the
players'           tunnel to see what was happening on the pitch and on
the     stands        and     terraces, from inside the        Ground.           It       was
still        the     case     that it was noticeable that        Liverpool                fans
were     slower building up in the north stand and the west stand
areas than the Nottingham Forest fans.



                                                                                      . ./ . .
I     had agreed with the media and with the television crews                                      in
particular              as to how they should position themselves prior to
commencement                 of     the match because they were anxious to                       film
the     teams           coming           out onto the pitch.         In    particular           Brian
Clough,           the        Nottingham Forest Manager, was very much in                          the
news     at        that           time     because        he had   been    banned     from        the
touch-line              and I knew that they were anxious to film him                             and
were     aware              that     he     had been allocated a seat           in     the        pen
immediately                 behind        the dug-out.        As I recall,    I was        out     on
the     pitch           when the Liverpool team came out, and                       just        after
they     came onto the pitch Doug Lock came up to me and told                                      me
that     Gate           C     had either been opened or broken                 down        at     the
Leppings           Lane end and as I recall he told me that about 300 -
400     people              had entered through the gate.                 I said I would           go
and     see what the problem was and I immediately pushed my                                      way
through           the        photographers           in     the area and     walked        up     the
players'           tunnel.               At that stage the Nottingham           Forest           team
were     also           on the pitch, but the photographers                    were        waiting
for the arrival of Brian Clough,                            I believe.


I walked out of the Ground and around through the sterile area
to     Gate        C at Leppings Lane.                    I imagine the match       must         have
kicked           off at about that time but I cannot be certain.                                 Once
the     teams were out on the pitch the noise from the huge crowd
inside the stadium was such that it would be difficult to tell
from     outside whether the kick off had taken place and in                                      any
event        I     was concentrating on the problem in hand.                          In        going
through           the sterile area I did, of course, pass the groups of
foot     officers              who were on duty at each set of barriers,                          and
when     I        arrived           at Gate C the gate was            partially       open*         A
mounted           Police           Officer was positioned outside the                 gate        and
there     was           a line of.fans walking in and as I recall                          he    was
shouting           to the fans indicating to them that they should                                not
come through in that queue unless they had a ticket.                                   The fans
who     were walking through were holding up the tickets for                                      him
to see that they had one.                       There seemed to be a number of fans
around          who did not have tickets and could not get access as a
result.


As     I       walked through the gate I recollect that there                             were     a
couple          of Police Officers stationed just inside it and one of
our        Stewards, Richard Beadslev,                   to whom I spoke.          Looking        at
him he seemed a bit shaken, and I asked him whether he was all
right          and     he answered in the affirmative.                    I was       intent      on
making          my     way to the Police Control Box to find out                          exactly
what       was        going        on and to do that I had to walk                 around        the
southern             corner        of    the    west stand and go          through        a     gate
adjacent             to turnstiles 19 - 22 to get to the Box.                         That      gate
was     manned          by Club Stewards who also man the exit Gate E                             at
that point, and they let me through.


I     climbed          up into the Police Control Box and I                       recall        that
Chief           Superintendent                 David    Duckenfield       was     there         with
Superintendent                Bernard Murray and I believe 2 other Officers.
When       I     looked out of the window of the Police Control Box                                I
noticed          for     the first time that they were a large number                             of
Liverpool             supporters           on the pitch around the Liverpool                    goal
area,          that     other supporters appeared to be seeking to                             climb
over the perimeter fence to gain access to the pitch, and some
were       also        climbing or being pulled up from the back                          of     the
terrace up to the seated area in the west stand.                                  I cannot say
whether          the     gates in the perimeter fence were open                          at     that
stage          - “here was such a mass of people around that it                                would
not     have          been     obvious.           I recall that       I    asked        what     was
happening             and was told that people were being crushed in                             the
pens       because of pressure from behind.                        No reference was             made
at     any       stage        to        the gate having been opened,              and     it     was
clearly          an urgent situation where I did not wish to interfere
with       the        Police operations.               They were     giving       instructions
over       their personal radios to Officers as to how they                                   should
deal with the situation on the Ground, and I recall that Chief
Superintendent                Duckenfield was talking to the Police                       Officer
who     had          control        of the Tannoy system telling                him      to     keep
talking        to the crowd.                  As I recall the message that was being
repeated over the Tannoy at that stage was asking the crowd to
keep     calm and remain patient without giving any reason why
i.e.     without explaining the nature of the emergency that                                               had
arisen.           I     recall           that       I did ask whether             there     were           any
fatalities             and     Mr. Duckenfield replied "I believe so,                                 yes".
The     impression I had was that there was a confused situation,
and     I    heard the Police giving instructions to deploy men                                             at
the front of the perimeter fence and to seek bolt cutters.


I left the Police Control Room and went back to the Directors'
area     via          the     kitchens of the Riverside Suite,                        seeking              out
F.A. Officials,                    in         particular       Graham       Kelly,        the         Chief
Executive,             to advise him of what was happening.                           I met him in
the     offices' area, as I recall near the Boardroom, and I told
him         that            what        was        involved    outside       was     not        a     pitch
invasion          but        was a major incident and I took him                           and        Glenn
Kirton       of        the F.A. back to the Police Control Box.                                 When        we
entered        the Control Box you could see through the window that
there       were        a     number           of    people     in    obvious        distress              and
receiving             mouth to mouth resuscitation.                      In discussions                   with
the     Police          it     was        agreed        that    the     match       could           not     be
re-started             but     the Police were anxious not to announce                                    that
fact        to the fans because they feared that fans who might then
leave         the       Ground           would        impede    access       to     the     emergency
services.              Consequently whilst the Police announcer was still
talking        to the crowd at regular intervals over the Tannoy.                                            I
believe        no       formal announcement was made even at                              that        stage
that we had a major incident on our hands.


After        a short while I left the Police Control Box again                                            with
Graham        Kelly          and        Glenn Kirton, and Mr. Kelly said                        that        he
wanted         to           convene            a     meeting    in    the         Boardroom               with
representatives                of all 3 Clubs, F.A. Officials and the                                 match
referee.              Between the 3 of us we gathered the various                                    people
together          in        the Boardroom where a meeting took place and                                    we
discussed             the     abandonment              of the match and agreed                  that        we
would     not formally announce it was abandoned until the Police
considered        that it was safe to do so, having regard to                         their
concern        about     access for emergency vehicles.                 I recall       that
during        the meeting Doug Lock entered the room and said he had
a message from Brian Clough that he was putting his players in
the bath and taking them home, or words to that effect.


Subsequently           I recall that I went back to the Police                      Control
Box     and     was     there when the announcement was made                   over     the
Tannoy        that the match was formally abandoned, the crowd                         were
informed        that there was a major incident and they were                         asked
to remain patiently in their places until they were advised by
the     Police        that     they could disperse in an           orderly          manner,
without        impeding        the        emergency services.     As I    recall        the
announcement           was effective and later the supporters did leave
the Ground in an orderly fashion.


As     to access to the Ground generally,                  for an all ticket           game
I     would expect each turnstile to admit at a rate of about 800
per     hour     with        a good operator on it.          I am aware        that     for
spectators        for        the     standing area at Leppings Lane             on     15th
April     we     expected to have full capacity (10,100)                      and     their
tickets        would indicate that they should gain entrance through
turnstiles        A     - G.       With 7 turnstiles operating I              appreciate
that     it     would        take a period of time before           all       spectators
could     be admitted.             However given that the turnstiles were to
be      opened no later than 12 noon for a kick-off at 3 p.m. and
given     the , experience                of the previous year where          there     had
been     no     difficulty with spectators getting into                   the        Ground
(albeit        some     will always arrive late) I did              not       anticipate
that     there would be a problem on 15th April.                    I would          expect
that                               would      have   put   his   more     experienced
turnstile        operators           on     the turnstiles at the       Kop     end     and
Leppings Lane end, for the terraces, that day.


I     would expect the Stewards manning Gate C (there were some 3
in     number)        to assist in the orderly dispersal of                   spectators
                                                 -    20



once    they           had    come through the turnstiles,                   for    they        would
normally          be     coming Unuuyl* at such & rate that it                           would          b*»
possible          for        Stewards    to   direct them in a               particular             way.
Similarly          the        gate in the dividing wall at the rear                        of           the
west     stand          which        divides the area behind turnstiles A                           -       G
from     the       area covered by turnstiles 1 1 - 1 6                      would be          manned
by      Stewards,             even     though        it    was     open     throughout              that
afternoon,             and     those Stewards would also                   direct        spectators
towards        the          standing     area in pens 5, 6 and 7 m                       the    north
west     corner.             I would not expect our Stewards to be                         standing
on     the terraces themselves because it is not an easy task                                            to
ask     a     Steward to stand on the. terraces                           surrounded       by       Away
fans        for    any        football match.             Those terraces           are     normally
patrolled          by Police with the assistance of visiting                               Stewards
where        appropriate.             I know that there were Liverpool Stewards
in     attendance             at this game.           Apart from those who                may       have
entered           via       the turnstiles, a group of them arrived                            at       the
Club's        offices on 15th April and I authorised their admission
to the Ground as Liverpool Stewards.


In     conclusion I have been asked to comment on two matters                                            in
case it should be felt that they had any bearing on the tragic
events         of 15th April - they relate to the provision o£                                      first
 aid equipment and loudhailers for Stewards.


 In     1988       the        Local Authority             Environmental'         Health        Officer
 inspected             with specific reference to this item and wanted the
 Club       to provide such equipment as was considered necessary by
 the St. J o h n 's Ambulance Brigade.                       I spoke to Peter Wells, the
 Duty       Officer of the St. John's Ambulance, Sheffield area, and
 he provided me with an extract from a booklet listing what was
 required.              I     gave     that     to Alan           Smith    who     organised             the
 purchase          of        the     equipment.            I am     not    aware    whether              the
 Environmental                Health Officer came back to check that they had
 been purchased*




                                                                                                    • • /   • *
St.     John's       Ambulance Brigade are responsible               for        providing
first     aid     cover        at the Ground during matches.                 This is          a
standard        arrangement          with    the     Football    League     and        as     I
understand        that they undertake to provide adequate first                             aid
cover.      They          will have details of our Fixture List                  for        the
Season     and       a      degree    of local knowledge as         to     the     likely
attendances.               If there is any         variation in that Fixture           List
they      are        notified        and    they are also      notified    of     special
occasions such as the holding of an F.A. Cup semi-final at the
Ground.         They        were sent a letter prior to the match on                    15th
April     this year and asked to provide adequate cover and                             they
confirmed they would do so.


Prior to the incident the Club provided no loudhailers for the
use     of Stewards but I was aware that the Police had them                                for
their     own        use.     The Tannoy system was in my view the way                       to
deal     with        any     announcements that needed to be made                 to        the
crowd     and        the     system    is such       that   announcements         can        be
directed        to        particular sections of the Ground including                       out
into     the Leppings Lane area to people outside the turnstiles.


The       number of safety stewards we employ is not a factor which
is     raised        for discussion at Safety Committee meetings in                          my
experience           of     attending such meetings.            I believe       that        the
Club     would stand comparison with virtually any other Club                                in
the     country in relation to the number that we do employ on                                a
regular     basis, and those numbers can be increased for certain
matches     if        a     large crowd is expected, this            being       done        by
agreement between Doug Lock and the senior stewards.


I     have read this Statement and it is true and correct to                                the
best of my knowledge and belief.

I am employed as the Secretary of Sheffield Wednesday Football

Club.   I am a qualified accountant and a Fellow of the

Association of Certified Accountants.   I joined Sheffield

Wednesday Football Club in the latter part of 1986.

When I joined the club it had already an established system for

dealing with safety matters, licensing by the Local Authority

and requirements of the Act and the Green Guide generally.     The

club retained Consulting Engineers, Eastwood and Partners and on

15 April 1989 I was the Safety Officer as per the Safety at

Sports Grounds Act 1975.

Douglas Lock at that time had special responsibility for

security matters.   He had primary responsibility for the

recruitment, training and supervision of Stewards and Gatemen.

I am aware of the fact that Stewards are given written

instructions at the beginning of each season as to the general

duties they are required to perform and which emphasises the

fact that the Police are responsible for public order

situations.   I can produce a copy of these instructions if

required.

I have always considered Douglas Lock to be a very able and

reliable Security Officer, perhaps uniquely experienced in the

sense that he was previously a Superintendent with the South

Yorkshire Police Force in which capacity he had a good deal of

responsibility for supervising the policing of Sheffield

Wednesday Football Ground at Hillsborough.   He is a man who has
GRAHAM HENRY MACKRELL                                     PAGE 2




written and had published articles on policing of football

matches and because of his background he has also been of

assistance to me in liaison with the South Yorkshire Police.

I am also primarily responsible for liaison with the Police in

relation to the policing of matches at the ground.     The club

signs an annual contract with the South Yorkshire Police

Authority for the provision of Police officers on match days.

There is an annual meeting called by the Police with

representatives of all 5 Yorkshire Clubs who come under the

jurisdiction of the South Yorkshire Police.   They are Sheffield

Wednesday, Sheffield United, Doncaster Rovers, Rotherham and

Barnsley Football Clubs.   At that meeting there is usually a

general discussion relating to policing and football, and it is

invariably my practice to attend with a member of the Board of

Directors.   In addition to that annual meeting there is regular

liaison with the Police throughout the Season.   Thus, for

example, when the Fixture List is published in June of each year

I send a copy to the Police for their comment prior to

commencement of the Season and they may have a particular

request in relation to matches on the Fixture List.

For matches played at Hillsborough the Police Liaison Officer

(Inspector Sewell) would normally contact me a week or more

before the match was to take place.   For a normal match where an

unusual crowd was not expected the contact would be made

probably to find out such details as which turnstiles we
GRAHAM HENRY MACKRELL                                    PAGE 3




intended to open, what time they were to be opened etc so that

he could be sure that our plans for manning the turnstiles and

stewarding the ground complied with his knowledge of arrival

times for visiting fans etc.    If it were a particularly large

match where we would expect, for example, a large number of away

supporters as well as home supporters then the degree of liaison

will naturally increase as a good deal of more detailed planning

has to go into the policing of it from the point of view of

providing extra Police Officers and, from the club's point of

view, deployment of Stewards.   Inspector Sewell was assisted in

his liaison duties by Detective Constable Charlesworth, and I

would have a degree of contact with him as well.

The average gate in 1989 at Hillsborough was about 20,000 fans.

In my dealings with the Police over the years, in relation to

Hillsborough policing, I would say that they have made it plain

that they regarded the function of Stewards from the club as

directing people to their seats, and manning gates around the

ground.   They very much regarded the Police being in charge of

crowd control generally, both inside and outside the ground, and

indeed the written instructions to Stewards which we issue every

year take these factors into account.   They were drafted by

Douglas Lock and approved by me, and I have no doubt he drafted

them having regard to his own experience as a Superintendent

with the South Yorkshire Police.

I would say that in my experience in the context of policing
GRAHAM HENRY MACKRELL                                     PAGE 4




within the ground, the Police are most concerned about the

question of segregating home and away fans.     It is my belief

that they regard that as the primary means by which they avoid

crowd trouble.

There are contingency plans agreed with the Police, to deal with

an emergency situation at the ground.    Arrangements with the

Police basically cover evacuation of the ground in an emergency

and all Stewards are trained in that procedure.     Their task is

simply to man and open the gates to allow     people out of the

ground in an orderly fashion.    To my knowledge these emergency

procedures were tested during match days to ensure that they

worked properly, and the test procedure would involve the

broadcast of a message over the tannoy by the Police Operator,

which would act as a signal to the Stewards and the Police

Officers to take their positions for dealing with an emergency

situation.   In that context I would explain that the tannoy

system is one where the Police Control Room has the ability to

operate it as well as the    Club Disc Jockey/Announcer, but the

Police have an override facility so that they can cut across any

announcements being made by the Club Disc Jockey in order to

broadcast a message.    The procedure for emergencies involved the

Police control of the tannoy system and I cannot envisage a

situation where emergency messages would be broadcast by club

staff.   If, for example, I became aware of an emergency which

necessitated a tannoy announcement, I would report that to the
GRAHAM HENRY MACKRELL                                   PAGE 5




Police so that they could make the announcement, rather than

make it myself.



* Who announces the teams and can the tannoy be overridden

during the announcement?



As to contingency plans for coping with spectators coming into

the ground, this is done on specific occasions when the Police

would be aware that visiting supporters who may have an all

ticket arrangement, might have a contingent arriving without

tickets or, for example, where they might expect a large number

of spectators to arrive who would be seeking to pay cash at the

turnstiles.   They would then have arrangements with us for

turnstiles to be opened to admit such spectators or, in the case

of an all ticket match, they would have arrangements made to

remove spectators without tickets from the vicinity of the

ground.

I have stated that Stewards are instructed to man all exit gates

from the ground, but the exception to that is the gates in the

perimeter fencing which allow access onto the pitch.   During the

period that I have been with Sheffield Wednesday I cannot

remember any instance where those gates were manned by Stewards

- it is Police who are normally stationed along the perimeter.

I cannot remember however any instance where there was express

discussion and agreement with the Police that they would be
GRAHAM HENRY MACKRELL                                    PAGE 6




responsible for manning those perimeter gates instead of Club

Stewards - it is just something that has always happened in

practice during my time with the club.    Overall I would say that

there is very close liaison between the club and the Police and

this is particularly so having regard to the relationship

between Douglas Lock and the South Yorkshire Police.

The Police brief our Stewards on a sectional basis - ie the

officer dealing with policing in the West Stand area will brief

the Stewards who are working in that area and likewise the

officer in charge of the Spion Kop will brief the Stewards in

that area and so on.    The Stewards will also be briefed by

Douglas Lock on match day, and since he has direct supervision

of those Stewards I leave that aspect to him although I am

generally aware of what goes on and have in fact from time to

time attended briefing sessions.

FA Cup semi finals have been held at Hillsborough in 1987 (Leeds

v Coventry City); in 1988 and 1989.    These latter two games have

both involved Liverpool Football Club and Nottingham Forest

Football Club.   In 1987 the match was moved to a Sunday at the

request of the Police because they anticipated there might be

difficulties with Leeds United supporters.    Chief Superintendent

Brian Mole was in charge of the policing as indeed he was for

the 1988 game.   That match took place on Sunday 12 April 1987

and a few weeks before there was a briefing meeting arranged at

the request of the Police.

* The club was       issued with a Safety Certificate                  in compliance

with the     Safety at Sports Ground Act              1975 on     21 D e c e m b e r   1979.

My own recollection of the semi final which took place in 1988

is that everything went extremely smoothly, there were no

problems in getting the fans into the ground on time for kick

off that year, but my memory is that the Liverpool fans in

particular arrived earlier that year than they did for the 1989

semi final.

The draw for the FA Cup semi final took place on Monday 20

March.     I was telephoned by                             the Competition

Secretary of the Football Association, that morning before the

meeting of the FA took place.                He asked me to contact the Police

to confirm that if Hillsborough were awarded the semi final

between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, that they would once

again insist upon the Nottingham Forest fans being accommodated

in the Spion Kop and South Stand areas.                    As a result I spoke on

the telephone to Chief Superintendent Brian Mole who confirmed

that that would be the case.               I was aware of the Police reason

for so insisting - it enabled them to have more effective

control over the flow of fans into the ground, since the

Nottingham Forest fans, in journeying from Nottingham, would

normally arrive at the Penistone Road end of the ground via

Junction 34 of the Ml and Liverpool fans would exit the Motorway

so as to arrive at the Leppings Lane end via the A61 Junction 36

of the Motorway.

I telephoned Steve Clark and confirmed what Chief Superintendent

Brian Mole had told me.           The semi final at Hillsborough was

later confirmed by telephone and this enabled us to put

arrangements in hand for the printing of tickets etc.



* Paragraph here to explain fully the turnstile and ticketting

arrangements he made         f o r 1989.




I now turn to events that occurred on the day of the match, 15

April 1989.

During the hours leading up to the start of the game I was busy

dealing with a variety of organisational matters.                          As is my

normal practice I would, from time to time, walk out of the

office and check the position in the ground itself.                           Thus, for

example, on more than one occasion I walked down the players'
GRAHAM HENRY MACKRELL                                     PAGE 9




tunnel to see how the spectators were building up, and my

principal recollection is that Nottingham Forest were filling up

their end of the ground at a quite early stage, but Liverpool

supporters were not.

I visited the Leppings Lane end shortly after 2.00 pm, but I

cannot put anything like an exact time on it.     However my

recollection of the situation at Leppings Lane at that time was

that the number of Liverpool supporters was starting to build up

- there was a substantial group of them present but I would not

say that the area was packed solid.     I can say that nothing

about the scene at that time struck me as unusual or potentially

dangerous.

Subsequently I was in and out of the office (I had placed myself

in             's office that afternoon) at intervals and on more

than one occasion I would have walked down the players1 tunnel

to see what was happening on the pitch and on the stands and

terraces, from inside the ground.     It was still the case that it

was noticeable that Liverpool fans were slower building up in

the North Stand and the West Stand areas than the Nottingham

Forest fans.

As I recall, I was out on the pitch when the Liverpool team came

out, and just after they came onto the pitch Douglas Lock came

up to me and told me that Gate   'C' had either been opened or

broken down at the Leppings Lane end and as I recall he told me

that about 300 - 400 people had entered through the gate.        I
GRAHAM HENRY MACKRELL                                                                    PAGE 10




said I would go and see what the problem was and I immediately

pushed my way through the photographers in the area and walked

up the players' tunnel.                At that stage the Nottingham Forest

team were also on the pitch, but the photographers were waiting

for the arrival of Brian Clough, I believe.

I walked out of the ground and around through                             the sterile area

to Gate      'C' at Leppings Lane.



* W h a t d i d he o b s e r v e w h e n he got      there?




I imagine the match must have kicked off at about                               that time         but

I cannot be certain.              Once the teams were out on the pitch the

noise from the huge crowd inside the stadium was such that it

would be difficult to tell from outside whether the kick off had

taken place and in any event I was concentrating on the problem

in hand.



* At this time         I was    in p o s s e s s i o n of a S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y

Football Club radio but had heard no transmissions                                f r o m the

Police Control Box to myself                 o r a n y m e m b e r s of m y     staff.        I was

c e r t a i n l y u n a w a r e at t h i s t i m e of a n y i n t e n t i o n b y the P o l i c e to

open the exit gates and I was                  not asked for m y advice on such a

decision.




As to access to the ground generally, for an all ticket game, I
GRAHAM HENRY MACKRELL                                       PAGE 11




would expect each turnstile to admit at a rate of about 800 per

hour with a good operator on i t .    I am aware that for spectators

for the standing area at Leppings Lane on 15 April we expected

to have full capacity (10,100) and their tickets would indicate

that they should gain entrance through turnstiles A - G.       With 7

turnstiles operating I appreciate that it would take a period of

time before all spectators could be admitted.       However given

that the turnstiles were to be opened no later than 12 noon for

a kick off at 3.00 pm and given the experience of the previous

year where there had been no difficulty with spectators getting

into the ground (albeit some will always arrive late) I did not

anticipate that there would be a problem on 15 April.

I would expect the Stewards manning Gate     'C'   (there were some 3

in number) to assist in the orderly dispersal of spectators once

they had come through the turnstiles, for they would normally be

coming through at such a rate that it would be possible for

Stewards to direct them in a particular way.       Similarly the gate

in the dividing wall at the rear of the West Stand which divides

the area behind the turnstiles A - G from the area covered by

turnstiles 11 - 16 would be manned by Stewards, even though it

was open throughout that afternoon, and those Stewards would

also direct spectators towards the standing area in pens 5, 6

and 7 in the North West corner.      I would not expect our Stewards

to be standing on the terraces themselves because it is not an

easy task to ask a Steward to stand on the terraces surrounded
GRAHAM HENRY MACKRELL                                   PAGE 12




by away fans for any football match.   Those terraces are

normally patrolled by Police with the assistance of visiting

Stewards where appropriate.   I know that there were Liverpool

Stewards in attendance at this game.

In conclusion I have been asked to comment on the provision of

loudhailers for Stewards.

Prior to the incident the club provided no loudhailers for the

use of Stewards, but I was aware that the Police had them for

their own use.   The tannoy system was in my view the way to deal

with any announcements that needed to be made to the crowd and

the system is such that announcements can be directed to

particular sections of the ground including out into the

Leppings Lane area to people outside the turnstiles.

I have been shown a copy of a 'print out' from the club's

turnstile computer timed at 3.00 pm.   I can say that this is a

true copy and can identify it by the label which I have signed.

                                this moment, at the, at the conclusion

                                of the interview I'11 give you a

                               the tapes.    Do you understand that?
             MACKRELL          I do.

             DSU61             On the 15th of April 1989 (150489)

                               a disaster occurred at Hillsborough

                               Football Stadium and 95 people died.

                               Following the public inquiry and

                               report, the Chief Constable of South

                               Yorkshire Police consulted with the

                               Director of Public Prosecutions and

                               as a result West Midlands Police were

                               requested to do a criminal

01.32
                               investigation.   So far as you are

                               concerned, arising from that

                               investigation, there are possible

                              criminal offences of corporate

                              manslaughter and that is against the

                              Club as distinct to yourself and an

                              offence of, a possible offence of

                              culpable malfeasance, which would be

                              against you as an individual,    i'll

                              explain the specific allegations to

                              you in interview, but do you now

                              understand the nature of this

02.04
                              interview.    Before you answer that

                              I need to formally caution you, you
 MACKRELL               GRAHAM   HENRY


                                  do not have to say anything unless

                                  you wish to do so but what you say

                                  may be given in evidence.     Do you

                                  understand?

             MACKRELL             I do.

             DSU61                I will now remind you that you are

                                  not under arrest and that you need

                                  not remain here, in addition you

                                  are entitled to legal representation

                                  and of course you are aware of that

                                  because                is here anyway.

                                  Do you understand what I have said in

                                 regard to the fact that you are not

                                 under arrest?

            MACKRELL             I do.

            DSU61                Initially you gave evidence to the

                                 inquiry held by Lord Justice TAYLOR.

                                 I have here a transcript of the

                                 evidence and you have a copy in your

                                 folder which it may be necessary

                                 to refer to during the interview.

                                 Are you content to accept the

                                 contents of that transcript, or is

                                 there anything in it which you wish

                                 to clarify before we start?

            MACKRELL             No.

03.10       DSU61                You also submitted a written

                                 submission to Lord Justice TAYLOR in

                                 relation to the Semi-Final on the

                                   15th of April 1989 (150489).        I have

                                  here a copy of that document and

                                  you have a copy also in your folder

                                  which it may be necessary to refer

                                  to during interview.     Are you content

                                  that we do that also?

             MACKRELL             Yes.

                                  I think if we may, I should interject

                                  at this point just to put on record

                                  the fact that Mr MACKRELL has not

                                  reviewed his transcript of evidence

                                 word by word, line by line, for the

                                 purposes of this interview.      So

                                 the answer he has given is broadly

                                 correct no doubt, but there may be

                                 matters when you, when you take him

                                 through the transcript that he will

                                 want to clarify.

            DSU61                I understand that yes.     Presumably

                                 that also relates to his written

                                 submission as well?

                                 He has reviewed the statement, I

                                 believe, his statement.
            DSU61                Okay.

                                 The written submission.

04.07   DSU61                    Fair enough then.   If we could move

                                 on Mr MACKRELL to deal with the

                                 situation as far as your employment

                                 is concerned.   As I understand it,
 MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


                               you're the Secretary of Sheffield

                               Wednesday Football Club, you also

                               describe yourself as Chief Executive

                              you were appointed in December 1986

                               (001286) and you're answerable to a

                              board of seven Directors, responsible

                              for the implementation of policy by

                              the Board.   How far did this extend

                              in relation to you authorising work

                              at the ground?

04.40       MACKRELL          All works of a capital nature of a

                              major capital nature were sanctioned

                              by the Board of Directors.

            DSU61             Yes, so in regard to, so the Spion

                              Kop, and the roof on the Spion Kop,

                              that's something that would have

                              clearly gone to the Board of

                              Directors, considerable financial

                              implications.

04.58       MACKRELL          Indeed, in addition to that

                             obviously works of a major nature

                             we employ EASTWOOD and Partners

                             as our consultants to initially

                             draw up schemes, obtain tenders,

                             costings, because a lot of the work

                             that is done at the football ground

                             is funded by way of grant aid or

                             assisted by way of grant aid and

 MACKRELL               GRAHAM    HENRY


                                   Trust so there are obviously

                                   set, definite procedures which one

                                  must go down the path and obviously

                                  that's why we've particulary used

                                  EASTWOOD and Partners.

             DSU61                Yes.

             MACKRELL             For actually setting us up.

             DSU61                Can you talk about the composition

                                  of the Board Mr MACKRELL, I

                                  understand that there are seven

                                  Directors, we know that Mr ADDY is

                                  one of the Directors with

                                  responsibility for structural

                                  safety work at the ground and we'll

                                  cone to that in a minute, but there

                                 are seven Directors, as I understand

                                 it, it's a non executive Board.     Can

                                 you explain to me what that, what

                                 that means, and you know what what

                                 the structure is?

05.58       MACKRELL             Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

                                 is a public limited company,     it has

                                 seven Directors who basically are

                                 part time in their operation, they

                                 therefore meet on a regular basis

                                 to direct policy of the company.

                                 I'm the Senior Executive of the

                                 Company who looks after all the

                                 non footballing aspects aspects of
 MACKRELL              GRAHAM   HENRY


                                 the company.     Basically the Directors

                                 are, do not have a controlling

                                 interest in the company and

                                 they are appointed under normal

                                 company law by the shareholders in

                                 annual meetings.



06.29       DSU61                So they're responsible to the share

                                 holders.

            MACKRELL             Indeed.

            DSU61                I see, yeah.    Can we deal with the

                                 composition of the Board.    I think

                                composition, I'm right in saying

                                that, since your appointment the

                                Board's been comparatively same

                                Directors, the seven Directors.     Can

                                you name the Directors?

06.48       MACKRELL            Yes indeed.     The Board actually has

                                changed subsequent to the events of

                                15th of April 89 (150489) in, but I

                                will expand on that.    At the time in

                                question, Chairman was Mr H E McGEE,

                                Vice Chairman was a Mr Mathew

                                SHEPHERD, in addition the other

                                Directors were Keith ADDY, Ernest

                                BARON, Cliff WOODWARD, Stanley

                                SPATE and Geoffrey HULLEY.

                                Subsequent to that and at the present

                                time Messrs MrGEE, SHEPHERD and SPATE
 MACKRELL               GRAHAM    HENRY


                                  have retired frcm the Board and we

                                  have new Directors in Mr David

                                  RICHARDS who is in fact now Chairman,

                                  Mr Bob GREARSQN and Mr Joe ASHTON MP.

             DSU61                Mm.     Those changes, I understand it

                                  though, are post the 15th April...

             MACKRELL             Indeed.

             DSU61                1989 (150489).

             MACKRELL             That's right...

             DSU61                So where, where if - sorry to interrup

                                  you.

            MACKRELL              It's alright, just making a point,

                                  that sorry, that Mr GREARSQN and Mr

                                 RICHARDS were appointed in

                                 October 1989 (001089) and Mr

                                 ASHTON was in March 1990 (000390).

07.73       DSU61                Right. So am I right in assuming

                                 then that the, frcm your appointment

                                 which i think was in December 1986

                                 (001286), the Board of Directors

                                 were as you described up until

                                 after the 15th of April 1989

                                 (150489)?

            MACKRELL             Indeed.

            DSU61                Are you aware of the, any changes

                                 in the Directors, the Board of

                                 Directors in the period frcm when

                                 the Safety Certificate was issued

                                 in 1979 (000079) to through to
 MACKRELL               GRAHAM HENRY


                                your appointement If you like, in

                                1986 (000086)?

             MACKRELL           Only by reference to the statutory

                               records of the Company and I wasn't,

                                I wasn't familiar with personally

                               not coming from Sheffield with any

                               of the gentlemen who were previously

                               Directors of the Club prior to m y

                               appointment.

08.41       DSU61              I see.    What type of decisions would

                               you refer to the Board.     I mean

                               we've we've talked about it, that the

                               major capital, the major financial

                               decisions would be referred to the

                               Board and we mentioned the roof on

                               the Spion Kop.    What type of

                               decisions would you deal with

                              yourself?

08.59       MACKRELL           I would make it possibly minor

                              decisions, obviously there is an

                              ongoing discussion say with the

                              police on a matter of policing,

                              policing individual matches,

                              and the policy for individual

                              matches.    Obviously it's the general

                              activities of the Chief Executive

                              of any Company.

        DSU61                 Mm.   Was, would there be any sort

                              of financial constraint or
 MACKRELL               GRAHAM    HENRY


                                   limitation.   Was there any sort of

                                   sealing put on what you could spend

                                  or?

             MACKRELL             It wasn't an actual determined

                                  sealing in that I had an x limit

                                  of which I wasn't to spend more

                                  than the Board, but obviously it

                                  was a situation the Board had

                                  strong financial controls and I

                                  normally wouldn't spend large

                                  capital sums without reference to

                                  the Board.

09.40       DSU61                 Mn.   What, what I'm getting out

                                  can you, is there any definition

                                 what would you consider to be large

                                 can you give us a       ?

09.44       MACKRELL             I would, I would, I would anticipate

                                 I would say large is five, ten

                                 thousand pounds.

            DSU61                Was it the cost element that

                                 controlled, you know what you

                                 referred or was it the type of

                                 decision?

        MACKRELL                 I think basically, it's it's a

                                 financial control element, not the

                                 actual, because obviously I think

                                 when one's talking about referring

                                 to the Board they've obviously got

                                 to monitor all expenditure not in
MACKRELL              GRAHAM    HENRY                                   12


                                matter of to balance up for example

                                whether expenditure should be spent

                                on the sports hall or visa -v- the

                                lottery department and so it's a

                                simple one of that and I think

                                that they appraise the situation

                                and make their decisions accordingly.
10.21      DSU61                I see.   Would you make decisions

                                in relation to work identified as

                                necessary by either EASTWOODS, the

                                Working Party or Advisory Group

                                as you became later, the police or

                                groundstaff in relation to safety

                                matters or would you refer those to

                                the Board or, I mean does that go

                               back to tow much money you're

                                spending?

           MACKRELL             I think it goes back to basically

                               items of capital expenditure

                               obviously if one commits over

                               a thing like the Kqp, then one

                               would, one's talking about a large

                               near seven figure sum, one would

                               refer it to the Board, if one has

                               another item whereby say a barrier

                               to barrier repairs are needed that's

                               reported to me, obviously I would

                               instruct them to go ahead with that

                               work.

  11.03       DSU61                 Mta.    How much interest generally

                                    did the Board take in, in safety of

                                    the Ground, I mean can you give us

                                    seine sort o f ... ?

              MACKRELL             Well the Boards obviously were were

                                   interested in safety.      It was the

                                   sit... it was basically a situation

                                   whereby I was there and EASTWOODS

                                   were there to draw their attention

                                   to matters.     That's EASTWOODS were

                                   responsible from the time when the

                                   Safety Certificate was issued by

                                   South Yorkshire County Council and

                                   obviously they were instructed by

                                   the Board at that time to basically

                                   do what work was necessary to get

                                  the certificate.

             DSU61                 I see.    What, we'll cone back to

                                  EASTWOODS actually shortly but what

                                  what decisions, were, sorry, were

                                  the decisions by the Board on a

                                  majority basis.      You know in other

                                  words was it a diplomatic sort o f ...

          MACKRELL                Quite honestly...

          DSU61                   decision, majority decision?

12.00     MACKRELL                No, it never came to that because

                                  matters of public safety I felt

                                  the Board always went down, went

                                  down the path, if one looks
MACKRELL                GRAHAM    HENRY


                                   statistically, there's only one other

                                  Club in the British Isles under the

                                  last statistics published by

                                  Football Trust, that had spent

                                  more money on or received more

                                  grant aid in respect of safety

                                  and improvement work.

            DSU61                 Yeah.

            MACKRELL              And that's Glasgow Celtic.

12.22       D5U61                 But how, I mean in regard to

                                  decisions by the Board, how were

                                  they made, generally?

           MACKRET.T.             Gen, generally, a a proposition

                                 was put to the Board, and they

                                 obviously mooted by the Board

                                 and then a decision taken.

           DSU61                 So if you've got something that you

                                 wanted to deal with and some work

                                 that needed to be carried out, you

                                 mentioned barriers, earlier,

                                 what you'd do is put a proposition

                                 up to the Board?

           MACKRET.T.            Something like barriers would be

                                 on a routine basis, you know

                                 routine situation if somebody, it's

                                 it's it's almost an on going house

                                 keeping situation of keeping the

                                 ground up to scratch.

        DSU61                    Yes.
 MACKRELL                GRAHAM    HENRY


 12.56       MACKRELL              The Board would mainly be referred

                                   to matters of direct policy or

                                   capital expenditure.   I think

                                   things like barrier repairs are

                                   really an ongoing, an ongoing

                                   cost.

            DSU61                  Maintenance you regard it almost as

                                   maintenance.

            MACKRET.T.             Yeah I would regard that almost

                                   like a, okay as a safety element

                                   but it's a you know, it's a

                                   situation whereby something has

                                   to be done on a, on a regular

                                   basis.

            DSU61                  So unless something, unless it

                                  was a question of sort of

                                  clearing out all the barriers

                                  on the West Terrace or something

                                  like that and spending twenty or

                                  thirty thousand pounds on replacing

                                  them, you wouldn't go to the Board,

                                  you wouldn't expect to go to the

                                  Board?

         MACKRET.T.               No that's right.

13.29    DSU61                    Mm.   Mr McGEE was the, was the

                                  Chairman of the Board, I appreciate

                                  that he's he's now left, but did he

                                  take a leading role in the

                                  decision making process during
 MACKRELL                GRAHAM    HENRY


                                    the period that he was the

                                    Chairman?

 13.39       MACKRELL              Well by the definition of the

                                    fact that he was Chairman

                                   obviously he chaired, yeah he

                                   chaired the meetings.   But it's,

                                   it was, it was basically a a

                                   Board decision and not an

                                   individual decision.

            DSU61                  Mm.   Were there ever occasions

                                   when the Board, members of the

                                   Board sort of greatly differed.

                                   Presumably you sit on all Board

                                   meetings?

            MACKRET.T.             Of course, yeah.   No I've___

            DSU61                 Was there a ....

            MACKRET.T.            No I've never, I've never known

                                  a great diversity of opinion what­

                                  soever .

            DSU61                 No sort of animosity or anything

                                  like that within the Board.      It..?

         MACKRELL                 No.

14.13    DSU61                    I see. Referring to Mr LOCK who who's

                                  described as the Security, describes

                                  himself in fact as the Security

                                  Officer, according to his statement

                                  and transcript of evidence, he

                                  was responsible for the Stewards

                                  the selection briefing and training

              MACKRELL              That's correct yes.

              DSU61                 is that right?    I'll come back

                                    to the role of stewards later but

                                   so far as Mr I£)CK'S concerned,
 14.44
                                   I think he, he mentions that he

                                   was involved with general matters

                                   of crowd safety and was of course

                                   familiar with the Green Code. That's

                                   what what sort of, I'm referring

                                   for the audio tape to the statement

                                   by Douglas John LOCK.    What sort of

                                   involvment did he have in general

                                   safety matters?

             MACKRELL              General safety matters visa viz ...

                                   stewarding.

             DSU61                Crowd safety.

15.17        MACKRELL             Visa viz stewarding and he would

                                  draw matters of possible attention

                                  that, that would be, that he felt

                                  might be, might be of benefit to

                                  the Club.

15.26    DSU61
                                  So how would that work then?    Would

                                  he, you were the Safety Officer?

         MACKRET.T.
                                  That's right, he would report to me,

                                  he acted as the go betwsen, between

                                  myself and all the Stewards etc

                                  on match days.

             DSU61                  So if the Stewards or any member

                                    of the staff, in fact, catering,

                                    it might even be a member of the

                                    catering staff presumably,

                                    turnstile and any of those?

             MACKRELL               That's right.

                                    went to him and said there was a

             MACKRET.T.             Mm.

             DSU61                  something like that then he would, he

                                   wouldn't actually deal with it, he'd

            MACKRET.T.             Yeah the two parts, two parts ccme

                                   to that.   On a normal basis

                                   actually just just to clarify

16.12                              a point, normally the Steward

                                   would go initially to their

                                   individual superior.   We have a

                                     Chief Steward say for the South

                                    Stand...

              DSU61                 Yeah.

              MACKRELL              a Chief Steward for the North Stand

                                    and that person would in fact,

                                    usually normally go then to Doug

                                    LOCK.

             DSU61                  I see.    He wouldn't have authority

                                    to spend any money ...

             MACKRET.T.             No.

             DSU61                  without reference to yourself

                                    at all?

             MACKRET.T.             No, that's right he wouldn't.

 16.34       DSU61                  I see.    Can we now talk about

                                   the role of Mr ADDY and I understand

                                   that in private life Mr ADDY is a

                                   builder developer, property developer.
             MACKRET.T.            That's right.

16.45        DSU61                 But within the Club organisation,

                                   he had all the, he had responsibility

                                   for the ground and the premises,

                                   the structural safety as I understand

                                   it.    According to Mr Me:GEE, Mr ADDY

                                   had responsibility for structural

                                   safety as well,    is that how you

                                   understand the situation?

         MACKRELL                  Basically yes.    I think that one has

                                   to look at the situation of the

17.13                              implementation of the Safety of
 MACKRELL              GRAHAM    HENRY                                 20


                                 Sports Grounds Act.    Keith had,

                                 when the Safety of Sports Grounds

                                 Act was implemented in 78 (000078)

                                 79 (000079), there was no, there

                                 were no executives in football,

                                 with any experience of it, because

                                 obviously it never happened before.

            DSU61                Mm.

            MACKRELL             And as a result of that, Keith as

                                 his, as you say his expertise in

                                 the building development business

                                 obviously was somebody who who

                                 understood the technical nature

                                of certain of the work that was

17.38                           done.    Over the years, gradually,

                                there are people such as myself

                                who have come into the game with

                                inexperience in sixteen, seventeen

                                years, who now have an experience,

                                and so therefore it was his his

                                amount of work that he did lessened

                                at the Club as obviously different

                                personnel took over, like myself.

                                Having said that he took an active

                                interest because of his actual, he

                                under, he understood the technical­

                                ities of it, and I often used to, if

                                I had matters of a technical nature,

                                that EASTWOODS write to me about




                                                                            735
MACKRELL                GRAHAM   HENRY


                                  I would refer it to him just

                                  copy a correspondence over him

                                  to keep him fully briefed of the

                                  situation.

18.13      DSU61                  Mm.    Did he, was he on the Board in

                                  1979 (000079)?

           MACKRET.T.             I believe he was yes.

           DSU61                  So he's, he's as it were seeing this



18.21      MACKRELL               Exactly.     He was right involved in

                                  the early meetings, with the

                                  South Yorkshire, the then South

                                 Yorkshire County Council over the

                                 actual granting of the Safety

                                 Certificate.

                                 I think I should perhaps interject

                                 here to say that in those days I

                                 believe that a Mr WOODWARD...

           MACKRELL              Mr WOODWARD, a Mr WHITEHEAD as

                                 well, they were, they were, they

                                 were two people who used to sit,

                                 but Keith came in earlier.

                                 Keith took over at a later stage

                                 I think, I'm not sure he was the

                                 Director with structural

                                 responsibility or special

                                 responsibilities in structural

                                 matters, until the early eighties

                                 I think ...
 MACKRELL                GRAHAM    HENRY


             DSU61                  Right, so we're not quite...

             MACKRELL               ... at that point, but obviously

                                   an early aspect o f ___

                                   He was a Director then certainly,

                                   but m y recollection is that he did

                                   not take over that responsibility

                                   until later.

             DSU61                 Who are these two other gentlemen

                                   that you were talking about, Mr

                                   WOODWARD?

            MACKRET.T.
                                   Basically WHITEHEAD is a gentleman

                                   who has left the Board, who left

                                   the Board early eighties I believe.

            DSU61                  He was a Director?

            MACKRET.T.             Yes he was.

            DSU61                 They're both Directors then?

            MACKRET.T.            They both were Directors yes, a

                                  chap called Roy WHITEHEAD.

            DSU61                 I see.   And the other guy is again?
            MACKRET.T.            WOODWARD, but I'm not sure on

                                  that one, I have to refer...

                                  (Flicking of paper).     (Pause).

20.00                             Mr WHITEHEAD I think is the, is

                                  the man who was more involved

                                  with it in those days.

        DSU61                     This is involved in the safety

                                  aspects ...

                                  Yes.   In in structure of it.

        DSU61                     Before Mr ADDY?
 MACKRELL            GRAHAM HENRY


                             In construction work around the

                             ground.    It wasn't specifically

                             just related to safety aspects.

                             It was the Director who had a

                             special expertise in areas of,

                            he was in structural steel

                            business as I remember and he

                            had that particular task before

                            Mr ADDY took over.

             DSU61          I see.

 20.31                      I believe Mr ADDY in fact dealt

                            with it in his statement and

                            referred to this.     Mr ADDY said

                            in his statement that he joined

                            the Board of Directors in 1975

                            (000075) and at that time Roy

                            WHITEHEAD was a Director of the

                            Club with a structural steel

                            business and he was regarded

                            as Director with special

                           responsibility for structrual

                           matters at the ground, I took

                           over that responsibility from

                           him when he retired.

            DSU61          Oh, I see.    If we can cone to..

                           presumably b y virtue of this
MACKRELL               GRAHAM   HENRY


                                 responsibility would have some

                                 sort of knowledge of the Green

                                 Guide 1976 (000076) and then

                                 1986 (000086), when that, when

                                 that was issued?

            MACKRELL             He had a knowledge of it, but

                                 predominantly the matters of the

                                 ground safety and elements of

                                 pertaining to it, were hand, were

                                 interview and quite what their role

21.39                           is.   Would, would, dealing with Mr

                                ADDY, would he have a degree of

                                technical knowledge, about, I'm

                                not talking about in the building

                                industry generally, I'm, he would

                                obviously have that from his

                                occupation but I'm thinking more

                                about the Green Guide, the Green

                                Guides plural?

           MACKRELL             Yes, no, sure I don't necessarily say

                                he would of, say he would have

                                technical knowledge of the Green Guide,

                                he had knowledge of the Green Guide

                                but I feel that it would, it would

                                have been a situation, it would be by

            DSU61                on technical matters.

22.39       MACKRELL              I think that the situation often was

                                 that may be EASTWOODS would consult

                                 initially with Mr ADDY because he

                                 had a technical expertise...

            DSU61                Yes.

            MACKRELL             by way of Partner and Son building

                                 terms and it would be left that

                                 then Mr ADDY might put EASTWOODS

                                 proposals to the Board.

            DSU61                In the way that the Board can

                                 understand...

        MACKRELL                 Exactly.

             MACKRELL              Yeah.

             DSU61                 Laymen's type approach.

             MACKRELL              That's right.

             DSU61                 I see.   So he I mean he wouldn't

                                   actually, he ADDY, wouldn't actually

                                   be able to go off and spend money

                                   again in regard to safety

                                   independent of anybody else?

            MACKRELL              No.

            DSU61                 He would be, to some extent,

                                  something similar to yourself, you

                                  he'd help...

23.17       MACKRELL              That's right.    There is basically

                                  the under the corporate structure

                                  no person would have the actual

                                  right to go and do it to no doubt

                                  it would be referred back.

23.30       DSU61                How do you see Mr ADDY'S function

                                 in relation to your own function?

                                 How do do you equate the two?

                                 You're, you are the Safety Officer.

        MACKRELL                 Yeah Mr ADDY I feel, I feel gives

                                 can give me some technical advice

                                 of matters which if I, if i require

        MACKRELL                 I can ask him, you know, can look at.

                                 Again he's explained EASTWOODS even

                                   in reasonable layman's language,

                                   sometimes on occasions you know,

                                   I've asked Keith.

             DSU61                What type of, can you give me an

                                  example of what type of work you're

                                  talking about, Mr MACKRELL the ...

             MACKRELL             Basically there was a dispute

                                  regarding the final payment on the

                                  Kop roof ...

            DSU61                 Mrt.
            MACKRELL              with the main contractors and it dealt

                                 with sub contractors and it rep, dealt

                                  and the sub contractors then

                                 approached us to to for additional

                                 sums of money.   And obviously this was

                                 like on a, on a basis of a building

                                 contract with a main contractor and a

                                 sub contractor and quite honestly

                                 I don't know, I'm the first to admit

                                 I don't know a great deal about

                                 you know the technicalities of

                                 building contracts.

            DSU61                Mrt.
            MACKRELL             And it was something where I 've

                                 showed the correspondence to Keith

                                 and then he advised me said no, on

24.41                            in this particular instance, no, we

                                 have to leave that to EASTWOODS,

                                 they were the Consulting Engineers
MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


                              they were the people who instructed,

                              it must be left for them to decide.

           DSU61              So they, they weren't really safety

                              aspects, they they were. (Overtalking)

           MACKRELL          More technical function.

           DSU61             Building function than a safety

                             function.

           MACKRELL          Indeed.

           DSU61             Can you give us an example in

                             regard to safety how'd you'd,

                             you know in regard to the safety

                             his safety role, your safety role?

25.02      MACKRELL          Well basically if EASTWOODS were for

                             example, you know, I'm I'm I'm

                             trying to actually think of, think

                             of a specific term.   It was

                             predominantly, I must say I can't

                             recall a particular matter on safety.

                             It's mainly in relation to other

                            capital expenditure, Keith, we...

                            over the last, since I've been the

                            Company, the Club have re-roofed the

                            North Stand which was a considerable

                            capital cost and ended up being

                            one hundred and fifty thousand

                            and there was some dispute, or not

                            dispute, some discussion with British

                            Steel over the pitch of the roof,

                            now again I have known nothing about
  MACKRELL               GRAHAM    HENRY


                                    the pitches on flat roofs.

              DSU61                Mrt.
              MACKRELL             And it was that, that he was able to

                                   give us a little bit of advice and

                                   advise me and the Board on that

                                   matter.

 25.50        DSU61                If we talk, you know the barrier 144?

              MACKRELL             Yes.

              DSU61                That was reduced.    I don't want to

                                   ccme in to this into, at this

                                   stage again, in too much detail but

                                   would would you have any conversation

                                   with Mr ADDY, would you seek his

                                   advice in regard to that or would

                                  you simply take the advice of

                                  EASTWOODS, I mean EASTWOODS were

                                  there anyway?

             MACKRELL             Well I have to say that that barrier

                                  144, is before I joined the company,

                                  the removal, the removal of barrier

                                  144.

             DSU61                I used that as an example...

             MACKRELL             Yeah, of course, of course, I would

                                  have thought on something like that,

                                  one .would have relied upon our

                                  Consulting Engineers.

26.26    DSU61                    Okay.    Perhaps this is an appropriate

                                  place to to deal with the role of

                                  the EASTWOODS who are your Consulting

                                   safety matters, and obviously for

                                  at the Club, some of which obviously

                                  are consequential to safety matters.

            DSU61                 I see.     The role of EASTWOODS, in

                      question is, put back to him, 'Yes I

                      am sorry it was not your remit, as it

                     were to wander round and round and

                     ccme up with suggestions' answer,

                      'No'.   He then goes on, 'Let us

                     suppose that you have been taken by

                     the Club Secretary and shown the

                     Leppings Lane end, and supposing

                     he said to you, Dr EASTWOOD, we are

                     a little concerned, we have just

                     been to a ground abroad where there

                     are vast spaces around, round the

                     stadium.   We are very worried about

                     this area, where there is a narrow

                    restricted entrance to the ground,

                    would you then have considered it

                    within your remit to think up ways in

                    which the turnstile areas could be

                    made safer or would that have been

                    outside your competance and remit'

                    and Dr EASTWOOD replied to that,

                    'I didn't, I did do that with four

                    schemes' and in fact the questioning

                    does go on but the the point that I

                    want to put to you Mr MACKRELL is, is

 29.06      MACKRELL             Well I, you know, I I can't quite

                                 understand the great difference

                                 inspections have been dealt with.

 30.00      MACKRELL             Following on from that, the

                                 annual inspection that was taken,

                                 undertaken by the Local Authority,

                                 any points that were drawn up from

                                 that, EASTWOODS would actually

                                 monitor on the Club's behalf.

            DSU61                Yeah.   If we can sort of go back

                                 over that, I appreciate that they

                                 were there, at the bi-annual

                                 inspections initially and that

                                 more recently they became annual

                                 inspections.

            MACKRELL            Mm.

            DSU61               And that during those inspections

                                which were attended by members of

                                the Officer Working Party, your

                                Advisory Group.   And yourselves,

                                and EASTWOODS, they they would and

                                they would advise as necessary but

                                on work that was being proposed, but

                                the point that I'm, I'm trying to

30.48                           get to is, would they have advised

                                you, where you didn't week advice,

                                in another words, did they take a,

                                an active role or a pro-active role,

                                would they, for example, have pointed

                                out that the barrier configur...,

                                would you have expected them to point
 MACKRET.T.                 GRAHAM   HENRY


                                      out the barrier confirguation wasn't

                                      as it should be, in accordance with

                                      the Green Guide?

               MACKRET.T.             Well I can only say, obviously, the

                                      barrier configuration was set prior

                                      to I joined the Company and I'm you

                                      know more aware of the fact that

                                      there was annual inspections frcm,

                                      with the Local Authority and as a

                                      result of that the the Green Guide is

                                      a guide as such.   And the configur­

                                      ation of the barriers, to use an

                                      example as you did there, is, was, was

                                      accepted by the Local Authority and

                                     not commented upon by the Local

                                     Authority.

              DSU61                  Right, I don't want to go again

                                     into that in too much detail.

              MACKRET.T.             Mm.

31.44         DSU61                  At this point but, would you

                                     generally speaking now, would you

                                     have expected EASTWOODS as your

                                     advisors to have advised you where

                                     your ground, or any part of your

                                     ground, didn't accord with what

                                     was laid down in the Green Guide?

                                     And I accept the Green Guide

                                     isn't mandatory?

          MACKRELL                   No, sure.    I think, I I I I say
 MACKRET.T.              GRAHAM   HENRY


                                   yes, but with a qualified yes

                                   obviously after their negotiations

                                   or conversations with the Local

                                   Authority, as the Licensing

                                   Authority.

              DSU61                But that they, they're not

                                   employed, EASTWOODS are not

                                   employed by the Local Authority.

              MACKRELL             No.

              DSU61                They're employed by you or the

                                   Club, you and the Club.

              MACKRELL             Yeah.

32.23         DSU61               They relate direct to you, and they

                                  are the people that you presumably

                                  would depend upon for technical

                                  advice?

              MACKRELL            That's correct.

              DSU61               They and possible Mr ADDY, frcm what

                                  you say, depending upon what you're

                                  dealing with?

          MACKRELL                Yeah.

32.37     DSU61                   You'd obviously have some knowledge

                                  of the Green Guide yourself, again

                                  I'll cone to this later, but, what I'm

                                  getting at is, ap... with these

                                  inspections that were held, for

                                  example, by the Local Authority.    At

                                  those inspections would you have

                                  expected EASTWOODS or, I mean it
 MACKRET.T.                 GRAHAM HENRY


                                    wouldn't necessarily be EASTWOODS,

                                    I'm talking about EASTWOODS as a

                                   company.

               MACKRET.T.          Yeah.

               DSU61               Not specifically Dr EASTWOOD.

              MACKRET.T.           Yes.

              DSU61                When I'm saying EASTWOODS, would

                                   you have expected their

                                   representative to say to you,

                                   well this part, this part of the

                                   ground doesn't accord with the

                                   Green Guide, but it's okay, we

                                   can, you know, it it's, it is the

                                   Working Party are aware of it,

                                   and we can....

              MACKRELL             I would have expected to have been

                                   advised to look at it, yes, I think

                                  these sort of issues, yes.

              DSU61               You would have been.   So, if we can

                                  summarize then the role of,

                                  EASTWOOD'S role.   You regard them

                                  as what?

33.34     MACKRELL                I regard them as the Consulting

                                  Engineers who handle our affairs,

                                  visa viz the Safety of Sports

                                  Grounds Act and other capital

                                  projects.

          DSU61                   I see.   As, coning back to

                                  your role in the, now Mr MACKRELL,
 MACKRET.T.                GRAHAM HENRY


                                   as the Safety Officer, according

                                   to both your statement and your

                                   transcript of evidence, you

                                   liaised with EASTWOODS, who we've

                                   just mentioned.

              MACKRELL            Yeah.

 34.04        DSU61               Generally how did you, how did you

                                  liaise with EASTWOODS?     I appreciate

                                  that they attended the inspection.

              MACKRELL            Mm.

              DSU61               We've already mentioned that.     How

                                  would you liaise with them, over

                                  safety matters?

34.16         MACKRET.T.
                                  Well by telephone, by correspondence

                                  I think there is, in the in the

                                  records I have unlike treasury

                                  documents they were obviously copies

                                  of telephone conversations I had with

                                  EASTWOODS and correspondence I had

                                 with EASTWOODS.

          DSU61                  Yeah.     Would they ccme to the ground,

                                 they...

          MACKRELL               Yeah.

          DSU61                  One of the members of staff or Mr

                                 EASTWOOD cone to the ground?

34.46     MACKRET.T.             Yeah they are, they're often at

                                 the ground, they because in their

                                 role as Consulting Engineers,

                                 they're obviously at the ground
 MACKRET.T.                GRAHAM   HENRY


                                     by way of monitoring works that

                                     are done.

               DSU61                 Again we, you've already mentioned

                                     the Officer Working Group and the

                                     Advisory Working Party as it later

                                     became.     I mean how, how would you

                                     liaise with them, you'd be present

                                     part of the time I know when they

                                     carry out these inspections?

              MACKRET.T.             Yes, but it was impossible to

                                     actually be present all the time

                                     because they departed to all, all

                                     parts round the stadium.

              DSU61                  Yes, so would you make a point of

                                    being there when, when they were

                                    carrying out these inspections?

              MACKRET.T.            I'd made the point that...

              DSU61                 As long as possible.

          MACKRELL                  Of, being, of being there obviously

                                    but you... as a result of those

                                    inspections letters were written by

                                    the Ixxial Authority, based upon

                                    reports received frcm the various

                                    constituent parts of the Advisory

                                    Group.   Pointing the matters out, to

                                    the, to the, to the Club.

35.34     DSU61                     So at these inspections, you get the

                                    Police, Fire, the Building Surveyors

                                    Department...

             MACKRELL           That's right.

             DSU61              frcm the Council, those sort of

                                people?

            MACKRELL            That's right.

            DSU61              You'd be there, M r EASTWOOD would be

                               there, Dr EASTWOOD would be there...

            MACKRELL           Yeah.

            DSU61              or somebody frcm his staff.

            MACKRELL           Yeah.

            DSU61              They'd depart around to look at

                               different areas of the ground.

            MACKRELL           Mm.

            DSU61              You'd be there and or a member of

                               your staff.

            MACKRELL           I would be there, they'd have a

                               member of ray staff particularly

                               there to may be unlock areas,

                               caretaker person.   I would be there

                               really as a point of reference should

                              they wish to, kind of, clarify any­

                              thing or any any particular.     The

36.03
                              Police on the annual inspections were

                              very very much there almost in a

                              courtesy aspect because they, they'd

                              policed the stadium on thirty times

                              a season, they really didn't need to

                              to wander, to wander around.     I think

                              it was really they were there almost

                              in the same brief as I was.

             DSU61                Yeah.   Can you recall at any of

                                  those meetings whether this

                                  configuration of barriers or anything

                                  like that was ever brought u p . ..

             MACKRELL             Never brought up.

             DSU61                in your time in office?

             MACKRELL             No, no it was never brought up in

                                  m y time whatsoever.

 36.35       DSU61                What about some of the, some of the

                                  other things, the elevation in

                                  the tunnel?

            MACKRELL              No.

            DSU61                Width of perimeter fences?

            MACKRELL             Not at all, no.

            DSU61                Nothing like that?

            MACKRELL             No.

            DSU61                So then, if they'd got something

                                 seme work that they wanted carrying

                                 out, would, who would actually come

                                 to you, frcm the Working Party.

                                 Would it....

            MACKRELL             Normally it would be in a letter...

            DSU61                or frcm the Advisory Group?

            MACKRELL             which would I think it was drafted

37.00                            by David BOWNES but it may have

                                 ccme out in somebody else's

                                 signature.

         DSU61                   Yeah.

 37.12       DSU61                What would actually happen then,

                                  the, they would identify something

                                  that needed to be done, let's

                                  supposing it's a crush barrier that

                                  needs to be rewelded or something

                                  like that?

            MACKRELL              Sure.

            DSU61                 That would be discussed and

                                 presumably if you were present they

                                 would mention it to you that that

                                 needs a new strap on it?

            MACKRELL             Yes but ...

            DSU61                Scmething like that yeah?

            MACKRELL             Obviously something along that

                                 level, they would put in writing to

                                 me.

            DSU61                They'd, but they would, would you

                                 discuss it first, you'd probably know

                                 about it would you?

37.37       MACKRELL             Poss, possibility, you know they,

                                 they'd obviously were certain, if they

                                 were going, literally if we had the

                                 Health and Consumer Services, when

                                 you're talking about those, some­

                                 times there were six chaps frcm

             DSU61                 Yes.

             MACKRELL             Who kind of spread all over the

                                  stadium, so there's no physical

                                  way one could monitor everything,

                                  that was, that was happening.

 37.53       DSU61                And they wouldn't ccrrte back to you

                                  and necessarily to say, this needs

                                  doing, that surface is dangerous,

                                  this is the case?

            MACKRELL              No.

            DSU61                 They would go away.

            MACKRELL              They would go away, write a report.

            DSU61                And then you'd get a report back

                                  frcro, through M r BOWNES, or through

                                 the...

            MACKRELL             Yes, that's right.

            MACKRELL             That's right yes.

38.10       DSU61                So then you would would, you would

                                 act on it.    Were there ever any

                                 occasions when work that they wanted

                                 carried out you were in dispute over

                                 generally or, can you recall?

         MACKRELL                I can't recall, I I, on a couple of

                                 minor matters you might have

                                 been the opinion they were being a
 MACKRELL              GRAHAM   HENRY


                                 bit pedantic on one or two things,

                                 because there is an element maybe

                                 that to choose things you've always

                                 got on every inspection something like

                                 so many seats are loose in certain

                                 areas.    Well you know that is an

                                 ongoing situation the moment they are

                                 the moment they are tightened up

                                 there's three down the row that are

                                 loose and it happens on a, on a

                                 regular basis and so it's a thing

                                 that's almost handled under normal

                                 housekeeping basis.

38.53       DSU61               Mm.     You mentioned earlier about the

                                Police attendance and the fact

                                that they were there at thirty odd

                                matches a year anyway and so really

                                they were, I think your words were

                                courtesy?

            MACKRELL            Mm.

39.06       DSU61               Did they not take any involvement,

                                any direct involvement, presumably

                                this is Inspector CALVERT is it or?

39.13       MACKRELL            It was Inspector CALVERT on a

                                basis, but of, the Police were

                                there on a very regular basis.     The

                                Police wouldn't just ccme on match

                                days, the Police would come and see

                                me and discuss other things and
 MACKRELL               GRAHAM   HENRY


                                  other odds and ends, so it wasn't

                                  really as relevant and the Police

                                  spent more time at the ground

                                  that any other constituent member

                                  of the Advisory Group.

             DSU61                In policing the ground?

             MACKRELL             No in, in actually coming to look

                                  at things, have a look around,

                                  discuss, discuss things, not

                                  necessarily just operational

                                  things, procedural matters and

                                 things like that.

39.38       DSU61                Would they cane to you to discuss

                                 safety bits, safety matters

                                 generally?

            MACKRELL             Yeah.

            DSU61                Would they have brought safety

                                 matters to you.

            MACKRELL             Yes there was, there was a

                                 situation that occurred I belive

                                 it was in the first closed season

                                 when there was a request to add

                                 Gate number 7 at the botton of

                                 the...

39.58       DSU61                For the audio Mr MACKRELL is

                                 talking about the Gate 7 into

                                 the North West Terrace.

            MACKRELL             That's correct.

            DSU61                I see.

             MACKRELL             And at the same time there was over

                                  the top of the tunnel that came down

                                  into the centre of the West Stand,

                                  there were, there were a few

                                  brackets that were bolted with

                                  spites on to stop people climbing

                                  and in fact the Police felt that

                                  they were, and in fact an inducement

                                  to people to climb, it gave them an

                                  opportunity to people if they wanted

                                  to climb up to actually do that and

                                  they asked for those to be removed

                                  as w ell.

            DSU61                 So what we're talking about Mr

                                 on the back end.

                                  in 1986 (000086).   Is that correct?

             MACKRELL             Correct.

             DSU61                Can you tell me when this was

                                  that you examined them?

            MACKRELL              It was the early part of 87 (000087)

                                  I joined around Christmas just the

                                  week before Christmas in 1986 (000086)

                                  and it was in the early months of

                                  87 (000087) I was obviously

                                 ploughing m y way through them.

                                 There's a lot, there's a lot to

                                 get your feet under the table and

                                 when I found this when I say it was

                                 in the file it wasn't hidden, but

                                 when I came upon the Safety

                                 Certificate, it obviously was a

                                 Safety Certificate that was issued

                                 by South Yorkshire County Council.

            DSU61                Mn.

41.50       MACKRELL             I contacted EASTWOODS and I think

                                 I spoke to John STRANGE who is on

                                 the basis is is this the current

                                 safety certificate and because

                                 obviously it was the current

                                 safety certificate, there had been

                                 fundamental alterations to the

                                 ground that that hadn't been
MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


                              amended under the Safety Certificate

                              and I wondered if it had been

                              amended by way of correspondence

                             or whatever.

            DSU61            Mn.     In fact this, there is a

                             copy of the next document in your

                             bundle, next but one, is the

                             Safety Certificate Mr MACKRELL.

42.27                        For the audio tape DPP Document

                             Reference 55, the Safety

                             Certificate, if I can refer you

                             to Schedule 3, which deals with

                             the capacity.       Referring to the

                             West Stand, the capacity is

                             shown as four thousand four

                             hundred and sixty five, the West

                             and the North West Terrace two

                             thousand nine hundred.      The total

                            capacity of the ground is shown

                            as fifty thousand one hundred and

                            seventy four.

           MACKRELL         Mil.

           DSU61            Is that correct?       (Buzzer)

           MACKRELL         Sorry, that w a s...

           DSU61            Can I, go o n . ..

        MACKRELL            That was, that was correct under

                                 as that, but it was obvioulsy

                                 fundamental that since I joined

                                 the Club, that the Spion Kop had

                                 been extended.

             DSU61               Yes.

 43.24      MACKRELL             And as a result of that, the

                                 capacity for the Spion Kop

                                 by way of correspondence that was

                                 on file between EASTWOODS and the

                                 local Authority showed that the

                                 capacity on the Kop was twenty

                                one thousand.

            DSU61               Twenty one thousand.      No that's

                                fair enough, I understand where,

                                what you're saying there.       I

                                think this is probably an

                                appropriate point to adjourn

                                the interview while we change

                                the tapes and then we'll resume

                                from where we are.      Okay?

            MACKRELL            Right.

43.55                           (Tape switched off ).

00.10       DSU61               Yes the time now is twenty five

                                minutes to two (1335) and the

                                interview with Mr MACKRELL is

                              before the tape run out, about the

                              crowd capacity and you were

                              saying I believe that you

                             picked this up at or shortly

                             after the time that you arrived

                             at the Club and you recognised

                             that the capacity in the Spion

                             Kop at the ground which had had

                             alterations done to it, didn't

                             appear, the Safety Certificate

                             didn't appear to reflect those

                             alterations, in that they

                             weren't increased to twenty one

                             thousand.   Presumably you noted

                             at the same time that you were

                             looking at the West Tterrace

                             which is what I'm particulary

                             interested in, the capacity was

                             seven thousand two hundred and

                             that there were no capacities,

                             no separate capacities for

                            each of the pens on that

                            terrace?

           MACKRELL         Yeah.

           DSU61            Was that a matter that created

                            any sort of problons in your

                            mind, any, any, did it cause

                            you any concern at all, when you,

                            when you took over the job?

 MACKRELL               GRAHAM   HENRY


 01.34       MACKRELL             I contacted EASTWOODS just to

                                  clarify the situation on

                                  capacities, because we had a

                                  camrunication from the Football

                                  Association to ccmplete...

             DSU61                Yes.

             MACKRELL             which obviously required seme

                                  capacities that could have been

                                  relied upon and that was

                                  obviously, you know, that was,

                                 that was why I contacted EASTWOOD

                                 and Partners.

            DSU61                Yes. Is this the conversation

                                 that you're referring to I

                                 think Sharon actually made the

                                 enquiry on your behalf.

            MACKRELL             Yes, that's right on m y behalf

                                 that's right.     (Overtalking)

            DSU61                And this is the memo's in

                                 actual fact.

            MACKRELL             I think they're copies of

                                 telephone conversations...

            DSU61                That's right, if you can refer, for

                                 of sequence ...

            MACKRELL             Right ....?
MACKRELL               GRAHAM   HENRY


            DSU61                Okay.    You've obviously seen

                                 these (fades away).

            MACKRELL             Yeah.

            DSU61                two memorandums of telephone

                                 messages before and in in fact

                                 what you're talking about is the

                                 bit at the bottom of the page,

                                 that, does that, is that the

                                 one that arises as a result

                                 of the query by the FA?

           MACKRELL              It's not a query by the way.

           DSU61                 Or is this a query that you raised

                                 on your own behalf?

03.00      MACKRELL             Well I raised the one subsequent

                                about the actual Safety Certificate.

                                This was, came as a result of

                                completing the form which I

                                refer to frcm the FA, regarding

                                capacities.    That's because it

                                refers to other matters like

                                locks, readings of floodlights.

           DSU61                Yeah.

           MACKRELL             It's a standard form which clubs

                                have to complete each year to send

                                in to the Football Association and

                                obviously we're looking for

                                confirmation on these figures frcm

                                them.

        DSU61                   Yeah.    As a result of that query
 MACKRELL              GRAHAM   HENRY


                                 that, that was raised, the reply

                                 that you got back from EASTWOODS,

                                 not specifically Dr EASTWOOD, but

                                 I think it, seems to suggest that

                                 he was spoken to.

            MACKRELL             Mn.

03.36        DSU61               And then the reply given by a

                                 member of his staff to you, was

                                 that providing the gates, providing

                                 the police had the gates under the

                                 West Stand open, so that people

                                 can distribute thanselves throughout

                                 the terraces, there was no problem

                                with the capacities remaining.

                                 Is that your understanding of

                                the situation?

            MACKRELL            Yes.

            DSU61               Did that not cause you, give you

                                any cause for concern, or were you

                                happy to accept that?

04.04       MACKRELL            Well obviously the situation had

                                been licensed by the Local

                                Authority, Dr EASTWOOD had had,

                                Dr EASTWOOD had handled the ground

                                for a long time, I'd only been at

                                the Club for under three, under

                                three months there and obviously

                                I accepted their their professional

                                advice.

                               capacity is concerned that the

                               barrier configurations, tunnel

                              elevations, gate widths, elevation

                              on the terraces, all these sorts

                              of things had been considered by

                              both the Working Party or the

                              Advisory Group, had also been

                              considered by EASTWOODS.    There

                              was a lot of technical professional

                              people on those and and you actually

                              tend to accept EASTWOODS advice?

            MACKRELL          Yeah.

            DSU61             Given that they'd been involved

                              I think since 1978 (000078)?

            MACKRELL          That's, that's correct.

05.01       DSU61             Can you, it's probably an appropriate

                              point actually to mention to take

                              EASTWOODS role a little bit further

                              we we talked about it a short time

                              ago but, was there ever any kind,

                              is there any sort of written contract

                             between you and EASTWOODS?    Have

                             you ever, are there any sort of

                             terms of reference or work desc...

                             jobs description type of thing

                             in being as far as you're aware,

                             between the Club and EASTWOODS as
MACKRELL               GRAHAM   HENRY


                                 to what their role is?

            MACKRELL             I believe there was when the

                                 initial setting up of the safety

                                 of Sports Grounds Act was about

                                 was about to be set up.

           DSU61                 Yes.

           MACKRELL              Obviously when the Club became a

                                 designated Club under the terms of

                                 that act.    But subsequent to that

                                 I, there hasn't been an ongoing

                                matter of actual record.

05.47      DSU61                Do you consider that that contract

                                or what ever you want to call it

                                still held good in 1979 (000079)

                                prior to the disaster?

           MACKRELL             1989    (000089).

           DSU61                Sorry 1989 (000089).

           MACKRELL             Yeah, yeah.

           DSU61                I'm sorry.

           MACKRELL             I I do obviously became of the fact

                                the way in that they particularly

                                led on if one is to read the files,

                                they led on certain matters with the

                                Local Authority, by taking, by

                                acting on, on our behalf, often

                                without talcing actual points of

                                reference back to myself because

                                obviously they were the technical

                                experts ...
MACKRELL               GRAHAM   HENRY


            DSU61                Yes.

            MACKRELL             they knew about matters of, you

                                 know, flow, flow of ext... of

                                 spectators and things like this

                                 obviously had greater technical

                                 knowledge.

            DSU61                Can you refer me to the, to that

                                 document in 1978 (000078)?

           MACKRELL              Em.

           DSU61                 Presumably that's what you're

                                trying to find is it Mr

           MACKRELL             Yeh there was, there was a ...

                                 (Overtalking)

                                There was a reference if I remember

                                in the minutes and there was also

                                an exchange of letters.

           DSU61                Is that, was that referred to at

                                any time during the Inquiry, the

                                TAYLOR Inquiry, the document at

                                all?

                                The document was in I don't recall

                                it being specifically referred to,

                                the document was certainly in the

                                core bundle...

           DSU61                In your core bundle to the TAYLOR

                                No I think in the treasury core.
 MACKRELL               GRAHAM HENRY


             MACKRELL           I believe it's in the Treasury

                                Room.

            DSU61               Yeah, that's the same thing.

            MACKRELL            Sorry.

            DSU61              Yeah.

 07.04                         There is a letter the 1st of

                               December 1978 (011278), there

                               were two people considered as

                               apparently interviewed them both

                               it appears from the minutes, Dr

                               EASTWOOD was appointed and there

                               was a letter of the 1st December

                               1978 (011278), which confirms

                               that appointment.

            DSU61              I see, can I...

                               Yes of course.

07.33       DSU61              For the audio Mr                has

                               handed me a letter dated the 1st

                               from the Club Secretary to Messrs

07.57                         The letter reads,    'further to your

                             last evening that you'd been

                             comiissioned to act on our behalf

                             in our dealings with the South

                            perhaps ws could take a copy of

                            that at seme time.

                            Yes there i s .   Dr EASTWOODS

                            response.

                            1978 (041278), which is the reply

                            from EASTWOODS, accepting the

                            on then to talk about carrying

                            is not, based on those documents

                            then, I mean it's quite clear

                                Ground Act, would you consider

                                that that encompassed what we

                                discussed earlier that that they




                                should have perhaps given you

                                advice where the ground didn't

                                conform to the Green Guide and

                                advised you as to whether any work

                                was necessary in regard to that?

09.40      MACKRELL             Well obviously the point of contact

                                this is long before m y time, but one

                               would looks at the situation under

                               the terms of the Green Guide to be

                               negotiate with the Local Authority

                               on our behalf which was actually

                               from reading through the files

                               which was done on a great deal,

                               on a great number of occasions.

           DSU61               To act, to act on our behalf in

                               that would ccme on to, as far as

                               you're concerned, to involve

                               Steffield City Council when they

           MACKRELL           Yeah.

                              There was also a letter written

                              at the same time to the South

                              Yorkshire County Council informing

                             acting.

10.24      DSU61             I see.     Mr             has now

                             handed me a letter dated the 1st

                             of December 1978 (011278) which is

                             from the Club to South Yorkshire

                             County Council which confirms that

                             EASTWOOD and Partners would be

                             acting on behalf of the Club in

                             their application for a certificate

                             under the Safety of Sports Ground

                             Act.     Okay I think that deals

                             with the situation, if we can just

                             keep those separate.    As far as

                             those letters are concerned Mr

                             MACKRELL, obviously you would

                             read through the, you've already

                            talked about, that's what we

                            were talking about it at the time,

                            you'd obviously go through the

                            file, the Club files, and those

                            no doubt would be on the Club's

                            copy of the files as far as the

                            originals are concerned.

            MACKRELL             That's right.   I was aware of that

11.14                            obviously that the, that Dr

                                 EASTWOOD was acting on our

                                behalf and correspondence he had

                                he often led in to the Local

                                Authority and obviously it was

                                implicit the other way because

                                often when the Local Authority

                                would write to me, they would

                                automatically copy to Dr EASTWOOD.

           DSU61                Yes.    Oh I see, that ..., that

                                explains something to me, yes.

                                Okay.   We talked, sorry ...

                                I wonder whether I should also

                                simply mention in relation to a

                                ccnment you made earlier.      The

                                one of the early meetings between

                                the Officer Working Party and the

                                Club, Dr EASTWOOD was present,

11.53                           and there is actually specific

                                reference in those minutes to the

                                fact that it was recognised that

                                entrances, exits, gangways etc

                                were not one hundred per cent in

                                keeping with the guidelines.     So

                                all parties including the, the

                                Working Party and Dr EASTWOOD

                                recognised that at an early stage.

           DSU61                Right, can you refer me to the date
 MACKRELL            GRAHAM HENRY


                             of the Working Party?

                             Yes, certainly, it was...

             DSU61           Minutes?

                             it was a meetings, minutes of a

                            meeting at Hillsborough Stadium

                             Sheffield on the 13th of December

                             1978 (131278).

            DSU61           So that's before it's actually

                            licensed?

                            Yes.     This was in the initial

                            application for a certificate.

            DSU61           Mn.     Did they resolve what they

                            were going to do about it,

                            within those minutes?

                            M y understanding from having spoken

                            to Dr EASTWOOD on these, on this

                            subject in the past, is that the

                            the guide was always recognised

                            as a guide.

            DSU61           Yes.

12.42                       Not as a statutory certainty

                            as it were, and not something that

                            had to be complied with in terms

                           of the absolute strict level of

                           the law.     He has views for

                           example in relation to the height

                           of barriers which don't accord

                           with those in the Guide.     He

                           believes his views ...

             DSU 61              That's alright.

                                 Are better but it was clearly

                                 recognised there are two, two

                                 references to it in the meeting that

                                 there were aspects of the ground

                                 which didn't comply and they put at

                                 one hundred per cent of the Guide.

13.08        DSU61               Yeah, well the Guide, I mean the

                                 Guide as you say is not mandatory

                                 it's also there, it talks about

                                 reasonable safety, and that's

                                obviously what he's, what he's depend-

                                in on.

            MACKRELL            Yes.

            DSU61               But if, I'll accept what you're saying

                                we, we can perhaps move on from from

                                that area for the moment.   In reading

                                the files that you had Mr MACKRELL,

                                on the Hillsborough Stadium, can you

13.35                           recall seeing correspondence dealing

                                with the crushing incidents that

                                are alleged to have taken place in

                                1981 (000081), 1987 (000087) and

                                1988 (000088)?

            MACKRELL            No, only the one in nineteen eighty

                                eighty one (000081) was only by way

                                of of reference to me, I can't even

                                remember who mentioned it to me,

                               predecessor I think, Mir ENGLAND?

             MACKRELL          Yeah.

                               which relates to crushing, crushing

                               and injuries in the West Stand

            MACKRELL           Yeah.

            DSU61              Can you recall actually seeing

                               that letter?

            MACKRELL           I can't recall seeing the letter

                               but I was, I had it referred to me.

            DSU61              After the disaster, or before the

                               disaster, can you recall?

            MACKRELL           I'm afraid I can't on this occasion,

                               I I I   believe it was after, after

                              aware that paragraph 3 of that letter,

                              I think it is, sorry paragraph 2,

                             as you were, paragraph 2, refers to

                             the crushing in the Leppings Lane,

                             and overcrowding.      Have, have you

                             ever seen that letter?

           MACKRELL          No.

                             of the letter which I mean it talks

                             about the capacities that are laid

                             down for the ground and in particular

                             the capacities for the North West

                             that actually had been copied through

                               not marked up.   if you can refer to

                               the next Document, these are all in

            MACKRELL          Yeah.

                              So far as I can see this is not a DPP

                              Document for the audio but it's a

17.03                         letter, say, from from South Yorkshire

                              Police to Mr McGEE, item B of that

                              letter talks about Leppings Lane

                              and it not being constructed to give

                              maximum aid to packing and the

                              control of the crowd and the

                              accepted crowd capacity is such

                             that there is no safety margin,

                             and in fact allied to that is

                             Board Meeting, and most of the

                             Document is scored out but that,
MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


 17.50                        that Document does in fact refer

                              to crushing which occurred at the

                              Leppings Lane end of the ground in

                              1981 (000081), and goes on to say

                              that further investigation in, into

                             making it more comfortable, it

                             being the terraces, presumably,

                             should be looked into.   Now that

                             Document is signed by Mr McGEE.

                             Presumably, well the the Board minute

                             is pre, predates the letter to the

                             to Mr McGEE, but presumably both

                             those Documents would be on the

                             Football Club files?

18.28      MACKRELL          They should have been on the

                             Football Club, I'm not saying

                             they're not, I had, I didn't have

                             a copy of the correspondence, from

                             obviously one looks at the situation

                             at there'd been.   Mr ENGLAND was

                             Secretary at that time, who retired

                             in 84 (000084), Mr CHESTER was then

                            Secretary for a period of three

                            years, before I took over.    I have

                            not seen this document until after

                            the events.

           DSU61            I see. So, I mean, how how much of

                            an examination of the files would

                            you have carried out?

18.59       MACKRELL           I did an examination but quite

                               honestly an examination may not

                               have gone back, it got some of the

                               relevant documents was, were there,

                               but when one looks at it, I think

                               is transpired as a result of these

                               investigations, certain things have

                              happened like EASTWOODS had some of

                              m y copies of documents and it's been

                              an amalgam of the, of them both.     It

                              may be that this might have been

                              held personally by Mr McGEE but it

                              wasn't something which I had a

                              copy of.

           DSU61              When we're talking about these

                              files, what what are we actually

                              talking about in terms of volume,

                              I mean are we talking about one

                              sort o f ...

           MACKRELL           We're talking about I would think

                              antici..., we're talking about

                              filing, filing cabinets, virtually

                              equivalent probably to a filing

                              cabinet full.

           DSU61             One filing cabinet four drawsr

                              full.

           MACKRELL          That, I would anticipate that.

                             Because obviously if one's talking

                             about the correspondence that goes
 MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


                               for a simple, thing like roofing the

                               Kop.   You're talking about a massive

                               amount of correspondence by way of

                               tender documents arid plans and

                               drawings and revisions to same

                              and such.

20.01       D5U61              I mean you obviously went through

                              the Safety Certificate...

            MACKRELL          Yeah.

            DSU61             you've talked about that?

            MACKRELL          Yeah.

            DSU61             And raising queries in fact from

                              it?

            MACKRELL          Yeah.

            DSU61             What I'm, what I'm really getting

20.14                         at is, seeing if you'd seen some

                              of this or were aware of this

                              crushing in 1981 (000081)...

            MACKRELL          No.

            DSU61            Would that have sort of flagged

                             up to you that there, there was,

                             there had been previous problems,

                             but that that was an area that nay

                             need to be looked at in the future

                             so far as you're concerned, and

                             again I'm thinking about your

                             role as the Safety Officer here.

        MACKRELL             Yeah.

        DSU61                You see, you've got, you've got
 MACKRELL               GRAHAM HENRY


                                a role which is laid down quite

                                clearly.

             MACKRELL           Yeah sure.      You're actually

                                obviously talking, having not seen

                                it, one could, I was in a situation

                               where this happened five and a half

                               years prior to I joined the Company.

             DSU61             I accept that.

 20.52      MACKRELL           As a, and as a result of that I think

                               it would be reasonable to assume on

                               a personal basis that items that

                               had transpired on that, had been

                               dealt with to the satisfaction of of

                               the relevant parties.

            DSU61              Mm.     If you had of seen them do you

                               think it would of, would of flagged

                               up a warning sort of in the back of

                               your brain would then, this is an

                               area I've got to keep an eye on.

                               That type of thing?

            MACKRELL           I can only conjecture on that, I can't

                              really state categorically from that

                              situation, I can only really see it

                              as I have seen it at the Club.

            DSU61             Mm.    I see.     Can we perhaps move on

                              to the next Document then Mr

                              MACKRELL.       For the audio, this is

21.36                         DPP Document 48, which is a report

                              dated the 30th of April 1981 (300481)
MACKRELL   GRAHAM HENRY                                      70


                   from Chief Superintendent HAROLD, I

                   think it's HAROLD, it may be HERALD,

                   of the South Yorkshire Police to his

                   Assistant Chief Constable, paragraph

                   4 of that, and I appreciate that it

                   is a Police communication so it won't

                   be on your files, I hope.   Paragraph

                   4 of that refers to the crushing

                   that took place on the West Stand and

                   the, the report reads,   'I've informed

                   Mr ENGLAND that our consensus view

                   is that the ten thousand one hundred

                   crowd figure specified in the Safety

22.18              Certificate is too high.'

                   Understandably he refutes this and

                   defends the position by stating that

                   the former capacity prior to the

                   implementation of the Safety of

                   Sports Ground Act, at Hillsborough

                   in December 1979 (001279) was

                   eleven thousand one hundred, and

                   that on a number of occasions in

                  previous all ticket matches the

                   terracings had accommodated that

                  number.   Certainly at the 1980

                   (000080) Semi-Final when we had again

                  again had a capacity of fifty

                   thousand one hundred and seventy

                   four, he also had some hundreds of




                                                                  785
MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


                              forged tickets and he goes on to

                              talk about the forged tickets .    Vfes

                              that information reflected in the

                              files that are held by the Club and

                              I'm sorry to keep having to...

           MACKRELL          No sure I can't, well I can't, I

                             can't obviously if I can't, I didn't

                             see one, I didn't really see the

                             correspondence that related to the

                             1981 (000081) crushing.     I assume

23.16                        obviously and from reading of that

                             if the Police had thought

                             particularly strongly on the subject

                             it would have been raised with the

                             Advisory Group when one's talking

                             about the capacities as set down on

                             the Safety Certificate.

           DSU61             Unfortunately I mean, they, they do

                             appear to have written to the then

                             Council controlling the Group about

                             the safety capacity, sorry in the

                            crowd capacity in the West terrace

                            being too high, that's as far as they

                            were concerned, within the certificate,

                            but unfortunately the matter doesn't

                            appear to have been pursued then by

                            either party.   You, you're saying

                            you're not aware of that?

        MACKRELL            I wasn't aware of that obviously,
 MACKRELL           GRAHAM HENRY


                            I have been aware of it subsequent

                            to the events of 15th of April 1989

                            (150489).

            DSU61          Are you - sorry Mr MACKRELL?

 24.07                      I know, I was going to comment that

                           I noticed that there was a a meeting

                           at the stadium of the Officer Working

                           Party on the 8th June when Mr HERALD

                           was present among others, and there

                           isn't any mention of anything

                           raised at the minutes of that meeting.

            D5U61          This is June nineteen?

                           End of June 81 (000081).

            D5U61          I mean presumably this, this

                           recorded date of the 30th of

                           April, obviously it was dealt

                           with preceeding that date, even

                           according to the Board report, the

                           Board minutes I should say, not the

                           Board report.   It was dealt with,

                          was being dealt with very quickly

                          after, if the, if the Semi-Final

                          was on the 11th of April

                           (interruption) it may well not be

                          the case, you know, that they dealt

                          with it then. (Pause)

24.59                     Dealing with the alleged crushing

                          in 1987 (000087) and 1988 (000088)

                          and I do accept that the evidence
 MACKRELL               GRAHAM HENRY                                   73


                                in regard to that crushing is

                                fairly tenuous.

             MACKRELL           Yeah.

 25.10       DSU61              It comprises basically of a

                               couple of letters from supporters

                               saying that they were crushed and

                               sane statements from supporters in

                               particular areas on the West Tterrace

                               and of course that's after the

                               disaster had taken place anyway.

            MACKRELL           Yeah.

            DSU61              You were actually in appointment

                               at the Club at that time...

            MACKRELL           Correct.    Yes.

            DSU61              and I know it was put to you at the,

25.35                          the Inquiry, but do you have any

                               knowledge of any crushing taking

                               place in 1987 (000087) or 1988

                               (000088)?

            MACKRELL           None whatsoever.

            DSU61              You've got no letters written to

                               you by supporters who attended the

                               game...

            MACKRELL          No.

            DSU61             saying that they were crushed...?

25.50       MACKRELL          No.   I've dug through my files

                              and I've kept individual files

                              which i think obviously have been

                              seen by the individual, by yourselves




                                                                            738

                               in respect of each of the Semi-Finals

                               and I've kept correspondence on them,

                               that related and I've had a couple

                               of letters you know, come, I've

                               kept what letters there are, and

                              there's been like letters

                              complimenting stewards, somebody

                              complaining about programmes but

                              nothing about...

             DSU61            Crushing at all.   Not even elsewhere

                              in the ground?

            MACKRELL          No.

26.16       DSU61             Following these sort of matches,

                              I'm talking about Cup Semi-Finals

                              now, big matches, do the Board and

                              yourselves have any sort of a deb...,

                              is there any sort of provision for

                              any debrief as to how it went, what

                              what we learnt.

26.32       MACKRELL          I normally debrief m y departmental

                              heads after a big game and any

                              problem areas, anything that went

                             well, particularly well, might be

                             ineventive ...

            DSU61            Yes.

            MACKRELL         a few times, but we do have you

                             know, do try to, previously it was

                             on an informal basis obviously

                             subsequently after the events of
 MACKRELL              GRAHAM   HENRY


                                 15th of April 1989 (150489) it's on a,

                                 it's on a slightly more formal basis

                                 than that.    But quite honestly I had

                                 nothing, I had no feedback whatsoever

                                 and I was surprised, obviously but

                                 maybe I shouldn't be surprised you

                                 know when things like that crop up

                                 after another event, you know.

27.14        DSU61               Yeah.    Do you keep any minutes of

                                 those debriefs or are they sort of

                                 an informal debrief?

            MACKRELL            Not as then, now I do.
27.30       DSU61                I see.    Were you or the Club ever

                                informed of crushing and injuries

                                by either the Police or staff,

                                St John's Ambulance or your own

                                staff or the St John's Ambulance

                                Brigade that occurred at those

                                matches?

            MACKRELL            No.
27.43       DSU61               So you, as far as you're concerned

                                up until Hillsborough happens and

                                the disaster in April 1989 (000489)

                                you've got really no, no knowledge

                                of of any problems on those

                                terraces at all?

            MACKRELL            That's correct.

            DSU61               You concede that the Club hadn't

                                knowledge within its system of,
MACKRELL               GRAHAM HENRY                                 76


                               that there had been problems

                               certainly in 1981 (000081) I mean

                               it was also suggested there was

                               a problem in 1956 (000056).     Do

                              your records go back as far as

                              that?

28.11       MACKRELL          Well they obviously the Club, the

                              statutory records of the Company

                              would go back from that, I can

                              only reiterate that I didn't see

                              the correspondence relating to 81

                              (000081), and having read the,

                              having read the correspondence

                              now with hindsight which obviously

                              I accept as perfect signs, if

                              there had been any strong feeling

                              on the matter or the police had had

                              perfect opportunity by way of the

                              Advisory Group to draw it to their

                              attention and ask for and usually

                             m y experience with, with the

                             Advisory Groups or with ever in

                             within Football is if Police

                             are adamant they want something

                             done, they regard it as a matter

                             of safety, it usually gets done.

           DSU61             And of course they're licensed

                             to inspect the ground, anyway

                             aren't they and u n d e r the Safety




                                                                         791
MACKRELL               GRAHAM HENRY


                               of Sports Ground Act and in fact

                               they can go to the Council and,

                               in fact they can prevent you from ...

                               open you, from opening if you're not

                               conforming with the Certificate.

28.59       MACKRELL          That's it and also by way of the

                              Police, if the Police for example

                              cone to me, when the fixtures are

                              published and they don't want us

                              to play a particular team, they

                              want an early morning kick-off

                              for example on a Boxing Day

                              morning.   I can turn round and

                              argue the toss may be, I might

                              say, hang on that's being a bit

                              unreasonable for people who've

                              got to travel, but ultimately

                              I know that if push came to

29.21                         shove, the Police could go to

                              the Local Authority and it could

                              be imposed upon me.

           DSU61             Yes.

           MACKRELL          So therefore   you know the Police

                              are quite conscious of their own

                              conscious of their powers, should

                              they need, should they need to

                              need to utilize them.

           DSU61             Fair enough.   Do you think if

                              if you had of known about these,
MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


                              I mean you obviously had a limited

                              knowledge of 1981 (000081) from

                              what you're saying, but no great, no

                              great knowledge and it was before

                             your time anyway, you, you assumed it

29.48                         had been dealt with.    Do you think

                              if you had of known about the

                             crushing in 1987 (000087) and 1988

                              (000088), such as it was, would,

                             would it have flagged up that there

                             was a problem there in regard to

                             capacity or would you have I mean

                             expected the Police to highlight

                             that to you anyway o r . ...

           MACKRELL          Well actually I can only, you know,

                             it sounds a bit simplistic only

                             saying yes I would see it, regard it

                             to capacity, you know, I could

                             obvious, obviously.

           DSU61             You might now, you wouldn't

                             necessarily then.

           MACKRELL          Exactly from that point of view and

30.15                        also the fact is that the Police

                             after the 87 (000087) and 88

                             (000088) semi-final never at all

                             came to me and told me that there

                             were any, there were any problems

                             with the way that the, that the

                             actual, the great game had been run
MACKRELL              GRAHAM   HENRY


                                for want of a better word.

            DSU61              Okay, that's fair enough.      If we

                               can move on now to deal with the

30.34                          Green Guide.   In your statement

                               and in your transcript of evidence

                               you've conceded that you have

                               knowledge of the Green Guide 1976

                                (000076) from your previous

                               occupations in Bournemouth and

                               Luton Town Football Club.      Is

                               that?

           MACKRELL            Yeah.

30.52      DSU61               Is that.   How far does that

                               knowledge extend, and to some

                               extent we've, I know we've touched

                               on this earlier...

           MACKRELL            Sure.

           DSU61               in this interview but...

           MACKRELL            It extends, it extends obviously to

                               to certain elements that one regards

                               as, as you know the Club's

                               responsibility althought obviously

                               the Club ultimately is, you know, is

                               responsible for certain areas.

                               However in the same way at Luton

                               Town they employed a cons,,,, a firm

                               of consultants to to handle...

           DSU61               Safety Engineers?

           MACKRELL            On this occasion it was architects.
MACKRELL              GRAHAM   HENRY


           DSU61                Yes.

           MACKRELL            But you know on the same, same

                               principle obviously for that, to

                               actually handle the negotiations

                                for any safety work that was

                               required at, required at the ground

                               and I think you'd find that this

                               is quite normal amongst footballing

                               clubs.

31.36      DSU61               Yes, yeah.   But as a result of all

                               that work, how much knowledge

                               would you get of the Green Guide

                               and I'm talking about the 76

                               (000076) Green Guide at the

                               mcment?   For example would you,

                               would you recognise that tunnel

                               elevations or elevations on the

                               terraces, barrier configurations,

                               heights, height of barriers, this

                               type of thing all had a bearing

                               on crowd capacity in that area?

           MACKRELL            Sure, I under... I understand what

                               you're saying, but I can only, risk

                               of sounding of repeating myself

32.14                          state that obviously we had

                               employed a company to handle this

                               technical, I'm not qualified to

                               judge the scale and the rate of

                               slope on the terrace.   I think
 MACKRELL              GRAHAM   HENRY


                                 you know, it would be beyond

                                 m y technical remit to to do so and

                                 therefore as as a Club w e employ

                                 a Company to handle this on our

                                 behalf.

            DSU61                I accept what you're saying,

                                 that you depend, what you're

                                 saying is you depended on

                                 EASTWOOD to advise you of that,

                                EASTWOODS the Company.

            MACKRELL            Yeah.

            DSU61               But, I mean you you, by virtue

                                of what you were doing with the

                                Engineers that you p r e ... in

                                previous, or the architects in

                                your previous employments, you

                                would, you would have read the

                                Green Guide, you would know what

                                the Green Guide said, and after

                                all you're the Safety Officer.

            MACKRELL            Sure.

            DSU61               As well as being the Secretary.

            MACKRELL            Yeah.

33.00       DSU61               Now what I'm seeking to sort

                                of pursue is, would you by

                                virtue of your own knowledge

                                of the, of the Green Guide have

                                seen the relevance of those

                               ations the height of the barriers,

                               and those sort of things, in

                               relation to crowd capacity?

            MACKRELL           I'm aware of what obviously

                              the implications of the, of

                              barrier configurations etc

                              and what's obviously requirements

                              are for a safety matter but I

                              can only repeat there is

                              basically on that, that amount,

                              that type of work, the technical

                              aspects of the work, those are

                              handed over to Consulting

                              Engineers who handle that

                              matters on our behalf, and whilst

                              I hear what you say about the

                              Green Guide, the Green Guide

                              actually is still, at this

                              mcment in time a Guide to such,

                              and obviously matters then are

                              negotiated to the, to the

                              satisfaction, obviously of the

                             Licensing Authority, otherwise

                             the license would not, would

                             not have been granted.

           DSU61             No I accept that, but you see

                             what I'm getting at is that

                             with the knowledge of the Green

                             Guide 1976 (000076) and with

                                knowledge in 1981 (000081) and

                                you have said in fact that you

                                terraces must be something that's

                                very much forefront in your mind?

           D5U61               As safety officers.

34.25      MACKRELL            Safety, safety at the ground is

                               obviously paramount on anybody's

                               mind in r e . . in resolve of that

                               situation.     And Sheffield Wednesday

                               have never been kind of slow to

                               actually spend a great deal of

                               money on safety and improving

                               their ground, but with regard

                               to the actual technical aspects

                               of it, I understand the

                               implications of the technical

                               aspects but I can only just

                               repeat that I had to leave that

                               to somebody who was more qualified

                               to deal with it.

           DSU61               Yeah but I mean the... okay then,

                               but did you ever say to that person
 MACKRELL              GRAHAM   HENRY


                                 who was more qualified to deal

                                 with it, look I have a knowledge

                                 of the Green, this this, this is m y

                                 the extent of m y knowledge of

                                 the Green Guide.    Now it occurs

                                 to me that there may be a problem

                                 on the West Stand because of the

                                 barriers, they're not spaced if

                                 you like, if the spacing doesn't

                                 accord with the Green Guide which

                                 says, talks about maximum spacing of

                                 ore point one metre, for example.

            MACKRELL            Yeah.

            DSU61               Will you have a look at it, you

                                see...

35.17       MACKRELL            Yeah.     With respect, I you know, I

                                hear what you're saying but with

                                respect if I'm employing a company

                                of Consulting Engineers to do that

                                I'm hardly gonna go around with

                                the tape measure, measuring that

                                and the theodolite measuring

                                the slope, I'm taking a

                                reputable company of Consulting

                                Engineers to handle that on our

                                behalf.    They understood the

                                implications of what they were

                                doing, because they understood

                                that they were acting on our
GRAHAM HENRY


        behalf to handle those matters

        and previous correspondence

        that I think is common to all

        parties is there to show that

        they were doing this, and you

       know, I I think that really

       you are expecting a lot to

       say that I'm going to go down

       and do, study technical matters

       when I'm employing a company

       to handle those on m y behalf.

       No, I'm not, let's be quite

       clear, I'm not actually

       suggesting that, that you

       should have done that, what

       I'm suggesting is that with

       the knowledge of it.   You see

       EASTWOODS seem to be acting,

       reacting to to what you put

       to them. In other words you have

       to ask them, pro-active if you

       like aren't they?   So what the

       point I'm making is, that unless

       you went to them, it appears to

      me that from what Dr EASTWOOD

       said, although I accept that you

      and Dr EASTWOOD do do vary slightly

      in your understanding of what his

      role was, the the matter would
 MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


                               never have been brought to anybody's

                               attention?

36.38       MACKRELL          Well obviously it would have

                              been brought to the attention

                               for the Local Authority, by

                              the way the Club was licensed

                              in the first place and the Club

                              are granted and granted a

                              licence under the Safety of

                              Sports Grounds Act to Sheffield

                              Wednesday under that configuration.

            DSU61             Okay then, well I think you'll see

                              the the relevance of of what I'm

                              talking about as we go into

                              the interview.

36.56                         I think it's right to say that

                              that EASTWOOD initially

                              calculated the capacities and

                              he alone calculated the

                              capacities in terms of, of

                              applying for a licence for those

                             capacities the under the

                             certificate but I'm not quite

                             clear, I must say, whether you're

                             referring to the spacing of the

                             barriers having regard to the

                             effect on capacity or whether

                             you're referring to for example

                             the height of the barriers not
MACKRELL           GRAHAM   HENRY


                             being exactly as suggested in

                             the Green Guide.

37.26      DSU61             Well both, according to the Green

                             Guide, have a bearing on the

                             capacity that can be allowed in

                             that pen.   But I mean we're not

                             talking about now, I I'm talking at

                             the mcment generally, when the Club

                             got the certificate which is

                             before Mr MACKRELL'S time anyway.

                            Yes.

           DSU61            And this is part of the difficulty

                            if you like with this Inquiry,

                            that some of the stuff that I

                            have to put to him, is in fact

37.47                       before his time, but of course as

                            Safety Officer, when he takes

                            over this role in 1986 (000086),

                            to some extent he he has to accept

                            the responsibility that goes

                            with that and what was done in

                            the past.    Now in fact it would

                            probably be easier if we, if we

                            move on, because you'll see why,

                            why. I was sort of concentrating

                            on that a little bit because in

                            1981 (000081) and 1985 (000085)

                            there were radial fences erected

                            in the West Terrace, those those
 MACKRELL              GRAHAM   HENRY


                                 fences in fact, the first ones in

                                 1981 (000081), divided the terrace

                                 into three, the 1985 (000085) ones

                                 sub-divided the central pen into

                                 what is now pens 3, 4 and the

                                 void area, pen 5.   Now those

                                 fences in effect, reduced again

                                 the, the area that was available

                                 if you like, the met... the number

                                 of square metres that were

                                 available on that terrace.    Do

                                you accept that?

            MACKRELL             I accept that, you know, they they

                                obviously must, in that it's a

                                matter of fact.

            DSU61               What what, what knowledge have you

                                got of that, I mean was that some­

                                thing that you would again, again

                                see on the ... (Overtalking)

39.11       MACKRELL            Only from the correspondence, yeah,

                                I was ... on the 85 (000085) it is,

                                it was that the radial fences were

                                put in at the request of South

                                Yorkshire Police to assist with crowd

                                control.

            DSU61               Yes.

            MACKRELL            Control measures.

39.24       DSU61               Yeah.   So that's 1981 (000081)

                                in fact I think you, you probably

                                 know that the 1981 (000081)

                                 fences were put in, as you say

                                 at the request of the Police and

                                 to prevent the lateral movement

                                 that they thought might have

                                 caused the crushing in 1981

                                 (000081) so that was, that was

                                 what i was looking for earlier

                                 on actually.   But, the 19... and the

                                 1985 (000085) one was to, to do

                                with segregation and more so than

                                packing if you like in the terraces



            MACKRELL            Yeah.

            DSU61               but obviously they, they reduced the

                                the area that was available on

                                the terraces, now, I mean, it

40.04                           goes on from there, as it, as it

                                did reduce the, the area would you

                                have expected EASTWOODS, as the Club

                                Safety Engineers, to point out to

                                the Club the effects of the

                                erection of those radial fences

                                on the crowd capacity and the

                                fact that it had implications

                                in fact ultimately for the

                                Safety Certificate?

40.23       MACKRELL            I would expect a combination of

                                EASTWOODS and the Local Authority,
 MACKRELL               GRAHAM   HENRY


                                  rather like the ultimate

                                  licensing authority who would have

                                  had to have given permission for

                                  that work to have been undertaken

                                  in the first place.

             DSU61                And indeed they did.

             MACKRELL

             DSU61                I mean that, that's common ground

                                  that they they did that, but at, at

                                  the present moment, you see we've

                                  got a situation where the, the

                                  area was reduced and we're still

                                  left with the, with the Safety

                                 Certificate, Schedule 3 unamended

                                 by the Local Authority and I accept

                                 that that's their problem but the,

                                 the ground, the Club itself also

                                 have some responsibility and again

                                 when you take it over in 1986

                                 (000086)...

            MACKRELL             Yeah.

41.04       DSU61                you take on those responsibilities

                                 on behalf of the Club and it appears

                                 that nothing was done about trying

                                 to amend those certificate, no

                                 nobody recognised it.

41.13       MACKRELL             Yeah, but a lot of capacities

                                 that are on Safety Certificates

                                 with respect, are not done to the,
 MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY                                    91


                               to the letter, to the actual letter

                               of the law.    There is an element

                               that's taken into account, because

                              when the Kop was done, they, the

                              capacity was technically they could

                              have had more then twenty one

                              thousand on the Kop, the Local

                              Authority chose at that stage not to

                              grant the capacity for more than

                              twenty one thousand on the Kop

                              because of the flows, but they weren't

                              quite happy with licensing as large

                              an area as that and so that it was

                              took, and in fact there's a reference,

                              I think again which we pointed at to

                              previously on when querying about

                              the capacity of the Kop, can this

                              be raised up, because it was in

                              at twenty one thousand, could have

                             been higher, so there is the element

                             obviously that within those type of

                             capicities, there is slack to be

                             taken up.

            DSU61            What you're talking about is an

                             inbuilt safety margin?

42.04       MACKRELL         Ind... an inbuilt safety margin

                             from there.     Obviously I think it,

                             I think personally it's reasonable

                             to assume that if ones, it's done




                                                                            806
 MACKRELL              GRAHAM   HENRY


                                 at the request of the Police, it's

                                 done on a technical basis by ones

                                 Consulting Engineers, it's

                                 approved by the Officer Working

                                 Party and by the Local Authority,

                                 it's reasonable to, to act on that

                                 request, or on their actions.

             DSU61               And you're also sort of saying as

                                 well, I understand, that you, this

                                 may only have been taken up the

                                 safety margin that there may have

                                 been in that pen anyway.

            MACKRELL            Well that's right.    Well one, I

                                think one's entitled to assume that

                                that has been considered.

42.42       DSU61               Well fair enough.    Okay.   Can we move

                                on to deal with the m o . .., the

                                reduction in the barrier 144 and again

                                we mentioned this earlier on, which

                                was just before you joined the

                                Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

                                I accept that this was as a result

                                of the request from the Police, but

                                do you recall noting any

                                correspondence on the file in

                                relation to the work when you

                                arrived and examined the files?

            MACKRELL            No.

43.04       DSU61               So when was the first time it came
 MACKRELL               GRAHAM HENRY


                                to your notice that this barrier

                                had been removed?

             MACKRELL           It, obviously, one looks at the

                                ground and sees the situation.    The

                                implications of the removal of the

                                barrier were obviously not drawn to

                               one's attention until until after the

                               events of 15th of April 1989 (150489)

 43.23                         but it was right that one can see

                               that the request was made by, I think

                               it was Mr CALVERT, of the South

                               Yorkshire Police at the time, at

                               a meeting of the group on the ground

                               at which John STRANGE of EASTWOOD and

                               Partners was present and permission

                               was given by the Advisory Group to

                               to remove that that barrier.    (Buzzer)

            DSU61              I see.   The buzzer's just gone for

                               the two minutes Mr MACKRELL.    This

                               may be a suitable point I think for

                               us to take a break from the interview

                               we'll turn the, Mr TOPE will turn

                               the tapes off now.   We'll terminate

                               the interview, perhaps have a break

                               and a cup of coffee and then we'll

                               resume at a time to be agreed if

                               that's okay with you.   Okay.

44.12                          (Tape switched off).

00.08       D5U61             Yes, Mr MACKRELL, this is a

                                resumption of the previous interview

                                you'll appreciate that you are still

                                under caution and if you could

                                consider yourself so.     The persons

           DSU61               Your date of birth Mr MACKRELL

                               please?

           MACKRELL            Sorry,




                               Solicitor.

           DSU61               The time now is seven minutes to

                               22nd of June 1990 (220690).

                               Before we concluded or terminated

                               the interview Mr MACKRELL we were

                               talking about barrier 144, and the

                               reduction in that barrier if you

                               can recall and I appreciate that

                               that was before your time at the

                               Club, although you joined the Club

                               I think in the December.
MACKRELL               GRAHAM HENRY


            MACKRELL           Correct.

01.22       DSU61              Are you aware of what consultation

                               EASTWOOD, or what part of the

                               consultation EASTWOOD had in regard

                              to the removal of that barrier.

            MACKRELL          As I understand it was a meeting of

                              the Working Party that took place

                              like a site meeting.

            DSU61             Inspection?

           MACKRELL           Yes, on the, on the terrace at at

                              the Leppings Lane end.

           DSU61              Yes.

01.41      MACKRELL           And following on there was a request

                              from as I understand it, Inspector

                              CALVERT, from South Yorkshire Police

                              for the removal of the barrier to

                              assist with crowd control.

           DSU61              So you, you actually played no part

                              in it, you're presented with a fait

                              accompli, as it were, when you

                              joined the Club, that barrier's

                             been reduced?

           MACKRELL          That's right.

           DSU61             You see documentation on it

                             presumably?

           MACKRELL          Yeah, and obviously the fact it had

                             been dealt with at an Advisory Group,

                             at an Advisory Group meeting and so

                             obviously one assumed that that had
MACKRELL               GRAHAM HENRY


                               been sanctioned properly.

            DSU61              You didn't, did you, any thoughts go

                               through your mind about that having

                               any sort of bearing on the capacity

                               at all?

            MACKRELL          No.

            DSU61             Of the terrace?

            MACKRELL          No.

            DSU61             No.     You assumed that had been

                              dealt with from what you said?

           MACKRELL           Obviously I felt that had been dealt

                              with because obviously all parties

                              were present.

02.35      DSU61              Yeah.    Do you accept that the fact

                              that the barrier 144 being removed,

                              has a bearing on the collapse of the

                              barrier 124a in the front of the,

                              in the front of that pen 3?

           MACKRELL           Well I'm not, I'm not a technical

                              expert and so obviously I'm not fully

                              aware, obviously I've seen the, I've

                              seen the the evidence that's been

                             produced, to kind of, that makes

                             that assumption, so obviously I

                             would concur with with that on the

                             basis but, you know, I don't have

                             any specialist knowledge on it.

           DSU61             You're talking now presumably

                             about the H.S.E. report are you?
MACKRELL               GRAHAM HENRY


            MACKRELL           That's correct, yeah.

            DSU61              As the technical...

            MACKRELL           That's right.

            DSU61              sort of thing.      So whilst you

                               you've got no, what you're saying

                               is you've got no technical knowledge

                              of it, you accept their interpret­

                              ation of it, that it does have a

                              bearing?

            MACKRELL          Obviously I I've seen the report

                              and obviously they're the technical

                              experts.

           DSU61              You've never seen the significance

                              presumably of the, of that?

           MACKRELL           No.     (Pause)

03.45      DSU61              Yeah.    So it therefore follows that

                              you did take it for granted that

                              this would have been taken into

                              account b y the Officer Working Party

                              as it was then, the Officer Working

                              Group in consult... in consultation

                             with EASTWOODS, when the Club was

                              asked to carry out the work?

           MACKRELL          That's right, it was obviously

                             an actual meeting, it wasn't even

                             just a matter of like a letter to

                             the Working Party, actually was

                             they were physically present.

           DSU61             Right.     (Pause).
 MACKRELL               GRAHAM HENRY


 04.31                          Yeah the Club have a responsibility

                                to ensure that the safety of

                                supporters is a general responsibility

                                to ensure the safety of supporters

                                I think you, would you accept that?

             MACKRELL          Yes.

             DSU61             When they're on their premises?

             MACKRELL          Yes.

 04.44      DSU61              The reduction of that barrier,

                               without proper consideration, if you

                               like, for the safety implications,

                               and also accepting that there

                               was crushing in 1981 (000081),

                               1987 (000087) and 1988 (000088),

                               do you consider that the Club have

                               any responsibility for the disaster

                               because of that?

05.08        MACKRELL          No I can't accept that because I

                               feel that the Club acted upon a

                               request from constituent members

                               of the Officer Advisory Group and

                              relied upon the advice of its own

                              Consulting Engineers and as a result

                              obviously it was a, you know I and I

                              feel that the Club under those

                              circumstances don't have a

                              responsibility.

05.29       DSU61             Right.   Now the next question is,

                              do you think with hindsight that
MACKRELL              GRAHAM   HENRY


                                EASTWOODS should have given better

                                advice to the Club in regard t o the

                               West terraces?

           MACKRELL             Possibility in hindsight, you know

                               one has to say if that is the

                               causation then possibly that is,

                                that may, that may be true but

                               obviously it is a situation and

                               not only EASTWOODS, it's the

                               Officer Working Party, the Building

                               Surveyor's Department, which, which

                               also sanction that work to to take

                               place.

05.54      DSU61               So what you're saying is they all

                               have a, is it, they all have a

                               responsibility, some responsibility

                                for what took place?

           MACKRELL             I believe so, yes.

                                I think if I may say so, the

                               question assumes that no

                               consideration of the safety aspect

                               was given and that doesn't

                               necessarily follow and the question

                               also assumed I think, did have an

                               effect on causation which will also

                               be a technical issue.   So I think ...

           DSU61               Mr MACKRET.Ii is, is aware of the

                               contents of the H.S.E. report?

                               Yes and the TAYLOR report indeed.
 MACKRELL              GRAHAM   HENRY


             DSU61               Which is, and the TAYLOR report

                                 sort of amplifies that, that that

                                 it did in fact have a bearing on

                                 on the collapse of the barrier, so

                                 I think that's a reasonable

                                 supposition or assumption to make.

                                 Yes.   I think you may find that there

                                will be experts who may disagree with

                                 it, it's the only point I I'm nraking.

            DSU61               Oh, I see.

06.45                           It's a matter which will no doubt

                                be aired in court in due course

                                in civil proceedings in any event

                                but I merely make the point that

                                I know, I believe that Dr EASTWOOD

                                doesn't agree that his removal

                                had had an effect on causation.

                                Whether he's right or not is

                                a different matter.

            DSU61               Oh, I see.

                                But, I mean, I accept that the

                                H.S.E. report and the TAYLOR

                                report do make certain comments

                                about it.

            DSU61               Is there anything you want to

                                say about that Mr MACKRELL?

            MACKRELL            No, certainly not.

07.14       DSU61               Are EASTWOODS still retained

                                b y the Club as Safety Engineers?
MACKRELL               GRAHAM HENRY


            MACKRELL           Yes.

07.22       DSU61              Did you ever ask Dr EASTWOOD for

                               a full safety survey of the ground

                               or ever mention to the Board of

                               Directors that this was desirable

                               or necessary?

           MACKRELL            No.    Under the terms of the

                              Safety Certificate he has to

                              do a visual inspection of the

                              ground which he obviously has done

                              and lodged with the Local

                              Authority, done with the Local

                              Authority, so nothing further

                              than that was done.

           DSU61              As I understand it, in fact he

                              carries out an inspection pre­

                              inspection by the Local

                              Authority?

           MACKRELL           Yeah, a lot of the kind of barrier

                              testing work and things like that

                              which is obviously...

           DSU61              That's right.

           MACKRELL           required to be done is done in

                              advance of the annual inspection.

                              That as it was done now that the

                              situation has changed slightly

                              in that they've brought forward

                              the period, the inspection period,

                             to a more logical time, at the end

                               of the season which which obviously

                               then allows work to be done over,

                               the c l ... over the summer closed

                               season rather than a big rush at

                               the start of the season.

            DSU61             That's alright, I can unders...,

                               I can understand the reasons for

                              doing the ...

            MACKRELL          Yeah.

            DSU61             doing it as you have done, but the

                              point that again, that I'm trying

                              to make is, we've got to this

                              situation over nine years, ten

                              years, when the disaster occurs.

                              It seems to me that nobody's ever

                              actually reviewed the, never

                              reviewed it annually or hi-annually,

                              within the inspections, within the

                              law.

            MACKRELL          Mm.

08.40       DSU61             But nobody has actually sort

                              of said, look, where, where

                              does this ground stand, there's

                              no legal requirement for me,

                              let me make this quite clear,

                             I mean there's no legal require­

                             ment for me, for you to to do

                             that as a Club, but nobody

                             actually seems to have sort

        of said, well where are we

        at this ground in regard to

        safety, shouldn't we have a

        look at it overall again,

       and review the situation,

       carry out seme sort of review.

       Mr ADDY doesn't seem to have

       sort of highlighted that that

       may be necessary and it may

       be that he didn't consider that

       it was necessary, given what

       was taking place, you as the

       Safety Officer don't seem to

       have done it, the Local

       Authority by virtue of their

       position have certainly not

       done it, and EASTWOODS has

       never said it's been nec...

       presumably have said it's never

       been necessary, but I mean, it,

       if it had of been done, and

       and it's an assumption I suppose,

       and it may have, and it certainly

       if it had been done by an

                                 the disaster ultimately?

            MACKRELL             Sure, I appreciate what you say but

                                 with respect I think it's a bit of

                                 a conj..., it is conjecture, in that

10.02                            you know, in that the various

                                 constituent parts of the Working

                                 Party have been satisfied with the

                                 configuration of the ground and and

                                 I hear what you say about an outside

                                 party but you know that is really

                                you know that that's same... that

                                 that could be true or it could not

                                be true and I 've really got no way of

                                you know of comment..., commenting

                                in the definitive.

           DSU61                Mm.   Presumably it would cost

                                a lot of money to carry out

                                that sort o f ....?

           MACKRELL             II...

           DSU61                Would that be a factor?

           MACKRELL             No not at all, I wouldn't know

                                but I I would, I I'm not sure

                                how professional etiquette

                                would go, but if one has a firm of

                                Consulting Engineers who are

                                handling object, I wouldn't have

                                thought it would have been normal

                           their performance.

           DSU61           Mm.

10.46                      I think if I can comment here.

                           Dr EASTWOOD'S evidence was

                           that he carried out a thorough

                           safety inspection every year.

           DSU61          Yes.

10.54                     And that he accepted that he was

                          responsible for the Club for

                          safe, for structural matters

                          on safety, in relation to the

                          Certificate and the Safety of

                          Sports Grounds A c t . ..

           DSU61          Where he had carried out work, only

                          where he had carried out work or

                          generally?     (Overtalking)

                          No no, oh no, oh no, cert... no

                          generally, generally, he carried

                          out a detailed inspection of the

                          ground generally each year and he

                          reported to the Club and he

                          didn't for example just inspect

                         matters he'd dealt with before,

                          he inspected generally and

                          if he found something was

                         wrong he recommended it should

                         be put right.     I think his own

                         evidence to the Inquiry confirmed




                                                                      820
MACKRELL           GRAHAM   HENRY                                     106


                             that .   He was the only independent

                             expert who was charged with that

                             duty by the Club.    That's absolutely

                             right, the Club would have had no

                             reason to suppose that he wasn't

                             carrying out his duties properly,

                             particularly in light of the fact

                             that he was liaising, he was the

                             interface with the Officer Working

                             Party etc.   As to the other than

                             structural and expertise aspects,

                             if you like, the general Green

                            Guide aspect, again I think if

                            you look at the evidence that was

                            given by Mr LOCK at the Inquiry.

           DSU61            Yes.

                            and in his statement, he was

                            quite clear that he was, he had

                            full knowledge of the Green

                            Guide, it was something in

                            which he had taken a particular

                            interest and he inspected the

                            ground and made certain

                            recommendations after he was

                            appointed, matters relating to

                            fire extinguishers and that

                            accessibility to them etc,

                            so he was looking at it from

                            that point of view.
MACKRELL           GRAHAM   HENRY                                 107

           DSU61             He also made seme recommendations

                             in regard to hoardings that

                             were blocking the perimeter

                             fences I believe and things

                             like that.

                             Indeed he did, yes.

           DUS61             I mean, his, his, his role was

                             not as a Safety Officer, it was

                             as a Security Officer.

                             Yes.

12.35      DSU61             I mean, what, what that begs

                             the question if he knew about

                            the non conformation, non

                            conforming with the Green Guide

                            in relation to height and

                            spacing of barriers and things

                            like that, in relation to

                            tunnel elevations, in relation

                            to width of perimeter gates,

                            why didn't he bring it to Mr

                            MACKRELL'S notice, as an, as an

                            employee, with knowledge?

                            I I would suggest this is an

                            interview of Mr MACKRELL so

                            I hesitate to actually take

                            the dialogue too far but I would

                            suggest that the evidence points to

                            the fact that everybody considered

                            that those were technical issues,




                                                                        822

                                the exact height of a barrier, Dr

                                EASTWOOD had strong views about

                                that.

            DSU61               Mm.

13.18                           The spacing between barriers, the

                                angle between barriers, all of

                                these were regarded as technical

                               matters on which Dr EASTWOOD

                               was was the man to speak.

           DSU61               Right.

                               And who had to negotiate and

                               reach agreement with the Local

                               Authority as to whether or not

                               the, the parameters of the Green

                               Guide were sufficiently met, if

                               I can put it that way.

           DSU61               Right yeah.

                               And that this appears as I mentioned

                               earlier from the initial meeting

                               with the Officer Working Party when

                               it was clearly recognised that there

                               were areas within the ground were

                               not quite within the parameters

                               laid down in the Guide, nevertheless

                               a decision was clearly made that

                               they were acceptable.

           DSU61               Would you agree with that Mr

                               MACKRELL?

           MACKRELL            Yes I would do I think, I would do,




                                                                            823

                              particularly in relation to like Mr

                              LOCK'S situation.

            DSU61             Yeah.    Okay.   Just as a matter of

14.09                         interest then, did you ever, with

                             your knowledge of the Green Guide,

                             did you ever note that the tunnel

                             elevation in the West Stand was

                             one in six as against the Green

                             Guide recommendation?

           MACKRELL          No, I haven't, I haven't got the tex..

                             I wouldn't have the tex...,

           DSU61             It wouldn't mean any...

           MACKRELL          technical expertise to even measure

                             it.

                             Could I again, I hesitate to

                             interrupt you, but could I just put

                             on record the fact that the one in

                             six calculation is one that we

                             would challenge.     If you, if one

                             actually....

           DSU61             It's an approximation?

                             This would, it is an approximation,

                             and this was from Lord Justice

                             TAYLOR'S Interim Report, and it is

                             is an approximation the exact figure

                             is a little different from that but

                            probably not a great deal turns on it.

           DSU61            Okay.     Was that ever brought to

                            your attention by EASTWOODS?

           MACKRELL             No, no.

           DSU61                I think we've talked about the

                                barrier type and configuration

                                at quite some length together with

15.03                           the height and spacing.   Presumably

                                you appreciated that that did have

                                a bearing, I think you've conceded

                                that already, but you did appreciate

                               that it had a bearing on the, on

                               the capacities in the pen, but again

                               you were dependent, you were

                               dependent on Dr EASTWOOD to ...

           MACKRELL            On Dr EASTWOOD and obviously the

                               interpretation of it by the Advisory

                               Group.

           DSU61               Yeah.    We've already mentioned the

                               Safety Certificate, I don't know

                               whether you've still got it in front

15.29                          of you, Document 55, for the audio.

                               That schedule 3 of the Safety

                                  West Stand?

             MACKRELL             Well I think it.

             DSU61                You as the Club this is?

16.07        MACKRELL             Sure, obviously the Club it can, on

                                  the basis that one finds the level,

                                  finds the level of support, level

                                 of spectators that's there.     As a,

                                 as a regard to that we knew the

                                 optimum numbers that were able to

                                 go into the, into the terrace area,

                                 in total.

            DSU61                As seven thousand two hundred or?

            MACKRELL             That's right yes.

            DSU61                ten thousand one hundred including

                                 the North West Terrace?

            MACKRELL             It was, it was seven, seven thousand

                                 two hundred and plus the two thousand

                                 one hundred.   Yes the ten thousand,

                                 ten thousand one hundred, and then

                                 what, because that wasn't the broken

                                 down the seven thousand two hundred

                                 into any specific pen.

16.41       DSU61                What you're saying I understand is

                                 that you'd got the computerised

                                 counts on the turnstiles?

            MACKRELL             Yeah.

            DSU61                That, that only fed, those 23

           MACKRELL             Yes.

           DSU61               And the count that you kept on

                               there w a s , was your means o f ...

           MACKRELL            Knowing...

           MACKRELL            Yes.

           DSU61               &it that you concede do you that

                               you weren't able to monitor any

                               capacities in individual pens

                               and particulary pens 3 and 4?

           MACKRELL            Correct.

17.19      DSU61               With hindsight do you think that

                               that you probably should have been

                               able to monitor those capacities?

           MACKRELL            Well, I think hindsight is again

                               is very difficult to comment in

                               hindsight, other than the fact is

                               one possibly would question the

                               Advisory Group's approval of the

                               as a constraint.   And I think there

                               becomes a balance again in

                               hindsight, which one looks at it,

           DSU61               Mm.     You see I mean it's difficult

                               you can't actually comply with

                               Schedule 3 of the Safety Certificate

                               strictly given the procedure of

                               monitoring that you've got.

           MACKRELL             In respect of which way?

           DSU61               Well you, people can cone in

                               through A to G and go through the

                               side gates and up into the West

                               Stand.

           MACKRELL            Not without their tickets are

                               checked at the, at the point of

                               entry into the West Stand.

           DSU61               Yes.     What about going round if

                               they can't get into the North

                               Stand can they?

           MACKRELL            No.     The West Stand and Leppings

                               Lane are totally self contained.

18.46      DSU61               I see okay.     If I can refer you

                               to the plan by EASTWOODS which

                               is I think your next Document,

                               Document Number 74 should be marked

                               in the margin.    That Document shows

                               the capacities of pens 3 and 4 as

                               respectively.     If you can, if you

                               can read the print on it?

           DSU61              For the audio this is a plan, DPP

                              Document Reference 74.     Were those

                              capacities ever conveyed to you?

           MACKRELL           Conveyed by way of draw, there

                              were notes on drawing that they had

                              they didn't, they were, I I

                              understood them to be an

                              indication as opposed to because

                              obviously they weren't referred to

                             on the Safety Certificate.

19.31      DSU61             Yes.    Is that what you were

                             querying, is it those figures

                             that were querying when you got

                             Sharon LANE to query?

19.39      MACKRELL           I was querying, I was querying the

                             whole aspects of of the, because

                             obviously one was, the Spion Kop was

                             obviously totally totally incorrect,

                             by you know just by looking at it,

                             you know the ground there was massive

                             complete changes to configuration,

                             roof on it, and it was just a matter

                             of checking that at the same time.

                             But no I wasn't looking to to have, to

                             have the break down between individual

                             areas, no.     Because I was aware of

                             the fact that I it was, it was a

                             global figure as per the Safety

                             Certificate.

           DSU61              Fair enough.   So you, you never

                              actually checked those figures,

                              you just assumed that they were?

           MACKRELL           Yeah.

           DSU61              Okay, fair enough.   We've dealt with

                              the ...   The, some of the, of the

                             correspondence tends to indicate that,

                             that the check by Miss LANE was the

                             one in 1987 (000087), this is, as

                             distinct to the one that you, I think

                             you made ...

           MACKRELL          Yeah.

           DSU61             personally, was as a request as

                             a result of an inquiry by the FA

                             in regard to...

20.48      MACKRELL          Yeah.    No that's not quite correct,

                             there's there's a standard form that

                             is to be completed every year by

                             all football league Clubs which

                             actually just sets out details of

                             the ground in broad terms by way

                             of address, that that the height, the

                             strength of the flood lights, the

                             size of the playing area, how the

                             ground capacity is divided up to.

                             It's a, it's a guide which basically

                             is used to, when they're looking

                             at the, for the competition

            DSU61                Yeah.

            MACKRELL             so that the team fills that in

                                 and it's mainly for use at

                                 teams lower down the scale in

                                 may be non league but all Clubs,

                                 all members of the FA have to

                                 fill it in.   And its to say how

                                 the ground is situated, do you

                                 have number of stands and things

                                 like this, so it's mainly for

                                they can look at it and say that

                                Club isn't eligible to play

                                in the FA vase or FA trophy but

                                it's, it's a, because obviously

                                in the Football League all

                                Clubs or pretty much all Clubs

                                flood lights are in, are of a

                                good standard, but it still has

                                to like to write down like, for

                                example, the flood lightings ...

           DSU61                Yes.

           MACKRELL             level and it was in order to

                                complete that regular form which

                                has to be submitted in the Spring

            MACKRELL           Yes.

            DSU61              what the reply was, providing the

22.21                          gates were open at the back, it's

                               for the crowd to find their own

                               level, then the capacity is as per

            MACKRELL           Yes.

            DSU61              Is that right?

            MACKRELL           That's right.

22.33       DSU61              Did, did it strike you as being

                               unsatisfactory that that EASTWOODS

                               should say leave the capacity at

            MACKRELL          Not, not really because of the fact




                                                                              832

                               is one, I I had been at the Club

                               three months, four months, in

                               addition to saying EASTWOODS had

                               been there right from day one of the

                               ground being designated and that

                               had been in regular contact with

                               the Local Authority Police and

                               all constitent members of the

                              Advisory Group.

            DSU61             Yes.

            MACKRELL          So I obviously you know, I I felt

                              it quite reasonable to assume that

                              the matter had been dealt with

                              accordingly.

            DSU61             Fair enough.     You mentioned or

                              we discussed earlier your, the

                              extent of your knowledge of the

                              Green Guide 1976 (000076), but

                              do you have a similar sort of

                              working knowledge presumably

                              is how you'd describe it, is it

                              of the 1986 (000086) Green Guide?

23.27       MACKRELL          Yeah, I obviously read the Guide.

                              I have a copy to hand, it's not,

                              I can't say it's a thing one

                              remembers by way of , you know,

                              wrote so to speak, remembering it,

                              but it's down.    I'm acquainted

                              with the Guide, yes.
 MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


             DSU61             Did, I mean the, this what I wanted

                               to talk about here was the width

 23.48                         of the perimeter fencing.    You may

                               be aware now, if you weren't aware

                               originally, that the Green Guide's

                               recomrtendation is one point one

                              metres whereas the gates in pens

                               3 and 4 respectively are point

                              eight five and point eight three of

                              a metre.

            MACKRELL          Yeah.

            DSU61             Was that something that was ever

                              brought to your attention at all?

            MACKRELL          I I was con, I was aware...

            DSU61             Before the disaster?

            MACKRELL          Yeah, I was, I was aware of the

                              fact that they were less than

24.16                         specification, however one the

                              Local Authority had obviously

                              accepted them as being below

                              below specification and more

                              importantly they weren't a

                              designated exit, exit way from

                              the ground.

            DSU61             Yes.

            MACKRELL          And they weren't taken into

                              consideration with regard to their

                              size.

24.33       DSU61             Then you're talking about

                                  evacuation.

             MACKRELL             When one's looking at the

                                  evacuation time which obviously

                                  is a factor when comes to setting

                                  capacity.

             DSU61                Yeah, you say that you were aware

                                  of it, how were you aware of that?
             MACKRELL            Vis... visually, visually look you

                                 were aware that it just looked a bit

                                 smaller, you know, but obviously it

                                 was a thing that had been there,

                                 they'd been set up and the, the

                                 perimeter fences had been, been put

                                 up obviously to the satisfaction of

                                 the Local Authority because

                                 obviously anything of that nature

                                 can't be put up without Local

                                 Authority approval.
25.04       DSU61                Yeah.   Were you ever actually

                                 informed about the fact that it

                                 didn't conform, I mean, you say

                                 you made a visual, visual check.

            MACKRELL             Yeah.

            DSU61                Can you recall...
25.12       MACKRELL             I can't, I can't recall, Mr LOCK

                                 no, it would not have been Mr LOCK

                                 did not draw it to ray attention but

                                 I can't recall whether it was

                                 Dr EASTWOOD or any of his staff but




                                                                              83

                              it was something that I was aware

                              of in, and I can't say how I became

                              aware of it unfortunately.

           DSU61              Fair enough.    The Safety Certificate,

                              again we've ...

           MACKRELL          Yeah.

25.34      DSU61             We've got that there, shows an

                             overall capacity of seven thousand

                             two hundred in the West terrace,

                             pens 1 to 5, but it does not show

                             individual capacities of pen 3 and

                             4.      The Health and Safety

                             Executive calculation was based on

                             reconmendations laid down in the

                             Green Guide 1986 (000086) which

                             obviously was in force at the

                             time of the disaster, shows that

                             the present capacity of those pens

                             and this may be disputed, I accept,

                             pen 3 827 and pen 4 882 respectively.

26.12                        The plan from EASTWOOD shows twelve

                             hundred and a thousand in those pens

                             respectively which is something like

                             373 and 118 more than it appears that

                             there should be.    In view of that,

                             do think that you should perhaps have

                             done something about having those

                             pens checked, the capacity of those

                                 than in fact there were?
 26.44      MACKRELL             Well ... sure.   Obviously but when it

                                 comes to the capacities one's reliant

                                upon the again, our professional

                                Advisors EASTWOODS and also the Local

                                Authority, the Local Authority had

                                an annual inspection here, which

                                has obviously now come up with

                                those figures subsequent to the

                                events, they had every opportunity

                                of checking it prior to the event.

                                I'm not saying I'm reliant upon

                                Local Authority to to advise us

                                on this, but they had an opportunity

                                to do so and were often coming back

                                on matters of minor things like

                                there's a step crumbling half way

                                up the Kop or something like that

                                and do something to it.     You know

                                so they did, they do have that

                                opportunity on a regular basis.

            DSU61               Yeah.   I should make it clear I'm

                                not, I'm not referring to anything

                                from the Local Authority I'm

                                referring to the Health and Safety

                                Executive.

27.25       MACKRELL            Sure.   That's what I'm saying the

                                Local Authority had that opportunity,

                                the the capacities had been

                               and that had come through, they

                               had put no constraints upon how

                               that North West terrace should

                               have been, how the West terrace

                              should have been sub-divided.

            DSU61             Min.    Given the experience

                              within the Club, the existence

                              of the Green Guides, the two of

                              them and the Club files on work

                              carried out on the West Terrace,

27.58                         do you think that the Club should

                              have recognised the potentially

                              dangerous situation that existed

                              on the terrace?

            MACKRELL          I think the Club were entitled

                              to rely upon their professional

                              advisors wto had drawn up the

                              schemes and had the schemes

                              approved by the Local Authority.

28.13       DSU61             Fair enough.    Your Club employed

                              EASTWOODS as Safety Engineers

                              and neither do they seam to have

                              recognised the potential for

                             disaster.    With hindsight do you

                             consider that they or the Working

                             Party Advisory Group should have,

                                failure to comply with the Green

                                Guide?

             MACKRELL           I think that's a reasonable

                                assumption in hindsight.

             DSU61              You'd agree with that?

             MACKRELL           I believe so yeah.

 28.38       DSU61             Can we now go on to deal with

                               the situation at the turnstiles

                               Mr MACKRELL.   I know that you were

                               closely questioned on this area

                               at the disaster inquiry, but can

                               you tell me who was responsible

                               for the decision to use only

                               23 turnstiles for the admission

                               into the ground of the twenty

                               four thousand two hundred and

                               fifty six Liverpool fans.

28.56       MACKRELL           Yes South Yorkshire Police advised

                               me that they did not want to use

                               the, the turnstiles which accessed

                               the North Stand at the Leppings, at

                               the Penistone Road end of the ground.

            DSU61              This is for segregation purposes?

            MACKRELL          Correct.

            DSU61             Presumably.

            MACKRELL          Yeah.

29.11       DSU61             Did you ever advise them that to

                              get twenty four thousand people

                              through there was going to take

                                X amount of time and that there

                                may be problems if people arrive

                                late?

             MACKRELL           Yeah but we were both of the

                               opinion I think it's in my

                               transcript that, canment, that

                               I discussed the matter with Mr

                               MOLE ...

             DSU61             Yeah.

             MACKRELL          of South Yorkshire Police and we

                               were confident that the, the flow

                               rate could be achieved, you know,

29.38                          that the South Yorkshire Police though

                               were adamant that they was not going

                               to to use the Penistone Road

                               turnstiles.

            DSU61              You're confident that the flow rate

                               could be achieved...

            MACKRELL           Yeah.

            DSU61              assuming that people came over the

                               period frcm when the turnstiles

                               opened at twelve o'clock (1200)

                              until three o'clock (1500)?

            MACKRELL          Correct.

29.54       DSU61             Did you ever take into account

                              the fact that they may arrive late?

            MACKRELL          Well one has to take into account

                              but obviously one has to look at

                              the, the probability factor, which I




                                                                              840

                               think obviously an imbalance in

                               relation to balancing the fact there

                              might be what you state regarding

                               numbers to go through the turnstiles

                               against the prob... the potential

                              problems for segregation, or lack of

                              segregation, it was felt that this

                              was path to go down, and particularly

                              in view of the fact that in 1987

                              (000087) and 1988 (000088), the

                              situation had had operated

                              satis factorily.

            DSU61             I was just going to ask you that

30.26                         actually.    The situation you used

                              the same number of turnstiles in

                              1988 (000088) and 1987 (000087)?

            MACKRELL          Exactly in 88 yes, exactly the same

                              configuration was operated for both

                             matches.

30.39       DSU61             Fair enough.   Did anyone consider

                              the imbalance between Liverpool with

                             23 turn..., Liverpool fans with

                             23 turnstiles and twenty four

                             thousand, two hundred and fifty six

                             supporters and Nottingham Forest

                             who had 60 turnstiles with twenty

                             nine thousand, eight hundred

                             supporters?

30.53   MACKRELL             Well obviously that was, that was




                                                                            84 *

                              the, that was the, that is the

                              configuration of the ground, if you

                              know whichever it happened it

                              was that way, as again I can only

                              repeat that in 1987 (000087) and

                              1988 (000088) the situation was

                              satisfactory.

            DSU61            Cause it's obviously a matter that

                             the Liverpool supporters had

                             complained about in 1988 (000088)

                             certainly and in 1989 (000089)

                             to the FA I ... (Interruption)

           MACKRELL          No they complained about their

                             allocation of tickets to the FA.

           DSU61             To the turnstile ...

           MACKRELL          About the, about the turnstiles,

           DSU61             you're quite right, you're quite

31.26                        right.   Liverpool have a reputation

                             for late arrival at football grounds

                             which certainly now seents to be

                             quite well documentated,

                             documented.   Were you aware of that?

           MACKRELL          Liverpool have a reputation for a

                             lot of things at football grounds

                             and late arrivals is just one of

                            them.

           DSU61            Late arrival was one of them?

           MACKRELL         Late arrival, they do it, they, the

                            thing is late arrival unfortunately

                                starts to become a common factor

                                within football.

             DSU61             With other Clubs as well as

                                Liverpool or?   (Overtalking)

             MACKRELL          With with their own supporters from ..

                                I think that one only has to go to

                               grounds and one looks at the number I

32.05                          think in the core document there is a,

                               there's a document I referred to

                               which monitors a hone match with

                               Manchester United which I think was

                               in February of 89 (000089) prior to

                               the event only just shows the build

                               up of the supporters, how they

                               arrive at the ...

            DSU61              Yes.

            MACKRELL           stadium, they come late.   I think

                               like the control of alcohol acts

                               people going in for a long, long

                               discussion with this but the control

                               of alcohol situation hasn't helped

                               getting people into into stadia

                               faster.

32.34       DSU61              Knowing that, was that ever taken

                               into account in the planning so

                               far as you're concerned for the

                              the 1989 (000089) Cup Semi-Final?

            MACKRELL          Well the situation is obviously that

                              the opening hour, the opening of the




                                                                              843

                                 turnstiles, the closing is obviously

                                 the kick off time.   One can open up,

                                 one it's very, it's very hard to,

                                 you can't force people to cane

                                 through turnstiles, you can't

                                 force them to arrive, to arrive on

                                 time.

 33.04       DSU61               Presumably the re... that why was,

                                 why was some of the turnstiles in

                                 Penistone Road not utilised?

            MACKRELL             It was for segregation purposes.

            DSU61               And because presumably the Police,

                                the Police were controlling the

                                segregation side of it?

33.16       DSU61               That's right, Police did not want

                                visiting supporters, rather

                                visiting supporters say in

                                88 (000088) and 89 (000089) it

                                was Liverpool supporters in 87

                                (000087) it was Leeds supporters

                                coming onto Penistone Road because

                                then they would be mixing with the

                                other supporters which it was

                                Coventry in 87 (000087) and

                                Forest in 88 (000088) and 89,

                                (000089) mixing supporters on the

                                same road.

33.43       DSU61               When you and other members of your

                                staff realised that there was
MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


                              still a large number of Liverpool

                              supporters missing from the

                              terraces, from the ground, not

                              necessarily the terraces, and you're

                              approaching the kick off time,

                             did you then not think of opening

                             or causing to be opened some of

                             the other turnstiles, you know

                             I mean did you equate, did you

                             equate the fact that you're only

                             using 23 turnstiles and maybe ...?

34.02      MACKRELL          Yeah, realistically I don't think

                             one could have done.   I can't speak

                             for the Polices, I can only spieak

                             as I see it.   The Police would be

                             able to give you technical

                             information but in the same way as

                             they'v they've got the people to

                             come into the Leppings Lane end,

                             they closed off all the, all the

                             side roads which is called the

                            triangle area that goes off from

                            it there would have been, there

                            would have been no way of physically

                            getting those spectators externally

                                   round to those turnstiles.

             DSU61                Yeah.

             MACKRELL             Because it was a conscious Police

                                  effort to keep the supporters

                                  away and you would have actually

                                  broken down one system to try and

                                  solve another.

             DSU61                Yeah, they could of, I mean there

                                  are other, there are ways that the

                                  Police could have achieved that,

                                  had it been, been foreseen or or

                                  noticed in time.    I accept that

                                  it may have upset their

                                  segregation plan but I mean that's

                                  a matter for the Police anyway.

            MACKRELL             That's right, no request of us

                                  for that.

35.05       DSU61                Did you ever notice, I mean you

                                 did notice the, the uneven

                                 distribution I think and the

                                 fact that Nottingham Forest ...

            MACKRELL             I noticed that Nottingham Forest,

                                 obvious Nottingham Forest people

                                 had got there previously, were in

                                 the ground.

35.21   DSU61                    Okay.    Can we go on to deal with

                                 the ticket markings.

        MACKRELL                 Yeah.

        DSU61                    Again this is something which




                                                                             846

                               was dealt with at quite sane

                               length during the tribunal and

                               I don't really want to go, I can

                               go into it in detail but I don't

                              really want to go into it unless

                              you are unclear about what I'm

 35.43                        getting at.   Was the ticket

                              marking in 1988 (000088) and the

                              turnstile marking the same as

                              in 1989 (000089)?

            MACKRELL          Yes.

            DSU61             It was the same?

            MACKRELL          Yeah.

            DSU61             So we've got this business of the

                              turnstiles being marked A, C, B?

            MACKRELL          Yeah.

            DSU61             The diagram on the back of the

                              tickets being marked A, B, B, C,

                              D?

            MACKRELL         Yeah.

            DSU61            And the counterfoil on the ticket

                             being marked for the West Stand

                             anyway, B, which didn't necessarily

                             accord with the, with the diagram.

36.17       MACKRELL         But there was colour codings on

                             the ticket and outside the ground

                             there were signs in the same c o l ...,

                             with the letters on, the A's, B's,

                             with the same colour as on the

                               ticket to go through.    So I hear

                               what you say but I think that with

                               respect as people go through the,

                               go through the ...

            DSU61              If we can refer for the audio to the

                              photograph number 7 ...

            MACKRELL          Yep.

            DSU61             Mr MACKRELL, does that illustrate

                              or indicate what you're trying to

                              show?

           MACKRELL           Yes.

           DSU61              I'm just looking as I'm talking to

                              you to see if I can see the colour

                              marking ... (Overtalking)

           MACKRELL           I'm looking at the red, the red,

                              the red w . .., which appears as red

                              here...

           DSU61              Yes.

           MACKRELL           Or there and the kind of, the purple

                              ticket.

           DSU61             This is looking at the photograph

                             in, to the left-hand side.

           MACKRELL          Yeah.

           DSU61             The red markings by the door of the

                             turnstile marked C.    Presumably

                             the turnstiles to the left of

                             that are marked with a red sign

                             are they?




                                                                            848
 MACKRELL               GRAHAM   HENRY


             MACKRELL             No they're marked with the, the

                                  North, the North Stand.

             D5U61                Which was different from.

             MACKRELL             I can't remember the colour of it

                                  no.

             D5U61                That's fair enough.     The North

                                  Stand.

             MACKRELL             Black.

             DSU61                Blue, red and brown.     Brown was the

                                  West Stand.   Okay.    So what you're

                                  saying is then that whilst they

                                  they didn't exactly accord...

            MACKRELL              The colour coding...

            DSU61                the colour coding...

            MACKRELL             Yeah.

            DSU61                should have, but I mean that that

                                 presupposes that the supporters

                                 are gonna have enough intelligence

                                 to to know which one to go down

                                 if the...

            MACKRELL             Well yeah.

            DSU61                tickets are marked C and they're

                                 trying to go through B.

            MACKRELL             Well the question on intelligence,

                                 you know possibly question that

                                 colour coding might be simpler

                                 than the alphabet, you know and

                                 I say that with respect.

38.26   DSU61                    Fair enough.   I don't want to

                                   go as I say into too much detail

                                   about that because during your

                                  cross examine of it, your

                                  examination in chief I think

                                  in the Inquiry you conceded that

                                  I think that was done by Miss,

                                  by                 your employee

                                  at your direction?

             MACKRELL             That's right, but I say I take

                                  responsibility of obviously her,

                                  for her actions.

38.50       D5U61                 Yeah.     I think you also concede

                                 the way I read the transcripts

                                 that it was less than desirable

                                 the ticket markings was less than

                                 desirable, the...

            MACKRELL             It may have been, I feel, but I I I

                                 do believe it was a minor factor

                                 and not something which was of

                                 paramount importance.

            D5U61                Well that's that's semething I'd

                                 like to ccme back on you, at you

39.16                            o n . ..   I ... do you think that the

                                 confusion and seme of the situation

                                 that arose in Leppings Lane was

                                 contributed to by virtue of the

                                 ticket markings?

            MACKRELL             I don't believe so.

            D5U61                You deny that?




                                                                                8 5.Q

             MACKRELL             Yes I do.
 39.33       D5U61                It must have had seme bearing on

                                  the flow through the turnstiles of

                                  people are moving between turnstiles

                                  and not sure which turnstiles to

                                  go in and the evidence does seem

                                  to, seem to suggest, quite

                                  considerable evidence, that people

                                  were unsure about where they

                                  should be going.
            MACKRELL              Well you know, I can only, you

                                  asked me the question and I can

                                 only answer it as I see it.
39.55       DSU61                Do you think it was a significant

                                  factor in the Police eventually

                                 losing control and having to open

                                 Gate, exit gates A, B and C to

                                 avoid injury?
            MACKRELL             I don't believe so but I can't

                                 obviously speak for the Police's

                                 reasonings behind their opening

                                 the gates.   (Pause)
40.20       DSU61                Having regard to the fact that

                                 all tickets for Leppings Lane

                                 Stand area were marked B,

                                 supporters with these tickets

                                 would automatically make for the

                                 area B and be allowed through

                                 that, through that turnstile




                                                                               851

                                  that served the West terrace

                                  tunnel.     Is that a reasonable

                                  assumption?

             MACKRELL             No because as people go through

                                  the terrace, they they disperse

                                  down there and I think that as

                                  they normally go through a flow

                                  through a turnstiles it acts as

                                  a regulator so they don't go

                                  through in large volume and so

                                  people can then move around.       I

                                  hear what you're saying obviously

                                 regarding the opening of the gate

                                 where there's an influx of people

                                 but under normal circumstances in

                                 which people go through turnstiles

                                 it acts as a regulator as people,

                                 to control...

            DSU61                I will accept that, I think that's

                                 general...

            MACKRELL             Yeah.

            DSU61                you know we're on common ground

                                 with that...

            MACKRELL             Yeah.

            DSU61                But what I'm saying to you is

41.12                            that, I mean first of all because

                                 of the ticket markings, people

                                 are likely to converge on, on

                                 those turnstiles, so that creates




                                                                               852

                                 I would, I would perhaps argue,

                                 that creates a back log out in

                                 Leppings Lane and once they

                                 get through then and they've got

                                 a ticket marked B, which is for

                                 the standing area, on the West

                                 terrace, then the first thing

                                 that they see is this signing

                                 A and B to the left and right of

                                 the tunnel?

41.41       MACKRELL             But if you accept that premise,

                                 then the situation never occurred

                                 in 1987 (000087) or 88 (000088)

                                when it was a similar to

                                configuration of the ground and

                                tickets.

            DSU61               It was exactly the same was it in

                                1988 (000088)?

            MACKRELL            Yes.

41.58       D5U61               In 1988 (000088) there was seme

                                evidence again from members of the

                                public that in the fact the police

                                had had to put a cordon across

                                those, across that tunnel and

                                that's a matter that's certainly

                                very arguably...

            MACKRELL            Sure, but but following on from

                                88 (000088), the Police never

                                raised any comment to me regarding

                               how how people got into the ground.

           DSU61               The fact that the, there is the

                               words 'Standing' in large letters

                               above the mouth of the tunnel

                               tends to confirm that the B

                               marking on the tunnel, marking

                               on the tickets, I mean that's

                               that's, they're all features

                               that the the central pens are

                               traditionally I understand

                               the best peak viewing area, the

                               best viewing area as far as the

                               fans are concerned.   You've

                               got a situation where you've got

                               a turnstile feeding directly

                               in to the concourse and

                               immediately opposite the

                               concourse is the tunnel marked

                               B and the tickets are marked B

                               there's the word 'Standing'

                               across the top of the tunnel,

                               and people would whether they

                               knew the layout of the ground or

                               not, would presumably want to go

                               towards that area?

43.11      MACKRELL            Yeah, but as ... I appreciate the

                               size was larger but there was also

                               a 'Standing' sign which I admit was

                               smaller to the right directing




                                                                           854

                                 people on to the pens in front of

                                 the Police Control.    (Buzzer)

 43.26       D5U61               Yeah, this, the fact that other

                                 signing indicating pens 1, 2, 6

                                 and 7 is not very conspicuous

                                 coupled with the fact that

                                 supporters traditionally went

                                 to stands, to the stand behind the

                                goals all increased the possibility

                                of overcrowding in the central

                                terraces, pens 3 and 4.     Am I

                                right?

            MACKRELL            Well you're right in obviously in

                                what happened on the day, but

                                one can only say that previously

                                that situation didn't occur.

                                Be it either previous two semi­

                                finals or league games where

                                there's a, a near to capacity

                                numbers on the terraces.

            D5U61               Okay.    The buzzer's just gone,

                                Mr MACKRELL.    If we can just

                                adjourn for a few minutes

                                while we load another tape in

                                then we'll resume the interview.

                                Okay.

            MACKRELL            Sure.

44.13                           (Tape switched off).

00.09       DSU61               Yes Mr MACKRELL we are resuming the
MACKRELL               GRAHAM   HENRY


            (1536)               the interview then, remember you're

                                 still under caution and the same

                                 people are still in the interview

                                 rocm as previously.   Okay.
            MACKRELL             Yes.

            D5U61                We talked about the signing

                                 indicating pens 1, 2, 6 and 7

                                 not being very conspicuous and

                                discussed about the fans going

                                down the central terrace, that

                                area acting as a, a magnet if you

                                like.   In hindsight do you think

                                that the signing to other parts of

                                the terrace was inadequate and

                                likely to contribute to

                                overcrowding on those pens?
           MACKRELL             I think it's difficult to say in

                                hindsight, I think it, I think it

                                could be improved but whether it

                                was a factor I think is questionable.
01.03      DSU61                Fair enough.   Had the signing ever

                                been that the, what may be

                                inadequate signing, ever been

                                pointed out to you prior to the

                                disaster?
           MACKRELL             No.

           DSU61                And to you the Club I'm talking

                                about as well now.

                                now?

             MACKRELL             No.

01.15        D5U61                Is it something that you would

                                  have expected EASTWOODS or the

                                  Police or the Working Party

                                  Advisory Group to have brought

                                  to your notice, if they, if it

                                  was inadequate?
             MACKRELL             If it was inadequate I suppose

                                  I would have expected possibly

                                  the Advisory Group to bring

                                  it to my attention on the basis

                                 that they bring matters which

                                 if it's referred to you by

                                 yourself as significant, they

                                 bring through forward a great

                                 deal of matters which are very

                                 insignificant.
01.42       DSU61                Yeah.   As the Club Safety Officer

                                 do you think that you should, you

                                 should have foreseen this possibility

                                 and perhaps done something about it?
            MACKRELL             It was something which obviously I

                                 had seen, but you know, I can't

                                 say now that I regarded it as of of

                                 great importance.   I felt that what

                                 was there was adequate, at that

                                 time, obviously otherwise I would

                                 have done something about it.

                               minute to the area at the entrance

                               to the ground in Leppings Lane,

                               the courtyard in front of the

                               turnstiles I'm talking about now,

                               this is a comparatively small area

                               in which the whole large crowd, it's

                              shape which is like a bottleneck

                              does not help in that once people

                              are in it, and it becomes crowded

                              it is almost impossible to get them

                              out.     Was this ever a factor that

                              was recognised by the Club prior

                              to the disaster?

            MACKRELL          No, not, I can't say, I can't say

                              it has, you know when one looks at

                              the situation of comparing the

                              ground to other, other stadia, I

                              think it, you know, kind of it's it's

                              no better, no worse, than a lot of

                             other grounds.

02.49       DSU61             I see.    Did Dr EASTWOOD'S firm or

                             in the supervision ever point out

                                 I think back to 1985 (000085) in

                                 relation to changing the

                                 configuration of the turnstiles

                                 at Leppings Lane, but obviously

                                 what, after that had been

                                 completed and prior to any

                                 implementation the Bradford

                                 City Fire had occurred and

                                 obviously there was a change

                                 of emphasis of priorities.

             DSU61              Yeah.   Fair enough.    In fact you,

                                you're bringing me on to to the

03.50                           DPP Document Numbers 63, 64 and 65.

                                Are these the plans that you're

                                referring to ...

            MACKRELL            Yes indeed.

04.03       D5U61               Mr MACKRELL?    Can you tell me were

                                those plans designed primarily

                                to achieve segregation or were

                                they designed to improve the

                                safety or both?

            MACKRELL            I think everything really is a

                           ! combination of both.




                                                                             859

            DSU61               Mn.    I noticed that, and in fact

                                you just made mention of it, that

                                in fact when this was put to the

                                Board, this, these various schemes

                                then, the Board turned the, turned

                                them down, they'd obviously turned

                                it down for financial reasons as

                                you mentioned given the Popplewell

                                that sort of was coming on top.

04.45      MACKRELL             That's right, there was a great

                                deal of expenditure and by

                               examining the records which

                               obviously I did when I made, gave

                               evidence to the Inquiry, that

                               year the Club spent twD hundred

                               and forty three thousand pounds

                               on safety and associated works

                               in other areas of the ground so

                               it wasn't a matter of not spending

                               the money to keep or to spend on

                               something else, it was literally

                               the priorities obviously that came

                               up particularly in relation to wooden

                               structures whereas, where the main

                               stand at Sheffield Wednesday is, a

                               wooden structure.

           DSU61               So I mean the, the Club whilst they

                               employed Dr EASIWDOD'S firm as

                               Safety Consultants, they didn't




                                                                             860

                                always act on his advice?

             MACKRELL           Well I can't quite actually mean ..

                                find another case when we didn't

                                actually act on his advice, this

                               was a situation here where a plan

                               and a scheme was drawn up and

                               obviously as a result of Bradford

                               City, the moment after that every

                               local Authority in the country and

                               every Fire Service in the country

                               was knocking on Club's doors

                               regarding wooden structures.

05.50       DSU61              It does tend, I mean it does tend

                               to illustrate that they weren't

                               adverse to exercising their, if you

                               like independence when they needed

                               to of all ... (Interruption)

            MACKRELL           Well I think it shows also that

                               they weren't adverse to, to

                               spending money were they felt was

                              a, was a priority.

06.07       DSU61             Mn.   Do you think that erecting

                              seine form of wall or other means of

                              dividing that court yard up,

                              to feed the terraces, sorry the

                              turnstiles, even the existing

                              bank of turnstiles, might have

                              inproved the situation in ...?

        MACKRELL              I think it's, I think realistically




                                                                            861

                                  it's questionable in that you've got

                                 other, you've got some officers who

                                 want speaking to on a policing

                                 aspect who would prefer the turnstiles

                                 to be right out on the road aspects so

                                 there there's never any any element of

                                 funnelling and you've got others who

                                 want a larger configuration so that's,

                                 it's not, it's not universal amongst

                                 the Police when it comes to actually

                                 • *   •




            DSU61                I'm thinking really about trying

                                 to get organised queuing...

            MACKRELL             Yeah.

            DSU61               Something to organise.   I mean

                                seme grounds, other grounds I've

                                seen, they've struck some things

                                like that, where they've got

                                barriers, steel barriers, similar

                                to what you've got in fact...

            MACKRELL            Yeah.

            DSU61               to the right of Turnstile G.

            MACKRELL            Yeah, but I think but in as I

                                can only go back to saying that

                                when it comes to the games which

07.12                           we're talking about, in 87 (000087)

                                and 88 (000088) we didn't have a

                                problem, in 88 (000088) and the

                                difference between 88 (000088)
MACKRELL              GRAHAM   HENRY                                  148


                               and 89 (000089) was that the

                                spectators tickets were checked, to

                               check to see if they had tickets

                               away from the ground by the Police.

           DSU61               Did you actually see that

                               happening?

           MACKRELL            No I had that reported to me by

                               Mr MOLE ...

           DSU61               Yeah.

           MACKRELL            that this was done and and I under­

                               stand, again I've only heard this

                               from other officers, maybe your own,

                               I'm not certain, or South Yorkshire,

                               that this did not in fact take place

                               this in the 89 (000089) Cup, in the

                               89 (000089) Cup.

           DSU61               In fact it did place, it may have

                               been to a more limited degree and

07.54                          I think it did take place.     Can

                               we now move on to deal with the

                               situation with the stewards.     I

                               appreciate that it is already

                               and posting on match days, is that
MftCKRELL               GRAHAM   HENRY


                                 correct?

                                 pursue in any detail at this

                                 stage because it is already quite

                                 well dealt with in fact in your,

                                 in your transcript, but if I can

                                 refer you to the next Document

            MftCKRELL            That's correct.

            MftCKRELL            Yeah.

09.14       D5U61                That implies that they have

                                 overall responsibility and to

                                 that end they should, they should

                                 ensure that stewards are properly

                                 qualified.   Do you agree?

            MACKRELL             When you say overall responsibility,

                                 how do you define overall

                                 responsibility?

                                 safety of members of the public?

            MACKRELL             They have, I I believe they have a

                                 responsibility to that end yeah.

09.42       DSU61                Yeah.    It goes on to deal with

                                 effective deployment and the

                                 fact that they should be given

                                 written instructions, which is

                                 laid down, at 3, at Item 3, the

                                 Document mentioned that stewards

                                 should be distributed around the

                                ground to fulfil the four duties

10.02                           the first of these (a) talks about

                                controlling or directing members of

                                leaving the ground.     Is that right?

           MACKRELL             Yes.

           DSU61                What do you understand by that?

           MACKRELL             Well I think it's as it says,

                                the exits are manned by Sheffield

             MACKRELL             I don't think you can pick things

                                  in isolation, I think you could say,

                                  you know, as what what as required.

                                  Because anything now with regard to

                                  stewarding, stewarding is a, is a,

                                  is a different, is a situation where

                                 stewarding changes every every, every

                                 game depending upon the opposition.

                                 the written instructions that were

                                 issued to the stewards I think and

                                 I'm referring initially to the

                                 Director of Public Prosecutions

            MACKRELL             Yeah.

                                First of all you find that there

                                are these in the instructions in

                                this booklet to your stewards and

                                then there are a series of other

                                what seems to be a series anyway

                                of other instructions to stewards

                                and on these are also stamped

                                DPP Document 1 for the audio.

                                Can you tell me, I say there

                                seems to be two or three of these,

                                can you tell me which one of those

                                is actually in force?

11.58      MACKRELL            The situation and it's an ongoing

                               thing, each time the year, the

                               year these were forwarded to

                               usually Inspector SEWELL of South

                               Yorkshire Police for his canments

                               of anything he wanted us on the

                               stewarding.

           DSU61               Yes.

           MACKRELL            The arrangements, it was basically

                               the situation that was the one that

                               was issued at that present time to

                               the, to the stewards.

           DSU61               This is the o n e ...

           MACKRELL            This one for example here w a s ...

           DSU61               Fran the hand book you're talking

                               about?

           MACKRELL            Yeah, yeah the one here you referred




                                                                            867
MACKRELL               GRAHAM HENRY                                 153


                               you before...

            DSU61              Yeah.
12.30       MACKRELL           Document Number 43 was purely a

                              Document issued by, to me b y Doug

                              LOCK.

            DSU61             So it wasn't a, addressed, it seems

                              to indicate that it was circulated

                              to management...

            MACKRELL          That was issued only to me ...,

            DSU61             generally.

           MACKRELL           only to me.   I might have given it

                              to               but it was not

                              issued to any other other than me.

           DSU61              Would it go to the Chief Stewards

                              that Document or one of the

                              management?

           MACKRELL           No that was really, that was a

                              discussion Document, for me that

                             wasn't an implementation Document,

                             that was something he produced for

                             me.

           DSU61             It does seem to be something if I

                             may say so, a little bit more than

                             that, it seems to be.

           MACKRELL          I think that if you look at it, most

                             of it's cribbed out the Green Guide,

                             you know he's actually played with

                             a photocopy of it and put it

                             together.




                                                                          668
MACKRELL              GRAHAM   HENRY                                   154

            DSU61               I'd certainly agree with it seme of

                                it's out of the Green Guide.

           MACKRELL             Yeah.

           DSU61                But I mean that's...

           MACKRELL             But that was it, that was, it was

                                produced for that and not

                                circulated like to other Chief

                                Stewards or other members of the

                                staff.

13.18      DSU61                So what are you actually saying

                                they were acting under the

                                instructions in the handbook?

           MACKRELL            Yes.

           DSU61               And those are the instructions.

           MACKRELL            Those are the instructions that

                               they were, they were issued with.

13.38      DSU61               It hasn't got a set document

                               number.   Okay none of those instruc­

                               tions so far as I can see in the

                               hand book that you're referring to

                               Mr MACKRELL seemed to reflect the

                               element of control and direction of

                               members of the public entering or

                               leaving the ground mentioned in the

                               management information Document

                               prepared by Mr LOCK.    Is that an

                               oversight perhaps on the Club's

                               behalf?

        MACKRELL               No I think it's not sir, I think that




                                                                             869

                               it's, the the parts are covered on

                               their duties.

            DSU61              Wall it doesn't, it doesn't talk of,

                               I mean it talks about the managing,

                              manning gates?

            MACKRELL          Yeah.

            DSU61              In and out of the ground ...?

            MACKRELL          Yeah.

            DSU61             and keeping them open.

           MACKRELL           Spectators sitting in correct

                              seats.

           DSU61              That's right in regard to

                              stewards in the stands...

           MACKRELL           Yeah yeah.

14.22      DSU61              but it doesn't actually talk about

                              directing people ... (Interruption)

                              to pens when they enquire, things

                              like that?

           MACKRELL           Well I I think, m y interpretation

                              of that is implicit.

           DSU61              Fair enough.     I mean I would say

                              that those instructions are more

                              in the nature of an administrative

                              information sheet almost, to the,

                             to the stewards.

           MACKRELL          Yeah ... but but you got you got to

                             read there's also an instruction that

                             these are issued at the same time

                             as, and they go, then they go through




                                                                            870

                               and obviously I think they need, they

                               need to be regarded in conjunction

                              with those items.

15.05       DSU61              I think in your transcript you

                              actually talk about being present

                              at the steward's training.

           jMACKRELL          Yes.
           I
           DSU61              Can you tell me whether that was

                              reflected in the training, the the

                              business ... ?

15.16      MACKRELL           I understood it to be.   I addressed,

                              I addressed the group in brief and

                              then it was left to Mr LOCK, then

                              a representative of South Yorkshire

                              Police which is usually Inspector

                              SEWELL then there was a gentleman

                              from the South Yorkshire Fire Service

                              and generally it was the St John's

                              Ambulance Brigade - it has been the

                              SYMAS.

           DSU61              Yeah, but I mean none, none of them

                              seem to be acting in a capacity

                             other than manning the gate or

                             manning, manning stands and and

                             assisting people to their seat.

                             And I do accept that I mean as far

                             as public order is concerned their

                             instructions are that they don't




                                                                             871

                                  situations and that the Police ...

                                  have the prime responsibility to

                                  deal with those.      (Pause).

 16.02       MACKRELL             Yeah, I hear what, I hear what, I

                                  hear what you say you know, but I

                                  I regard that, you know, I       I   regard

                                  that they're reasonably clear

                                  and that I don't think there's

                                  any impression that they wouldn't

                                  understood what their duties were.

16.18       DSU61                 My, the management document also

                                 mentions manning of the entrances

                                 exits and other strategic points.

                                 My enquiries show that there was

                                 no stewards on the concourse area

                                 behind the West Stand on the gates

                                 between the concourse areas or

                                 on the tunnel.    I   see those

                                 actually as strategic points ...

                                 explain to me why w . .. ?

16.38       MACKRELL             Yeah, they had stewards on Gate C

                                 who were there and that Gate C is

                                 the best situation within the

                                 concourse to monitor, to monitor

                                 the concourse cause you're at the,

                                 situation, and also you've got,

                                 there was a steward on the wall

                                 which bisects the back of the

                                 West Stand.

             DSU61               In the gate of, at the gate in

                                 the wall?

            MACKRELL             Yes.

            DSU61                Giving access to the area of the

                                 West Stand?

            MACKRELL             That bisects the the West Stand.

            DSU61                Can you just clarify that for me?

            MACKRELL             Yeah.

            DSU61                Can you, would you like to

                                 indicate that?    Yeah Mr MACKRELL

                                 is, is indicating the, the gap

                                 in the wall, as he says bisecting

                                the concourse area behind the

                                West Stand giving access to the

                                entrance to the, to the West Stand

                                seating area.     Is that right Mr

                                MACKRELL?

17.40       DSU61               There doesn't appear though to be

                                any other, other stewards in that

                                area, and I'll accept what you're

                                saying, that you've got steward

                                on the gate.

        MACKRELL                And you've got also stewards ...

        DSU61                   The C Gate this is?

        MACKRELL                and you've got stewards also at the

                                that lead up into the West Stand.

            DSU61               Right, but there's nobody actually, on

                                on that concourse or indeed on any of

                                the other concourses with the general

                                responsibility which to me seems to

                                be implicit in the management document

                                at least, for direct, for the purpose

                                of direction and control of people

                                that are coming into the ground?

                                a very small space you've got at least

                               seven people, three on gate, three on

                               Gate C, at least three or four at the

           DSU61               These people are all dealing with

                               specific responsibilities in relation

                               to the gate, they're not dealing with

                                are, they all are there to enhance

                                the viewing of the public, you know

                                they're all officers of the company,

                                however low down, low down the

                                scale and, they would be expected

                                to deal with reasonable requests

                                of asking for where toilets are,

                                whatever duties, because it's part

                                of the brief to familiarise them­

                                selves with the, with the area to

                               which they are located.

19.13      DSU61                They do seem to have congregated

                               as you say behind the gate, or

                               they are actually in the entrance

                               to the Stands.

           MACKRELL            Yeah.

           DSU61               They're together.   I mean is your

                               understanding of what they should

                               have been doing then?

           MACKRELL            No, what I'm saying that that

                               they're grouped to three.     We're not

                               talking about something which is

                               very far apart.   You know the

                               entrance from going through

                               those turnstiles to where the

                               C gate is and to where the

                               more than ten yards away from

                               from a steward.

            DSU61                When you ccroe through the

                                 turnstiles, if you're heading

                                 directly towards the West, sorry

                                 the tunnel and the West Stand.

            MACKRELL             Yes. (Overtalking)    You go past a

                                 steward, you go past a steward.

                                 Excuse me if I may.     You've you've

                                 got stewards literally situated

                                 there, which is on Gate C.

            DSU61                You're indicating C gate.

20.00      MACKRELL              I'm mentioning C gate.    You've

                                got another steward here, which

                                 is on the gate which I referred

                                to previously, the hole in the

                                wall ...

           DSU61                Right.

           MACKRELL             and you've got more stewards here.

                                In addition to that you've got

                                programme sellers which are, which

                                are located in the area.

           DSU61                Yeah but the steward that's

                                in the gate in the wall.

           MACKRELL             Yeah.

           DSU61                Can be either side of that

                                wall.

           MACKRELL             No he's on, no the steward on

        DSU61                   Either side...

                                  the Gate C yes.   He can be on on

                                  that situation but specifically the

                                  people going through turnstiles

                                  A to G have to walk past the three

                                  stewards who are on Gate C.

            DSU61                 Yeah, well they're off to their

                                  right as they ccroe through.

            MftCKRELL             It's not very, it's not, it's it's

                                  not actually a, it's only a bank

                                  of seven turnstiles.

20.42       DSU61                 Would you have expected those

                                  stewards to be spread out on

                                  that concourse as opposed to being

                                 on the gate? (Overtalking)

           MftCKRELL             No, because it's their, it's it's a

                                 safety requirement and there must

                                 be always a minimum of two, of two

                                 stewards on that gate, so we put

                                 three there as a back up in case

                                 one wants to go to the toilet, one

                                 is called away for sane other, sane

                                 whatever.

           DSU61                 So in fact they're working, within

                                 their terms of reference?

           MftCKRELL             Yeah, they're working with their terms

                                 of reference but they are expected

                                 to do.

             MACKRELL             To be normal things, they are

                                  kind of, you know, kind of

                                  courtesy element that one has to

                                  do with the job.

             DSU61                I mean the, the stewards on the bottom

                                  of the stand.

             MACKRELL             Yeah.

             DSU61                on that concourse, that stand,

                                  that stand area, was was that used,

                                  that entrance to the stand o f f ...



            MACKRELL             Yes, yes it was.

            DSU61                off the concourse fed by A to G?

21.32       MACKRELL             It, that was, people came through

                                 there because people were

                                 coming through 9 to 16 to go up

                                 into the West Stand.

21.49       DSU61                Fair enough.     One last question

                                 to do with that, I mean

                                 presumably the Police approved

                                 the number of stewards who were

                                 working in these areas anyway

                                 and you act in consultation with

                                 the Police when you do that?

            MACKRELL             Yes.

            DSU61                Yeah?

                               they would perhaps have been in

                               the position to recognise the

                              volume of supporters that had

22.34                         pen became overfilled.       If it was

                              in a situation which it became

                              overfilled after the gate had

                              been opened, after Gate C had been

                              opened, I don't think anybody

                              could have possibly have have

                              directed that, that group of

                              people.

22.46       DSU61            This is at 1452 (1452) when Mr

                             DUCKENFIELD gave the order to

                             open the gates?

            MACKRELL         Yes.

            DSU61            Yeah.      If it was before that, I

                             mean there is a suggestion that

                             the, those pens were b e c o m i n g

                               overcrowded before that?

           MACKRELL            Sure.

           DSU61               Let me say not overcrowding

                               necessarily, but there was an

                               uneven distribution.

23.03      MACKRELL            Yeah but the situation was, was

                               it was accepted that the Police

                               were on were stewarding pens.

                               The police had got the close

                               circuit television, the Police

                               Control Box is right above the

                               area where it took place. You know

                               I, I would regard that as being

                               the prime Police responsibility.

           DSU61               To monitor the pens.

           MACKRELL            To monitor, to monitor that

                               situation.

           DSU61               Yeah, I think you dealt with

                               that in seme detail again in

                               your transcript...

           MACKRELL            Yes.

23.30      DSU61               previously.   Did the stewards at

                               Leppings Lane end have any direct

                               responsibility towards the

                               supporters apart from opening gates

                               and manning the turnstiles and

                               stands to look after seat...

                               seating?

                                 supporters with tickets for seats

                                 gained access to the West Stand.

             DSU61               Yeah.   I'm really, what I'm

                                 really coming back to is this

                                 direction and control and

                                 interpretation of direction and

                                 control?

            MACKRELL             No I think there's as I say it

                                 goes on from what I said

                                 previously.

            DSU61                I accept that the reason of no

                                stewards actually on the West

                                terrace because the Liverpool

                                supporters were likely to be

                                hostile, but dealing with gates

                                in the perimeter fence, there does

                                seem to be a dis, disagreement or

                                document does say that stewards

                                will man gates which are not

                                     said that the management document

                                     to be fully implemented.    The

                                     management document was, was states

                                     that however the situation was that

                                     the gates onto the track were always

                                     manned by the Police.

                 DSU61               I, I understand, was it the

                                     position with the gates at the

                                     front of the pen onto the

                                     perimeter track that these be

                                    manned by the Police and that

                                    that's been, has that been the

                                    situation for seme time?

                MACKRELL            That's been the situation indeed.

                DSU61               How long, how long has that been?

                MACKRELL            Ever since I've been at the Club.

                DSU61               So it's taken place before y ou...

                MACKRELL            Yes indeed.



•
    25.06       DSU61               presumably.   Is there any

                                    agreement, written agreement in

                                    force as far as you know to do

                                    with that, or is it just something

                                    that's become a precedent?

                MACKRELL            The written agreement now that

                                    we have with South Yorkshire Police

                                    is considerably different to that

                                    which was current on that day.

                DSU61               Was there one actually in force

                                    a written agreement?




                                                                                  ool
 MACKRELL               GRAHAM HENRY


             MACKRELL           No, no.

             DSU61              It was an understanding between

                                you and the Commanders, or

                               your your predecessors?

             MACKRELL          No it was an understanding,

                               understanding, exactly and it

                               was a situation, it was something

                               that the Police had never

                               approached me to say, why

                               aren't your chaps doing this job.

                               It was obviously that they

                               accepted that it was a job that

                               they did.

25.40       DSU61              Mm.     Fair enough.   Was that

                               agreement ever taken up with

                               Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD

                               when he took over from Chief,

                               Chief Superintendent MOLE?

            MACKRELL           No.

            DSU61              Or did you assume the situation

                               would be allowed to continue?

25.49       MACKRELL           I assumed the situation would be

                              be continued because Mr DUCKENFIELD

                              only had I believe might be one match

                              prior to the semi-final.      I believe

                              he took command on the 27th o f ...

            DSU61             March.

            MACKRELL          27th of March, I think he came to

                              the last match where Brian MOLE
 MACKRELL              GRAHAM    HENRY


                                 was commanding...   I stand to be

                                 corrected, I, it's just an opinion

                                 that I think that happened and I'm

                                 not sure after that I think there

                                 might have been one game at which

                                 he was there.
 26.16       DSU61               But I mean it was never, it was

                                 never put up that there may be a

                                 problem about manning those gates

                                 or who should man them at all?
            MACKRELL             Not at all, not at all.
            DSU61                This is the front perimeter gates.
            MACKRELL             Exactly, you know, quite honestly

                                 the, there wasn't a great, there

                                wasn't a great discussion about

                                policing at all, it was a matter

                                of obviously following on from

                                what Mr MOLE had already already

                                set up.

            DSU61               It was a bit early for him to make

                                any changes in any case ...
            MACKRELL            I would have thought so because ...
            DSU61               until he understood what he was

                                doing?

         MACKRELL               he obviously wanted to get his

                                feet under the table I assume.
26.43    DSU61                  What about the gates at the back

                                of the pens under the front of the

                                West Stand, it does, does seem to
MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY                                    170


                              be scrne dispute about who was

                              responsibile for manning them

                              the Police or stewards or indeed

                              whether they should be manned at

                              all.    What's your understanding of

                              that situation?

           MACKRELL           Well the situation there is that

                              I understand, there were definitely

                              not Sheffield Wednesday stewards

                              on that area, it was left, it was

                              a situation that that was left to

                              the Police.   However, because of

                              the fact obviously that all the pens

                              have a mutual toilet, refreshment

                              facility, there always is going to

                              be seme flow between the various

                              pens.

27.19      DSU61             Is it, does it make any differences

                              as to whether the gates are closed or

                              open as to whether they're manned?

           MACKRELL          I think, I'm not aware of that,

                              I'm not aware of any difference.

                             But as I say because, because it

                             was a situation that was in the

                             hands of the Police.

27.37      DSU61             Yeah, fair enough.    Did you

                             appreciate that because of their

                             location towards the back of the pen

                             under the stand they were difficult
 MACKRELL               GRAHAM   HENRY                                     171


                                  to see and because of this when

                                  the pens were crowded supporters

                                  needed seme assistance to achieve

                                  any even spread?

             MACKRELL            Well I was aware obviously of

                                 where the location of the gates

                                 were, but again it goes right back

                                 to what I say that the the pen

                                 the configuration of it had been

                                 approved by the, had of been approved

                                 by the Local Licensing Authority.

            DSU61                Yeah, but the, that doesn't

                                 actually answer the question.       Did

                                 you appreciate that because of

                                 their location towards the back of

                                 the pen, in other words you

                                 personally, under the stand, they

                                 were difficult to see and because

                                 of this when the pens were crowded,

                                 supporters needed seme assistance

                                 to achieve an even spread.    Did

                                 you appreciate that?

28.24       MACKRELL             Yeah, I don't think it would have

                                 made any difference where so ever

                                 where the gates were, if because

                                 by definition if the pens full you

                                 hardly, you're going to struggle to

                                 see the gates wherever they are.

            DSU61                So what you're saying that you did




                                                                                 836

                                  appreciate but it wouldn't have

                                  made any difference whether they

                                  were there or otherwise?

                                  (Overtalking)

             MACKRELL             The thing is I acknowledged where

                                  they were when, when any ground is

                                  full it's difficult, it's difficult

                                  to move about and I don't think that

                                  that really had a factor, had a

                                  factor on it.

 28.50       DSU61               Was there, has there ever been any

                                 other sort of problems with crowds

                                 achieving the even distribution...

            MACKRELL             No.

            DSU61                through those gates?

            MACKRELL             No.

            DSU61                I mean, presumably the same

                                 situation again applied in 1988

                                 (000088) and 1987 (000087) did it?

            MACKRELL             That's right.    We didn't, it didn't

                                 present a problem.

            DSU61                No problem?

            MACKRELL             No.

29.12       DSU61                Do you believe that there was a

                                 failure between you and the police

                                 to allocate responsibility for

                                 manning those gates?

29.19       MACKRELL             I I don't believe so in that

                                 there was, it was a situation




                                                                               0 O /

                                 that was in the hands of the

                                 Police, the Police never did

                                 anything to say that it wasn't

                                 their responsibility to do so.

            DSU61                Conversely you never did anything

                                 to clarify the situation with

                                 the Police?

            MACKRELL             No but having said that, there

                                 wasn't, there wasn't, there

                                 wasn't a written agreement

                                 between the parties and I

                                 inherited an arrangement which

                                 had obviously successfully

                                worked and had successfully

                                worked for the two previous

                                semi-finals when I was in, when

                                 I was in charge.

29.46       DSU61               Wasn't there an agreement between

                                the Working Party that the Police

                                would in fact man those gates.

                                Are you aware of that?

                                It was a condition of of the

                                radial fences being put in,

                                the Officer Working Party

                                imposed the condition that

                                there would be gates at the back

                                which would be manned by the Police.

30.06   DSU61                   Okay.    Do you believe that there

                                was a failure in 1989 (000089)




                                                                             8 38

                                to locate stewards on the

                               concourse area behind the West

                               Stand to direct and control the

                               supporters entering away frcm the

                               tunnel and around the wings into

                               pens 1, 2, 6 and 7?

           MACKRELL            No I think there was sufficient

                               numbers there.

           DSU61               Earlier in this interview we

                               touched on the monitoring of

                               the crowd in relation to

                               compliance with the Safety

                               Certificate, Schedule 3, and

                               I am still particularly

                               interested in the West terrace.

                               Given that there were no

                               stewards on either the terrace

                               or the concourse behind the

                               stand and the fact that the

                               Green Guide stipulates that

                               the Club oblique stroke

                               stewards should monitor the

                               situation in regard to crowd

                               capacity in the pens, how how

                               did you fulfil your obligations?

30.52      MACKRELL            There was an obligation taken on

                               by the, taken on by the Police

                               in that the Police were, the

                               Police had accepted that they
MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY                                 175


                              monitored and stewarded the and

                              stewarded the West Terrace.

           DSU61              This is from the Control Box?

           MACKRELL           From the Control Box, visually

                              frcm the track because they they

                              looked after the perimeter gates

                             and by way of close circuit

                             television.

           DSU61             To be fair though, don't you think

                             that, don't you think that you're

                             abrogating your responsibilities by

                             saying, it's not, is it just as

                             simple as that the Police are

                             watching from the Box, therefore

                             they must be monitoring, they're

                             doing it be agreement?

31.26      MACKRELL          No, but at the end of the day the

                             Police are always adamant to me of

                             regarding close circuit

                             television refinements to the

                             close circuit television to be

                             done.   The Club has, we as a

                             Club probably spend more money

                            on close circuit television than

                            any other Club in the country in

                            upgrading, adding bits on to it,

                            and you know, I would regard that

                            as one of, one of the reasons why

                            we're doing that.

 31.45       DSU61               But don't you think your stewards

                                 should also have had some sort of

                                 a function, the Green Guide, which

                                 I accept isn't mandatory, does

                                 lay down that they, that stewards

                                 have a responsibility for

                                 assisting the even distribution

            DSU61               Also this general duty of care

                                of course that the Club has.

            MACKRELL            Of course a general duty of care

                                which one, which one accepts.

                                However, however it was a

                                situation where the Police and I

                                think it goes down if one refers

                                back to the transcripts that

                                the Police accepted that it was

                                their responsibility to steward,

                                steward that area of the terrace.

32.27       DSU61               Okay.   You mention in your statement

                                you were watching the build up

                                that Liverpool fans were slower

                                building up in the North Stand

                              you notice the uneven

                              distribution in pens 3 and 4

                             as compared to 1, 2, 6 and 7?

           MACKRELL          At that time I did not.     But

                             obviously as it, as it later

                             you know, kind of went onto

                             that time.

           DSU61             Mm.     Perhaps at this point we

                             can have a look, for the audio,

                             for the audio we're looking at

33.04                        the video film, DPP Document

                             a much higher level than you

                            would be when you went out to

 34.28       DSU61               You see this is at a time just

                                 before the gates outside, C gate,

                                 are opened on the authority of

                                 the Police.   We're looking now

                                 at 1445 (1445) for the audio

                                 and we're looking at the North

                                 panning along towards pens 3

                                 and 4.   In fact we're now

                                 looking at pens 3 and 4 at

                                 1445 (1445) on the, on the video.

35.12                           You can see there that there's

                                quite a considerable difference

                                in the density.   (Fades away).

                                What I'm getting at is, when you

                                went in and out and I appreciate

                                that you're obviously doing other

                                things.

            MACKRELL            Yeah.

            DSU61               Did you notice that, I mean

                                distribution at all?

            MACKRELL            I didn't notice anything in

                                distribution until afterwards

                                no.

35.37       DSU61               Mr LOCK, I think came to you.

            MACKRELL            Yeah.

            DSU61               At sort of, 1448 (1448) or

                                thereabouts to tell you about

                                 the fact that there'd been an

                                 inflow of supporters during

                                 the ejection b y the Police...

              MACKRELL           Yeah.

              DSU61             of something like three or

                                four hundred supporters.     Did

                                he mention to you anything

                                about the number of Liverpool

                                supporters that were in the

                                were outside?

             MACKRELL           No.

             DSU61              Did he mention to you anything

                                about the uneven distribution

                                that the...

             MACKRELL           No, no.

             DSU61             He hadn't noticed anything like

                               that, I mean he's he's also

                               an ex police officer?

             MACKRELL          That's right yes.

             DSU61             Pretty experienced sort of a

                               guy.

         MACKRELL              Yeah.

         DSU61                 Do you think he, is he more

                               likely to have seen the problem

                               than you or?

36.21    MACKRELL              Sure, but I think you're you're

            MACKRELL            Doug LOCK, myself and notifying

                                me of what's happening if we've

                                got to contact the Police,

                                whatever.

36.50       DSU61               Yeah.    I mean the only point

                                I'm trying to make here is you

                                were together with Mr LOCK

                                at some stage.

            MACKRELL            Yeah.

36.56       DSU61               At a time when the pens, those

                                pens 3 and 4 were pretty, pretty

                                well full, and there seemed to

                                be, there would have been an

                                uneven distribution or there

                                seems to be from the film an
MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


                              uneven distribution.    Now all I'm

                              trying to point, the only point

                              I'm trying to make i s ...

           MACKRELL           It wasn't apparent from when

                             we had the conversation.

           DSU61             Okay and he didn't tell you

                             about it?

           MACKRELL          Well obviously he, he I I would

                             assume he hadn't noticed it

                             either.

37.23      DSU61             You were out on the pitch when

                             Mr LOCK told you of the entry

                             of the three or four hundred

                             supporters.   Did you look at

                             the terraces stand to consider

                             the effect of this inflow into

                             those terraces?

           MACKRELL          I, when Mr LOCK I thought with

                             regard to the numbers of people

                             who came in, I asked him how many

                             it was, and he thought about

                             three to four hundred.   Tinder

                            that basis I thought that

                            wouldn't have presented too

                            much of a problem if it had

                            been contained at that number.

                            Because statistically one always

                            gets a percentage of supporters

                            who don't turn up for matches.

                                You're always into the region of

                                two or t h . .. can be as much as

                                three or four per cent.      People

                               who buy tickets who don't actually

                                straw on the day and so therefore

                               you do have you know...

             DSU61             You can absorb it?

             MACKRELL          You you, I felt that the three

                               hundred we could have absorbed it,

                               you know on on that basis, that

                               three hundred to ten thousand we

                               probably at fair wind would have

                               been reasonable to accept that we

                               could have absorbed that.

38.20       DSU61              Fair enough.    Just one or

                               two quick points now Mr MACKRELL.

                              After the disaster happened, you,

                               I believe, accompanied members of

                              the FA to the boardrocm to decide

                              what was going to happen to the

                              game?

            MACKRELL          Yeah.

38.40       DSU61             I think at some stage in the

                              and addressed the Board,

        MACKRELL              Yeah.

        DSU61                 and ultimately I think Mr JACKSON

            DSU61              did they come together.    Can

            MACKRELL           Em, they were there together,

                               they came together.

38.56       DSU61             Can you tell me and you know about

            MACKRELL              Well only by the way when I first

                                  went up there because I think it's

                                  referred to . ..

40.40       DSU61                This is before you went back with

            MACKRELL             That's right, yeah, it's on page,

            DSU61                Right.

            MACKRELL             I just made the point there because

                                 obviously I I was up there and it

                                 wasn't a time to start asking

                                  situation then we came back to the,

                                  back to the boardroom and there

                                  was representatives of the three

                                  Clubs there, a few directors from

                                  each of the Clubs, some FA Council

                                  officials who were there and Lionel

                                  SMART.

             DSU61                Can you remember who was there?

             MACKRELL             Em.

             DSU61                I think you've already mentioned

                                  earlier in your ...

            MACKRELL              I don't mention by name in my

                                  statement.

            DSU61                Min.

                                 of Nottingham Forest, Maurice

                                 ROWORTH.

            DSU61                Yes.

41.32       MACKRELL             There was the Chairman of Liverpool,

                                 John SMITH.   Then there was Bert

                                 McGEE and there was one or two

                                 other directors from the, from

                                 each club.

            DSU61                Yes.

            MACKRELL             and then there was from the

        v
        .                        Football Association I know that

                                 SMART who were the Chairman,
 MACKRELL               GRAHAM   HENRY


                                  Deputy Chairman of the Charity

                                  Club Committee.       They were there.

                                  Glen KIRTQN and Graham KELLY with

                                  regard to what was happening.

 42.05      DSU61                 So what what can you remember,

                                  what did, can you remember Mr,

                                  Mr DUCKENFIELD addressing the

                                  board?

             MACKRELL             No Mr DUCKENFIELD was addressing

                                  them as I was speaking to Mr LOCK.

                                  I don't, I cannot recount Mr

                                 DUCKENFIELD'S statement, you know

                                 his actual carrments, camnents,

                                 he was talking, I was talking

                                 to Doug LOCK because as I,

                                 as he came in to the rocm to

                                 say that Brian CLOUGH had told

                                 him that his team were going

                                 off.

            DSU61                Yes.

            MACKRELL             but I can, I was not sat in the

                                 same way as I'm listening to

                                 you, heard what Mr DUCKENFIELD

                                 said to ...

42.31       DSU61                Did did Mr JACKSON address the

                                 group as well in the boardroom,

                                 yeah?

            MACKRELL             I believe o n e ... Mr J A C K S ®

                                 only addressed them in the way
 MACKRELL               GRAHAM HENRY


                                of regarding the abandonment

                                of the match and how that was

                               going to be conducted.

             DSU61             You don't, can you recall any

                               conversation about...

                                (Interruption).

             MACKRELL          I...

             DSU61             How the, how the influx

                               ocurred, the...

            MACKRELL           I only had that related to

                               me afterwards by one of m y own

                               directors and I didn't hear it

                               third, first hand from Mr

                               DUCKENFIELD.

            DSU61              Can you tell me which director

                               that was?

                               (Pause).

43.05       MACKRELL           I think, I think it was the

                              Chairman, I, I just it's...

            DSU61             Mr McGEE?

            MACKRELL          Yeah, it's just very confusing

                              obviously you know cause I've

                              been...

        DSU61                 It's a long time ago.

        MACKRELL              It's a long time ago from that

                              because obviously it wasn't

                              something that until the

                              following morning as it ended

                              up transpired that when I
MACKRELL              GRAHAM   HENRY


                                actually played the tape myself

                               of the the shot that I think

                               everybody's seen over the

                               turnstiles A to G, I actually

                               saw what what had happened...

           DSU61               Yeah.

43.36      MACKRELL            and that, because the initial

                               situation of one was told was that

                               fence, the gates had been,

                                (buzzer) the gates had been

                               broken and you know people had

                               forced an entry.

           DSU61               Yeah, okay.     I think we're

                               probably at a suitable point

                               Mr MACKRELL to adjourn again

                               while we change the tape.        We'll

                               switch the... Mr TOPE will switch

                               the tape off and we'll change it

                               over and then we'll carry on

                               with the interview.

44.02                          (Tape switched off).    (1620)

00.09      DSU61               Yeah to resume the interview now

           (1621)              that the tape has been replaced Mr

                               MACKRELL, just a few more points

                               to put to you then we'll be

00.20                          finished.     Is it the case that

                               the Club's systems of monitoring

                               both at the turnstiles and inside

                               the ground failed to identify
MACKRELL                GRAHAM   HENRY


                                 the uneven distribution in pens

                                  3 and 4 by 1445 (1445) 1450 hours

                                  (1450) and to warn the Police and

                                 the stewards accordingly, in

                                 order that they could take the

                                 appropriate action?

00.40      MACKRELL              The Club's systems that on the

                                 turnstiles are only capable of

                                 actually monitoring the global

                                 number of people that come into

                                 the area.   Following on from that

                                 it's a matter of dispersing people

                                 within the, with the terrace area

                                 and as stated previously that is a

                                 function that has been left to the

                                 Police.

           DSU61                 Even so far as the concourse areas

                                 are concerned and feeding, and

                                 feeding it in and monitoring it

                                 from that point of view?

01.17      MACKRELL .            Well no I have, I have, you know I

                                 did, as I stated previously, I did

                                 have people on the concourse by way

                                 of ex ... emergency exit C on the wall

                                 bisecting the West Stand and on the

                                 South and on the South West entrance

                                 to the West Stand and I regarded that

                                 as sufficient number of people.

01.40      DSU61                 It does seem that the Club failed
MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


                              to heed experience of crushing

                              oblique stroke injuries in 1981

                              (000081) and to learn from them by

                              adequately reviewing their

                              performance.   I accept that they

                              took advice from the Police and

                              in fact as a result of that

                             crushing in 1981 (000081) they

                             put up the radial fences and

                             that but I, I I wondered whether

                             they did enough.

           MACKRELL          Well obviously I can't speak for

                             previous people's actions only to

                             say that I feel sure that it would

                             have, it was enough to satisfy

                             the Local Authority Working Party

                             otherwise the Police would not

                             have let the matter rest.

02.28      DSU61             Despite knowledge of the problems

                             in 1981 (000081) the Club failed

                             to ensure proper capacities for

                             all pens and a system to monitor

                             them in accordance with the Green

                             Guide 1976 (000076) and 1986

                             (000086) was in place.

           MACKRELL          Well the situation regarding the

                             Safety Certificate was that there

                             was, the capacities were a global

                             figure for that area and so there
 MACKRELL              GRAHAM   HENRY


                                 was, that was the way that the

                                 Club monitored it by way of a

                                 global figure and as as it was

                                 required by us under the standards

                                 of the Safety Certificate.

 03.02       DSU61               It also appears that the Club did

                                 not provide adequate signing in

                                 Pens 1, 2, 6 and, to 1, 2, 6 pens

                                 1, 2, 6 and 7.   Do you agree with

                                that?

            MACKRELL             I think the signing possibly in

                                hindsight could have been better

                                but I don't regard it as a

                                significant factor.

03.22       DSU61               Neither do you regard the tickets

                                and the confusion that they may or

                                may not have been there?

            MACKRELL            I think the ticketing situation was

                                not ideal but I think it was

                                perfectly adequate in, particularly

                                in light of the fact that the

                                colour codings were put on, they

                                were put on to the satisfaction

                                and to the actual places where the

                                Police required them.

03.48       DSU61               I see okay.   I'd like to just leave

                                the rocm for a couple of minutes,

                                okay?

            MACKRELL            Fine.

 04.10       DCI2514           If I can just explain that we do not

                              have to switch anything off because

                              Mr MACKRELL and yourself are still

                              and you can see that the tapes

                              are still playing.

                              Yes.

04.18        DSU61            Detective Superintendent TAYLOR

                              re-entering the rocm for the audio.

                              We've spent something like the

                              last three hours or so Mr

                              MACKRELL asking you a number of

                              questions.   Is there anything

                              that you feel that we haven't

                              covered but we should have covered

                              perhaps, that you want to talk about,

                              is there anything that you feel

                             you want to address, given the line

                             of questioning that I've put to you?

            MACKRELL          I can't think initially myself.

            DSU61            Would you like to consult with

                             your solicitor?

05.07                         (Consultation between Mr MACKRELL

05.56                        and                   in very quiet

                             speech - unable to transcribe).

            MACKRELL         I think that's a valid point obviously

                             that in relation to the 1985 (000085)




                                                                            9 J7

             DSU61                Can you speak up a bit?

 06.00       MACKRELL             Yeah.   In relation to the 1985

                                  (000085) alterations, it was never

                                  never emphasized or make, or put over

                                  that there was a safety element to

                                  the actual work that was involved

                                  in changing the configuration and

                                  that if the Board had felt that that

                                  was, had been a priority within the

                                  the alterations then obviously maybe

                                  a different tack would have been

                                 would have been taken.

            DSU61                Who would you have expected to

                                 bring that to your attention then?

            MACKRELL              I think if that's, it's an element

                                 I think obviously initially it would

                                 become a Police and Advisory Group,

                                 an Advisory Group matter cause the

                                 matter was drawn up to the, at the

                                 request of the Police.

            DSU61                Not EASTWOODS?

06.43       MACKRELL             Well East..., EASTWOODS drew the

                                 scheme up in response to a request

                                 from the Police.

            DSU61                Yeah, that that was in 1981 (000081)

                                 and 1985 (000085), you're talking

                                 about post, post those periods.     I

                                 The configuration for the Leppings

                                 Lane turnstiles, the consideration

                                 of altering that configuration was

                                 first raised by the Police who

                                 submitted to the Club a proposed

                                 sketch ...

           DSU61                Yes.

07.15                           that they said they would like the

                                Club to consider with a view to

                                effecting better segregation of home

                                and away supporters and it was as a

                                result of that approach to the Police

                                that EASTWOOD looked at the scheme

                                and produced his, his alternative

                                schemes for increasing the number

                                of turnstiles and having separate

                                turnstiles for each area.     That was

                                done following the initial approach

                                to the Police who were concerned

                                about segregation but the only

                                issue that appears from the

                                minutes and the records at the time

                                was that the consideration was

                                segregation.

                            purposes there, I thought you were

                            talking about the radial fencing

                            on the pens 1 ...

                            No.

            DSU61           sorry on the pens 3 and 4.   You're

                            actually talking about the ...

                           The, the .

            DSU61          rejigging of the turnstile area.

08.06                      Yes when the, when the question of

                           rejigging the turnstiles was first

                           raised it was raised by the Police...

            DSU61          Yes.

                           who actually submitted a scheme

                           saying they would like the Club to

                           consider changing the configuration

                           to achieve better segregation

                           because at that time that end of

                           the ground was being used for home

                           and away supporters.

            DSU61          Yes.

08.26                      And it was as a result of that

                           approach from the Police that

                           EASTWOOD looked at it, produced

                           his schemes and the Club were

                           actively considering those

                           schemes in connection with other

                           matters at that end of the

                           ground, sought planning permission.

                           In fact as I recollect got




                                                                         9;o

                             planning permission but then the

                             the Bradford City Fire situation

                             intravened and resources were

                             switched elsewhere to dealing

                             with much greater expenditure

                             in relation to the South Stand.

                             The point that's being made

                             is that the Board in considering

                             whether they could and should

                             proceed with the alterations for

                             the Leppings Lane turnstiles, did

                            not consider it in the light of

                             it being a safety question.

           DSU61            Yeah.

09.11                       It was solely segregation of fans

                            and the Board have said to me

                            that had had it been put to them

                            at that time that it was required

                            for safety reasons then a

                            different complexion would have

                            been put on it and they would have

                            looked at it ... (Interruption)

           DSU61            I entirely accept that it was,

                            you know, it was put as a

                            segregation, to assist segregation.

                            In fact I think the safety, safety

                            benefits from it were probably a

                            spin off...

                            Yes.




                                                                        9

            DSU°-*-          in that, in that they enlarged the

                              courtyard area, I mean that was,

                              that, that would have enlarged

                              fractionally the courtyard area.

09.42                         I think the major element with

                              hindsight would have been that

                             there would have been more

                             turnstiles to allow people through.

           DSU61             Yes.

                             And when you then have a large

                             number of people caning late to

                             get into the ground, you would get

                             them in more easily and, and the

                             flow through would have been

                             multiplied by the number of

                             extra turnstiles that you had.

                             That I think in the context of what

                             actually happened on this fatal

                             day...

           DSU61            yes.

                             would have been the major benefit.

           DSU61            i see.

                            And of course for a semi-final the

                             situation was aggravated by the

                             fact that the normal use of the

                            Penistone Road turnstiles to allow

                            people into the North Stand was

                            discontinued to achieve

                            segregation in that end so



                                                                         9i2

                               Ultimately he will decide what

         I,     GRAHAM         HENRY          MACKRELL,         of

                                                   'vILL S A Y : -


         Mv date       of     birth      is



         I am employed            as    t h e S e c r e t a r y of     Sheffield Wednesday Football
         Club.        My    employment         history        is a s       follows


         After    completing            my O-xevels           at     school       I joined        Thornton Baker
         (as     they        were      then    known),        a f i r m of A c c o u n t a n t s ,           at       their
         Bournemouth          office.          I qualified            as     an A c c o u n t a n t    and b e c a m e        a
         F e l l o w of     the Association             of C e r t i f i e d A c c o u n t a n t s      in    1976.


        In      the    interim         I left T h o r n t o n B a k e r         in a b o u t A u g u s t      1974       to
         join     the        staff        of     Bournemouth           Football             Club,       and       I     was
(       appointed          Club   Secretary          shortly a fter that.

i
        At      that       time Bournemouth were                   a Third Division              Club but              they
        were      in       ract   r e l e g a t e d to the F o u r t h          Division        the year              after
        I      joined        uhem.         The     facilities          at     the Club          were        therefore
        fairly         basic,       but when        the Safety             of S p o r t s    Grounds Act               1975
        ( "the        Act"'       became         law    I was       a w a r e of     it a n d    of      the       Green
    ^   Guide     that        was       subsequently            issued.           The Club            was     not       of
        course         a designated Club within                      the terms          of    the Act          because
        of      its    status,       but certainly work                 done       at the Club t h e r e a f t e r
        had      regard       to the provisions                of    the Act         and the Green                Guide.
        One      of    the    Directors          of B o u r n e m o u t h     F.C.    at th a t       time was           an
        Architect,            and    he took a lead part                    in o r g a n i s i n g     alterations
        and      improvements            to the Ground,              but      I worked closely with                    him
        throughout           that    time.




                                                                                                                   •. / . .
 In     November          1981        following            an       approach               from       Luton        Town
Football        Club      I resigned my              position            at B o u r n e m o u t h      and became
Secretary         to      L u t o n T o w n F.C.           I remained with                   that      Club       until
I     resigned in November                    1986,      and virtually                 immediately               there-
after      joined         Sheffield Wednesday                     Football         Club       in nv          present
position.



When     I joined         Luton Town           Football           Club they were                  in the      Second
Division        and        won     the       Second Division                championship char                      year
becoming        p r o m o t e d to the          First        Division.            At       that       time       First
and     Second Division                 Clubs       were     designated under                    the Act,             and
as     Secretary           to      the Club          I had         responsibility                     for     safety
matters.             As        such      I     was      the        Club's         representative                       at
meetings        of        the Committee              set     up by the Local                 Authority                for
the     purpose           of     licensing             the        Ground         under           the        Act.         I
reported        on        safety         matters           to      the       Board,          and        the        Club
retained        a n r m         of C o n s u l t i n g A r c h i t e c t s      who        dealt        with          all
matters        relating            to        safety     requirements.                  I     dealt           with       a
particular           Partner          in t h a t A r c h i t e c t u r a l       Practice,             one
         who     would           inspect        the Ground            and the          facilities                on     a
regularbasis              to     ensure         that         we     did            comolv             with            the
requirements          of       the Act       and     the G r e e n Guide.


When     I joined           Sheffield Wednesday                    Football Club                 as     Secretary
the     Club          h a d alre a d y an        estabished              system for              dealing           with
safety     matters,             licensing by            the Local A u t h o r i t y and r ea u i r e -
ments     of     the           Act and the           Green Guide             generally.                 The        Club
retained         Consulting               Engineers,               Eastwood            &     Partners,             who
performed             the       same         role      for        Sheffield Wednesday                       as        the
Architects       retained by Luton Town                           F.C.     had performed                for them.
Similarly        in        my     position           as S e c r e t a r y      I am         in        effect          the
Chief     Executive              of t h e C l u b ,       and      I have overall                     control          of
safety matters             reporting          to the Board               o n t h a t as w e l l          as      other
topics    c o n n e c t e d with the           running            of t h e Club.


Since      my     appointment                 the       composition               of        the       Board            of
Directors        has       not changed.               T h e C h a i r m a n is Mr.               H e r b e r t McGee

                                                                                                                 . . i. .
and      there        are       6 other       Board members.                They      are      in     effect             a
non-executive               Board who           take nonetheless               a close           interest           in
the      affairs           of     the       Club and         who        regularly              attend         Board
meetings.             There        are      regular Board m e e t i n g s , perhaps                      9     each
ye ar.         The C l u b       is,    to my knowledge,                a little         unusual         in that
the      members           of    the    Board between them hold                      only       4.8%     of        the
issued         share        capital         and there        is i n f a c t        no        single          entity
who      has        anything           approaching           control         of      the        Club.          Each
member         of     the        Board,      in his      non-executive                  capacity,             takes
special         responsibility                  for a p a r t i c u l a r      activity.             Thus          for
example         Matthew          Sheppard,        the Vice-Chairman,                    is    an A c c o unta nt
and      responsible              for        financial        matters.             Keith          Addy        is     a
builder/developer                  with         responsibility               for        the       Ground           and
premises.

Douglas         Lock       has    special       responsibility               for    security matters.
I   have        seen       and    read     a c o p y of     the     Statement           he has          already
prepared,           and    it    accurately describes                   his p o s i t i o n      and role           as
Chief      of        Security.             He   has p r i m a r y r e s p o n s i b i l i t y         for      the

I   am     aware           of     the    fact that          Stewards            are      given          written

I     have        always       considered             Douglas         L o c k to b e         a very able               and
reliable          Security          Officer,          perhaps         uniquely          experienced              in the
sense        that    he w a s           previously          a Superintendent                  w i t h zhe           South
Yorkshire Police                   Force      in w h i c h       c a p a c i t y he     had       a good deal           of
responsibility                 for         supervising              the      policing              of      Sheffield
Wednesday           Football              Ground         at H i l l s b o r o u g h .        He    is a m a n          .who
has w r i t t e n    and       had published                articles         on p o l i c i n g         of f o o t b a l l
matches        and        because             of    his b a c k g r o u n d he          has       also       been       of
assistance          to m e         in    liaison with              the     South Y o r k s h i r e Police.


                     is        the        Club        Caretaker             in    charge            of         general
maintenance.                  He    has b e e n w i t h the Club some                        4 0 years         and      is
in     fact       approaching retirement.                             Essentially             he    carries            out
running        repairs             of    a maintenance              nature,       and will              often carry
out     small        works              requested           b y Mr.         Eastwood.               He       has       the
assistance          of    2 men who work                  in his         team,                             and
         and t h e r e         are       also      about        10 c l e a n e r s w h o      are employed              on
a regular part-time                      basis.


The     Groundsman             is                                  and he has           a n u m b e r of           staff
working with             him       in k e e p i n g the pitch in go o d                    condition.
In     my      capacity           as S e c r e t a r y        to the Club              I        have        executive
responsibility              effectively                for the       overall         organisation              of      the
Club's         activities.                  As     such       I am the          person            with        overall
responsibility                  for     safety matters,                 and     liaise           directly            with
the     Working            Party        set        up      under the            aegis            of     the        Local
Authority.                This        Working          Party consists                of         representatives
from         the      Police           ana        Fire        Brigade,          and         also        from           the
Surveyors/Structural                             Engineers'              Department                     and            the
Environmental               Health           Department              of t h e        City         of        Sheffield
(formerly              the South            Yorkshire Metropolitan                          County Council).
These         meetings           are     held      on     an annual b a s i s               for the          purposes
of     licensing the              Club       under        the    S a f e t y of      Sports           Grounds         Act
1975,        and the        Safety          Committee           make    a thorough               inspection             of
the     Ground            each year          for       that purpose.              In the              past,        those
inspections                would        normally              take      place          in        about        August.
However         in        1988 w e      brought           the    inspection            f o r w a r d to M a y           of
that        year,     and       the    same       is    happening this year,                      the       intention
being         to     givethe            Club      plenty        of t i m e      to         carry             out       any
necessary            work        that        might         be    required         as        a     condition             of
iss u i n g the L i c e n s e .


Prior         to          the annual         meeting          of t h e S a f e t y C o m m i t t e e          it       is
usually         the        practice              for Eastwood           & Partners               to     carry         out
their       own t h o r o u g h       inspection           of    the G r o u n d       to m a k e       sure       tha t,
so     far      as w e      can,       it    is    in     first      class      condition before                      the
Safety Committee                 inspect.              In f a c t    as p a r t      of     that process              the
Consulting            Engineer will                issue        a Certificate               confirming their
inspection,               and     they       are       also required to carry                         out     certain
tests    - for e x a m p l e          tests        on crush barriers.


If     Eastwood            & Partners,             upon carrying             out       their           inspection,
came     across            any matters             upon which they needed                         a decision              I
would        be the        person wit h whom they would                           liaise          at t h e         C l u b.
Similarly             if        there        was        any     member          of        the         Club     sta ff,
including            Mr.        Lock,       who    thought          that there was                    some     matter
relating             to     the       structural                integrity            of         the     Ground          or

                                                                                                                   .. /..
otherwise            relating to the Green                      Guide     or    the        Act;,     t h ey     would
draw        it t o m y      attention and               I would then            deal        with Eastwood                   &
Partners.           Thus,        for example,             Douglas        Lock wouid              not        normally
have        direct contact with                   the     Consulting           Engineers             -      anything
he    had to do or           say would            be done        t h r o u g h me.


I am also primarily                    responsible            for     liaison with               the Police            in
relation           to' t h e p o l i c i n g      of m a t c h e s     at t h e      Ground.             The      Club
signs        an     annual            Contract with             the      South           Yorkshire             Police
Authority           for     the       provision         of P o l i c e    Officers             o n m a t c h d a y s.
There         is      an     annual            meeting          called,        by        the       Police         with
representatives                  of      all     5 Yorkshire           Clubs        who     come       under         the
jurisdiction                of        the      South       Yorkshire            Police.                They          are
Sheffield             Wednesday,               Sheffield            United,          Doncaster               Rovers,
Rotherham           and Barnsley               F.C.      At     that m e e t i n g        t h e r e is u s u a l l y
a     general         discussion             relating         to policing            and       football,             and
it     is     invariably my practice                       to    attend w i t h           a m e m b e r of           the
Board        of    Directors.            In a d d i t i o n t o t h a t       annual           meeting          there
is     regular         liaison              w ith the      Police        throughout                the       Season.
Thus,        for example,              when     the Fixture            List     is       p u b l i s h e d in June
of     each        year     I send          a copy to the             Police        for        their         comment
prior        to     commencement                of      the     Season    and        they         may        have       a
particular            request           in      r elation to m a t c h e s                on      th e       Fixture
List.         I     recall,            for      example,         that    last        Season            we      had      a
fixture           against        Newcastle           United      on B o x i n g      Day       a n d the P o l i c e
asked       us     to b r i n g       the    kick-off         forward to            12    n o o n and w e            did
so.         I do not        recall          them giving a particular                       reason for that
      the p o s i t i o n    is       that     if t h e P o l i c e ,    with        their        k n o w l e d g e of
policing          matters,            ask me      to c o - o p e r a t e w i t h         them     in        relation
to     particular matches                    I will      always       attempt            to do       so in e v e r y
way      possible          and    I would         not,     for    example,           require           a detailed
explanation            from           them      as in t h a t i n s t a n c e , as              to       why     they
wished      a particular               change        t o b e m a de .


For     matches        played          at H i l l s b o r o u g h the P o l i c e          Liaison Officer
(Inspector           Sewell)            would        normally contact               me     a week or             more
before        the m a t c h was             to take place.              For    a normal match where

                                                                                                                . . / . .
 an     unusual           crowd was          not expected              the contact would be                           made
 probably           to      find       out       such details            as     which          turnstiles                  we
 intended           to      open,      what       time     they were          to be       opened             e t c.        so
that         he     could        be      sure          that      our      plans          for      manning              the
 turnstiles               and       stewarding             the       Ground        complied              with          his
xnowieage            of     arrival         times       for v i s i t i n g     fans      etc.          If i t w e r e
a particularly                 large match where                 we would         expect,            for e x a m p l e ,
a      large n u mber           of A w a y       supporters          as w e l l    as     Home          supporters
then      the degree             of    liaison will              naturally         increase             as    a       good
deal      of mor e          detailed         planning          has     to go      into     the policing                    of
it      from the p o i n t            of v i e w cf p r o v i d i n g         extra       Police             Officers
and,      rrom           the    Club's       point       of v i e w ,     deployment            of       Stewards.
Inspector             Sewell           is        assisted         in      his      liaison             duties              by
Detective            Constable Charlesworth                       stationed         at     Hammerton                  Road
Police            Station,       and     I would have             a degree         of     contact with                 him
as     well.          For      example           it w o u i d b e m y       normal       practice,                 prior

pass    that        mrormation              on    to the       P o l i c e to a ssist           them in t h e i r
planning.


The     average             gate       this       year    at    Hillsborough             has         been          about
20,000        rans.            For      the           normal     or       average          attendance                 the
Contract           with        the     Police will             lay down the             n u m b e r of         Police
Officers           who         are deployed.                   That       number          can         however          be
increased           at         the discretion                 of t h e    PoliceAuthority                     if       a
particularly             heavy gate              is    expected,         for example,            or i n d e e d        if
the     Away       f an s   are      e x p e c t e d to be unruly.                Where        the number              is
being    increased             it    is n o t         the practice         of t h e      Police Authority
to     discuss        and      agree with me beforehand                        how many          extra Police
they     will       involve.            I have never             r e q uired t h e m to agree extra
numbers           withme       or     queried          a Police        invoice          for mann i n g             — the
invoice           is i n       fact r e l a t e d tothe          s i z e of t h e       g a t e as       set          out
in     the    Contract with              them,          save    for     some matches             s u c h as           the
F.A.     Cup        semi-final,             w h i c h w ould be          charged         on      a      different
basis.            The Accounts           for the Club              indicate        that        for the             year
ended     May       1 98 8 t h e C l u b      paid a total             of    £97,731          to the           South
Yorkshire       Police          for p o l i c i n g the Ground.                   Of    that       sum a total
of     £39,800       r e l a t e d to t h e p o l i c i n g c o s t s            of    the     1988 F.A.            Cup
semi-final          between Liverpool                F.C.        a n d N o t t i n g h a m F o r e s t F.C.


I am aware          of t h e     fact     that      the     South Yorkshire                  Polic e d r a w up
an     operational              plan    for       each     Home game         at        Hillsborough                 and
they do not normally provide                         a copy         of t h a t        plan    to a Club.                 I
have    however        in the past            asked        f o r o n e if        only    out       of i n t e r e s t
to      see     how        they        organise            the      deployment               of        Police        in
controlling c r o w d s , and whe n                  I have asked                I have       been provided
with    a copy.


In     my dealings          with the          Police        o v er the y e a r s , in r e l a t i o n to
Hillsborough              policing,           I     would        say that         they       have        made        it
plain     that         they      regarded          the     function         of    Stewards              from        the
Club     as     directing people                   to their         se at s ,     and        manning           gates
around        the Ground.              They       very much regarded                   the    Police           being
in     charge       of c r o w d      control       generally,           both         inside       and o u t s i d e
the     Ground,           and    indeed       the written            instructions                 to     Stewards
which     we        issue       every y e a r       take      these      factors             into        account.
They     were        drafted by           Douglas         L o c k and a p p r c v e a         b y me,         and     I
have     no     doubt           he     drafted       them having                 regard           to     his        own
experience           as     a        Superintendent               with       the        South           Yorkshire
Police.


I     would    say that          in m y      experience           in the c o n t e x t            of     policing
within        the     Ground,          the    Police        are mo s t c o n c e r n e d               about        the
question        of     segregating            Home       and A w a y     fans.          It    is m y          belief
that they       regard          that    as    the primary means                   by which they                avoid
crowd    trouble.


There     are        contingency             plans       agreed with             the    Police,          to        deal
with     an    emergency             situation       at t he Ground.                  Arrangements                 with
the     Police        basically              cover       e v a c u a t i o n of t h e        Ground           in     an
emergency           and     all        Stewards          are trained             in     that           procedure.
Their     task        is        simply        to man        and    open the             gates           to     allow


                                                                                                               . . /..
people        o u t of t h e G r o u n d                in an o r d e r l y      fashion.             Before           each
game     the         Police meet w i t h                   the Referee           and discuss                with        him
the     emergency procedures                            w h i c h w o u l d be     involved           in     stopping
the     game         and evacuating the                       Ground.            To m y        knowledge              these
emergency            procedures                have        been     tested during               m a t c h days,          to
ensure        that        they work                properly,          and the       test        procedure              will
involve           the     broadcast                c£    a message          over    the        tannoy,           by     the
Police        Operator,            which            will      act     as    a signal           to    the     Stewards
and     the        Police Officers                      to take       their positions                 for        dealing
with     an e m e r g e n c y s itu a t i o n .                 In t h a t c o n t e x t        I would          explain
that     the         tannoy      system             is     one where          the P o l i c e        Control           Room
has     the        ability         to          operate          it as w e l l        as         the        Club        Disc
Jockey/Announcer,                  but         the       Police       have     an o v e r r i d e      facility          so
that     they can cut              across               any   announcements              being made              by     the
Club     Disc           Jockey        in           order      to      broadcast            a        message.            The
procedure            for e m e r g e n c i e s           involves          the P o l i c e      control          of     the
tannoy            system        and        I        cannot          envisage         a         situation              where
emergency           messages would                      be broad cast by C l u b                staff.           If,    fo r
example,           I became aware                   of    an e m e r g e n c y w h i c h        necessitated              a
tannoy        announcement,                    I        would      report that           to     the        Police        so
that     they           could make             the       announcement,             rather           than     make        it
myself.


As    to contingency plans                         for coping with               spectators            coming          into
the    Ground,          this    is d o n e          on    specific          occasions           w h e n the       Police
would        be     aware that v i s i t i n g                  supporters         who        may     have an           all
ticket        arrangement,             might             have      a contingent            arriving              without
tickets           or,     for     example,                where       they might               expect        a        large
number        cf        spectators             to       arrive who would be                    seeking           to     pay
cash     at        the t u r n s t i l e s .             They would then                 have         arrangements
with     us       for turnstiles                   to be      opened        to a d m i t       such        spectators
or,     in        the     case        of   an           all   ticket match,                they       would            have
arrangements             made         to r e m o v e          spectators without                    tickets            from
the     vicinity          of t h e G r o u n d .              T h a t,     for example,             happened very
recently with             the Middlesbrough                        game where        the        space available
for     Middlesbrough                 supporters                was      severely restricted                     due     to
the     closure           of t h e w e s t              stand      area     following          the         events        on
 15th       April.             The Police             anticipated there might                       be a lot             of
Middlesbrough                  supporters             and had contingency                    plans       in        pla c e ,
to      my knowledge,               to h o l d        spectators           a r r i v i n g v.ithout            tickets
at      a     nearby          Police      sports          ground.          Other      than     that        I am         not
aware       of     any    other contingency                   plans to deal               with      the Question
of     a mass       of   spectators              arriving           for e n t r a n c e      sucn    as       happened
at t h e      semi-final            on    15 t h April.


I      have        stated that            Stewards            are      instructed         to man           all         exit
gates         from the         Ground,           but      the exception to                that      is    the gates
in      the       perimeter          fencing which                allow access             onto      the        pitch.
During           the period          that        I have been with                 Sheffield Wednesday                        I
cannot           remember any             i n s t a n c e where those gates                   w e r e m a n n e d bv
Stewards           - it       is P o l i c e        who    are    normally           stationed           along         the
perimeter          and    I believe              that      the    numbers         of p e o p l e     s t a n d i n g on
the        perimeter           would           be      kept      as    l o w as       possible            to        avoid
obstructing the                v i e w of        spectators            behind the         fence.           I cannot
remember               however           any        instance           where         there       was           exDress
discussion              and     agreement              with      the Police           that    they would                be
responsible              for m a n n i n g          those     perimeter           gates      instead           of C l u b
Stewards           -     it    is    just        something            t h a t h as    always       haDpened             in
practice           during           my time          with     t h e Club.            Overall       I would             say
that        there        is     very close                liaison between the                 Club         and         the
Police        and        this        is        p a r t i c u l a r l y so h a v i n g        regard            to      the
relationship             between          Doug       Lock     a nd the S o u t h Y o r k s h i r e             Police.


On     a     match        day        the P o l i c e will               have         their     own         briefing
sessions           with        the        Ground,         both        a general        briefing            for         all

will       brief    the       Stewards          who     are working             in t h a t    area and like­
wise        the     Officer          in c h a r g e       of t h e      Spion Kop will                  brief         the

briefed           by Douglas          Lock        on match          day,     and      since    he       has d i r e c t
supervision              of     those           Stewards         I leave that                aspect           to      him

although       I am generally                  aware         of w h a t g o e s       on     and       have    in fact
from      time         to time a t t e n d e d briefing sessions.


F.A.     Cup           semi-finals           have been            h e l d at H i l l s b o r o u g h          in       1987
(Leeds        v.       Coventry City);                 in    1 98 8    and     1 989.        These       latter two
games         have        both       involved                Liverpool            F.C.           and     Nottingham
Forest       F.C.         In      1 987      the match was moved                      to     a    Sunday       at       the
request        of t h e P o l i c e          because           they anticipated                   t h e r e m i g h t be
aiificuities              with       Leeds             United          supporters.                 Chief           Super­
intendent              Brian Mole was               in c h a r g e      of t h e      policing           as        indeed
he     was     tor        the     19 88      game.           For the         1987     game        I do        in       f a ct
have     a     copy        of     the P o l i c e           operations mannual                   which         is       the
written        instructions               issued by             the     South Y o r k s h i r e          Police         for
policing           the     game.             I cannot           now remember                 exactly           when        I
obtained           a     copy      of     that         - it m a y w e l l         have       been        after          the
fixture        took        place        and       to     the    best     of m y      recollection                  I    was
given        a ccpv when           I requested                 it b e c a u s e     I was        interested              to
see     how they were              organising                the match          from their             end.            That
match         took        place         on     Sunday,          12th April,             1987           and         a    few
weeks        berore        there          was       a briefing meeting                     arranged            at       the
request        of        the      Police.              The     earlier briefing                   was         on       20th
March        and       involved Brian                  Mole     together with                                           and
                               of L e e d s       United,         and                               of       Coventry
City.        I attended,           with        my      assistant,


For     the        1938        semi-final,               which        took place        on       9th     April           of
that     year,           the     early            briefing meeting took                          place         in      the
Boardroom           at    Hillsborough                 on 23rd March w i t h Mr.                    Mole present
and     with        Peter        Robinson                of L i v e r p o o l       and                                  of
Nottingham             Forest..              It     involved discussion with                           the         Police
and     the        participating               C l u b s as     to which            a r e a s ofthe           Ground
their        supporters            would            be    attending,            how tickets              would           be
colour-coded              and marked              for     each     s e t of       supporters,            where         car
parking            arrangements                   and parking                of c o a c h e s            would           be
organised          and matters            of      t h a t nature.
For     the    1989       semi-final          there was          no such p r i o r        meeting            with
the     Police        - I understood             they     felt one was             not. n e c e s s a r y        as
the     game        involved effectively                  an action           repiav      of        the      year
before,        when        the      same      teams     were involved               and        once         again
Nottingham            Forest        fans      were     to be a c c o m m o d a t e d      in     the        Spion
Kop and the           south      stand     areas,       and the L i v e r p o o l         fans       w o u l d be
accommodated           in t h e n o r t h      and west          stand a r e a s .


My own r e c o l l ect ion          of t h e     semi-final which                took     place        in    1988
is     that    everything went                extremely          smoothly,         and    indeed          I have
referred           to t h e     file    I kept       for that        fixture        and       the      records
indicate           that we       had c o m p a r a t i v e l y    little b y w a y            of d a m a g e to
the     Ground         afterwards.               There       were      in      fact       a     couple           of
letters        frcm        supporters            afterwards,           including              one      from       a
Liverpool          supporter who           expressed         his a p p r e c i a t i o n       for the way
xn     which        the    game had        been      organised and             stewardea.             My        own
recollection              is     that    there       were    no p r o b l e m s     in        getting           the
fans     into        the       Ground    on    time     for kick-off             that     year,       but        my
memory        is     that        the     Liverpool          fans      in       particular             arrived
earlier that year                than t h e y     did     for the       1 98 9     semi-final.


The     draw        f o r t h e F.A.       Cup    semi-final          took place               on     Monday,
20th     March.           I was     telephoned          by Steve Clark,               the      Competition
Secretary          of t h e     Football       Association,           that m o r n i n g before                 the
meeting        of      the      F.A.    took     place.          He a s k e d m e     to contact                the
Police        to     confirm           that      if H i l l s b o r o u g h      were       awarded             the
semi-final           between Liverpool                and Nottingham Forest,                        that    they
would        once again          insist       upon    the Nottingham Forest                     fans       being
accommodated              in     the    Spion     Kop     and south           stand      areas.            As     a
result        I spoke          on the    telephone          to Chief          Superintendent               Brian
Mole     who confirmed that                   that    w o u l d be the        case.         I was          aware
of     the     Police          reason    for     s o i n s i s t i n g - it        enabled           them        to
have     more        effective          control       o v e r the     f l o w of      fans          into        the
Ground,        since       the N o t t i n g h a m Forest          fans,      in    journeying              from
Nottingham,           would        normally          a r r i v e at t h e     Penistone             Road        end



                                                                                                           • • I. .
of     the        Ground via Junction                    34       of    t h e Ml,     and Liverpool                   fans
would        exit       the Motorway           so       as    to       arrive     at t h e      Leppings              Lane
end via       the A61          from Junc t i o n             36    of    the Motorway.


I    teiepnonea               Steve        Clark        and       confirmed           what        Chief          Super­
intendent:              Brian        Mole      haa           toid        me.         The     semi-final                 at
H i l i s b o r o u g n v/as l a t e r c o n f i r m e d           by telephone             ana      this       enabled
us     to     out       arrangements           in       hand       for the p r i n t i n g            of        tickets
etc.


I    recall        that       a couple        of    days          before       the    semi-final               the    F.A.
telephoned              to     enquire whe th er                  the Club would             be      providing           a
Doctor        positioned               near    the       playing          area.            Arrangements                had
already           been made          by    Sharon        Lane          for the Cl u b        Doctor,             Doctor
Bill        Purcell,           to attend           a nd he         had been a l located                    a     ticket
which        would       seat     him in       the       south          stand in t h e          pen b e h i n d the
dug-out.           I believe the              F.A.       were          concerned about               the presence
of     a Club          Doctor because              of    a recent          event w h i c h           had received
some    publicity,             where       a Bristol              Rovers       player       had      been       injured
on the       field       and     had      swallowed           his       tongue and          needed         emergency
treatment.


I    now      turn to          events        that       occurred          on the d a y          of    the        match,
15th       April,            1989.         I arrived              at the G r o u n d         between             7     and
7.30    a.:n.          Immediately           after       arriving          I walked          right         r o u n d the
Ground,           as    is m y    normal       p r a ct ic e before a game,                       to check             for
myself        the        general          state     of       things.           I would       be       looking           to
see,    for       example,        that       the    Ground was             generally            tidy.


I    had      a        number        of t a s k s       to p e r f or m that            morning                such     as
finalising             T.V.       arrangements,                   including means               of    access           for
television               crews,           dealing             with        the        issue           of         passes,
co-ordinating                arrangements           for a luncheon to be                        held      involving
Management             of      the     2 competing                Clubs,       and F.A.         Officials              and
local dignitaries.                     The    guests          started          to a r r i v e     shortly            after
II a.m.
I     recall,           d u r i n g the c o u r s e         of    t ha t morning,            that       I met        with
Douglas'           Lock in the r e c e p t i o n                 area    in the        south       stand o f fices
and        talked to him about t h e                        arrangements           f o r t h e day.             It        is
normal            for D o u g L ock to            seek me          out    on a m a t c n          d ay to e n q u i r e
whether            I     had        any     special          instructions               for        him      and          the
Stewards.                On     this        occasion             I n eeded to t a l k to                 him        about
arrangements                  for opening             the    turnstiles.               That       arose        because
originally               we    had agreed w i t h                the    Police     that       the        turnstiles
would        o p en at        12 noon,          and    a potential           prob le m had then                 arisen
as     a        result         of    some i n f o r m a t i o n         that was            inserted           in        the
Liverpool               Programme,              for Liverpool             fans,        the    previous              week.
That         arose           because       Sheffield Wednesday played                              Liverpool              at
Anfieid            on S a t u r d a y ,     8th April,             a n d the      Sheffield Police                       had
arranged               for     an     article           to be          inserted         in        the      Liverpool
Programme              giving         instructions                to Liverpool              fans    as t o          their
journey                from     Liverpool              to        Sheffield         for        the        F.A.            Cup
semi-final,                  arrangements              for        car    parking        etc.,       and        it        was
stated           in      that        document           that       "Gates will               be     opened           from
II a . m . ,           with          pre-match              entertainment               and         refreshments
available                inside           the     Ground."               Subsequently               t he        Police
realised              that     this       information             clashed with              the     arrangements
that       t h e y had m a d e w i t h me,              for the          turnstiles           t o be o p e n e d          at
12     and        I was       asked by          Inspector          Sewell,        as    I recall,              whether
we     c o u l d assist by h a v i n g                Turnstile           Operators           there to o p e n             a
few        of      the        turnstiles              early       if t h e r e    was         a     build-up              of
spectators outside.                        I had       confirmed          there w o u l d          be no p r o b l e m
with       t h a t,    since        Stewards          and Turnstile              Operators          had s t a n d i n g
instructions                  t o b e at t h e        Ground           no later than              11 a.m.       on       the
s e m i - f i n a l d ay.


During           the         hours    leading          up    to the       start        of    the    game        I        was
busy        dealing with a variety                          of    organisational              matters.              As    is
my    normal          practice        I would,          f r o m t i m e t o t i me,           w a l k o u t of           the
office          and c h e c k the p o s i t i o n            in    the Ground           itself.            Thus,         for
example,              on m o r e     than       one   occasion           I walked down              the players'
tunnel           to      see        how the       spectators were building                          up,      and          my
principal              recollection              is   that        Nottingham Forest were                       filling

                                                                                                                    . .J . .
up     their         end        of        the G r o u n d      at     a      quite        early          stage,               but
Liverpool            supporters were                    not.        As     I recall        that       in f a c t              was
remarked            on by       several m embers                of        staff d u r i n g      the c o u r s e                of
that     day.          F r om time           to    time       I would         also w a l k       outside            to        see
how     matters            were outside                 the    Ground.            I remember walking                           up
the     private            road           that         runs    alongside the                  river        from               the
Directors'           entrance to the                    Leppings           Lane      entrance.            The       Police
had     created            a        sterile        area       aionq        part      of   that       roadway,                  by
erectinq barriers                    just b e y o n d         Gate        C at L e p p i n q s      Lane       end,           and
a     further        series          of b a r r i e r s       near the          "dog-leg"           corner              close
to Gate       E.       I did         in fact           have    to     speak to the             Police          t h e r e to
arrange       for      some cars            to     be    allowed           to park w i t h i n           the       sterile
area,        since         visiting dignatories                           from Nottingham Forest                              had
been     allocated              parking           spaces       there.           As    I recall           there          was      a
group        of    foot        officers           of    the    South         Yorkshire         Police              manning
each     of        those            2 barriers           - perhaps            of t h e     o r d e r of        8        -      10
Officers          at e a c h b a r r i e r .


The     last       occasion when                  I visited          the Leppings              Lane       end       before
problems          built        up    later was           probably            shortly       after         2 p.m.,             but
I     cannot         put       anything           like    an    exact         time on         it.        However               my
recollection               of        the    situation           at Lep p i n g s          Lane      at t h a t              time
was     that         the n umber            of L i v e r p o o l         supporters           was    starting                  to
build up          - there was              a substantial                 g r o u p of t h e m p r e s e n t             but      I
would        net     say that the                 area was          packed        s oli d .      I can         say          that
nothing           about        the    scene        at    that       time      struck me          as u n u s u a l              or
potentially dangerous.


Subsequently               I        was     in a n d      out       of t h e o f f i c e       (I        had        placed
myself        in                                  s office          that afternoon)                 at     intervals
and     on        more     than one           occasion          I would have w a l k e d                   down              the
players'           tunnel           to see w h a t was              h a p p e n i n g on the         pitch          and        on
the     stands           and         terraces,           f r o m inside the               Ground.                  It        was
still        the      case           that     it w a s        noticeable that                 Liverpool                     f an s
were     slower building                    up     in    the    north         stand and          the w e s t            stand
areas    than       the Nottingham                     Forest       fans.




                                                                                                                        . .J ..
 I     had a g r e e d w i t h the m e d i a               and with           the t e l e v i s i o n crews                in
particular                as       to how they         should         position          themselves          p r i o r to
commencement                   or      the m a t c h b e c a u s e         they were          anxious       to        film
the      teams            coming           out on to the             pitch.        In     particular                 Brian
Clough,             the        Nottingham Forest                 Manager,          was    very much             in      the
news       at        that           time       because          he    had       been      banned          from         the
touch-line                and       I knew that          they were            anxious      to     film him             and
were       aware              that       he      had been        allocated a seat                    in    the         pen
immediately                   behind          the d u g - o u t .       As    I r e c a l l , I was            cut         on
the      pitch            w h e n the Li verpool                team came          out,    and        just           after
they       came         onto        the pitch        Do u g L o c k c a m e up           to m e    and t o l d             me
that       Gate           C        had either been              opened        or broken           down         at      the
Leppings            Lane           e n d a n d as    I recall           he    told me      that      about           300    -
400      people               had    entered through                 the     ga te.      I said      I would               go
and      se e w h a t          the p r o b l e m was         and      I immediately             pushed mv              wav
through            the         photographers               in        the     area and         walked           ud      the
players'            tunnel.               At that       stage         the     Nottingham           Forest            team
were      also            on the pitch,              but     the      photographers               were         waitina
for the           arrival           of B r i a n    Clough,          I believe.


I walked           out        of    the Ground         and      around through             the     sterile           area
to     Gate         C at L e p p i n g s           Lane.        I imagine the m a t c h                must          have
kicked            ofr    at        about that        time       but     I cannot        be cer tain.                 Once
the      teams were                 out on the         pitch       the       noise     from the        huge         crowd
inside        the       stadium was             such    that       it w o u l d b e       difficult            to    tell
from      outside whether the                        kick       off     had taken place              and       in     anv
event         I     was        concentrating            on the          p r o b l e m in h a n d .        In        going
through            the        sterile       area     I did,        of c o u r s e ,     pass     the      groups        of
foot      officers                 who were         on duty        at      e a c h s e t of    barriers,              and
when      I        arrived            at G a t e     C the       gate was             p artially          open.            A
mounted           Police             Officer was           positioned           outside        the        gate        and
there         was        a l i n e of .fans w a l k i n g               i n a n d as      I recall             he     was
shouting            to t h e         fans     indicating           to    t h e m that     they       should           not
come    through           in that q u e u e            unless         they had a ticket.                   The       fans
who     were walking through were                            h o l d i n g up the         tickets          for        him
to    see t h a t        t h e y h a d one.            There       seemed       to be     a number             of    f an s
around          who did           not have             tickets        and could not             get     access           as a
result.


As     I       walked        through the                gate       I recollect         that         there       were            a
couple          of P o l i c e         Officers             stationed         just    inside         it a n d       o n e of
our        Stewarcs,          Richard Beadslev,                       to w h o m     I spoke.           Looking            at
h i m he       seemea        a bit          shaken,          and     I a s k e d h i m w h e t h e r he w a s             all
right          and      he    answered             in the          affirmative.             I was          intent          on
making          my      way       to the Police                Control         Box to       find      out       exactly
what       was        going            on a n d        to do that           I had to w a l k            around            the
southern             corner            of      the          west     stand and go            through            a        gate
adjacent             to t u r n s t i l e s        19       - 22    to get to the            Box.          That          gate
was      manned            by Club Stewards who                          also man      the      exit Gate            E     at
t hat point,            and       thev       let       me    throuah.


I     climbed           up    into the             Police          Control      Box ana         I     recall             that
Chief           Superintendent                         David        Duckenfield             was       there              with
Superintendent                    Bernard Murray                   and    I believe         2 other Officers.
When       I     looked           out       of t h e w i n d o w         of t h e P o l i c e       Control         Box     I
noticed          fo r        the       first       time       that       they were         a large         number          of
Liverpool             supporters                  on    the pitch           around the Liverpool                         goal
a rea,         that        other        supporters             a p p e a r e d to be        s e e k i n g to         climb
over     the     perimeter              fence          to gain        access       to the       pitch,       and         some
were       also         climbing             or b e i n g p u l l e d up           from the          back      of         the
terrace         up t o t h e           seated          area    in t h e w e s t       stand.          I cannot            say
whether          the         gates          in t h e        perimeter        fence w e r e          open     at       that
stage          - zhere was              such       a mass          of p e o p l e a r o u n d     tha t it          would
not      have         been         obvious.                  I recall        that      I     asked          what          was
happening             and was           told       that       people were being crushed                        in         the
pens       because           of    pressure             from behind.              No r e f e r e n c e was            made
at     any       stage            to        the    gate       h a v i n g been opened,                and      it         was
clearly          an u r g e n t         situation where                   I did not w i s h           to i n t e r f e r e
with       the        Police           operations.                 They were          giving          instructions
over       their personal                    radios          to Officers          as t o h o w t h e y            should
deal with            the     situation             on       the Ground,         and    I recall            that Chief
Superintendent                    Duckenfield was                   t a l k i n g to the        Police        Officer
who      had      control               of t h e        Tannoy        system telling                him     to        keep

                                                                                                                     • • / ..
talking            to t h e       crowd.            As    I recall          the m e s s a g e       that was          being
'repeated over                  the    Ta nnoy at that                 stage was          asking         t h e c r o w d to
keep         calm and            remain patient without                          giving       any       reason why
i.e.         without            explaining             the    n a t u r e of t h e       emergency              that       had
arisen.                 I       recall            that       Id i d    ask w h e t h e r          there         were       any
fatalities                 and        Mr.    Duckenfield               replied         "I b e l i e v e       so,     y e s" .
The      impression               I had was              that      there was           a confused             situation,
and      I       heard          the    Police          giving         instructions            to d e p l o y m e n          at
the     front         of    the       perimeter           fence        and to      seek bolt             cutters.


I left the              Police         Control           Room and went             b a c k to the Directors'
area         via        the       kitchens             of t h e     Riverside           Suite,           seeking           out
F.A.     Officials,                    in         particular              Graham         Kelly,           the         Chief
Executive,                 to    advise          h i m of w h a t w a s          happening.              I met       h i m in
the      offices'               area,       as    I recall          near the Boardroom,                       and    I told
him           that              what        was        involved           outside            was        not     a     pitch
invasion              but        was       a major incident                 and    I took him                 and     Glenn
Kirton           of        the    F.A.       back to the               Police Control               Box.        When        we
entered            the Control               3ox you could                see t h r o u g h the w i n d o w that
there        were           a     number           of        people         in     obvious              distress           and
receiving               mouth         to mouth           resuscitation.                 In d i s c u s s i o n s          with
the      Police             it        was        agreed         that        the        match        could           not     be
re-started                 but        the    Police were               anxious         not    to    announce              that
fact       to      the      fans       because           they      feared that           fans w h o m i g h t             then
leave            the        Ground           would           impede         access           to     the       emergency
services.                  Consequently whilst                     the Police            ann ouncer was               still
talking            to the         c r o w d at         regular         intervals         over the Tannoy.                    I
believe            no       formal          announcement was                    made    even       at     that        stage
that we          had       a major          incident          on   our hands.


After        a     short while               I left the            Police         Control          Box    again           with
Graham           Kelly           and        G l e n n Kirton,           a n d Mr.       Kelly       said        that        he
wanted             to           convene            a     meeting            in     the            Boardroom               with
representatives                       of    all    3 Clubs,            F . A.    Officials          and the           match
referee.                Between            the    3 of us w e           gathered         the various                 people
t o g e t h e r in       the Boardroom where                       a        meeting          took place             and     we
discussed                   the        a b a n d o n m e n t of        the match and agreed                     that        we

                                                                                                                      * .i ..
would        not    formally           announce        it w a s        abandoned until               the       Police
considered            that        it was       safe    to do       so,      having       regard to              their
concern        about           access         for e m e r g e n c y vehicles.                 I recall              that
during        the m e e t i n g        Doug     Lock entered               the    room and          said       he    had
a message          rrom Brian           Clough        that       he w a s    putting          his p l a y e r s       in
the bath       and       taking        t h e m home,        or w o r d s     to that          effect.


Subsequently                 I recall       that      I went       b a c k to the Police                   Control
Box     and        was        there when         the a n n o u n c e m e n t was made                  over         the
Tannoy        that       the match was             formally          abandoned,              the crowd           were
informed           that      there was          a major          incident        and they were                 asked
to remain p a t i e n t l y            in t h e i r p l a c e s     until        they were advised                    bv
the     Police           that       they could disperse                     in an        orderly          manner,
without        impeding             the       emergency           services.             As    I    recall           the
announcement              was     effective           and    later       the     supporters did                leave
the Ground          in a n      orderly         fashion.



As     to access          to    the     Ground      generally,              for an all t i c k e t               game
I     would    expect          each     turnstile           to   admit       at a r a t e         of a b o u t      800
per     hour       with        a good         operator        on    it.          I am aware           that          for
spectators           ror       the       standing area              atL e p p i n g s    Lane        on        15th
April     we       expected            to have      full c a p a c i t y         (10,100)           and        their
tickets        would         indicate         that they          should gain entrance through
turnstiles          A        - G.      With      7 turnstiles                operating            I appreciate
that     it     would          take      a period        of      time        before           all s p e c t a t o r s
could     be    admitted.               However given              that     the turnstiles w ere                     to
be      opened      no       later than          12 n o o n      for    a kick-off             at 3 p . m .         and
given     the       experience                of t h e   previous           year where              there           had
been     no     difficulty with                  spectators            getting into                the     Ground
(albeit        some          will      always     arrive         l a te)    I did        not        anticipate
that     there would              be    a p r o b l e m on       15th April.                 I would       expect
that                                   would       have          put       his     more           experienced
turnstile          operators             on      the turnstiles               at t h e        Kop        end        and
Leppings       Lane      e nd ,     for t he      terraces,            t h a t day.


I    would     expect         the      Stewards manning                Gate C       ( th e r e w e r e     some       3
in     number)          to    assist      in    the o r d e r l y       dispersal            of     spectators
once    they           had      come through the turnstiles, for                 they           would
normally          be        coming Chiuuyh             such a rate that it           would           b*»
possible           for        Stewards     to direct them in a           particular              way.
Similarly          the         gate in the dividing wall at the rear                       of        the
west    stand            which        divides the area behind turnstiles A                       -     G
from    the        area covered by turnstiles 1 1 - 1 6 would be                            manned
by      Stewards,              even     though    it     was    open    throughout               that
afternoon,              and     those Stewards would also              direct        spectators
towards           the       standing      area in pens 5, 6 and 7 in                 the        north
west     corner.              I would not expect our Stewards to be                    standing
on     the terraces themselves because it is not an easy task                                         to
ask     a    Steward to stand on the. terraces                        surrounded       by        Away
fans        for     any        football match.          Those terraces         are     normally
patrolled           by Police with the assistance of visiting                          Stewards
where       appropriate.               I know that there were Liverpool Stewards
in     attendance              at this game.       Apart from those who               may        have
entered           via       the turnstiles, a group of them arrived                        at        the
Club's        offices on 15th April and I authorised their admission
to the Ground as Liverpool Stewards.


In     conclusion I have been asked to comment on two matters                                         in
case it should be felt that they had any bearing on the tragic
events        of 15th April - they relate to the provision of                                   first
aid equipment and loudhailers for Stewards.


In     1988        the        Local Authority          Environmental-        Health        Officer
inspected           with specific reference to this item and wanted the
Club        to provide such equipment as was considered necessary by
the St. John's Ambulance Brigade.                         I spoke to Peter Wells, the
Duty        Officer of the St. John's Ambulance, Sheffield area, and
he provided me with an extract from a booklet listing what was
required.               I     gave     that   to Alan         Smith    who     organised             the
purchase           of       the      equipment.        I am     not    aware    whether              the
Environmental                 Health Officer came back to check that they had
been purchased.
    St.     John's "Ambulance Brigade are responsible                  for       providing
    first     aid        cover    at the Ground during matches.              This        is     a
    standard        arrangement         with   the    Football     League     and        as     I
    understand           that they undertake to provide adequate first                        aid
    cover.         They       will have details of our Fixture List               for         the
    Season     and        a    degree     of local knowledge as       to    the      likely
    attendances.              If there is any variation in that Fixture                  List
    they     are     notified       and     they are also       notified    of      special
    occasions such as the holding of an F.A. Cup semi-final at the
    Ground.         They       were sent a letter prior to the match on                   15th
    April     this year and asked to provide adequate cover and                          they
    confirmed they would do so.


£   Prior to the incident the Club provided no loudhailers for the
    use     of Stewards but I was aware that the Police had them                          for
    their     own use.         The Tannoy system was in my view the               way         to
    deal     with         any announcements that needed to be made                  to    the
    crowd     and         the system      is such    that   announcements         can         be
    directed        to       particular sections of the Ground including                  out
    into the Leppings Lane area to people outside the turnstiles.


    The     number of safety stewards we employ is not a factor which
    is     raised for discussion at Safety Committee meetings in                              my
    experience       of        attending such meetings.         I believe     that        the
    Club     would stand comparison with virtually any other Club                             in
    the     country in relation to the number that we do employ
    regular     basis, and those numbers can be increased for certain
    matches     if       a    large crowd is expected, this          being       done         by
    agreement between Doug Lock and the senior stewards.


    I     have read this Statement and it is true and correct to                          the
    best of my knowledge and belief.

When       I   joined the           club    it    had     a l r eady an          established             system       fo r

dealing with             safety matters,                licensing           by    the       Local Authority

and    requirements             of    the      Act     and     the    Green       Guide          generally.           The

club       retained       Consulting             Engineers,           Eastwood             and    Partners          and    on

15 A p r i l      1989    I was       the      Safety Officer               as    per       the     S a f e t y at

Sports         Grounds        Act    1 9 75.

Douglas         Lock     at    that     time      had     special          responsibility                for

security matters.                    He h a d     primary        responsibility                   f o r t he

recruitment,             training          and    supervision              of    Stewards           and Gatemen.

I am aware          of    the       fact    that       Stewards        are       given written

instructions             at    the    beginning           of    each       season          as t o    th e   general

duties         they are        required          to p e r f o r m and w h i c h             emphasises          the

fact       that    the    Police        are      responsible           for p u b l i c           order

situations.              I can       produce         a copy      of t h e s e         instructions             if

required.

I have         always     considered             Douglas        Lock    to       be   a very able              and

reliable          Security          Officer,         perhaps         uniquely         experienced              in th e

sense      that    he w a s         previously          a Superintendent                   with      the    South

Yorkshire         Police        Force       in w h i c h       capacity          he   had a good deal                 of

responsibility                for    supervising           the     policing           of S h e f f i e l d

    assistance         to me       in        liaison with           the    South       Yorkshire           Police.

    I am also         primarily              responsible        for l i a i s o n w i t h           the    Police         in

    relation      to    the p o l i c i n g         of m a t c h e s      at    the    ground.            The    club

    signs   an a n n u a l        contract          with the         South Yorkshire                 Police

    There   is    an    annual          meeting        called       by the          Police      with

    representatives               of    all     5 Yorkshire            Clubs        who    come     under       the

    jurisdiction            of the       South Yorkshire                  Police.          They     are     Sheffield

Wednesday,             Sheffield             United,       Doncaster           Rovers,        R o t h e r h a m and

    Barnsley      Football             Clubs.        At    that m e e t i n g         there     is u s u a l l y a

general          discussion             r e l a t i n g to p o l i c i n g      and       football,         and      it    is

    invariably my practice                     to attend with a member                        of t h e B o a r d          of

Directors.             In a d d i t i o n       to that        annual          meeting        there       is    regular

liaison with                the    Police       throughout             the     Season.          Thus,       for

example,         when        the       Fixture       List     is p u b l i s h e d        in J u n e   of      each       year

I send       a copy          to the          Police       for t h e i r      comment        prior      to

commencement            of        the    Season       and     they may          have       a particular

request        in     relation           to matches           on the         Fixture        List.

For m a tches          played           at    Hillsborough           the       Police       Liaison         Officer

match where              we w o u l d      expect,       for       example,          a    large       number      of a w a y

supporters              as w e l l    as    home     supporters             then         the    degree        of lia i s o n

will     naturally             increase        as    a good deal              of m o r e        detailed        planning

has    to     go    into       the    policing          of   it      from the            point    o f v i e w of

providing           extra       Police       Officers             and ,    from the            club's     point       of

view,       deployment           of     Stewards.            Inspector          Sewell           was     assisted            in

his    liaison           duties       by    Detective          Constable           C h a r l e s w o r t h , and         I

would       have    a degree            of c o n t a c t     w i t h h i m as w e l l .

The    average          gate     in     1989    at    Hillsborough was                     about       20,000      fans.

In m y      dealings          with     the     Police        over         the years,           in r e l a t i o n t o

Hillsborough              policing,          I would         say     that     they        have made           it p l a i n

that     they      regarded           the    function         of     Stewards            from the         c l u b as

directing          people       to their          seats,          and manning             gates        a r o u n d th e

ground.         They very much                 regarded           the Police             being     in c h a r g e      of

crowd     control          generally,          both        inside         and outside            th e     ground,         and

indeed      the     written           instructions            to     Stewards            w h i c h we     issue every

year     take      these       factors       into       account.            They were            drafted         by

Douglas       Lock       and approved             b y me,         and     I have         no doubt        he d r a f t e d

them having             regard       to his       own    experience             as       a Superintendent

with    the     South Yorkshire                Police.

I would       say       that    in m y      experience             in t h e     context          of     policing
GRAHAM HENRY M AC KRELL                                    PAGE 4




within the ground, the Police are most concerned about the

question of segregating home and away fans.      It is my belief

that they regard that as the primary means by which they avoid

crowd trouble.

There are contingency plans agreed with the Police, to deal with

an emergency situation at the ground.      Arrangements with the

Police basically cover evacuation of the ground in an emergency

and all Stewards are trained in that procedure.      Their task is

simply to man and open the gates to allow      people out of the

ground in an orderly fashion.      To my knowledge these emergency

procedures were tested during match days to ensure that they

worked properly, and the test procedure would involve the

broadcast of a message over the tannoy by the Police Operator,

which would act as a signal to the Stewards and the Police

Officers to take their positions for dealing with an emergency

situation.   In that context I would explain that the tannoy

system is one where the Police Control Room has the ability to

operate it as well as the      Club Disc Jockey/Announcer, but the

Police have an override facility so that they can cut across any

announcements being made by the Club Disc Jockey in order to

broadcast a message.      The procedure for emergencies involved the

Police control of the tannoy system and I cannot envisage a

situation where emergency messages would be broadcast by club

staff.   If» for example, I became aware of an emergency which

necessitated a tannoy announcement, I would report that to the

As    to    contingency            plans      for    coping with        spectators           coming         into

the       ground,        this    is d o n e    on    specific      occasions          when    the Police

would       be    aware       that    visiting        supporters who may               have    a n all

ticket       arrangement,             might        have    a contingent          arriving without

tickets          or ,    for e x a mpl e,      where       they might      expect       a large         number

of    spectators            to a r r i v e    who would       be s e e k i n g   to    p a y c a s h at th e

turnstiles.                They would         then have       arrangements            with    us     for

turnstiles              t o be o p e n e d    to    admit    such spectators            or,    in the c a s e

of    an all        ticket match,             the y w o u l d have     arrangements            made        to

remove       spectators           without          tickets    from the      vicinity          of th e

ground.

I have       stated that             Stewards        are    instructed      to man       all       exit     gates

fr o m the        ground,       but    the     exception       to that      is    the    gates        in the

perimeter          fencing which             allow access         onto    the     pitch.           D u r i n g the

period       that        I have    been with          Sheffield Wednesday               I cannot

remember          any     instance       where      those     gates were         manned       by Stewards

     it   is P o l i c e w h o     are    normally          stationed     along       the     perimeter.

I cannot         remember         however       any    instance where            there was          express

discussion          and agreement             with    th e   Police      that     they would           be

practice          during my         time       with      the    clu b.       Overall        I would       say that

there       is v e r y c l o s e        liaison        b e t w e e n the club        and      the   Police        and

FA    Cup     semi    finals        have       been     h e l d at H i l l s b o r o u g h    in    1987       (Leeds

both       involved Liverpool                  Football        Club and N o t t i n g h a m Forest

Football          Club.      In    1987        the    match was moved              to     a Sunday        at the

My    own    recollection             of    the     semi     final w h i c h      took place            in 19 88

is    that    everything went                extremely          smoothly,         there       were      no

problems       in g e t t i n g       the    fans       into the grou n d             on t i m e    for kick

       that    year,       but m y m e m o r y          is t h a t   the    Liverpool          fans      in

particular          arrived         earlier         that    year than        they       did    f o r the        1989

semi    final.

The    draw    for      the     FA Cup       semi      final     took place            on M o n d a y    20

March.        I was       telephoned           by                           the       Competition

Secretary          of   the     Football        Association,              that morning             before       the

meeting       of    the    FA took          place.         He   asked me         to    contact       the Police

to    confirm that             if H i l l s b o r o u g h w e r e    awarded          the    semi    f i na l

between Liverpool                 and     N o t t i n g h a m Forest,       that       t h e y w o u l d onc e

the    telephone          to    Chief       Superintendent            Brian Mole             who    confirmed

that    that       would       be t h e    case.        I was       aware    of       the    Police     reason

for    so   insisting           — it      enabled       them to have             more       effective

 control         over   t he     f l o w of     fans     into     the       ground,        since      th e

 N o t t i n g h a m Forest         fa ns,    in   journeying           from Nottingham,                  would

 normally         arrive       at    the     Penistone        Road      end       of    the    ground        via

Junction          34 of t h e M l          and Liverpool            f ans     would        exit      the M o t o r w a y

of    the    Motorway.

I telephoned            Steve        Clark     and     confirmed what                  Chief    Superintendent

Brian Mole          h a d t o l d me.          The     semi     final       at    Hill s b o r o u g h was

later       confirmed          by t e l e p h o n e    and    this      enabled          us t o pu t

arrangements            in h a n d     for     the     printing-of            tickets          etc.




     Paragraph here to explain fully the turnstile and ticketting

arrangements he made for 1989.



I now turn          to events          that     occurred         on the       d a y of t h e m a t c h ,           15

During      the     hours      leading        up to the         start        of    the     game       I was     busy

dealing with            a variety          of o r g a n i s a t i o n a l    matters.           As     is m y

normal      practice        I would,          from time         to time,           w a l k out       of   the

office      and     check      the    position         in t h e     ground         itself.           Thus,      for

example,         on more       than     one     occasion        I walked           down the          players'

tunnel         to    see h o w the           spectators were               building         up,      and my

principal            recollection             is    that      Nottingham Forest                  were       filling       up

their      end       of    the     ground      at    a quite         early      stage,        bu t    Liverpool

supporters              were     not.

I visited            the    Leppings          Lane      end     shortly      after        2 .0 0     pm,    but    I

cannot         put      anything        like       an exact         time   on    it.        However my

recollection               of    the    situation          at L e p p i n g s    Lane       at     that     time was

that      the       number       of L i v e r p o o l     supporters was              starting to               build     up

       there    was       a substantial             g r o u p of    them present             but      I would          n ot

say that            the    area was          packed       solid.       I can        say that          nothing

about      the       scene       at    that    time       s t r u c k me   as    unusual           or p o t e n t i a l l y

dangerous.

Subsequently               I was       in a n d     out    of   the office            (I h a d       placed myself

-*-n                        's o f f i c e     that       afternoon)        at      intervals           and on m ore

than      one    occasion             I would       have w a l k e d down           the    p l a y e r s ' tunnel

to     see w h a t        was    happening          on the      p i t c h a nd on the              stands       and

terraces,           from        inside       the    ground.         It w a s     still       th e     case      that     it

was     noticeable              that    Liverpool          fans     were    slower         building          up    in

the     North       Stand        and    the W e s t       Stand     areas       than      the N o t t i n g h a m

Forest         fans .

As     I recall,          I was        out    on    the    pitch when           the    Liverpool            tea m came

out,     and     just- a f t e r        they       came    o nto the p i t c h         Douglas         Lock came

up to me         and told me             that       Gate      'C'   had either            been opened             or

broken      down        at t h e       Leppings       Lane      end   and      as     I recall         he    t o l d me

that     about       300        - 400    people       had entered           through          the     g a te .      I

 said      I would        go and      see w h a t     the   problem was          and     I immediately

 pushed my         w ay through the            photographers            in t h e    area and walked

 up the         players'       tunnel.        At    that    stage    the     Nottingham Forest

 team were         also on the pitch,                 but   the   photographers               were waiting

 for      the    arrival      of B r i a n    Clough,       I believe.

 I walked         out    of t h e     ground and        around      through        the sterile area

to     Gate      'C'    at L e p p i n g s   L ane.




* What did he observe when he got there?



I imagine          the m a t c h must         have     kicked     off    at a b o u t     that time         but

I cannot         be c e r t a i n .     Once    the     teams     were     out    on the p i t c h      the

noise      f r o m the huge           crowd    inside       the   stadium was            such that      it

would      be    difficult          to tell        from outside         whether         the   kick    off    had

taken      place       and    in a n y e v e n t      I was   concentrating              on t h e    problem

in h a n d .




* At this time I was in possession of a Sheffield Wednesday

Football Club radio but had heard no transmissions from the

Police Control Box to myself or any members of my staff.                                               I was

certainly unaware at this time of any intention by the Police to

open the exit gates and I was not asked for my advice on such a
decision.



As   to    access       to the        ground generally,           for    an all         ticket      game,    I

would expect              each      turnstile             to admit        at    a rate         of     about         800 p e r

hour with           a good          operator         on    it.        I am aware         that       for        spectators

for        the   standing           a r e a at    L e p p i n g s L a n e on       15 A p r i l       we       expected

that        they    should          gain entrance               through turnstiles                  A -        G.     With          7

turnstiles           operating           I appreciate                 t h a t it w o u l d      take       a    period          of

time       before       all    spectators            could       be a d m i t t e d .        However            given

that       the     turnstiles          were      t o be     opened         no     later      than        12 n o o n        fo r

a kick off           at   3.00       pm and        given        the     experience           of     the        previous

year       where     there         had been        no d i f f i c u l t y w i t h        spectators                 getting

into the           ground      (albeit         some will          always         arrive         late)          I did       no t

anticipate           that      there would            be    a p r o b l e m on          15 A p r i l .

I would          expect       the    Stewards manning                   Gate      'C'     (there w e r e             some       3

they       had   come     through        the      turnstiles,              for    they w o ul d            normally             be

by a wa y      fans      for     any      football match.                  Those     terraces          are

In c o n c l u s i o n     I have         been     asked       to comment           on   the    provision         of

loudhailers           for Stewards.

Prior       to the       incident           the    club provided             no     loudhailers           f o r th e

use    of    Stewards,           but      I was        aware       that    the    Police       had     t h e m fo r

their       o w n u s e.       The     tannoy          s y stem was        in m y    view      the     way     to deal

with    any announcements                    that       n e e d e d t o be m a d e       to    the     crowd and

                                   of the interview I'll give you a

             05061                    ^    15th of April 1989 (150489)

                                  a disaster occurred at Hillsborough

                                  Football Stadium and 95 people died.

                                  Following the public inquiry and

                                  report, the Chief Constable of South

                                  Yorkshire Police consulted with the

                                  Director of Public Prosecutions and

                                  as a result West Midlands Police were

                                  requested to do a criminal
 01.32
                                  investigation.   So far as you are

                                 concerned, arising from that

                                 investigation, there are possible

                                 criminal offences of corporate

                                 manslaughter and that is against the

                                 Club as distinct to yourself and an

                                 offence of, a possible offence of

                                 culpable malfeasance, which would be

                                 against you as an individual.    I'll

                                 explain the specific allegations to

                             you in interview, but do you now

                             understand the nature of this
02.04
                             interview.      Before you answer that

                             I need to formally caution you, you
  MACKRELL               GRAHAM    HENRY


                                    do not have to say anything unless

                                    you wish to do so but w h at you say

                                    ma y be given in evidence.    Do you

                                    understand?

              MACKRELL              I do.

              DSU61
                                    I will now remind you that you are

                                   not under arrest and that you need

                                   not remain here, in addition you

                                   are entitled to legal representation

                                   and of course you are aware of that

                                   because                   is here anyway.

                                   Do you understand what I have said in

                                   regard to the fact that you are not

                                   under arrest?

             MACKRELL              I do.

             DSU61
                                   Initially you gave evidence to the

                                  m q u a r y held b y Lord Justice TAYLOR.

                                  I have here a transcript of the

                                  evidence and you have a copy in your

                                  folder which it ma y be necessary

                                  to refer to during the interview.

                                  Are you content to accept the

                                  contents of that transcript, or is

                                  there anything in it which you wish

                                  to clarify before we start?

         MACKRELL             No.

03.10    DSU61
                              You also submitted a written

                              submission to lord Justice TAYLOR in

                              relation to the Semi-Final on the
  MACKRELL              GRAHAM    HENRY


                                   15th of April 1989 (150489).       I have

                                   here a copy of that document and

                                   you have a copy also in your folder

                                   which it may be necessary to refer

                                   to during interview.    Are you content

                                   that we do that also?
             MACKRELL              Yes.

                                   I think if we may, I should interject

                                  at this point just to put on record

                                  the fact that Mr MACKRELL has not

                                  reviewed his transcript of evidence

                                  word b y word, line b y line, for the

                                  purposes of this interview.    So

                                  the answer he has given is broadly

                                  correct no doubt, but there ma y be

                                  matters when you, when you take him

                                  through the transcript that he will

                                 want to clarify.

         DSU61
                                 I understand that yes.    Presunebly

                                 that also relates to his written

                                 submission as well?

                                 He has reviewed the statement, I

                                 believe, his statement.
         DSU61                   Okay.

                                 The written submission.
04.07    DSU61
                                 Fair enough then.   If we could irove

                             on Mr MACKRELL to deal with the

                             situation as far as your enplqyment

                             is concerned.     As I understand it,

                                   you're the Secretary of Sheffield

                                   describe yourself as Chief Executive

                                   the Board.   How far did this extend

                                   in relation to you authorising work

                                  at the ground?

 04.40       MACKRELL
                                  All vrorks of a capital nature of a

                                  major capital nature were sanctioned

                                  by the Board of Directors.
             DSU61
                                  Yes, so in regard to, so the Spion

                                  Kop, and the roof on the Spion Kop,

                                  that's something that would have

                                  clearly gone to the Board of

                                 Directors, considerable financial

                                 irrplications.
04.58    MACKRELL
                                 Indeed, in addition to that

                                 obviously works of a major nature

                                 we employ EASTWOOD and Partners

                                 as our consultants to initially

                                 draw up schemes, obtain tenders,

                                 costings, because a lot of the work

                                 that is done at the football ground

                                 is funded b y way of grant aid or

                                  Trust so there are obviously

                                  set, definite procedures which one

                                  must go down the path and obviously

                                  that's why we've particulary used

                                  EASTVroOD and Partners.

             DSU61
                                  Can you talk about the composition

                                 of the Board M r MACKRELL, I

                                 understand that there are seven

                                 Directors, w e know that Mr ADDY is

                                 °ne of the Directors with

                                 responsibility for structural

                                 safety work at the ground and we'll

                                 come to that in a minute, but there

                                 are seven Directors, as I understand

                                 it, it's a non executive Board.     Can

                                you explain to m e what that, what

                                that means, and you know what what

                                the structure is?

                                is a public limited conpany.     it has

                                seven Directors who basically are

                                part time in their operation, they

                                therefore meet on a regular basis

                                to direct policy of the company.

                                I'm the Senior Executive of the

                            Ccnpany who looks after all the

                                  the caipany.    Basically the Directors

                                  are, do not have a controlling

                                  interest in the company and

                                  they are appointed under normal

                                  company law by the shareholders in

                                  annual meetings.

                                 I see, yeah.    Can vre deal with the

                                 composition of the Board.    I think

                                 composition, I'm right in saying

                                 that, since your appointment the

                                 Board's been comparatively same

                                 Directors, the seven Directors.    Can

                                 you name the Directors?
06.48    MACKRELL
                                Yes indeed.     The Board actually has

                                changed subsequent to the events of

                                15th of April 89 (150489) in, but I

                                will expand on that.    A t the time in

                                question, Chairman was M r H E IfcGEE,

                                Vice Chairman was a M r Mathew

                                SHEPHERD, in addition the other

                                Directors were Keith ADDY, Ernest

                                BARON, Cliff WOOCWARD, Stanley

                                SPATE and Geoffrey HULLEY.

                                Subsequent to that and at the present

                            time Messrs MeGEE, SHEPHERD and SPATE

                                 It's alright, just making a point,

                                 that sorry, that M r GREARSON and Mr

                                then that the, from your appointment

                                which I think was in December 1986

                                (001286), the Board of Directors

                                ware as you described up until

                                after the 15th of April 1989

                                   records of the Conpany and I wasn't,

 08.41       DSU61
                                  I see.   What type of decisions would

                                  you refer to the Board.    I mean

                                  we've we've talked about it, that the

                                  major capital, the major financial

                                  decisions would be referred to the

                                  Board and w e mentioned the roof on

                                 the Spion Kop.     What type of

                                 decisions would you deal with

                                 yourself?

08.59    MACKRELL
                                 I would mate it possibly minor

                                 decisions, obviously there is an

                                 ongoing discussion say with the

                                 police on a matter of policing,

                                 policing individual matches,

                                 and the policy for individual

                             matches.        Obviously it's the general

                             activities of the Chief Executive

                             of any Ccrnpany.

                                    limitation.    Was there any sort of

                                    sealing put on what you could spend

                                    or?

              MACKRELL
                                    It wasn't an actual determined

                                    sealing in that I had an x limit

                                    of which I wasn't to spend more

                                    than the Board, but obviously it

                                   was a situation the Board had

                                    strong financial controls and I

                                   normally wouldn't spend large

                                   capital sums without reference to

                                   the Board.
09.40        DSU61
                                   Mn.    What, what I'm getting out

                                   can you, is there any definition

                                   what would you consider to be large

                                   can you give us a      ?
09.44    MACKRELL
                                   I would, I would, I would anticipate

                                   I would say large is five, ten

                                  thousand pounds.
         DSU61
                                  Was it the cost element that

                                  controlled, you knew what you

                                  referred or was it the type of

                                  decision?

        MACKRELL                  I think basically, it's it's a

                                  financial control element, not the

                                  actual, because obviously I think

                              when one's talking about referring

                              to the Board they've obviously got

                              to monitor all expenditure not in

                           matter of to balance up for example

                           whether expenditure should be spent

                           on the sports hall or visa -v- the

                           lottery department and so it's a

                           surple one of that and I think

                           that they appraise the situation

                           and make their decisions accordingly,
10.21      DSU61
                           I see.   Would you make decisions

                           in relation to work identified as

                          necessary b y either EASTWOODS, the

                          Working Party or Advisory Group

                          as you became later, the police or

                          grounds taff in relation to safety

                          matters or would you refer those to

                          the Board or, I mean does that go

                          back to how much money you're

                          spending?

        MACKRELL
                          I think it goes back to basically

                          items of capital expenditure

                         obviously if one coranits over

                         a thing like the Kop, then one

                         would, one's talking about a large

                         near seven figure sum, one would

                         re^er ^    to the Board, if one has

                         another item whereby say a barrier

                         to barrier repairs are needed that's

                         reported to me, obviously I would

                         instruct them to go ahead with that

                        work.

                                  Safety Certificate was issued by

                                  South Yorkshire County Council and

                                  obviously they were instructed by

                                  the Board at that time to basically

                                 do what work was necessary to get

                                 the certificate.

                                 I see.    What, vas'll came back to

          MACKRELL               Quite honestly...

                                 decision, majority decision?
12.00     MACKRELL
                             No, it never came to that because

                             matters of public safety I felt

                             the Board always vent down, went

                             cfcwn the path, if one looks

                                      statistically, there's only one other

                                     more money on or received more

                DSU61                Yeah.

                                     And that's Glasgow Gel tic.


m    12.22      DSU61
                                     But how, I mean in regard to

                                     decisions b y the Board, how were

                                     they made, generally?

                MACKRELL
                                     Gen, generally, a a preposition

                                     was put to the Board, and they

                                     obviously mooted b y the Board

                                    and then a decision taken.
                DSU61
                                    So if you've got something that you

                                    wanted to deal with and some work

                                    that needed to be carried out, you

                                    mentioned barriers, earlier,

                                    what you'd do is put a proposition

                                    up to the Board?

             MACKRELL
                                    Something like barriers would be

                                    on a routine basis, you know

                                    routine situation if somebody, it's

                                    it's it's almost an on going house

                                keeping situation of keeping the

                                ground up to scratch.

             DSU61              Yes.

                                    Hie Board vrould mainly be referred

                                    to matters of direct policy or

                                    capital expenditure.    I think

                                    things like barrier repairs are

                                    really an ongoing, an ongoing

                                    cost.

             DSU61
                                   Maintenance you regard it almost as

                                   maintenance.

             MACKRELL
                                   Yeah I would regard that alirost

                                   like a, okay as a safety element

                                   but it's a you know, it's a

                                   situation whereby something has

                                   to be done on a, on a regular

                                   basis.

             DSU61
                                   So unless something, unless it

                                   was a question of sort of

                                  clearing out all the barriers

                                  on the West Terrace or something

                                  like that and spending twenty or

                                  thirty thousand pounds on replacing

                                  them, you wouldn't go to the Board,

                                  you wouldn't expect to go to the

                                  Board?

          MACKRELL                No that's right.

                                    Well by- the definition of the

                                    obviously he chaired, yeah he

                                    chaired the meetings.   But it's,

                                    it was, it was basically a a

                                   Board decision and not an

                                   to the role of stewards later but

                                   so far as M r LOCK'S concerned,
  14.44
                                   I think he, he mentions that he

                                   was involved with general matters

                                   of crowd safety and was of course

                                   familiar with the Green Code. That's

                                   what what sort of, I'm referring

                                   for the audio tape to the statement

                                  fcy Douglas John LOCK.      What sort of

                                  m v o l v m e n t did he have in general

                                  safety matters?

                                  stewarding.

15.17     MACKRELL
                                  Visa viz stewarding and he would

                                  draw matters of possible attention

                                  that, that would be, that he felt

                              might be, might be of benefit to

15.26     DSU61
                              So how would that work then?          Would

          MACKRELL
                              That's right, he would report to me,

                              he acted as the go between, between

                              myself and all the Stewards etc

                                   the role of Mr ADDY and I understand

                                   that in private life Mr ADDY is a

                                   builder developer, property developer.

                                       obviously was somebody who who

                                       understood the technical nature

                                       of certain of the work that was
      17.38
                                       done.   Over the years, gradually,

                                       there are people such as rnyself

                                      who have come into the game with

                                     to keep him fully briefed of the

                                Exactly.         He was right involved in

                                the early meetings, with the

                                South Yorkshire, the then South

                                I think I should perhaps interject

                                here to say that in those days I

                                     but m y recollection is that he did

                                    until later.

              DSU61                 He was a Director?

              MACKRELL              Yes he was.

                                just related to safety aspects.

                                It was the Director who had a

                                special expertise in areas of,

                               had that particular task before

                               referred to this.     M r ADDY said

                               in his statement that he joined

                               the Board of Directors in 1975

                               (000075) and at that time Roy

                              matters at the ground, I took

                              over that responsibility from

                              him when he retired.

                                occupation but I'm thinking more

                                about the Green Guide, the Green

        MACKRELL                Yes, no, sure I don't necessarily say

                                he would of, say he would have

                                   No, that that would be a situation

            MACKRELL              to to EASTWOOD and Partners.
            DSU61
                                  I see.   Did Mr, would M r ADDY, again

                                  because of this, have any function in

                                  regard to decisions about building

                                  work or would he just advise the

                                  Board, assist you to advise the

                                  Board if you like...

            MACKRELL              Sure.

            DSU61
                                 on technical matters.
22.39    MACKRELL
                                  I think that the situation often was

                                 that ma y be EASTWOODS would consult

                                 initially with M r ADDY because he

                                 had a technical expertise...

        DSU61                    Yes.

        MACKRELL
                                 by way of Partner and Son building

                                 terms and it would be left that

                                 then Mr ADDY might pit EASTWOODS

                                 proposals to the Board.

        DSU61
                                 In the wa y that the Board can

                             understand...

        MACKRELL             Exactly.

        DSU61                Non engineering...
  MACKRELL               GRAHAM    HENRY


              MACKRELL              Yeah.

              DSU61
                                    Laymen's type approach.

              MACKRELL              That's right.

              DSU61
                                    I see.   So he I mean he wouldn't

                                    actually, he ADDY, wouldn't actually

                                   be able to go off and spend money

                                   again in regard to safety

                                   independent of anybody else?

             MACKRELL              No.

             DSU61
                                   He would be, to same extent,

                                   something similar to yourself, you

                                   he'd help...

23.17        MACKRELL
                                   That's right.    There is basically

                                   the under the corporate structure

                                  no person would have the actual

                                  right to go and do it to no doubt

                                  it would be referred back.
23.30    DSU61
                                  Ho w do you see Mr ADDY'S function

                                  in relation to your own function?

                                  Ho w do do you equate the two?

                                  You're, you are the Safety Officer.
        MACKRELL
                                  Yeah M r ADDY I feel, I feel gives

                              can give m e same technical advice

                              of matters which if I, if i require

                              I can ask him, you know, can look at.

                              Again he's explained EASTWOODS even

                                   in reasonable layman's language,

                                   sometimes on occasions you know,

                                   I've asked Keith.
            DSU61
                                  What type of, can you give me an

                                  example; of what type of work you're

            MACKRELL              Basically there was a dispute

                                  regarding the final payment on the
                                  Kop roof ...
            DSU61                Mm.
            MACKRELL
                                 with the main contractors and it dealt

                                 with sub contractors and it rep, dealt

                                 and the sub contractors then

                                 approached us to to for additional

                                 sums of money.   And obviously this was

                                 like on a, on a basis of a building

                                contract with a main contractor and a

                                sub contractor and quite honestly

                                I don't know, I'm the first to admit

                                I don't know a great deal about

                                you know the technicalities of

                                building contracts.

       MACKRELL
                                And it was something where I've

                                showed the correspondence to Keith

                            and then he advised me said no, on

                            in this particular instance, no, we

                            have to leave that to EASTWOODS,

                            they were the Consulting Engineers
 MACKRELL              GRAHAM    HENRY


                                  they were the people who instructed,

                                  it must be left for them to decide.
             D5U61
                                  So they, they weren't really safety

                                  aspects, they they were.   (Overtalking)

            MACKRELL              More technical function.

            D5U61
                                 Building function than a safety

                                  function.

            MACKRELL             Indeed.

            DSU61
                                 Can you give us an example in

                                 regard to safety how'd you'd,

                                 you know in regard to the safety

                                 his safety role, your safety role?

25.02       MACKRELL
                                 Well basically if EASTVTOODS were for

                                 example, you know, I'm I'm I'm

                                 trying to actually think of, think

                                 of a specific term.   It was

                                 predominantly, I mist say I can't

                                recall a particular matter on safety.

                                 It's mainly in relation to other

                                capital expenditure, Keith, we...

                                over the last, since I've been the

                                Company, the Club have re-roofed the

                                North Stand which was a considerable

                                capital cost and ended up being

                                and there was some dispute, or not

                                dispute, sane discussion with British

                                now again I have known nothing about

                                   the pitches on flat roofs.

             MACKRELL
                                   A n d it was that, that he was able to

                                   give us a little bit of advice and

                                   advise me and the Board on that

                                   matter.

  25.50      DSU61
                                   If w e talk, you knew the barrier 144?
             MACKRELL              Yes.

             DSU61
                                  That was reduced.      I don't want to

                                  cane in to this into, at this

                                  stage again, in too much detail but

                                  vrould would you have any conversation

                                  with Mr ADDY, vrould you seek his

                                  advice in regard to that or would

                                  you simply take the advice of

                                  EASTWOODS, I mean EASTWOODS were

                                  there anyway?

          MACKRELL
                                 Well I have to say that that barrier

                                  144, is before I joined the company,

                                 the removal, the removal of barrier

                                 144.

          DSU61
                                 I used that as an example...

          MACKRELL
                                 Yeah, of course, of course, I would

                                 have thought on something like that,

                                 one .would have relied upon our

                                 Consulting Engineers.
26.26     DSU61
                                 Okay.    Perhaps this is an appropriate

                             Place to to deal with the role of

                             the EASTWDODS who are your Consulting

             MACKRELL
                                   Sure.   Their terms of reference are

                                   basically as the advisors to the

                                   safety matters, and obviously for

                                  at the Club, some of which obviously

                                  are consequential to safety natters.
             DSU61
                                  I see.   The role of EASTWOODS, in

                                  actual fact if you could refer to your

                                  I think it's in that book (let's just

                                  have a look at this).   If you could

                                 this is to Dr EASTWOOD, can I now

                                 turn to something a little

                         this area, where there is a narrow

                        restricted entrance to the ground,

                        would you then have considered it

                        within your remit to think up ways in

%                       which the turnstile areas could be

                        made safer or would that have been

                        outside your canpetance and renit'

                        and Dr EASTWOOD replied to that,

                         I didn't, I did do that with four

                        schemes' and in fact the questioning

                        does go on but the the point that I

                    want to put to you Mr MACKRELL is, is

  29.06      MACKRELL              Well I, you know, I I can't quite

                                   understand the great difference

                                  inspections have been dealt with.
30.00       MACKRELL              Following on from that, the

                                  annual inspection that was taken,

                                  undertaken b y the Local Authority,

                                  any points that were drawn up from

                                  that, EASTVOODS would actually

                                 monitor on the Club's behalf.

           DSU61
                                 Yeah.   If we can sort of go back

                                 over that, I appreciate that they

                                 were there, at the bi-annual

                                 inspections initially and that

                                 more recently they became annual

                                 inspections.
           MACKRELL              Mm.
           DSU61
                                And that during those inspections

                                which wsre attended b y members of

                                they would advise as necessary but

                                on vrork that was being proposed, but

                                the point that I'm, I'm trying to

                                get to is, would they have advised

                                you, where you didn't week advice,

                                in another words, did they take a,

                                an active role or a pro-active role,

                            vrould they, for example, have pointed

                            out that the barrier configur...,

                            would you have expected them to point
 MACKRELL               GRAHAM HENRY


                                out the barrier confirguation wasn't

                                as it should be, in accordance with

                                the Green Guide?

             MACKRELL          Well I can only say, obviously, the

                               barrier configuration was set prior

                               to I joined the Company and I'm you

                               know more aware of the fact that

                               there was annual inspections from,

                               with the Local Authority and as a

                               result of that the the Green Guide is

                               a guide as such.    And the configur­

                               ation of the barriers, to use an

                               example as you did there, is, was, was

                               accepted b y the Local Authority and

                              not ccnmented upon b y the Local

                              Authority.

            DSU61             Right, I don't want to go again

                              into that in too much detail.

        MACKRELL              Mm.

31.44   DSU61                 A t this point but, would you

                              generally speaking now, would you

                              have expected EASTWOODS as your

                              advisors to have advised you where

                              your ground, or any part of your

                              ground, didn't accord with what

                             was laid down in the Green Guide?

                             A n d I accept the Green Guide

                             isn't mandatory?

        MACKRELL             No, sure.     I think, I I I I say
  MACKRELL              graham    HENRY


                                   yes, but with a qualified yes

                                   obviously after their negotiations

                                   or conversations with the Local

                                   Authority, as the Licensing

                                   Authority.

             DSU61                 But that they, they're not

                                   employed, EASTWDODS are not

                                   employed b y the Local Authority.

             MACKRELL             No.
             DSU61                They're enployed b y you or the

                                  Club, you and the Club.

             MACKRELL             Yeah.

32.23    DSU61
                                  They relate direct to you, and they

                                  are the people that you presumably

                                  would depend upon for technical

                                  advice?

         MSCKRELL                 That's correct.

         DSU61
                                  They and possible M r ADDY, frcm what

                                 you say, depending upon what you're

                                 dealing with?

         MACKRELL                Yeah.

32.37    DSU61
                                 You'd obviously have scire knowledge

                                 of the Green Guide yourself, again

                                 I'll come to this later, but, what I'm

                                 getting at is, a p . .. with these

                                 inspections that were held, for

                                 example, b y the Lccal Authority.     At

                                 those inspections would you have

                                 expected EASTWOODS or, I maan it
  MACKRELL               GRAHAM    HENRY


                                    wouldn't necessarily be EASTWOODS,

                                    I'm talking about EASTWOODS as a

                                    company.

              MACKRELL              Yeah.

              DSU61
                                    Not specifically Dr EASTWOOD.

             MACKRELL               Yes.
             DSU61
                                    When I'm saying EASTWDODS, would

                                   you have expected their

                                   representative to say to you,

                                   well this part, this part of the

                                   ground doesn't accord with the

                                   Green Guide, but it's okay, we

                                   can, you know, it it's, it is the

                                   Working Party are aware of it,

                                   and w s c a n ___

             MACKRELL              I would have expected to have been

                                   advised to look at it, yes, I think

                                  these sort of issues, yes.

         DSU61
                                  You would have been.     So, if we can

                                  summarize then the role of,

                                  EASTWDOD'S role.     You regard them

                                  as what?

33.34    MACKRELL
                                  I regard them as the Consulting

                                  Engineers who handle our affairs,

        DSU61                     I see.    As, coming back to

                               We've already mentioned that.     H ow

                               I think there is, in the in the

                              liaise with them, you'd be present

                              part of the time I know when they

                              carry out these inspections?
            MACKRELL
                              Yes, but it was impossible to

                              actually be present all the time

                              because they departed to all, all

                             parts round the stadium.
            DSU61
                             Yes, so would you make a point of

                             being there when, when they were

                             carrying out these inspections?
        MACKRELL             I'd made the point that...
        DSU61                As long as possible.

                             but y o u. .. as a result of those

                             inspections letters were written by

                            the Local Authority, based upon

                            reports received from the various

                            So at these inspections, you get the

            DSU61
                                  You'd be there, Mr EASTWOOD would be

                                  there, Dr EASTWOOD would be there...
           MACKRELL               Yeah.

           DSU61
                                 or somebody from his staff.

           MACKRELL              Yeah.

           DSU61
                                 they'd depart around to look at

                                 different areas of the ground.

           MACKRELL              Mn.

           DSU61
                                 You'd be there and or a member of

                                 your staff.

           MACKRELL              I would be there, they'd have a

                                 member of m y staff particularly

                                 there to may be unlock areas,

                                caretaker person.   I would be there

                                really as a point of reference should

                                they wish to, kind of, clarify any­

                                thing or any any particular.     The

                                Police on the annual inspections were

                                very very much there almost in a

                                courtesy aspect because they, they'd

                                policed the stadium on thirty times

                                a season, they really didn't need to

                                to wander, to wander around.     I think

                            it was really they were there almost

                            in the same brief as I was.

             DSU61
                                   So then, if they'd got something

                                   What would actually happen then,

                                   the, they would identify something

                                   that needed to be done, let's

                                   supposing it's a crush barrier that

                                  needs to be rewelded or sonething

                                  like that?

             MACKRELL             Sure.

             DSU61
                                  That would be discussed and

                                  presumably if you were present they

                                  would mention it to you that that

                                  needs a new strap on it?

          MACKRELL                Yes but ...

          DSU61                   Something like that yeah?

          MACKRELL               Obviously something along that        '

          DSU61
                                 They'd, but they would, would you

                                   And they wouldn't cane back to you

                                   and necessarily to say, this needs

                                   doing, that surface is dangerous,

                                   this is the case?

                                   They would go away.

                              been the opinion they vrere being a
  MACKRELL           GRAHAM HENRY


                             bit pedantic on one o r two things,

                             because there is an element maybe

                             that to choose things you've always

                             got on every inspection something like

                            so many seats are loose in certain

                            areas.     Well you know that is an

                            ongoing situation the moment they are

                            the moment they are tightened up

                            there's three down the row that are

                            loose and it happens on a, on a

                            regular basis and so it's a thing

                            that's almost handled under normal

                            housekeeping basis.

38.53        DSU61
                            Mn.   You mentioned earlier about the

                           Police attendance and the fact

                           that they were there at thirty odd

                           matches a year anyway and so really

                           they were, I think your words were

                           courtesy?

39.06    DSU61
                           Did they not take any involvement,

                           any direct involvement, presumably

                           this is Inspector CALVERT is it or?

39.13    MACKRELL          It was Inspector CALVERT on a

                           basis, but of, the Police were

                           there on a very regular basis.    The

                                   really as relevant and the Police

                                   spent more time at the ground

                                    into the centre of the West Stand,

                                    there were, there were a few

                                    brackets that were bolted with

                                    spikes on to step people climbing

                                    and in fact the Police felt that

                                   they were, and in fact an inducement

                                   to people to climb, it gave than an

                                   opportunity to people if they wanted

                                   to climb up to actually do that and

                                   they asked for those to be removed

                                   as well.

                                   in 1986 (000086).   is that correct?

             MACKRELL              Correct.

             DSU61                 Can you tell me when this was

                                   that you examined them?

             MACKRELL              It was the early part of 87 (000087)

                                   I joined around Christmas just the

                                  week before Christmas in 1986 (000086)

                                  and it was in the early months of

                                  87 (000087) I was obviously

                                  ploughing m y way through them.

                                 w h e n i came upon the Safety

  MACKRELL              GRAHAM    HENRY


                                   as that, but it was obvioulsy

                                   fundamental that since I joined

                                   the Club, that the Spion Kop had

                                   been extended.

             D5U61                 Yes.

 43.24       MACKRELL              A n d as a result of that, the

                                   capacity for the Spion Kop

                                   b y w a y of correspondence that was

                                  capacity on the Kop was twenty

                                  one thousand.

                                  what you're saying there.     I

                                  think this is probably an

                                  appropriate point to adjourn

                                  the interview while we change

                                   picked this up at or shortly

                                   after the time that you arrived

                                  didn't appear to reflect those

                                  looking at the West Terrace

                                 which is what I'm particulary

                                 interested in, the capacity was

                                 seven thousand two hundred and

                                 that there were no capacities,

                                   what you're talking about is the

                                   bit at the bottom of the page,

                                   that, does that, is that the

                                  one that arises as a result

                                  of the query b y the FA?

            MACKRELL              It's not a query b y the way.

            DSU61
                                  Or is this a query that you raised

                                  on your own behalf?

03.00       MACKRELL
                                  Well I raised the one subsequent

                                  about the actual Safety Certificate.

                                  This was, came as a result of

                                  ccnpleting the form which I

                                  refer to fran the FA, regarding

                                 capacities.    That's because it

                                 refers to other matters like

                                 locks, readings of floodlights.

        D5U61                    Yeah.

        MACKRELL                 It's a standard form which clubs

                                 have to complete each year to send

                                 in to the Football Association and

                                 obviously we're looking for

                                 confirmation on these figures from

                                 them.

        DSU61                    Yeah.    As a result of that query
  MACKRELL              graham    HENRY


                                   that, that was raised, the reply

                                   that you got back from EASTWOODS,

                                   not specifically Dr EASTWOOD, but

                                   I think it, seems to suggest that

                                   he was spoken to.

             MACKRELL              Mm.
 03.36       DSU61
                                   And then the reply given b y a

                                  member of his staff to you, was

                                  that providing the gates, providing

                                  the police had the gates under the

                                  West Stand open, so that people

                                  can distribute themselves throughout

                                  the terraces, there was no problem

                                  with the capacities remaining.

                                  Is that your understanding of

                                  the situation?

         MACKRELL                 Yes.

         DSU61
                                 Did that not cause you, give you

                                 any cause for concern, or were you

                                 happy to accept that?
04.04    MACKRELL
                                 Well obviously the situation had

                                 been licensed b y the Local

                                 Authority, Dr EASTWOOD had had,

                                 Dr EASTWOCD had handled the ground

                                 for a long time, I'd only been at

                                 the Club for under three, under

                                 three months there and obviously

                                 I accepted their their professional

                             advice.

 04.23       DSU61
                                  I see, so you, you really are

                                  taking it that the, so far as the

                                  capacity is concerned that the

                                  barrier configurations, tunnel

                                  elevations, gate widths, elevation

                                 on the terraces, all these sorts

                                 of things had been considered by

                                 both the Working Party or the

                                 Advisory Group, had also been

                                 considered b y EASTWOODS.   There

                                 was a lot of technical professional

                                 people on those and and you actually

                                 tend to accept EASTWOODS advice?

            MACKRELL             Yeah.

            DSU61
                                 Given that they'd been involved

                                 I think since 1978 (000078)?

            MACKRELL             That's, that's correct.

05.01       DSU61
                                Can you, it's probably an appropriate

                                point actually to mention to take

                                EASTVOXlS role a little bit further

                                we we talked about it a short time

                                ago but, was there ever any kind,

                                is there any sort of written contract

                                between you and EASTWOODS?   Have

                                you ever, are there any sort of

                                terms of reference or work d es c...

                                jobs description type of thing

                                in being as far as you're aware,

                                between the Club and EASTWOODS as
 MACKRELL               GRAHAM    HENRY


                                   to what their role is?

             MACKRELL              I believe there was when the

                                   initial setting up of the safety

                                   of Sports Grounds Act was about

                                   was about to be set up.

             DSU61                 Yes.

            MACKRELL              Obviously when the Club became a

                                  designated Club under the terras of

                                  that act.    But subsequent to that

                                  I, there hasn't been an ongoing

                                  matter of actual record.
05.47       DSU61
                                  Do you consider that that contract

                                  or what ever you want to call it

                                  still held good in 1979 (000079)

                                  prior to the disaster?

            MACKRELL              1989    (000089).

            DSU61                 Sorry 1989 (000089).

            MACKRELL             Yeah, yeah.

            DSU61                 I'm sorry.

        MACKRELL                 I I do obviously became of the fact

                                 the way in that they particularly

                                 led on if one is to read the files,

                                 they led on certain matters with the

                                 Ixcal Authority, by taking, by

                                 acting on, on our behalf, often

                                 without taking actual points of

                                 reference back to myself because

                                 obviously they were the technical

                                 experts ...

                                  obviously had greater technical

                                 knowledge.

           DSU61                 Can you refer me to the, to that

                                 document in 1978 (000078)?

           DSU61                 Presumably that's what you're

                                trying to find is it

                                There was a reference if I remember

                                in the minutes and there was also

           DSU61                Is that, was that referred to at

                               any time during the Inquiry, the

                               the document was certainly in the

       DSU61                   In your core bundle to the TAYLOR

             MACKRELL           I believe it's in the Treasury

                                 Well obviously the point of contact

                                 this is long before m y time, but one

                                 would looks at the situation under

                                 There was also a letter written

                               keep those separate.    As far as

                               those letters are concerned Mr

                               MACKRELL, obviously you would

                               talked about, that's what we

                               were talking about it at the time,

                               you'd obviously go through the

                               file, the Club files, and those

                           no doubt would be on the Club's

                MACKRELL           That's right.    I was aware of that
     11.14
                                   obviously that the, that Dr

                                  behalf and correspondence he had

                                  he often led in to the Local

                                  Authority and obviously it was

                                  implicit the other way because

                                  often when the local Authority

                                  would write to me, they would

                                  automatically copy to Dr EASTWOOD.

                                  Yes.    Cfti I see, that ..., that

                                  explains something to me, yes.

                                  Okay.   We talked, sorry ...

                                  I wonder whether I should also

                                  simply mention in relation to a

                                  comment you made earlier.     The

                                  one of the early meetings between

                                  the Officer Working Party and the

                                 Club, Dr EASTWDQD was present,
    11.53
                                 and there is actually specific

                                 reference in those minutes to the

                                 fact that it was recognised that

                                 entrances, exits, gangways etc

                                 were not one hundred per cent in

                                 keeping with the guidelines.     So

                                 all parties including the, the

                            it was a meetings, minutes of a

            DSU61          So that's before it's actually

                           licensed?

                           Yes.    This was in the initial

                           within those minutes?

                          Ify understanding from having spoken

                           to Dr EASTWOOD on these, on this

                          subject in the past, is that the

                          the guide was always recognised

                          as a guide.

        DSU61             Yes.

12.42
                          Not as a statutory certainty

                          as it were, and not something that

                          had to be conplied with in terms

                          of the absolute strict level of

                         with those in the Guide.    He

                                   there were aspects of the ground

                                   which didn't ccnply and they put at

Q                                  it's also there, it talks about

                              3rd of June 1981 (030681) to the

                              Secretary of the Football

                             Association, Mr CROKER.     Are you

                              aware that paragraph 3 of that letter,

                              I think it is, sorry paragraph 2,

                             as you were, paragraph 2 , refers to

                             the crushing in the Leppings Lane,

                             and overcrowding.     Have, have you

                             ever seen that letter?

           MACKRELL          No.

           DSU61
                             Have you any knowledge of the content

                             of the letter which I mean it talks

                             about the capacities that are laid

                             down for the ground and in particular

                             the capacities for the North West

                            Stand and including the terrace,

                            North West terrace sorry not Stand,

                            North West Terrace as ten thousand

                            one hundred.     You've never seen that

                            letter at all?

       MACKRELL             No I have not, no.     I'm not certain

                            that actually had been copied through

                            to the, to the Club.

                            It may well not have been its ...

       MACKRELL             Not from that point, obviously it's

                            not, I it's not noted as being copied

                            through to Sheffield Wednesday

                           Football Club so I'm, it may not have

                           actually ever got to ...

            DSU61
                               No, you're quite right, it did in

                               fact go to the Council but not, it's

                               not marked up.   If you can refer to

                               the next Document, these are all in

                              crushing in 1981 (000081) Mr MACKRELL.
            MACKRELL          Yeah.

            DSU61
                              If I can refer you to the bottom

                              of that, the front of that letter,

                              dated the 5th of June 1981 (050681).

                              So far as I can see this is not a DPP

                              Document for the audio but it's a
17.03
                              letter, say, from from South Yorkshire

                             Police to Mr VScGEE, Item B of that

                             letter talks about Leppings Lane

                             and it not being constructed to give

                             maxinwm aid to packing and the

                             control of the crowd and the

                             accepted crowd capacity is such

                             that there is no safety margin,

                             and in fact allied to that is

                             another non DPP Document which is

                             dated the 16th of April 1981

                             (160481) which appears to be a

                            Document is scored out but that,

     17.50
                                   that Document does in fact refer

                                   to crushing which occurred at the

                                   lappings Lane end of the ground in

                                   1981 (000081), and goes on to say

                                  that further investigation in, into

                                  making it more comfortable, it

                                  being the terraces, presumably,

                                  should be looked into.    Now that

                                  D°cument is signed b y Mr Mr-rare


%                                 Presumably, well the the Board minute

                                  is pre, predates the letter to the

                                  to Mr McGEE, but presumably both

                                 those Documents would be on the

                                 Football Club files?

    18.28       MACKRELL
                                 They should have been on the

                                 Football Club, I 'm not saying

                                 they're not, I had, I didn't have

                                 a copy of the correspondence, from

                                 obviously one looks at the situation

                                 at there'd been.   Mr ENGLAND was

                                 Secretary at that time, who retired

                                 in 84 (000084), Mr CHESTER was then

                                Secretary for a period of three

                                years, before I took over.    I have

                                not seen this document until after

                                the events.

             D5U61              I see. So, I mean, how how much of

                                an examination of the files would

                                you have carried cwt?
MACKRELL               GRAHAM    HENRY


18.59       MACKRELL              I did an examination but quite

                                  honestly an examination may not

                                  have gone back, it got some of the

                                  relevant documents was, were there,

                                 but when one looks at it, I think

                                 is transpired as a result of these

                                 investigations, certain things have

                                 happened like EASTWOODS had seme of

                                 m y copies of documents and it's been

                                 an amalgam of the, of them both.     It

                                 m a y be that this might have been

                                 held personally by Mr MbGEE but it

                                 wasn't something which I had a

                                 copy of.

           DSU61                 When we're talking about these

                                 files, what what are we actually

                                 talking about in terms of volume,

                                 I mean are we talking about one

                                sort o f . ..

           MACKRELL             We're talking about I would think

                                antici..., we're talking about

                                filing, filing cabinets, virtually

                                equivalent probably to a filing

                                cabinet full.

        DSU61                   One filing cabinet four drawer

                                full.

        MACKRELL                That, I would anticipate that.

                                Because obviously if one's talking

                                about the correspondence that goes
 MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


                               for a sirrple, thing like roofing the

                               K PP*   You're talking about a massive

                               amount of correspondence b y way of

                               tender documents and plans and

                              drawings and revisions to sane

                              and such.

20.01       DSU61
                              I mean you obviously went through

                              the Safety Certificate...

            MACKRELL          Yeah.

            DSU61
                              you've talked about that?

            MACKRELL          Yeah.

            DSU61
                              An d raising queries in fact from

                              it?

            MACKRELL          Yeah.

            DSU61
                             What I 'm, what I'm really getting
20.14
                             at is, seeing if you'd seen seme

                             of this or were aware of this

                             crushing in 1981 (000081)...

        MACKRELL             No.

        DSU61
                             Would that have sort of flagged

                             up to you that there, there was,

                             there had been previous problems,

                             but that that was an area that may

                             need to be looked at in the future

                             so far as you're concerned, and

                            again I'm thinking about your

                            role as the Safety Officer here.

        MACKRELL            Yeah.

        DSU61               You see, you've got, you've got
  MACKRELL               GRAHAM HENRY


                                    a role which is laid down quite

                                    clearly.

              MACKRELL              Yeah sure.     You're actually

                                    obviously talking, having not seen

                                    it, one could, I was in a situation

                                   where this happened five and a half

                                   years prior to I joined the Company.
             DSU61                 I accept that.

  20.52      MACKRELL
                                   As a, and as a result of that I think

                                   it would be reasonable to assume on

                                   a personal basis that items that

                                   had transpired    chi   that, had been

                                   dealt with to the satisfaction of of

                                   the relevant parties.

             DSU61
                               Mn.      if you had of seen them do you

                               think it would of, would of flagged

                                     a warning sort of in the back of

                               your brain would then, this is an

                               area I've got to keep an eye on.

                               That type of thing?

          MACKRELL
                               I    can only conjecture on that, I can't

                               really state categorically frcm that

                               situation, I can only really see it

                               as I have seen it at the Club.

          DSU61
                              Mn.      I see.     Can vre perhaps move on

                              to the next Document then M r

GRAHAM HENRY


        from Chief Superintendent HAROLD, I

        think it's HAROLD, it may be HERALD,

        of the South Yorkshire Police to his

       Assistant Chief Constable, paragraph

        4 of that, and I appreciate that it

        is a Police ccmnunication so it won't

       be on your files, I h o p e .   Paragraph

       4 of that refers to the crushing

       that took place on the West Stand and

       the, the report reads,    'I've informed

       Mr ENGLAND that our consensus view

       is that the ten thousand one hundred

       crowd figure specified in the Safety

       Certificate is too high.'

       Understandably he refutes this and

       defends the position b y stating that

       the former capacity prior to the

       implementation of the Safety of

       Sports Ground Act, at Hillsborough

       in December 1979 (001279) was

       eleven thousand one hundred, and

       that on a number of occasions in

       previous all ticket matches the

       terracings had accomnodated that

       number.    Certainly at the 1980

       (000080)   Semi-Final when ws had again

       again had a capacity of fifty

       thousand one hundred and seventy

       four, he also had sane hundreds of
MACKRELL               GRAHAM HENRY


                               forged tickets and he goes on to

                               talk about the forged tickets.     Was

                               that information reflected in the

                               files that are held b y the Club and

            MACKRELL          No sure I can't, well I can't, I

                              can't obviously if i can't, I didn't

                              see one, I didn't really see the

                              correspondence that related to the

                              1981 (000081) crushing.     I assume
23.16
                              obviously and fran reading of that

                              if the Police had thought

                              particularly strongly on the subject

                              it would have been raised with the

                             Advisory Group when one's talking

                             about the capacities as set down on

                             the Safety Certificate.

           DSU61             Unfortunately I mean, they, they do

                             appear to have written to the then

                             Council controlling the Group about

                             the safety capacity, sorry in the

                             crowd capacity in the West terrace

                             being too high, that's as far as they

                             were concerned, within the certificate,

                             but unfortunately the matter doesn't

                             appear to have been pursued then by

                            either party.   You, you're saying

                            you're not aware of that?

        MACKRELL            I wasn't aware of that obviously,
  MACKRELL           GRAHAM HENRY


                             I have been aware of it subsequent

                             to the events of 15th of April 1989

                             (150489).

             DSU61          Are you - sorry Mr MACKRELL?
 24.07
                             I know, I was going to comment that

                             I noticed that there was a a meeting

                            at the stadium of the Officer Working

                            Party on the 8th June when M r HERALD

                            was present among others, and there

                            isn't any mention of anything

                            raised at the minutes of that meeting.
             DSU61          This is June nineteen?

                            End of June 81 (000081).

             DSU61          I mean presumably this, this

                            recorded date of the 30th of

                           April, obviously it was dealt

                           with preceeding that date, even

                           according to the Board report, the

                           Board minutes I should say, not the

                           Board report.   it was dealt with,

                           was being dealt with very quickly

                           after, if the, if the Semi-Final

                           was on the 11th of April

                           (interruption) it may well not be

                           the case, you know, that they dealt

                           with it then. (Pause)

                          Dealing with the alleged crushing

                          in 1987 (000087) and 1988 (000088)

                          and I do accept that the evidence
  MACKRELL               GRAHAM HENRY


                                 in regard to that crushing is

                                 fairly tenuous.

              MACKRELL          Yeah.

  25.10       DSU61             It comprises basically of a

                                couple of letters fron supporters

                                saying that they were crushed and

                                some statements frcm supporters in

                                particular areas on the West Terrace

                                and of course that's after the

                                disaster had taken place anyway.

             MACKRELL           Yeah.

             DSU61
                                You were actually in appointment

                                at the Club at that time...

             MACKRELL          Correct.    Yes.

             DSU61
                               and I know it was put to you at the,
 25.35
                               the Inquiry, but do you have any

                               knowledge of any crushing taking

                               place in 1987 (000087) or 1988

                               (000088)?

          MACKRELL             None whatsoever.

          DSU61
                               You've got no letters written to

                               you b y supporters who attended the

                               game...

          MACKRELL            No.

          DSU61
                              saying that they were crushed...?
25.50     MACKRELL            No.   I've dug through irty files

                              and I've kept individual files

                              which I think obviously have been

                              seen b y the individual, b y yourselves
  MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


                                in respect of each of the Semi-Finals

                                and I've kept correspondence on than,

                                that related and I've had a couple

                               of letters you knew, come, I've

                               kept what letters there are, and

                               there's been like letters

             DSU61
                               Crushing at all.   Not even elsewhere

                               in the ground?

             MACKRELL          No.

26.16        DSU61
                               Following these sort of matches,

                               I'm talking about Cup Semi-Finals

                              now, big matches, do the Board and

                              yourselves have any sort of a d e b . ..,

                              is there any sort of provision for

                              any debrief as to how it went, what

                              what w e learnt.

26.32    MACKRELL
                              I normally debrief m y departmental

                              heads after a big game and any

                              problem areas, anything that went

                              well, particularly well, might be

                              ineventive ...

         DSU61               Yes.

         MACKRELL            a few times, but we do have you

                             know, do try to, previously it was

                             on an informal basis obviously

                             subsequently after the events of
  MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


                                15th of April 1989 (150489) it's on a,

                                it's on a slightly more formal basis

                                than that.    But quite honestly I had

                               nothing, I had no feedback whatsoever

                               and I was surprised, obviously but

                               maybe I shouldn't be surprised you

                               know when things like that crop up

                               after another event, you know.
 27.14       DSU61
                               Yeah.     Do you keep any minutes of

                               those debriefs or are they sort of

                               an informal debrief?

             MACKRELL         Not as then, now I do.
27.30        DSU61
                               I see.    Were you or the Club ever

                              informed of crushing and injuries

                              b y either the Police or staff,

                              St John's Ambulance or your own

                              staff or the St John's Ambulance

                              Brigade that occurred at those

                              matches?

         MACKRELL             No.

27.43    DSU61
                              So you, as far as you're concerned

                             up until Hillsborough happens and

                             the disaster in April 1989 (000489)

                             you ve got really no, no knowledge

                             of of any problems on those

                             terraces at all?

         MACKRELL            That's correct.

         DSU61
                             You concede that the Club hadn't

                             knowledge within its system of,
MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY
                                                                  76


                              that there had been problems

                              certainly in 1981 (000081) I mean

                              it was also suggested there was

                              a problem in 1956 (000056).    Do

                             your records go back as far as

                             that?

28.11      MACKRELL
                             Well they obviously the Club, the

                             statutory records of the Conpany

                             vrould go back from that, I can

                             only reiterate that I didn't see

                             the correspondence relating to 81

                             (000081), and having read the,

                             having read the correspondence

                             now with hindsight which obviously

                             I accept as perfect signs, if

                            there had been any strong feeling

                            on the matter or the police had had

                            perfect opportunity by way of the

                            Advisory Group to draw it to their

                            attention and ask for and usually

                            m y experience with, with the

                            Advisory Groups or with ever in

                            within Football is if Et>lice

                            are adamant they want something

                            done, they regard it as a matter

                            of safety, it usually gets done.

        DSU61              An d of course they're licensed

                           to inspect the ground, .anyway

                           aren't they and under title Safety

                               of Sports Ground Act and in fact

                               they can go to the Council and,

                               in fact they can prevent you fron ...

 28.59      MACKRELL
                              T h a t 's it and also b y w ay of the

                              Police, if the Police for exanple

                              cane to me, when the fixtures are

                              published and they don't want us

                              to play a particular team, they

                              want an early morning kick-off

                              for example on a Boxing Day

                              morning.   I can turn round and

                              argue the toss m ay be, I might

                              say, hang on that's being a bit

                             unreasonable for people who've

                             got to travel, but ultimately

                             I know that if push came to
29.21
                             shove, the Police could go to

                             the local Authority and it could

                             be imposed upon me.

         DSU61               Yes.

         MACKRELL            So therefore you know the Police

                             are quite conscious of their own

                             conscious of their powers, should

                             they need, should they need to

                             need to utilize them.

         DSU61              Fair enough.    Do you think if

                            if you had of known about these,
 MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


                               I mean you obviously had a limited

                               knowledge of 1981 (000081) fran

                               what you're saying, but no great, no

                               great knowledge and it was before

                              your tome anyway, you, you assumed it
 29.48
                              had been dealt with.     Do you think

                              if you had of known about the

                              crushing in 1987 (000087) and 1988

                              (000088), such as it was, would,

                              would it have flagged up that there

                              was a problem there in regard to

                              capacity or would you have I mean

                              expected the Police to highlight

                              that to you anyway o r . ...

            MACKRELL          Well actually I can only, you know,

                              it sounds a bit simplistic only

                              saying yes I would see it, regard it

                             to capacity, you know, I could

                             obvious, obviously.

            DSU61            You might new, you wouldn't

                             necessarily then.

         MACKRELL            Exactly from that point of view and
30.15
                             also the fact is that the Police

                             after the 87 (000087) and 88

                             (000088) semi-final never at all

                             came to me and told m e that there

                             were any, there were any problems

                             with the w a y that the, that the

                             actual, the great game had been run
MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


                              for want of a better word.

            DSU61             Okay, that's fair enough.     If we

                              can move on now to deal with the
30.34
                              Green Guide.    In your statement

                             and in your transcript of evidence

                             you've conceded that you have

                             knowledge of the Green Guide 1976

                              (000076) from your previous

                             occupations in Bournemouth and

                             iAiton Town Football Club.     Is

                             that?

           MACKRELL          Yeah.

30.52      DSU61             Is that.   How far does that

                             knowledge extend, and to scne

                             extent we've, I knew we've touched

                             on this earlier...

           MACKRELL          Sure.

           DSU61             in this interview b u t. ..

           MACKRELL          It extends, it extends obviously to

                             to certain elements that one regards

                            as, as you know the Club's

                            responsibility althought obviously

                            the Club ultimately is, you know, is

                            responsible for certain areas.

                            However in the same w a y at Luton

                            Town they errployed a c o n s ..., a firm

                            of consultants to to handle...

        DSU61               Safety Engineers?

        MACKRELL            On this occasion it was architects.
  MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


             DSU61              Yes.

             MACKRELL           Bat you know on the same, same

                               principle obviously for that, to

                                actually handle the negotiations

                                for any safety work that was

                               required at, required at the ground

                               and I think you'd find that this

                               is quite normal amongst footballing

                               clubs.

 31.36       DSU61
                               Yes, yeah.   But as a result of all

                               that work, how much knowledge

                               would you get of the Green Guide

                               and I'm talking about the 76

                               (000076) Green Guide at the

                               moment?   For example would you,

                              would you recognise that tunnel

                              elevations or elevations on the

                              terraces, barrier configurations,

                              heights, height of barriers, this

                              type of thing all had a bearing

                              on crowd capacity in that area?

         MACKRELL             Sure, I under... I understand what

                              you're saying, but I can only, risk

                              of sounding of repeating myself
32.14                         state that obviously w e had

                              employed a ccrnpany to handle this

                              technical, I'm not qualified to

                              judge the scale and the rate of

                              slope on the terrace.   I think
 MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


                               you knew, it would be beyond

                               m y technical remit to to do so and

                               therefore as as a Club w e ertploy

                               a Company to handle this on our

                               behalf.

             DSU61
                               I accept what you're saying,

                               that you depend, what you're

                              saying is you depended on

                              EASTTOOD to advise you of that,

                              EASlvflDODS the Ccmpany.

            MACKRELL          Yeah.

            DSU61             But, I mean you you, by virtue

                              of what you were doing with the

                              Engineers that you pre... in

                              previous, or the architects in

                              your previous enplayments, you

                             would, you would have read the

                             Green Guide, you would know what

                             the Green Guide said, and after

                             all you're the Safety Officer.

            MACKRELL         Sure.

            DSU61            As well as being the Secretary.

        MACKRELL             Yeah.

33.00   DSU61                N o w what I'm seeking to sort

                             of pursue is, would you by

                             virtue of your own knowledge

                             of the, of the Green Guide have

                             seen the relevance of those

                             different areas, barrier configur-
MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


                              ations the height of the barriers,

                              and those sort of things, in

                              relation to crowd capacity?

           MACKRELL           I'm aware of what obviously

                             the implications of the, of

                             barrier configurations etc

                             and what's obviously requirements

                             are for a safety matter but I

                             can only repeat there is

                             basically on that, that amount,

                             that type of work, the technical

                             aspects of the work, those are

                             handed over to Consulting

                            Engineers who handle that

                            matters on our behalf, and whilst

                            I hear what you say about the

                            Green Guide, the Green Guide

                            actually is still, at this

                            moment in tune a Guide to such,

                            and obviously matters then are

                            negotiated to the, to the

                            satisfaction, obviously of the

                            Licensing Authority, otherwise

                            the license would not, would

                           not have been granted.

       DSU61               No I accept that, but you see

                           what I'm getting at is that

                           with the knowledge of the Green

                           Glide 1976 (000076) and with
 MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


                               the knowledge of the crushing

                               albeit that it was a limited

                               knowledge in 1981 (000081) and

                              you have said in fact that you

                              assume that that had been
34.10
                              dealt with.     Capacity and danger

                              of people on terraces, the dangerous

                              of people being overcrowded onto

                              terraces must be something that's

                              very much forefront in your mind?

            MACKRELL
                              Obviously crowd, crowd safety.
            D5U61            As safety officers.
34.25       MACKRELL
                              Safety, safety at the ground is

                             obviously paramount on anybody's

                             mind in r e . . in resolve of that

                             situation.     And Sheffield Wednesday

                             have never been kind of slow to

                             actually spend a great deal of

                             money on safety and inproving

                             their ground, but with regard

                             to the actual technical aspects

                             of it, I understand the

                             implications of the technical

                            aspects but I can only just

                            repeat that I had to leave that

                            to somebody who was more qualified

                            to deal with it.

        D5U61               Yeah but I mean the... okay then,

                            but did you ever say to that person
 MACKRELL              GRAHAM    HENRY


                                  who was more qualified to deal

                                  with it, look I have a knowledge

                                  of the Green, this this, this is my

                                  the extent of my knowledge of

                                  the Green Guide.    Now it occurs

                                  to m e that there ma y be a problem

                                  on the West Stand because of the

                                 barriers, they're not spaced if

                                 you like, if the spacing doesn't

                                 accord with the Green Guide which

                                 says, talks about maximum spacing of

                                 one point one metre, for example.
            MACKRELL             Yeah.

            DSU61
                                 Will you have a look at it, you

                                 see...

35.17       MACKRELL
                                 Yeah.    With respect, I you know, I

                                 hear what you're saying but with

                                respect if I'm employing a company

                                of Consulting Engineers to do that

                                I'm hardly gonna go around with

                                the tape measure, measuring that

                                and the theodolite measuring

                                the slope, I'm taking a

                                reputable company of Consulting

                                Engineers to handle that on our

                                behalf.    They understood the

                                implications of what they were

                            doing, because they understood

                            that they vrere acting on our
  MACKRELL           GRAHAM    HENRY


                                behalf to handle those matters

                                and previous correspondence

                                that I think is common to all

                                parties is there to show that

                                they were doing this, and you

                                know, I I think that really

                               you are expecting a lot to

                               say that I'm going to go down

                               and do, study technical matters

                               when I'm employing a company

                               to handle those on m y behalf.

             DSU61
                               No, I'm not, let's be quite

                               clear, I'm not actually

                               suggesting that, that you

                               should have done that, what

                               I'm suggesting is that with

                               the knowledge of it.   You see

                              EASTWOODS seem to be acting,

                              reacting to to what you put

                              to them. In other words you have

                              to ask them, pro-active if you
36.20
                              like aren't they?   So what the

                              point I'm making is, that unless

                              you went to them, it appears to

                              me that from what Dr EASTWOOD

                              said, although I accept that you

                              and Dr EASTWOOD do do vary slightly

                              in your understanding of what his

                              role was, the the matter would




                                                                    8 0 0

                                attention?

 36.38       MACKRELL
                                Well obviously it would have

                               been brought to the attention

                                for the Local Authority, by

                               the way the Club was licensed

                               in the first place and the Club

                               are granted and granted a

                               licence under the Safety of

                               Sports Grounds Act to Sheffield

                               Wednesday under that configuration.
            DSU61
                               Okay then, well I think you'll see

                               the the relevance of of what I'm

                              talking about as we go into

                              the interview.
36.56
                              I think it's right to say that

                              that EASTWDOD initially

                              calculated the capacities and

                              he alone calculated the

                              capacities in terms of, of

                              applying for a licence for those

                              capacities the under the

                             certificate but I'm not quite

                             clear, I must say, whether you're

                             referring to the spacing of the

                             barriers having regard to the

                             effect on capacity or whether

                             you re referring to for exanple

                             the height of the barriers not

                            being exactly as suggested in

                            the Green Guide.

 37.26      DSU61
                           Well both, according to the Green

                           Guide, have a bearing on the

                           capacity that can be allowed in

                           that pen.    But I mean we're not

                           talking about now, I I'm talking at

                           the moment generally, when the Club

                           got the certificate which is

                           before M r MACKRELL'S tine anyway.

                           Yes.

            DSU61
                           And this is part of the difficulty

                           if you like with this Inquiry,

                          that seme of the stuff that I

                          have to put to him, is in fact
37.47
                          before his time, but of course as

                          Safety Officer, when he takes

                          over this role in 1986 (000086),

                          to some extent he he has to accept

                          the responsibility that goes

                          with that and what was done in

                          the past.    Now in fact it would

                          probably be easier if we, if we

                         move on, because you'll see why,

                         why -1 was sort of concentrating

                         on that a little bit because in

                         1981 (000081) and 1985 (000085)

                         there were radial fences erected

                         in the West Terrace, those those




                                                                      80
  MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


                                fences in fact, the first ones in

                                1981 (000081), divided the terrace

                                into three, the 1985 (000085) ones

                                sub-divided the central pen into

                               what is now pens 3, 4 and the

                               void area, pen 5.     N o w those

                               fences in effect, reduced again

                               the, the area that was available

                               if you like, the m e t . .. the number

                               of square metres that were

                               available on that terrace.      Do

                               you accept that?

             MACKRELL
                               X accept that, you know, they they

                               obviously must, in that it's a

                              matter of fact.

             DSU61
                              What what, what knowledge have you

                              got of that, I mean was that some­

                              thing that you would again, again

                              see on the ... (Overtalking)
39.11    MACKRELL
                              C*ily from the correspondence, yeah,

                              I was ... on the 85 (000085) it is,

                              it was that the radial fences were

                              put in at the request of South

                              Yorkshire Police to assist with crowd

                             control.

         DSU61               Yes.

         MACKRELL            Control measures.
39.24    DSU61               Yeah.     So that's 1981 (000081)

                             in fact I think you, you probably
  MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


                                   know that the 1981 (000081)

                                   fences were put in, as you say

                                   at the request of the Police and

                                   to prevent the lateral novanent

                                   that they thought might have

                                   caused the crushing in 1981

                                   (000081) so that was, that was

                               what I was looking for earlier

                               on actually.     But, the 19... and the

                               1985 (000085) one was to, to do

                               with segregation and more so than

                               packing if you like in the terraces

                               •   •   *




             MACKRELL          Yeah.

             DSU61
                              but obviously they, they reduced the

                              the area that was available on

                              the terraces, now, I irean, it
 40.04
                              goes on from there, as it, as it

                              did reduce the, the area would you

                              have expected EASTWOODS, as the Club

                              Safety Engineers, to point out to

                              the Club the effects of the

                              erection of those radial fences

                              on the crowd capacity and the

                              fact that it had implications

                             in fact ultimately for the

                             Safety Certificate?
40.23    MACKRELL
                             I would expect a ccnfcination of

                             EAS1*KX)DS and the Local Authority,
  MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


                                rather like the ultimate

                                licensing authority who would have

                                had to have given permission for

                                that work to have been undertaken

                               in the first place.

             DSU61
                               And indeed they did.

             MACKRELL           ....?
             DSU61
                               I mean that, that's ccimon ground

                               that they they did that, but at, at

                               the present moment, you see we've

                               got a situation where the, the

                               area was reduced and we're still

                               left with the, with the Safety

                              Certificate, Schedule 3 unamended

                              fcy the local Authority and I accept

                              that that's their problem but the,

                              the ground, the Club itself also

                              have some responsibility and again

                              when you take it over in 1986

                              (000086)...

         MACKRELL             Yeah.
41.04    DSU61
                              you take on those responsibilities

                              on behalf of the Club and it appears

                              that nothing was done about trying

                             to amend those certificate, no

                             nobody recognised it.
41.13   MACKRELL             Yeah, but a lot of capacities

                             that are on Safety Certificates

                             with respect, are not done to the,
   MACKRELL         GRAHAM HENRY


                            to the letter, to the actual letter

                            of the law.   There is an element

                            that's taken into account, because

                           when the Kop was done, they, the

                           capacity was technically they could

                           have had more then twenty one

                           thousand on the Kop, the Local

                           Authority chose at that stage not to

                           grant the capacity for more than

                           twenty one thousand on the Kop

                           because of the flows, but they weren't

                           quite happy with licensing as large

                          an area as that and so that it was

                          took, and in fact there's a reference,

                          I think again which we pointed at to

                          previously on when querying about

                          the capacity of the Kop, can this

                          be raised up, because it was in

                          at twenty one thousand, could have

                         been higher, so there is the element

                         obviously that within those type of

                         capicities, there is slack to be

                         taken up.

                         What you're talking about is an

                                approved b y the Officer Wbrking

                                Party and b y the Local Authority,

                                it's reasonable to, to act o n that

              DSU61
                                And you're also sort of saying as

                                well, I understand, that you, this

                                ma y only have been taken up the

                                safety margin that there may have

                               been in that pen anyway.
              MACKRELL
                               Well that's right.     Well one, I

                               think one's entitled to assume that

                               that has been considered.
 42.42    DSU61
                               Well fair enough.     Okay.   Can we move

                               on to deal with the m o . .., the

                               reduction in the barrier 144 and again

                               we mentioned this earlier on, which

                               was just before you joined the

                               Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

                               I accept that this was as a result

                              of the request from the Police, but

                              do you recall noting any

                              correspondence on the file in

                              relation to the work when you

                              arrived and examined the files?

         MACKRELL             No.

43.04    DSU61
                              So when was the first time it came
      MACKRELL               GRAHAM HENRY                                      93


                                     to your notice that this barrier

                                     had been removed?

                  MACKRELL           It, obviously, one looks at the

                                     ground and sees the situation.      The

                                     implications of the removal of the

                                    barrier were obviously not drawn to

                                    one's attention until until after the

                                    events of 15th of April 1989 (150489)
     43.23
                                    but it was right that one can see


%                                   that the request was made by, I think

                                    it was Mr CALVERT, of the South

                                    Yorkshire Police at the time, at

                                    a meeting of the group on the ground

                                    at which John STRANGE of EASTWOOD and

                                    Partners was present and permission

                                   was given by the Advisory Group to

                                   to remove that that barrier. (Buzzer)

                 DSU61
                                   I see.   The buzzer's just gone for

                                   the two minutes Mr MACKRELL.       This

                                   m a y be a suitable point I think for

                                   us to take a break from the interview

                                   we'll turn the, Mr TOPE will turn

                                   the interview, perhaps have a break

                                   and a cup of coffee and then we'll

                                   resume at a time to be agreed if

                                   that's okay with you.      Okay.

01.00                        Before vre concluded or terminated

                             the interview Mr MACKRELL we were

                             talking about barrier 144, and the

                             reduction in that barrier if you

                             can recall and I appreciate that

                             that was before your time at the

                             Club, although you joined the Club

                             I think in the December.
 MACKRELL               GRAHAM HENRY


             MACKRELL           Correct.

 01.22       DSU61
                                A r e you aware of what consultation

                                EASTWOOD, or what part of the

                               consultation EASTWDOD had in regard

                               to the removal of that barrier.

             MACKRELL          A s I understand it was a meeting of

                               the Working Party that took place

                               like a site meeting.

            DSU61              Inspection?

            MACKRELL
                               Yes, on the, on the terrace at at

                               the lappings Lane end.

            DSU61              Yes.

01.41       MACKRELL
                               A n d following on there was a request

                               from as I understand it, Inspector

                              CALVERT, frcm South Yorkshire Police

                              for the removal of the barrier to

                              assist with crowd control.

            DSU61
                              So you, you actually played no part

                              in it, you're presented with a fait

                              accompli, as it were, when you

                              joined the Club, that barrier's

                              been reduced?

         MACKRELL             That's right.

         DSU61
                              You see documentation on it

                              presumably?

         MACKRELL            Yeah, and obviously the fact it had

                             been dealt with at an Advisory Group,

                             at an Advisory Group meeting and so

                             obviously one assumed that that had
 MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


                               been sanctioned properly.
             DSU61
                               You didn't, did you, any thoughts go

                               through your mind about that having

                              any sort of bearing on the capacity

                              at all?

            MACKRELL          No.

            DSU61             Of the terrace?

            MACKRELL          No.

            DSU61
                              No.    You assumed that had been

                              dealt with frcm vdiat you said?

            MACKRELL
                              Obviously I felt that had been dealt

                              with because obviously all parties

                              were present.

02.35       DSU61
                             Yeah.    Do you accept that the fact

                             that the barrier 144 being removed,

                             has a bearing on the collapse of the

                             barrier 124a in the front of the,

                             in the front of that pen 3 ?

        MACKRELL
                             Well I'm not, I'm not a technical

                             expert and so obviously I'm not fully

                             aware, obviously I've seen the, I've

                             seen the the evidence that's been

                             produced, to kind of, that makes

                             that assumption, so obviously I

                            would concur with with that on the

                            basis but, you know, I don't have

                            any specialist knowledge on it.
        DSU61               You're talking now presumably

                            about the H.S.E. report are you?
 MACKRELL               GRAHAM HENRY


             MACKRELL           That's correct, yeah.

             DSU61              As the technical...

            MACKRELL            That's right.

            DSU61               sort of thing.      So whilst you

                               you've got no, what you're saying

                               is you've got no technical knowledge

                               of it, you accept their interpret­

                               ation of it, that it does have a

                               bearing?

            MACKRELL           Obviously I I've seen the report

                               and obviously they're the technical

                               experts.

            DSU61              You've never seen the significance

                               presumably of the, of that?

            MACKRELL           No.     (Pause)

03.45       DSU61
                               Yeah.    So it therefore follows that

                               you did take it for granted that

                               this would have been taken into

                              account b y the Officer Working Party

                              as it was then, the Officer Working

                              Group in consult... in consultation

                              with EASTWOODS, when the Club was

                              asked to carry out the work?

        MACKRELL              That's right, it was obviously

                              an actual meeting, it wasn't even

                              just a matter of like a letter to

                              the Working Party, actually was

                              they vrere physically present.

        DSU61                 Right.     (Pause).
  MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY

  04.31
                                Yeah the Club have a responsibility

                                to ensure that the safety of

                                supporters is a general responsibility

                                to ensure the safety of supporters

                                I think you, would you accept that?

             MACKRELL          Yes.

             DSU61             When they're on their premises?

             MACKRELL          Yes.

 04.44       DSU61
                               The reduction of that barrier,

                               without proper consideration, if you

                               like, for the safety implications,

                               and also accepting that there

                               was crushing in 1981 (000081),

                               1987 (000087) and 1988 (000088),

                               do you consider that the Club have

                              any responsibility for the riiwwi-ar

                              because of that?

05.08        MACKRELL
                              No I can't accept that because I

                              feel that the Club acted upon a

                              request frcm constituent members

                              of the Officer Advisory Group and

                              relied upon the advice of its own

                              Consulting Engineers and as a result

                              obviously it was a, you know I and I

                              feel that the Club under those

                              circumstances don't have a

                             responsibility.

05.29     DSU61              Right.    Now the next question is,

                             do you think with hindsight that
MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


                              E A S 1 W O D S should have given better

                              advice to the Club in regard to the

                              West terraces?

           MACKRELL           Possibility in hindsight, you know

                              one has to say if that is the

                              causation then possibly that is,

                              that may, that m a y be true but

                              obviously it is a situation and

                              not only EAS1WD0DS, it's the

                             Officer Working Party, the Building

                             Surveyor's Department, which, which

                             also sanction that work to to take

                             place.

05.54      DSU61             So what you're saying is they all

                             have a, is it, they all have a

                             responsibility, some responsibility

                             for what took place?

           MACKRELL          I believe so, yes.

                             I think if I m a y say so, the

                             question assumes that no

                             consideration of the safety aspect

                             was given and that doesn't

                             necessarily follow and the question

                             also assumed I think, did have an

                             effect on causation which will also

                             be a technical issue.      So I think ...

           DSU61             Mr MACKRELL is, is aware of the

                             contents of the H.S.E. report?

                             Yes and the TAYLOR report indeed.
 MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


             DSU61             Which is, and the TAYLOR report

                               sort of amplifies that, that that

                               it did in fact have a bearing on

                               o n the collapse of the barrier, so

                               I think that's a reasonable

                               supposition or assumption to mate.

                              Yes.    I think you m a y find that there

                              will be experts who m a y disagree with

                              it, it's the only point I I'm making.

             DSU61            (Mi, I see.

 06.45                        It's a matter which will no doubt

                              be aired in court in due course

                              in civil proceedings in any event

                              but I merely make the point that

                              I know, I believe that Dr EASTWOOD

                              doesn't agree that his removal

                              had had an effect on causation.

                              Whether he's right or not is

                              a different matter.

            DSU61             Oh, I see.

                              But, I mean, I accept that the

                             H.S.E. report and the TAYLOR

                             report do mate certain corrments

                             about it.

            DSU61            Is there anything you want to

                             say about that Mr MACKRELL?

            MACKRELL         No, certainly not.

07.14       DSU61            Are EASTWOODS still retained

                             b y the Club as Safety Engineers?
MACKRELL               GRAHAM HENRY


            MACKRELL           Yes.

07.22       DSU61
                               Did you ever ask Dr EASTWOOD for

                               a full safety survey of the ground

                              or ever mention to the Board of

                              Directors that this was desirable

                              or necessary?

            MACKRELL          No.     Under the terms of the

                              Safety Certificate he has to

                              do a visual inspection of the

                              ground which he obviously has done

                              and lodged with the Local

                              Authority, done with the Local

                              Authority, so nothing further

                              than that was done.

           DSU61
                             As I understand it, in fact he

                             carries out an inspection pre­

                             inspection b y the Local

                             Authority?

           MACKRELL          Yeah, a lot of the kind of barrier

                             testing work and things like that

                             which is obviously...

        DSU61                That's right.

        MACKRELL             required to be done is done in

                             advance of the annual inspection.

                             That as it was done now that the

                             situation has changed slightly

                             in that they've brought forward

                            the period, the inspection period,

                            to a more logical time, at the end

                          ground generally each year and he

                          reported to the Club and he

                          didn't for example just inspect

                           that.   He was the only independent

                           duty b y the Club.   That's absolutely

                           right, the Club would have had no

                          reason to suppose that he wasn't

                          carrying out his duties properly,

                          particularly in light of the fact

                          that he was liaising, he was the

                          interface with the Officer Wbrking

                          Party etc.   As to the other than

                          structural and expertise aspects,

                          if you like, the general Green

                          Guide aspect, again I think if

                          you look at the evidence that was

                          given b y Mr LOCK at the Inquiry.

           DSU61          Yes.

                          and in his statement, he was

                         quite clear that he was, he had

                         full knowledge of the Green

                         Guide, it was something in

                         which he had taken a particular

                         interest and he inspected the

                         ground and made certain

                         recommendations after he was

                         appointed, matters relating to

                         fire extinguishers and that

                         accessibility to them etc,

                         so he was looking at it frcm

                         that point of view.




                                                                          8

                               He also made some recommendations

                               in regard to hoardings that

                              were blocking the perimeter

                               fences I believe and things

                              like that.

                              Indeed he did, yes.

               DUS61
                              I mean, his, his, his role was

                              not as a Safety Officer, it was

                              as a Security Officer.


m   12.35      DSU61
                              Yes.

                              I mean, what, what that begs

                              the question if he knew about

                              the non conformation, non

                              conforming with the Green Guide

                             spacing of barriers and things

                             like that, in relation to

                             tunnel elevations, in relation

                             to width of perimeter gates,

                             I I would suggest this is an

                             interview of Mr MACKRELL so

                             I hesitate to actually take

                             the dialogue too far but I would

                             suggest that the evidence points to

                            the fact that everybody considered

                            that those were technical issues,




                                                                         82 2

                              the exact height of a barrier, Dr

                             EASTWOOD had strong views about

                             that.

           DSU61             Mn.

13.18
                             The spacing between barriers, the

                             angle between barriers, all of

                             these were regarded as technical

                             matters on which Dr EASTWOOD

                             was was the man to speak.

           DSU61             Right.

                             •And who had to negotiate and

                             reach agreement with the Local

                             Authority as to whether or not

                             the, the parameters of the Green

                             Guide were sufficiently net, if

                             I can put it that way.

           DSU61            Right yeah.

                            And that this appears as I mentioned

                            earlier frcm the initial meeting

                            with the Officer Working Party when

                            it was clearly recognised that there

                            were areas within the ground were

                            not quite within the parameters

                            laid down in the Guide, nevertheless

                            a decision was clearly made that

                            they were acceptable.

        DSU61               Would you agree with that Mr

                            MACKRELL?

           DSU61
                                 Yeah.     Okay.   Just as a matter of
14.09
                                 interest then, did you ever, with

                                 your knowledge of the Green Guide,

                                 did you ever note that the tunnel

                                 elevation in the West Stand was

                                 one in six as against the Green

           MACKRELL             No, I haven't, I haven't got the t e x . .

                                I wouldn't have the tex...,

                                it.

                                Could I again, I hesitate to

                                interrupt you, but could I just put

                                on record the fact that the one in

                                six calculation is one that we

                               would challenge.      If you, if one

                               actually___

        DSU61                  It's an approximation?

                               This would, it is an approximation,

                               and this was from Lord Justice

                               TAYIOR's Interim Report, and it is

                               is an approximation the exact figure

                               is a little different from that but

                               probably not a great deal turns on it.
        DSU61                  Okay.     Was that ever brought to

                                       I think we've talked about the

                                       barrier type and configuration

                                       at quite sane length together with
     15.03
                                      the height and spacing.     Presumably

                                      you appreciated that that did have

                                      a bearing, I think you've conceded

                                      that already, but you did appreciate

                                      that it had a bearing on the, on

                                      you were dependent, you were

            MACKRELL              Correct.

17.19       DSU61                With hindsight do you think that

                                 that you probably should have been

                                 able to monitor those capacities?

            MACKRELL             Well, I think hindsight is again

                                 is very difficult to content in

                                 hindsight, other than the fact is

                                 one possibly would question the

                                 Advisory Group's approval of the

                                 r a d . .. of the radial fence element on

                                 the, on the terraces which acted as a

                                 as a constraint.   And I think there

                                 becomes a balance again in

                                 hindsight, which one looks at it,

            DSU61                Mn.    You see I mean it's difficult

                                 you can't actually comply with

                                 Schedule 3 of the Safety Certificate

                                 strictly given the procedure of

                                 monitoring that you've got.

            MACKRELL             In respect of which way?

            DSU61                Well you, people can come in

                                 through A to G and go through the

                                 side gates and up into the West

                                 Stand.

           MACKRELL             Not without their tickets are

                                checked at the, at the point of

                                entry into the West Stand.

           DSU61                Yes.     What about going round if

                                they can't get into the North

                                Stand can they?

           MACKRELL             No.     The West Stand and Leppings

                                Lane are totally self contained.

18.46      DSU61                I see okay.     If I can refer you

                                to the plan b y EASTWOODS which

                                is I think your next Document,

                                Document Number 74 should be marked

                                in the margin.    That Document shows

                                the capacities of pens 3 and 4 as

                                twelve hundred and one thousand

                                capacities ever conveyed to you?

           MACKRELL             Conveyed by way of draw, there

                                were notes on drawing that they had

                                they didn't, they ware, I     I

                                understood them to be an

                                indication as opposed to because

                                obviously they weren't referred to

                                o n the Safety Certificate.

19.31      DSU61                Yes.   Is that what you were

                                querying, is it those figures

                                that were querying when you got

                               Sharon LANE to query?

19.39      MACKRELL             I was querying, I was querying the

                               whole aspects of of the, because

                               obviously one was, the Spion Kop was

                               obviously totally totally incorrect,

                               b y you know just by looking at it,

                               yo u knew the ground there was massive

                               of checking that at the same time.

                               But no I wasn't looking to to have, to

                               have the break down between individual

                               areas, no.     Because I was aware of

                               the fact that I it was, it was a

                               global figure as per the Safety

             DSU61             Fair enough.        So you, you never

                               actually checked those figures,

                               you just assumed that they were?

            MACKRELL          Yeah.

            DSU61             Okay, fair enough.        We've dealt with

                              the ...    The, same of the, of the

                              distinct to the one that you, I think

                              you made ...

            MACKRELL          Yeah.

            DSU61             personally, was as a request as

20.48       MACKRELL
                              Yeah.   No that's not quite correct,

                              there's there's a standard form that

                              is to be completed every year by

                             all football league Clubs which

                             actually just sets out details of

                             ground capacity is divided up to.

                             It's a, it's a guide which basically

                             is used to, when they're looking

           DSU61                 Yeah.

           MACKRELL              so that the team fills that in

                                 and it's mainly for use at

                                 teams lower down the scale in

                                m a y be non league but all Clubs,

                                all members of the FA have to

                                 fill it in.   And its to say how

                                the ground is situated, do you

                                have number of stands and things

                                like this, so it's mainly for

                                they can look at it and say that

                                Club isn't eligible to play

                                in the F A vase or FA trophy- but

                                it's, it's a, because obviously

                                Clubs or pretty much all Clubs

                                flood lights are in, are of a

                               good standard, but it still has

                               to like to write down like, for

                               example, the flood lightings ...

       °SU61                   yes.

                                to talk about here was the width
  23.48
                                of the perimeter fencing.     You may

                               be aware now, if you weren't aware

                               originally, that the Green Guide's

                               recommendation is one point one

                               metres whereas the gates in pens

                               3 and 4 respectively are point

                               a metre.

             MACKRELL          Yeah.

             DSU61             Was that something that was ever

                               brought to your attention at all?

             MACKRELL          Yeah, I was, I was aware of the

                              accepted them as being below

                              importantly they weren't a

                                        is a factor when canes to setting

                                       Yeah, you say that you were aware

                                 Executive calculation was based on

                                 recommendations laid down in the

                                 Green Guide 1986 (000086) which

                                 obviously was in force at the

                                 time of the disaster, shows that

                                the present capacity of those pens

                                The plan from EASTWDOD shows twelve

                                respectively which is something like

                                there should be.     In view of that,

                                do think that you should perhaps have

                                done something about having those

         26.44       MACKRELL           Well ... sure.   Obviously but when it

                                       I'm not saying I'm reliant upon

                                       on this, but they had an opportunity

                                       to do so and were often caning back

                                       on matters of minor things like

                                 late?

              MACKRELL           Yeah but we were both of the

                                opinion I think it's in n y

                                transcript that, comment, that

                                I discussed the matter with M r

                                M3LE ...

             DSU61              Yeah.

                                of South Yorkshire Police and we

                                were confident that the, the flow

                                rate could be achieved, you know,
 29.38
                                that the South Yorkshire Police though

                               were adamant that they was not going

                                to to use the Penistone Road

                               turnstiles.

             DSU61
                               You're confident that the flow rate

                               could be achieved...

         MACKRELL              Yeah.

         DSU61
                               assuming that people came over the

                               period from when the turnstiles

                               opened at twelve o'clock (1200 )

                               until three o'clock (1500)?

         MACKRELL              Correct.

29.54    DSU61
                               Did you ever take into account

                              the fact that they irey arrive late?

         MACKRELL             Well one has to take into account

                              but obviously one has to look at

                              the, the probability factor, which I
  MACKRELL           GRAHAM HENRY


                             think obviously an imbalance in

                             relation to balancing the fact there

                            might be what you state regarding

                            numbers to go through the turnstiles

                            against the prob... the potential

                            problems for segregation, or lack of

                            segregation, it was felt that this

                            was path to go down, and particularly

                            in view of the fact that in 1987

                            (000087) and 1988 (000088), the

                            situation had had operated

                            satisfactorily.

             DSU61
                            I was just going to ask you that
 30.26
                           actually.    The situation you used

                           the same number of turnstiles in

                           1988 (000088) and 1987 (000087)?
          MACKRELL
                           Exactly in 88 yes, exactly the same

                           configuration was operated for both

                           matches.
30.39     DSU61
                           Fair enough.   Did anyone consider

                           the imbalance between Liverpool with

                           23 turn..., Liverpool fans with

                           23 turnstiles and twenty four

                          thousand, two hundred and fifty six

                          supporters and Nottingham Forest

                          who had 60 turnstiles with twenty

                          nine thousand, eight hundred

                          supporters?
30.53    MACKRELL
                          Well obviously that was, that was
 MACKRELL              GRAHAM    HENRY


                                  the, that was the, that is the

                                  configuration of the ground, if you

                                  know whichever it happened it

                                  was that way, as again I can only

                                  repeat that in 1987 (000087) and

                                  1988 (000088) the situation was

                                  satisfactory.

            DSU61
                                 Cause it's obviously a matter that

                                 "the Liverpool supporters had

                                 complained about in 1988 (000088)

            MACKRELL
                                 No they complained about their

                                 allocation of tickets to the FA.

                                 To the turnstile ...

            MACKRELL
                                 About the, about the turnstiles,
            DSU61
                                you're quite right, you're quite
31.26
                                right.   Liverpool have a reputation

                                for late arrival at football grounds

                                which certainly now seems to be

                                quite well documentated,

                                documented.   Were you aware of that?
        MACKRELL
                                Liverpool have a reputation for a

                                lot of things at football grounds

                                and late arrivals is just one of

                                them.

        DSU61
                                Late arrival was one of them?
        MACKRELL
                            Late arrival, they do it, they, the

                            thing is late arrival unfortunately

                                   starts to become a canton factor

                                   within football.

             DSU61                 With other Clubs as well as

                                   Liverpool or?   (Overtalking)

             MACKRELL
                                   With with their own supporters from ..

                                   I think that one only has to go to

                                   grounds and one looks at the number I
 32.05
                                   think in the core document there is a,

                                  there's a document I referred to

                                  which monitors a home match with

                                  Manchester United which I think was

                                  in February of 89 (000089) prior to

                                  the event only just shows the build

                                  u p of the supporters, how they

                                  arrive at the ...

            DSU61                 Yes.

            MACKRELL              stadium, they come late.   I think

                                  like the control of alcohol acts

                                 people going in for a long, long

                                 discussion with this but the control

                                 of alcohol situation hasn't helped

                                 getting people into into stadia

                                 faster.

32.34    DSU61
                                 Knowing that, was that ever taken

                                 into account in the planning so

                                 far as you're concerned for the

                                 the 1989 (000089) Cup Semi-Final?

         MACKRELL                Well the situation is obviously that

                                 the opening hour, the opening of the




                                                                                  843

                                turnstiles, the closing is obviously

                                the kick off time.    One can open up,

                                one it's very, it's very hard to,

                               you can't force people to ccme

                               through turnstiles, you can't

                                force then to arrive, to arrive on

                               time.

 33.04       DSU61
                               Presumably the r e . .. that w h y was,

                               Penistone Road not utilised?

             MACKRELL          It was for segregation purposes.

             DSU61             And because presumably the Police,

                               the Police were controlling the

                               segregation side of it?
 33.16       DSU61
                               ®* 3t's right, Police did not want

                              visiting supporters, rather

                              visiting supporters say in

                              88 (000088) and 89 (000089) it

                              was Liverpool supporters in 87

                              (000087) it was Leeds supporters

                              caning onto Penistone Road because

                              then they would be mixing with the

                              other supporters which it was

                              Coventry in 87 (000087) and

                              Forest in 88 (000088) and 89,

                              (000089) mixing supporters on the

                              same road.

33.43    DSU61
                             When you and other members of your

                             staff realised that there was
 MACKRELL              GRAHAM    HENRY


                                  still a large number of Liverpool

                                  supporters missing from the

                                  terraces, from the ground, not

                                  necessarily the terraces, and you're

                                  approaching the kick off time,

                                  d id you then not think of opening

                                 or causing to be opened some of

                                 the other turnstiles, you know

                                 I mean did you equate, did you

                                 equate the fact that you're only

                                 using 23 turnstiles and maybe ... ?
34.02       MACKRELL
                                 Yeah, realistically I don't think

                                 one could have done.   I can't speak

                                 for the Polices, I can only speak

                                 as I see it.   The Police would be

                                 able to give you technical

                                information but in the same way as

                                they'v they've got the people to

                                cxme into the Leppings Lane end,

                                they closed off all the, all the

                                side roads which is called the

                                triangle area that goes off fzon

        DSU61                   Yes.

        MACKRELL                along along to the, to the main

                            Halifax Road and as a result of that

                                it there would have been, there

                            would have been no way of physically

                            getting those spectators externally
  MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


                                round to those turnstiles.
             DSU61              Yeah.

             MACKRELL
                                Because it was a conscious Police

                                effort to keep the supporters

                               away and you would have actually

                               broken down one system to try and

                               solve another.

             DSU61
                               Yeah, they could of, I mean there

                               are other, there are ways that the

                               Police could have achieved that,

                               had it been, been foreseen or or

                               noticed in tune.   I accept that

                               it m a y have upset their

                              segregation plan but I mean that's

                              a matter for the Police anyway.
         MACKRELL
                              That's right, no request of us

                              for that.

                              Did you ever notice, I mean you

                              did notice the, the uneven

                              distribution I think and the

                              fact that Nottingham Forest ...
         MACKRELL
                              I noticed that Nottingham Forest,

                             obvious Nottingham Forest people

                             had got there previously, were in

                             the ground.
35.21   DSU61
                             Okay.   Can ws go on to He;*! with

                             the ticket markings.

        MACKRELL             Yeah.

        DSU61
                             Again this is something which
  MACKREUj              graham    henry



                                      was dealt with at quite seme

                                      length during the tribunal and

                                      I don't really want to go, I can

                                   go into it in detail but I don't

                                   really want to go into it unless

                                   you are unclear about what I'm
  35.43
                                   getting at.    Was the ticket

                                  marking in 1988 (000088) and the

                                  turnstile marking the sane as

                                  in 1989 (000089)?

             MACKRELL             Yes.

             DSU61
                                  It was the same?

             MACKRELL             Yeah.

             DSU61
                                  So we've got this business of the

                                  turnstiles being narked A, C, B?
           MACKRELL              Yeah.

           DSU61
                                 2h e diagram on the back of the

          MACKRELL               Yeah.

          DSU61
                                 And the counterfoil on the ticket

                                 being marked for the West Stand

                                 anyway, B, which didn't necessarily

                                 accord with the, with the diagram.

                             But there was colour codings on

                             the ticket and outside the ground

                             there were signs in the sane col...,

           DSU61
                                I'm just looking as I'm talking to

                                you to see if I can see the colour

           MACKRELL
                                I'm looking at the red, the red,

        MACKRELL               Yeah.

        DSU61
                               The red markings by the door of the

                               turnstile marked C.    Presumably

                           the turnstiles to the left of

                           that are marked with a red sign

                           are they?
  MACKRELL               <2»HAM HENRY


              MACKRELL           No they're marked with the, the

                                 North, the North Stand.
              DSU61
                                Which was different from.

              MACKRELL
                                 I can't remember the colour of it

                                no.

              DSU61
                                That's fair enough.      The North

                                Stand.

             MACKRELL           Black.

             DSU61
                                Blue, red and brown.     Brown was the

                                West Stand.   Okay.    So what you're

                                saying is then that whilst they

                                they didn't exactly accord...
             MACKRELL          The colour coding...
             DSU61
                               the colour coding...

             MACKRELL          Yeah.

             DSU61
                               should have, but I mean that that

                               presupposes that the supporters

                               are gonna have enough intelligence

                               to to know which one to go down

                               if the...

         MACKRELL              Well yeah.

         DSU61
                               tickets are marked C and they're

                               trying to go through B.

         MACKRELL
                              Well the question on intelligence,

                              you know possibly question that

                              colour coding might be simpler

                              than the alphabet, you know and

                              I say that with respect.
38.26   DSU61
                              Fair enough.    I don't want to
  MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


                                 go as I say into too much detail

                                 about that because during your

                                 cross examine of it, your

                                examination in chief I think

                                in the Inquiry you conceded that

                                I think that was done b y Miss,

                                by                 your enployee

                                at your direction?

             MACKRELL           That's right, but I say I take

                               responsibility of obviously her,

                               for her actions.

 38.50       DSU61
                               Yeah.      I think you also concede

                               the wa y I read the transcripts

                               that it was less than desirable

                               the ticket markings was less than

                               desirable, the...

             MACKRELL
                               It m a y have been, I feel, but I I i

                              do believe it was a minor factor

                              and not something which was of

                              paramount importance.

         DSU61
                              Well that's that's something I'd

                              like to come back on you, at you
39.16
                              o n . ..   I ... do you think that the

                              confusion and same of the situation

                             that arose in Leppings Lane was

                             contributed to by virtue of the

                             ticket markings?

         MACKRELL            I don't believe so.

         D5U61               You deny that?
  MACKRELL               GRAHAM HENRY


              MACKRELL           Yes I do.

  39.33       DSU61
                                 It nust have had some bearing cm

                                 the flow through the turnstiles of

                                people are moving between turnstiles

                                and not sure which turnstiles to

                                go in and the evidence does seem

                                to, seem to suggest, quite

                                considerable evidence, that people

                                were unsure about where they

                                should be going.

             MACKRELL           Well you know, I can only, you

                                asked me the question and I can

                                only answer it as I see it.
39.55        DSU61
                                Do you think it was a significant

                                factor in the Police eventually

                               losing control and having to open

                               Gate, exit gates A, B and C to

                               avoid injury?

          MACKRELL
                               I don't believe so but I can't

                               obviously speak for the Police's

                               reasonings behind their opening

                               the gates.    (Pause)
40.20     DSU61
                               Having regard to the fact that

                               all tickets for Leppings Lane

                               Stand area were marked B,

                               supporters with these tickets

                              would automatically make for the

                              area B and be allowed through

                              that, through that turnstile
  MACKREUj              GRAHAM HENRY


                                that served the West terrace

                                tunnel.    Is that a reasonable

                                assumption?

             MACKRELL          No because as people go through

                               the terrace, they they disperse

                               down there and I think that as

                               they normally go through a flow

                               through a turnstiles it acts as

                               a regulator so they don't go

                               through in large volume and so

                               people can then move around.       I

                               hear what you're saying obviously

                              regarding the opening of the gate

                              where there's an influx of people

                              but under normal circumstances in

                              which people go through turnstiles

                              it acts as a regulator as people,

                              to control...

         DSU61
                              I will accept that, I think that's

                              general...

         MACKRELL             Yeah.

         DSU61
                              you know we're on common ground

                             with that...

         MACKRELL            Yeah.

         DSU61
                             But what I'm saying to you is
41.12
                             that, I mean first of all because

                             of the ticket markings, people

                             are likely to converge on, on

                               I would, I would perhaps argue,

                               that creates a back log exit in

                               lappings Lane and once they

                               get through then and they've got

                              a ticket marked B, which is for

                              the standing area, on the Wtest

                              terrace, then the first thing

                              that they see is this signing

                              A and B to the left and right of

                              the tunnel?

                              But if you accept that premise,

                              then the situation never occurred

                              in 1987 (000087) or 88 (000088)

                             when it was a similar to

                             configuration of the ground and

                             tickets.

        DSU61
                             It was exactly the same was it in

                             1988 (000088)?

        MACKRELL             Yes.

41.58   DSU61
                             In 1988 (000088) there was seme

                             evidence again from manbers of the

                             public that in the fact the police

                             had had to put a cordon across

                             those, across that tunnel and

                             that's a matter that's certainly

                            very arguably...

        MACKRELL            Sure, but but following on from

                            88 (000088), the Police never

                            raised any ccnment to m e regarding

             DSU61             3he fact that the, there is the

                               words 'Standing' in large letters

                               above the mouth of the tunnel

                               tends to confirm that the B

                              marking on the tunnel, marking

                              on the tickets, I mean that's

                              that's, they're all features

                              that the the central pens are

                              traditionally I understand

                              the best peak viewing area, the

                              best viewing area as far as the

                              fans are concerned.   You've

                              got a situation where you've got

                              a turnstile feeding directly

                              in to the concourse and

                              immediately opposite the

                              concourse is the tunnel marked

                              B and the tickets are marked B

                              there's the word 'Standing'

                              across the top of the tunnel,

                             and people would whether they

                             knew the layout of the ground or

                             not, would presumably want to go

                             towards that area?

43.11       MACKRELL         Yeah, but as ... I appreciate the

                             size was larger but there was also

                             a 'Standing' sign which I admit was

                             smaller to the right directing

                                    people on to the pens in front of

                                    the Police Control.    (Buzzer)

     43.26        DSU61             Yeah, this, the fact that other

                                    signing indicating pens 1, 2, 6

                                   and 7 is not very conspicuous

                                   coupled with the fact that

                                   supporters traditionally went

                                   to stands, to the stand behind the

                                   goals all increased the possibility


m                                  of overcrowding in the central

                                   terraces, pens 3 and 4.    Am I

                                   right?

                 MACKRELL          Well you're right in obviously in

                                   what happened on the day, but

                                   one can only say that previously

                                   that situation didn't occur.

                                  Be it either previous two semi­

                                   finals or league games where

                                  there's a, a near to capacity

                                  numbers on the terraces.

                 DSU61            Okay.     The buzzer's just gone,

                                  M r MACKRELL.    If we can just

                                  adjourn for a few minutes

                                  while we load another tape in

                                  then we'll resume the interview.

                                  Okay.

             MACKRELL             Sure.

 MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


             (1536)            the interview then, remember you're

                               still under caution and the same

                               people are still in the interview

                               roam as previously.   Okay.

            MACKRELL           Yes.

            DSU61
                              W e talked about the signing

                               indicating pens 1, 2, 6 and 7

                              not being very conspicuous and

                              discussed about the fans going

                              down the central terrace, that

                              area acting as a, a magnet if you

                              like.   In hindsight do you think

                              that the signing to other parts of

                              the terrace was inadequate and

                              likely to contribute to

                              overcrowding on those pens?

            MACKRELL          I think it's difficult to say in

                             hindsight, I think it, I think it

                             could be improved but whether it

                             was a factor I think is questionable.
01.03   DSU61
                             Fair enough.   Had the signing ever

                             been that the, what m ay be

                             inadequate signing, ever been

                             pointed out to you prior to the

                             disaster?

        MACKRELL             No.

        DSU61               And to you the Club I'm talking

                            about as well now.

 01.15      DSU61
                               Is it something that you would

                               have expected EASTWOODS or the

                              Police o r the Working Party

                              •Advisory Group to have brought

                              to your notice, if they, if it

                              was inadequate?

            MACKRELL
                              If it was inadequate I suppose

                              I would have expected possibly

                              the Advisory Group to bring

                              it to m y attention on the basis

                              that they bring matters which

                              if it's referred to you by

                             yourself as significant, they

                             bring through forward a great

                             deal of matters which are very

                             insignificant.
01.42     DSU61
                             Yeah.    As the Club Safety Officer

                             do you think that you should, you

                             should have foreseen this possibility

                             and perhaps done something about it?
         MACKRELL
                             It was something which obviously I

                             had seen, but you know, I can't

                            say now that I regarded it as of of

                            great importance.    I felt that what

                            was there was adequate, at that

                            time, obviously otherwise I would

                            have done something about it.

                                   this is a ccnparatively snail area

                                   in which the whole large crowd, it's

                                   does not help in that once people

                                   are in it, and it becomes crowded



§                                  it is almost impossible to get them

                                   out.    Was this ever a factor that

                                   was recognised b y the Club prior

                                   to the disaster?

                                  it has, you know when one looks at

                                I think back to 1985 (000085) in

                               relation to changing the

                               configuration of the turnstiles

                               at lappings Lane, but obviously

                               what, after that had been

                               completed and prior to any

                             referring to ...

         MACKRELL            Yes indeed.

                            Mr MACKRELL?     Can you tell me were

                            those plans designed primarily

                            to achieve segregation or were

                            they designed to improve the

                            safety or both?

        MACKRELL            I think everything really is a

                            combination of both.




                                                                            859

                                 Mn.    I noticed that, and in fact

                                 yo u just made mention of it, that

                                 in fact when this was put to the

                                 Board, this, these various schemes

                                 then, the Board turned the, turned

                                 them down, they'd obviously turned

                                 it down for financial reasons as

                                you mentioned given the Popplewell

                                that sort of was coming on top.

                                That's right, there was a great

                                deal of expenditure and by

                                examining the records which

                                obviously I did when I made, gave

                                evidence to the Inquiry, that

                                y ^    the Club spent two hundred

                                and forty three thousand pounds

                               on safety and associated works

                                in other areas of the ground so

                               it wasn't a matter of not spending

                               the money to keep or to spend on

                               something else, it was literally

                               the priorities obviously that came

                               up particularly in relation to wooden

                                             it's questionable in that you've got

                                  the first of these (a) talks about

                               in isolation, I think you could say,

                               Because anything now with regard to

                               Document Number 43 was purely a

                               Document issued by, to m e b y Doug

           DSU61
                              So it wasn't a, addressed, it seems

                              to indicate that it was circulated

                              to management...

           MACKRELL
                              That was issued only to me ...,
           DSU61
                              generally.

           MACKRELL
                              only to me.   I might have given it
                              to               but it was not

                              issued to any other other than me.
           DSU61
                             Would it go to the Chief Stewards

                             that Document or one of the

                             management?

        MACKRELL
                             No that was really, that was a

                             discussion Document, for me that

                             wasn't an implementation Document,

                             that was something he produced for

                            me.

        DSU61
                            It does seem to be something if I

                            m a y say so, a little bit more than

                            that, it seems to be.

        MACKRELL
                            I think that if you look at it, most

                            of it's cribbed out the Green Guide,

                            you knew he's actually played with

                            a photocopy of it and put it

                            together.

                                But I mean that's...

             MACKRELL          But that was it, that was, it was

                               produced for that and not

                               circulated like to other Chief

13.18       DSU61
                               So what are you actually saying

                               they were acting under the

                               instructions in the handbook?

            MACKRELL          Ihose are the instructions that

                              they were, they were issued with.
13.38    DSU61

                              but it doesn't actually talk about

                             of that is inplicit.

        DSU61
                             fair enough.   I mean I would say

                             that those instructions are more

                             in the nature of an adrninistrative

        MACKFELL             Yeah ... but but you got you got to

                            read there's also an instruction that

                             SEWELL then there was a gentleman

                             fron the South Yorkshire Fire Service

                             and generally it was the St John's

                             Ambulance Brigade - it has been the

                             Yeah, but I mean none, none of them

                             seem to be acting in a capacity

                            other than manning the gate or

                            manning, manning stands and and

                            assisting people to their seat.

                            And I do accept that I mean as far

                            as public order is concerned their

                                        situations and that the Police

                                        deal with those.    (Pause).

                                        Yeah, I hear what, I hear what, I

                                        hear what you say you know, but I

                                        I regard that, you know, I I regard

                                       that they're reasonably clear

                                       and that I don't think there's

                                       any inpression that they wouldn't

                                       understood what their duties were.

                                       mentions manning of the entrances

     16.38     MACKRELL
                                      Yeah, they had stewards on Gate C

                                      who were there and that Gate C is

                                      the best situation within the

                                there was a steward on the wall

                               which bisects the back of the

                               West Stand.

             MACKRELL          Yes.

                               That bisects the the West Stand.
             DSU61
                               Can you just clarify that for me?

             MACKRELL          Yeah.

             DSU61
                              Can you, would you like to

                              indicate that?    Yeah M r MACKRELL

                              is, is indicating the, the gap

                              in the wall, as he says bisecting

                              the concourse area behind the

                              West Stand giving access to the

17.40    DSU61
                              There doesn't appear though to be

                             any other, other stewards in that

                             area, and I'll accept what you're

                             saying, that you've got steward

                             on the gate.

        MACKRELL
                             And you've got also stewards ...
        DSU61                The C Gate this is?

           DSU61
                               Right, but there's nobody actually, on

                               on that concourse or indeed on any of

                               the other concourses with the general

                              responsibility which to m e seems to

                              be implicit in the management document

                              at least, for direct, for the purpose

                                  they're all officers of the company,

                                  however low down, low down the

                                  scale and, they would be expected

                                  to deal with reasonable requests

                                  of asking for where toilets are,

                                 whatever duties, because it's part

                                 of the brief to familiarise them­

19.13       DSU61
                                 They do seem to have congregated

                                 as you say behind the gate, or

                                 they are actually in the entrance

                                 to the Stands.

            MACKRELL             Yeah.

            DSU61
                                 They're together.   I mean is your

                                 understanding of what they should

                                have been doing then?

        MACKRELL                No, what I'm saying that that

                                they're grouped to three.     We're not

                                talking about something which is

                                very far apart.   You know the

                                entrance from going through

                                those turnstiles to where the

                                C gate is and to where the

                                other chaps are, you you're never

                            more than ten yards away from

                               steward, you go past a steward.

                               Excuse m e if I may.   You've you've

                               You're indicating C gate.
20.00       MACKRELL
                               I'm mentioning C gate.    You've

                               got another steward here, which

                               is on the gate which I referred

                              to previously, the hole in the

         MACKRELL
                              and you've got more stewards here.

                              In addition to that y o u 've got

                              prograntne sellers which are, which

        DSU61
                              Yeah but the steward that's

                              in the gate in the wall.

        MACKRELL             Yeah.

                             Can be either side of that

                                  that situation but specifically the

                                  people going through turnstiles

                                  A to G have to walk past the three

            MACKRELL
                                 It's not very, it's not, it's it's

                                 not actually a, it's only a bank

                                 of seven turnstiles.
20.42       DSU61
                                 Would you have expected those

                                 stewards to be spread out on

                                 that concourse as opposed to being

                                 on the gate? (Overtalking)

         MACKRELL
                                No, because it's their, it's it's a

                                safety requirement and there must

                                be always a minimum of two, of two

                                stewards on that gate, so we put

                                three there as a back up in case

                                one wants to go to the toilet, one

                                is called away for seme other, seme

        DSU61
                            So in fact they're working, within

                            Yeah, they're working with their terms

                                  reference but they are expected

                            to do.

             MACKRELL           To be normal things, they are

                                kind of, you know, kind of

                                courtesy element that one has to

                               do with the job.

             DSU61
                               I mean the, the stewards on the bottom

                               of the stand.

            MACKRELL           Yeah.

            DSU61
                               on that concourse, that stand,

                               that stand area, was was that used,

                               that entrance to the stand off...



            MACKRELL           Yes, yes it was.

            DSU61
                               off the concourse fed b y A to G?
21.32       MACKRELL
                               It, that was, people came through

                              there because people were

                              caning through 9 to 16 to go up

                              into the West Stand.
21.49    DSU61
                              Fair enough.     One last question

                              to do with that, I mean

                              presumably the Police approved

                              the number of stewards who were

                              working in these areas anyway

                              and you act in consultation with

                              the Police when you do that?

        MACKRELL             Yes.

        DSU61                Yeah?

        MACKRELL             Yes.

        DSU61
                             If stewards had been at the

                             strategic locations and aware of
  MACKRELL              GRAHAM    HENRY


                                   their responsibilities for

                                   controlling or directing manfcers

                                   of the public entering the ground

                                   they would perhaps have been in

                                   the position to recognise the

                                   volume of supporters that had

                                   gone down the tunnel and to

                                  direct them away from it and

                                  pens 3 and 4 round the wings

                                  into pens 1, 2, 6 and 7.    Do

                                  you agree?

             MACKRELL
                                  I don't, I I it's difficult, I

                                  can't, I'm not qualified to say,

                                  at which stage, at what time that
22.34
                                  pen became overfilled,    if it was

                                  in a situation which it becams

                                  overfilled after the gate had

                                 been opened, after Gate C had been

                                 opened, I don't think anybody

                                 could have possibly have have

                                 directed that, that group of

                                 people.

22.46    D5U61
                                 This is at 1452 (1452) w hen Mr

                                 DUCKENFIELD gave the order to

                                 open the gates?

         MACKRELL                Yes.

        DSU61
                             Yeah.        If it was before that, I

                             mean there is a suggestion that

                             the, those pens were becortming
 MACKRELL               GRAHAM    HENRY


                                   overcrowded before that?

             MACKRELL              Sure.

             DSU61
                                   I^t me say not overcrowding

                                   necessarily, but there was an

                                  uneven distribution.

 23.03       MACKRELL             Yeah but the situation was, was

                                  it was accepted that the Police

                                  ware on were stewarding pens.

                                  The police had got the close

                                  circuit television, the Police

                                  Control Box is right above the

                                  area where it took place. You know

                                  I, I would regard that as being

                                  the prime Police responsibility.

            D5U61                 To monitor the pens.

            MACKRELL              To monitor, to monitor that

                                  situation.

            DSU61                Yeah, I think you dealt with

                                 that in seme detail again in

                                 your transcript...

            MACKRELL             Yes.

23.30       DSU61
                                 previously.   Did the stewards at

                                 leppxngs Lane end have any direct

                                 responsibility towards the

                                 supporters apart from opening gates

                                 and manning the turnstiles and

                                 stands to look after seat...

                                 seating?

         MACKRELL                Only to make sure that those sup...
 MACKRELL              GRAHAM    HENRY


                                  supporters with tickets for seats

                                  gained access to the West Stand.
            DSU61
                                  Yeah.   I'm really, what I'm

                                  really ccming back to is this

                                  direction and control and

                                  interpretation of direction and

                                 control?

            MACKRELL
                                 N o I think there's as I say it

                                 goes on from what I said

                                 previously.

            D5U61
                                 I accept that the reason of no

                                 stewards actually on the West

                                 terrace because the Liverpool

                                 supporters were likely to be

                                 hostile, but dealing with gates

                                 in the perimeter fence, there does

                                 seem to be a dis, disagreement or
24.12
                                at least a m i s . .. misunderstanding.

                                Your management information

                                document does say that stewards

                                will man gates which are not

                                continuously open whilst the

                                ground is in use.   Is that

                                right?

        MACKRELL                My, m y management document yeah,

                            m y management document was an

                                item that was produced for Doug

                                   said that the management document

                                   to be fully implemented.     Hie

                                   that however the situation was that

                                   the gates onto the track were always

                                   manned b y the Police.

                 DSU61
                                   I, I understand, was it the

                                   position with the gates at the

                                   front of the pen onto the

                                  perimeter track that these be

                                  manned b y the Police and that

                                  that's been, has that been the

                                  situation for some tine?

                MACKRELL          That's been the situation indeed.

                DSU61
                                  Ho w long, how long has that been?

                MACKRELL
                                  Ever since I've been at the Club.

                DSU61
                                  So it's taken place before y o u . ..

                MACKRELL          Yes indeed.

    25.06       DSU61
                                  presumably.   Is there any

m                                 agreement, written agreement in

                                  force as far as you know to do

                                 with that, or is it just something

                                 that's become a precedent?

            MACKRELL             The written agreement now that

                                 we have with South Yorkshire Police

                                 is considerably different to that

                                 which was current on that day.

            DSU61                Was there one actually in force

                                 a written agreement?

                  MACKRELL              No, no.

                  D5U61
                                        It was an understanding between

                                        you and the Ccmnanders, or

                                        your your predecessors?

                 MACKRELL               No it was an understanding

                                        understanding, exactly and it

                                        was a situation, it was something

                                        that the Police had never

                                        approached roe to say, why


%                                      aren't your chaps doing this job.

                                       It was obviously that they

                                       accepted that it was a job that

                                       they did.
    25.40        DSU61
                                       Mn.     Fair enough.   Was that

                                       agreement ever taken up with

                                       Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD

                                       when he took over from Chief,

                                       Chief Superintendent MOLE?

             MACKRELL                 No.

%            DSU61
                                      Or did you assume the situation

                                      would be allowed to continue?

                                      I assumed the situation would be

                                      be continued because Mr DUCKENFIELD

                                   that I think that happened and I'm

                                   not sure after that I think there

                                  might have been one game at which

                                  But I mean it was never, it was

                                  never put up that there ma y be a

                                  problem about manning those gates

                                  or who should man them at all?

             MACKRELL             Not at all, not at all.

             DSU61
                                  This is the front perimeter gates.
             MACKRELL
                                  Exactly, you know, quite honestly

                                  the, there wasn't a great, there

                                 wasn't a great discussion about

                                 policing at all, it was a matter

                                 of obviously following on from

                                 what Mr MDLE had already already

                                 set up.

          DSU61
                                 It was a bit early for him to nake

                                 any changes in any case ...

          MACKRELL
                                 I would have thought so because ...
          DSU61
                                 until he understood what he was

                                 doing?

          MACKRELL               he obviously wanted to get his

                                 feet under the table I assume.
26.43     DSU61
                             What about the gates at the back

                             of the pens under the front of the

                             West Stand, it does, does seem to

                                      be some dispute about who was

                                      responsibile for manning than

                                      the Police or stewards or indeed

                                      whether they should be manned at

                                      all.   What's your understanding of

                                      that situation?

                 MACKRELL            Well the situation there is that

                                      I understand, there were definitely

                                      not Sheffield Wednesday stewards

                                     on that area, it was left, it was
%
                                     a situation that that was left to

                                     the Police.   Hovrever, because of

                                     the fact obviously that all the pens

                                     have a mutual toilet, refreshment

                                     facility, there always is going to

                                     be sane flow between the various

                                     pens.

    27.19        DSU61               Is it, does it make any differences

                                     as to whether the gates are closed or

                                     open as to whether they're manned?

                 MACKRELL            I think, I'm not aware of that,

                                     I'm not aware of any difference.

                                     But as I say because, because it

                                     was a situation that was in the

                                     hands of the Police.

    27.37        DSU61               Yeah, fair enough.     Did you

                                     appreciate that because of their

                                     location towards the back of the pen

                                     under the stand they were difficult

                                  to see and because of this when

                                  the pens were crowded supporters

                                  needed some assistance to achieve

                                  any even spread?

            MACKRELL             Well I was aware obviously of

                                 where the location of the gates

                                 were, but again it goes right back

                                 to what I say that the the pen

                                 the configuration of it had been

                                 approved by the, had of been approved

                                 by the local Licensing Authority.

            DSU61                Yeah, but the, that doesn't

                                 actually answer the question.       Did

                                 you appreciate that because of

                                 their location towards the back of

                                 the pen, in other words you

                                personally, under the stand, they

                                were difficult to see and because

                                of this when the pens were crowded,

                                supporters needed sane assistance

                                to achieve an even spread.     Did

                                you appreciate that?

28.24   MACKRELL
                                Yeah, I don't think it would have

                                made any difference where so ever

                                where the gates ware, if because

                                b y definition if the pens full you

                                hardly, you're going to struggle to

                                see the gates wherever they are.

                                        appreciate but it wouldn't have

                                        made any difference whether they

                  MACKRELL
                                        The thing is I acknowledged where

                                        they were when, when any ground is

                                        full it's difficult, it's difficult

                                       to move about and I don't think that

                                       that really had a factor, had a

                                       factor on it.

                 MACKRELL              No.

                 DSU61                 through those gates?

                 MACKRELL              No.

                 DSU61                 I mean, presumably the same

                                      situation again applied in 1988

                                       (000088) and 1987 (000087) did it?

             MACKRELL                 That's right.     We didn't, it didn't

                                      present a problem.

             DSU61                    No problem?

             MACKRELL                 No.

    29.12    DSU61
                                      Do you believe that there was a

                                       that was in the hands of the

                MACKRELL              From the Control Box, visually

                                      fran the track because they they

                                      looked after the perimeter gates

                                      and b y w a y of close circuit

%                                    that, don't you think that you're

                                     abrogating your responsibilities by

                                     saying, it's not, is it just as

                                     sample as that the Police are

                                     watching from the Box, therefore

                                     they must be monitoring, they're

                                     doing it be agreement?

                                     No, but at the end of the day the

                                    Police are always adamant to m e of

                                    regarding close circuit

                                    television refinements to the

                                    done.    The Club has, we as a

                                    Club probably spend more money

                                    on close circuit television than

                                    any other Club in the country in

                                    upgrading, adding bits on to it,

                                    and you know, I would regard that

                              of the three or four hundred

                              supporters.   Did you look at

                              the terraces stand to consider

                             the effect of this inflow into

                             those terraces?

           MACKRELL          I, when Mr IOCK I thought with

                             regard to the numbers of people

                             who came in, I asked him how nany

                             it was, and he thought about

                             three to four hundred.   Under

                             that basis I thought that

                             wouldn't have presented too

                             much of a problem if it had

                            been contained at that number.

                            Because statistically one always

                            gets a percentage of supporters

                            who don't turn up for matches.

                                   three or four per cent.      People

                                   show on the day and so therefore

                                   you do have you know...
             DSU61
                                   You can absorb it?

             MACKRELL
                                  You you, I felt that the three

                                  hundred we could have absorbed it,

                                  you know on on that basis, that

                                  three hundred to ten thousand we

                                  probably at fair wind would have

                                  been reasonable to accept that we

                                  could have absorbed that.
38.20    DSU61
                                  Fair enough.    Just one or

                                 two quick points now Mr MACKRELL.

                                 After the disaster happened, you,

                                 I believe, acccnpanied members of

                                 the FA to the boardroom to rfcT-irje

                                 what was going to happen to the

                                 gaire?

         MACKRELL                Yeah.

38.40    DSU61
                                 I think at some stage in the

                                 proceedings Mr DUCKENFIELD came

                             and addressed the Board,
        MACKRELL             Yeah.

        DSU61
                             and ultimately I think Mr JACKSON

           DSU61                 did they cane together.     Can

                                 you recall?

           MACKRELL
                                 Em, they were there together,

                                 I can't actually recall whether

                                 they came together.

                                 Can you tell me and you know about

                                 this business of an alleged lie

                                 told b y Mr DUCKENFIELD.

           MACKRELL             Yeah.

           DSU61
                                Can you tell me the gist of the

                                conversation that took place in

                                the boardroom in regard to, I'm

                                not particularly interested in

                                regard to the adjournment of the

                                match but in regard to what had

                                happened at the Leppings Lane

                               end?

        MACKRELL
                               Yeah I think I can.     Can I refer

                               to m y s . ..

        DSU61                  B y all means.

                               where I put it there.    I'm just

                               trying to get the chronological,

                           Mr MACKRELL is reading his written

 40.20      MACKRELL
                                I m just to separate in m y own

                                mind the conversation I had with

                                Mr DUCKENFIELD in the, in the Police

                                Control Box and the, and the

40.31       DSU61
                            Did you have a conversation with

                            him in the Control Box?

            MACKRELL
                            Well only b y the way when I first

                            went up there because I think it's

                            referred to...
40.40     DSU61
                            This is before you went back with

                            Mr KIRTON and Mr KELLY frcm the FA?

                            That s right, yeah, it's on page,

                            top of page 19 on m y statement.
         DSU61           Right.

         MACKRELL
                         I just made the point there because

                        obviously I I was up there and it

                        wasn't a time to start asking

                        <Juestions, obviously it was a major

                        major operation in hand, and so

                        I just happened to ask about

                        whether there was a possibility

                                    was representatives of the three

                                        actually played the tape myself

                                        of the the shot that I think

                                        everybody's seen over the

                                        turnstiles A to G, I actually

                                        saw what what had happened...

                    DSU61               Yeah.

        43.36      MACKRELL             and that, because the initial

                                        situation of one was told was that

                                        fence, the gates had been,


%                                       (buzzer) the gates had been

                                        broken and you know people had

                                        forced an entry.

                   DSU61                Yeah, okay.   I think we're

                                       probably at a suitable point

                                       M r MACKRELL to adjourn again

                                       while we change the tape.       We'll

                                       switch the... Mr TOPE will switch

                                       the tape off and we'll change it

                                       over and then we'll carry on

                                       with the interview.

       44.02                           (Tape switched off).   (1620)

       00.09       DSU61               Yeah to resume the interview now

                   (1621)              that the tape has been replaced Mr

                                       MACKRELL, just a few more points

                                       to put to you then we'll be

       00.20                           finished.   Is it the case that

                                       the Club's systems of monitoring

                                       both at the turnstiles and inside

                                       the ground failed to identify

                                  the uneven distribution in pens

                                  3 and 4 by 1445 (1445) 1450 hours

                                  (1450) and to warn the Police and

                                  the stewards accordingly, in

                                  order that they could take the

                                  appropriate action?

 00.40       MACKRELL             The Club's systems that on the

                                  turnstiles are only capable of

                                  actually monitoring the global

                                  number of people that come into

                                 the area.   Following on frcm that

                                 it's a matter of dispersing people

                                 within the, with the terrace area

                                 and as stated previously that is a

                                 function that has been left to the

                                 Police.

            DSU61                Even so far as the concourse anpas

                                 are concerned and feeding, and

                                 feeding it in and monitoring it

                                 from that point of view?

01.17       MACKRELL             Well no I have, I have, you know I

                                 did, as I stated previously, I did

                                 have people on the concourse by way

                                 of e x . .. emergency exit C on the wall

                                 bisecting the West Stand and on the

                                 South and on the South West entrance

                                 to the West Stand and I regarded that

                                 as sufficient number of people.

01.40       DSU61                It does seem that the Club failed
 MACKRELL              GRAHAM HENRY


                               to heed experience of crushing

                               oblique stroke injuries in 1981

                               (000081) and to learn frcm them by

                               adequately reviewing their

                              performance.   I accept that they

                              took advice frcm the Police and

                              in fact as a result of that

                              crushing in 1981 (000081) they

                              put up the radial fences and

                              that but I, I I wondered whether

                              they did enough.

            MACKRELL          Well obviously I can't speak for

                              previous people's actions only to

                              say that I feel sure that it would

                              have, it was enough to satisfy

                              the Local Authority Working Party

                              otherwise the Police would not

                              have let the matter rest.

02.28       DSU61             Despite knowledge of the problems

                              in 1981 (000081) the Club failed

                             to ensure proper capacities for

                             all pens and a system to monitor

                             them in accordance with the Green

                             Guide 1976 (000076) and 1986

                             (000086) was in place.

            MACKRELL         Well the situation regarding the

                             Safety Certificate was that there

                             was, the capacities were a global

                             figure for that area and so there
  MACKRELL              GRAHAM    HENRY


                                   was, that was the w a y that the

                                   Club monitored it by w a y of a

                                   global figure and as as it was

                                   required by us under the standards

                                   of the Safety Certificate.
  03.02      DSU61
                                   It also appears that the Club did

                                   not provide adequate signing in

                                  Pens 1, 2, 6 and, to 1, 2, 6 pens

                                   If 2, 6 and 7.   Do you agree with

                                  that?

             MACKRELL
                                  I think the signing possibly in

                                  hindsight could have been better

                                  but I don't regard it as a

                                  significant factor.
 03.22       DSU61
                                  Neither do you regard the tickets

                                  and the confusion that they m a y or

                                 m a y not have been there?

           MACKRELL
                                  I think the ticketing situation was

                                 not ideal but I think it was

                                 perfectly adequate in, particularly

                                 in light of the fact that the

                                 colour codings were put on, they

                                 were put on to the satisfaction

                                 and to the actual places where the

                                 Police required them.
03.48     DSU61
                                 I see okay.   I'd like to just leave

                                 the rocm for a couple of minutes,

                             okay?

                                  M r MACKRELL and yourself are still

                                  and you can see that the tapes

                                  Yes.

                                 re-entering the roan for the audio.

                                 We've spent something like the

                                 last three hours or so Mr

                                 questions.   Is there anything

                                 that you feel that we haven't

                                 covered but we should have covered

                                perhaps, that you want to talk about,

                                is there anything that you feel

                                you want to address, given the line

                                of questioning that I've put to you?
          MACKRELL
                                I can't think initially myself.
          DSU61
                                Would you like to consult with

                                your solicitor?

          MACKRELL
                            I think that's a valid point obviously

  MACKRELL               GRAHAM    HENRY




              DSU61                 Can you speak up a bit?

 06.00        MACKRELL
                                    Yeah.   In relation to the 1985

                                    (000085) alterations, it was never

                                    never emphasized or make, or put over

                                    that there was a safety elenent to

                                    the actual work that was involved

                                    in changing the configuration and

                                    that if the Board had felt that that

                                   was, had been a priority within the

                                   the alterations then obviously ntiybe

                                   a different tack would have been

                                   would have been taken.

             DSU61
                                   Who would you have expected to

                                   bring that to your attention then?

             MACKRELL
                                   I think if that's, it's an elanent

                                   I think obviously initially it would

                                   beccme a Police and Advisory Group,

                                   an Advisory Group matter cause the

                                  matter was drawn up to the, at the

06.43    MACKRELL

         DSU61                    Yeah, that that was in 1981 (000081)

                                  and 1985 (000085), you're talking

                              first raised b y the Police who

                              submitted to the Club a proposed

                              sketch ...

                              that they said they would like the

                              Club to consider with a view to

                             effecting better segregation of home

                             and away supporters and it was as a

                             result of that approach to the Police

                             that EASTWOOD looked at the scheme

                             and produced his, his alternative

                             schemes for increasing the number

                             of turnstiles and having separate

                             turnstiles for each area.    That was

                             done following the initial approach

                            to the Police who were concerned

                            about segregation but the only

                            issue that appears from the

                            minutes and the records at the time

                            was that the consideration was

                            segregation.

                                purposes there, I thought you were

                                talking about the radial fencing

                               on the pens 1 ...

                               No.

             DSU61
                               sorry on the pens 3 and 4.     You're

                               actually talking about the ...

                               Yes when the, when the question of

                               rejigging the turnstiles was first

                               raised it was raised b y the Police

            DSU61              Yes.

                               who actually submitted a scheme

                               saying they would like the Club to

                               consider changing the configuration

                               to achieve better segregation

                              because at that time that end of

                              the ground was being used for hone

                              and away supporters.

            DSU61             Yes.

                              A n d it was as a result of that

                              approach from the Police that

                              EASTWOOD looked at it, produced

                              his schemes and the Club were

                              actively considering those

                              schemes in connection with other

                              matters at that end of the

                                   planning permission but then the

                                   the Bradford City Fire situation

                                   intravened and resources were

                                   switched elsewhere to dealing

                                   with much greater expenditure

                                   in relation to the South Stand.

                                   The point that's being made

                                   is that the Board in considering

                                   whether they could and should


%                                 proceed with the alterations for

                                  the Ieppings Lane turnstiles, did

                                  not consider it in the light of

                                  it being a safety question.
                DSU61             Yeah.
    09.11
                                  It was solely segregation of fans

                                  and the Board have said to me

                                  that had had it been put to them

                                  at that time that it was required

                                  for safety reasons then a

                                 different complexion would have

                                 been put on it and they would have

                                 looked at it ... (Interruption)
            DSU61
                                 I entirely accept that it was,

                                 you know, it was put as a

                                 segregation, to assist segregation.

                                 1^ fact I think the safety, safety

                                 benefits from it were probably a

                                 spin off...

                                 Yes.

               DSU61
                                  in that, in that they enlarged the

                                  courtyard area, I mean that was,

                                  that, that would have enlarged

                                  fractionally the courtyard area.
    09.42
                                  I think the major element with

                                  hindsight would have been that

                                  there would have been nore

                                  turnstiles to allow people through.
               DSU61             Yes.


m                                And when you then have a large

                                 number of people caning late to

                                 get into the ground, you would get

                                 them in more easily and, and the

                                 flow through would have been

                                 multiplied by the number of

                                 extra turnstiles that you had.

                                 That i think in the context of what

                                 actually happened on this fatal

                                day—

            DSU61               Yes.

                                would have been the major benefit.
            DSU61               I see.

                                And of course for a semi-final the

                                situation was aggravated by the

                                fact that the normal use of the

                                Penistone Road turnstiles to allow

                                people into the North Stand was

                                discontinued to achieve

                                segregation in that end so

             MACKRELL              No.

                                   then M r MACKRELL that the facts

                                  will be reported to the Director

                                  of Public Prosecutions who is

                                  in fact in possession of a file

                                  in any case on this inquiry.

                                  Ultimately he will decide what

                                  if any further action is taken

                                  in regard to this natter against

were        in    evidence             in    quite          large        numbers,           there             was       no    trouble           and       i

would         describe              their        mood       as    boisterous.                   Situated                on    Kilner           Wa y     is      a

leaving           the       premises             the       football           fans        were        carrying               packs        of    alcohol

2 « 53pm<1455>.                     During        this        period          thousands              of       Liverpool              fans       passed

our      point           and     it    was       remarked           upon        on    several                occasions              that       although

time       was       running           out       to    enter        the       ground        a       large          portion           of    the        fans

were        in    no      apparent           hurry          to    get     there           and       in       fact       many        were       walking

away       from          the    ground           as    late       as     2.40pm           (1440).                 1 would           estim ate           that

it     would         take       a     maximum          of     10 m i n u t e s        to    walk             to    Hi 1 I s b o r o u g h       from

our      point.

During           our      time        at    this       observation               point          a     large            proportion              of     the

towards           the      ground.               There       was        obviously           a       lot       of       alcohol         being

consumed             in    the        short       distance              prior        to    entering                the       football

consider             to       be    normal           for       a semi-final                 day a n d           there     were      no m a j o r

hold-ups             in our             section.               By approx.                 H.20pm        (1420)      the        traffic          f lo w

appeared             normal             fo r    a Saturday                 but       sometime           just      after        2.30pm          (1430)

I saw 2           coaches               full        of L i v e r p o o l         supporters                arrive       what       I consider

to    be    late.              These           appeared           to       be    the       last       of    the    travelling

supporters .

At    around          H.55pm             (1455)           it a p p e a r e d          from       the       radio    traffic             that        t h er e

was    some          sort          of    problem            at    the       Leppings             Lane       end    of     the      ground,           and

consequently                   my       serial         attended             th e r e .       Upon          reaching          the    l o c a t i o n at

around          3pm       (1500)             I saw a           l a rg e     number          of       supporters           outside;           the

turnstiles                obviously                 waiting           to    get       in the          ground.           At     this      time

there       were          a    large           amount          of P o l i c e         officers             on    foot     in a t t e n d a n c e

and    from my                observations                  there          did       not    seem any             major       problem.               At

this       time       I saw             Inspector              Robinson              who    was       walking       away        from         Leppings

               HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY


               Interim Report


               The       Home             Office        circulated         the     Interim                 Report      to     the          police,
               local            authorities                responsible           for     administering                     the     Safety              of
               Sports Grounds Act 1975 (the 1975 Act), other emergency services,
               clubs and major                         sporting bodies on 4 August urging them all to
               take         action              to     implement       the       Report’s            recommendations                       without
               delay.                 Local           authorities         were        reminded              of    their          enforcement
               powers            under           the       197 5 Act      in cases          of serious                risk.            Feedback
               received so far, primarily from the police and Fire Service,                                                                        has
               indicated                   no     lack       of     willingness             to        implement             in       full          the
               Report's                   recommendations              [and      that        all           concerned         have           either
               already                implemented             them        or    where         this          was       not        immediately
               possible, have the matter in hand ].


               There have been soma practical difficulties and some difficulties
               of        interpretation.                            This        was      to        be        expected             given            the
               individuality                          of    grounds        whose         layout              and       format              do      not
               necessarily conform precisely to those at Hillsborough - on which
               the        recommendations                     are    based,             [Some          concern             has     also         been
               expressed about the possible effects of arbitrary reductions                                                                            in
               crowd capacities which might increase the potential                                                               for trouble
               outside the ground.]                            The Home Office has helped where it can and
               although                   it    has    no     statutory         role       to      supervise               the     way          local
               authorities                      carry       out     their       duties          under         the          1975      Act         (see
               paragraph                             } it is keeping the situation under review.                                                   The
               option                to        enforce       relevant          recommendations                   of    the         Report              by
               requiring                   safety          certificates          to     contain              mandatory             terms           and
               conditions remains open and has not been ruled out.


               Final Report


               It      is        anticipated                that    the    Final        Report             will       be    available                  at
               about            the       turn of the year.                     The Inquiry has already indicated
               that             it        will       address        the        wider      safety             issues          of       football

                  A measured response from Government                           to        the      Final        Report   is
                  therefore likely to .be required.

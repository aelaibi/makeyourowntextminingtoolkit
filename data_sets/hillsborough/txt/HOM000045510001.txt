 Date:        7 January 1998

 To:     Lord Justice Stuart-Smith


 I attach -

                  my draft of Appendix 1 of your report, listing the people who have given
                  evidence to you;

                  slightly revised (by me) versions of the Appendix 9 material about the
                  individual victims whose cases you have looked at, with your originals (pencil
                  marks show the changes);

                  a letter from Mr Foster about the impact (or non-impact) on the West
                  Midlands Police investigation of the changes to South Yorkshire statements -
                  this is in answer to a letter from me, also attached;

                  further material from South Yorkshire police about the contribution
                  proceedings/state of the ground issue. You may wish to discuss this. Lord
                  Taylor was plainly aware that the barriers were too low and the permitted
                  capacity of the terraces was too high (Chapter 8 of his Interim Report), so
                  what we are being told here is not really news - despite South Yorkshire
                  announcing it to us before Christmas as major new evidence. What it
                  amounts to, as I understand it, are the two points that

                                according to Noel Bumeâ€™s engineering report, the fact that the
                                barriers were too low made them more likely to break;

                                the North-West Comer issue which Mr Hepworth writes bout
                                means that the real capacity of the Leppings Lane terrace was
                                even lower than Lord Taylor realised.

                  a letter from the Police Authority about the payments by Sheffield Wednesday,
                  Eastwoods, and the Council. I think this answers all our questions except for
                  the most important one, which was what the overall estimate was when the
                  out-of-court settlement was reached. We are promised news on that soon.

               I am a Liverpool Football Sup po rt er and season ticket holder. I

               a t t e n d e d the Cup Semi          Final    between Liverpool            and Notts Forest at

               H i l l s b o r o u g h Sheffield,      on SatTuT-d^y 15th April             1989    <150489)

               obtained my ticket              for the m atch from >Hifie 1 d .

               I t ra vel led to S h e f f i e l d      in a car        driven b ^                     , also    in the
                             ^2^02-                                                  G\i
               car was                                                                             We did not stop on

               the way to S h e f f i e l d a rr iving about 2 pm <1400)                     we    left Liverpool

               a bout       10.30 am       <1030).     Traffic was           pretty heavy on route.            The    car

               was    parked        in a side      street about         half a mile        from the ground.

               Before        going to the ground we all went                    to a pub for a drink           I cannot

               remember        the name       of the     pub.

               A fter       this we all wal ke d to the               ground arriving        there at about 2.30            pm

             (1430)       I did Twot see any Police as we w al k e d to the ground,

             I have been to Shef        Id before and knew where I was going.                                    1

             in the L ep pings Lane        end of the ground then.                     On this         occasion,      there

             was    road blocks      set up by the Police                checking tickets              before you

             reached the ground but tiT3>Ksyear                there was          none of that.

             On    reaching    the   outside     of the gsround there were                   no orde rl y queues

             and made     our way towards         the turn st il es         but       there was a lot of             pushing

             and shoving.        I e v en t u a l l y went    thro ug h a turnstile                and gave      up my

             Once    inside    the   ground    it was "hsat so           crowded.        We all went           down the

             tunnel     together     t1>si the five       of u s V       The     tunnel      was    busy at this time

             but    not uncomfortable.                 was about         quarter      to three         (1443)    by now.
                                                                                             3

             W hen we    came out of the tunniSL we ^ e n t                to the

             down the terrace.           At this       time   it was not too             crowded,        and we decided

             to move     further     down the terrace          towards          the    pitch.      Fro m this

             position     I e-quld not     see a thing and did not see                       the    players      on the

             pitch at all.       I rtsard a roar and 1 thinly this was when the player;

             was    pushed against       people      in front     of me and e v e nt ua ll y             I was     jammed

             a gainst    the   front    fence.       I saw one       person under me but                 I c o u l d n ’t

             help him because          I was   jammed against             the    fence.       At    this    time     1 had

             lost    tou'bfej.with my friends.           There were         people       climbing        over my head

             and over the ferTc-a^onto the              pitch,    but      I could not move              because      I was

             j ammed    in.
                                                                                          /Y T                     i^£ n 'G £
             I then saw that the gate             ii          jence was          open and the St Johns,

             Police and other          fans were       helping    people         through      into the         pitch.       I

             was    jammed against       the   fence     for about         ten minutes and              I was    having

             d iff ic ul ty b re athing and was          very w o r r i e d      I did not         think    I was     going

to get out alive.

E v e n t u a l l y the    pressTa<e eased and           I slowly made my way towards                the

open gate there were                people under my feet              but    I c o u l d n ’t help them.

When    I reached the gate               I put my hand up and someone pulled me up
                                                      -----------------------------------
t hr ou gh the gate          into the       pitch.       I wa lk ed    into the     pitch    in a daze

not knowing what             to do.       I made my way to the front of the N orth Stand

and sat down on the                pitch.      I stayed there          for some     time.     I saw

people who a p p e a r e d         to be dead       lying on the        pitch and being         carried

awa y on hoardings               by fans and Police.             I could not describe any of the

d e ce a se d or    injured.

After a while             I got up and started to               look for my friends          1 e ve nt u al l y

found them         in the Leppis^gs Lane terrace.                     We even tu al ly all made         our

w ay back to the            car and home/N^I           rang my dad from Sheffield.                 I got

home about 6 .3 0           pm    (1830).         .

As a resul tT^tHL^the crush suffered a w^ui/sed right shoulder, I did not

at t en d the doctor a m t k d i d not            loose any time            from work.      I did not

lose any p roperty and m y S c l ot hi ng was                  not damaged.
                                                                         c o m M
I think the P ol ic e            o rg an i s a t i o n was   bad from the s t a r t , /t he y had       lost

control.        There was          no steward or Police at the entrance                     to the

tunnel     dire ct ing       fans    to either       end of the Leppings Lane               terrace.        I

also    cannot      urkte rstand why there             is fences       running     down the Leppings

Lane    terrace as the^e              caused     problems as fans            could not spread out to

the    corner areas.              I trKnk     it was a mistake          to have held the match

there after         the     problems      tSj^e^year before        it was      bad then and      it was

only time before             s omething      terrible         happened.

I am about 5 *8 tall,               stocky build,            dark brown short hair,         moustache.

I was w earing            blue jeans,       black T shirt and V necked jumper                   I cannot

remember the         colour.

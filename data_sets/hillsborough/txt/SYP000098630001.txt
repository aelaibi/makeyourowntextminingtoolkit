D.L. S E L L E R S 8t C o . / W. LLOYD W OODLAND




A                                                                     Tuesday.     2nd October.   1990.

         THE CLERK: In the m a t t e r of C h a p m a n and others, the Chief C o n s t a b l e
             of S outh Y o r k s h i r e Police, S h e ffield W e d n e s d a y F o o tball Club,
             She f f i e l d C i t y Coun c i l and Eastw o o d and Partners.

         MR.     PAYNE:          My Lord, there are three p a r t i e s before the Court.
                 They are the Chief C o n s t a b l e of South Y o r k s h i r e Pol i c e who I
                 represent t o g e t h e r w i t h my learned friend Mr. Limb;                S h e ffield
                 W e d n e s d a y F o o tball C l u b P.L.C. r e p r e s e n t e d by my learned
                 friends Mr. G l a s g o w and Mr. Davies, and E a s t w o o d and Partners
                 r e p r e sented by my lear n e d friend Mr. T o u l s o n and Mr. Fenwick.
                 My Lord, I intend to refer to the p a r t i e s as the Police, the
                 Clu b and the Engineer.

q                     My  Lord, a draft of this opening has bee n c i r c u l a t e d and I
                 hope a cop y has reached your Lordship.

         MR.     JUSTICE JOWITT:                   It has.

         MR.     PAYNE:         It is v e r y m u c h a skeleton and it will be n e c e s s a r y in
                 the course of the opening to go a little f u r t h e r t han what
                 a c t u a l l y appears at the moment of paper.
D
         MR.     JUSTICE JOWITT:       Yes.       Just before you b e g i n to open can you
                 h elp me on a p r o c e d u r a l point.  N e i t h e r of the p l a i n t i f f s has
                 obtained a .judgment.

         MR.     PAYNE:          My Lord,          that   is right.

         MR.     JUSTICE JOWITT:   So we are in the ra t h e r u n u s u a l p o s i t i o n of
E                dealing wit h the t hird p arty proceedings, albeit there is no
                 judgment.

         MR.     PAYNE:           My Lord,         that is right.

                         My  Lord, in the course of my opening m a y I take your
                 L o r dship to the Civil L i a bility C o n t r i b u t i o n Act w h i c h deals
                 w i t h this situation.

         MR.     JUSTICE JOWITT:                   I am grateful.     T h a n k you.

         MR.     PAYNE:         My Lord, as y o u r L o r d s h i p has m e n t i o n e d the action
                 started life by two stat e m e n t s of c l a i m in the Quee n ' s Bench
                 D i v i s i o n made by the p e r s o n a l r e p r e s e n t a t i v e s of Mr. Chap m a n
                 and Mr. R i m m e r and the ac t i o n at that time was against four
    q            parties, that is to say the three who are no w before the Court
                 plus Sheffield City Council.                 The a c t i o n by each of the
                 p l aintiffs was for da m a g e ca u s e d by the d e a t h s at H i l l s b o r o u g h
                 on 15th April 1989 of those two men.

                       My Lord, by a g r eement made on 15th D e c e m b e r 1989 the
                  Police agreed to make payment in s e t t l e m e n t or c ompromi se of
                  those two actions t o g e t h e r w i t h any o t h e r actions that arose
    H
D.L. S E L L E R S & C o . / W. LLOYD WOODLAND




               out of the same disaster.                    The case now comes before your
A              L o r d s h i p in which the Police c l a i m c o n t r i b u t i o n from the Club
               and the Engineer as pers o n s liable in respect of the same
               da m a g e w h i c h is the subject of the settlement.                    The action is
               to d e t e r m i n e what amount of c o n t r i b u t i o n is just and e q uitable
               to be made by the C lub and the E n g i n e e r having regard to the
               e xtent of t heir r e s p e c t i v e r e s p o n s i b i l i t i e s and the
               r e s p o n s i b i l i t y of the pol i c e for the deaths of Mr. C h a p m a n and
               Mr. Rimmer.               The a c t i o n is brought u n d e r the Civil Lia b i l i t y
               C o n t r i b u t i o n Act 1978 to which, my Lord, it w o u l d be conv e n i e n t
               if I now turn.

        MR.    JUST I C E JOWITT:                Yes.

        MR.    PAYNE: My Lord, I hope among the books ranged on your
              Lord s h i p ' s bench is a copy of the Statutes of 1978 w hich
q             cont a i n the Civil L i a b i l i t y Act. My Lord, it will be there
              somewhere.

        MR.    JUST I C E JOWITT:                34 of the Statutes    is that      it?

        MR.    PAYNE:  Yes.  I am af r a i d I don't have a ref e r e n c e for your
               Lordship.  My Lord, my friends h e l p f u l l y tell me it is in the
               White Book at page 1784.
D
        MR.     JUSTICE JOWITT:                  This is in volume    2?

        MR.     PAYNE:        Yes,      my Lord,        1784.   My Lord,   Sect i o n   1(1) says:

                        Subject to the fol l o w i n g provi s i o n s of this Section, any
              p e r s o n liable in respect of any damage suffered by another
              p e r s o n may recover c o n t r i b u t i o n from any o ther p e r s o n liable in
E             respect of the same d a m a g e (whether jointly w i t h him or
              o t h e r w i s e )."

               I don't read (2) b e c a u s e I don't t hink that applies, and I
               don't think (3) appl i e s either, but (4) is the q u e s t i o n which
               your L o r dship was addressing:

                         "A person who has made or agreed to make any payment in
                         bona fides s e ttlement or comp r o m i s e of any c laim made
                         against him in respect of any d a m a g e ... shall be entitled
                         to recover c o n t r i b u t i o n in accordance w i t h this Section
                         with o u t regard to w h e t h e r or not he himself is or ever was
                         liable in respect of the damage, provided, however, that
                         he w o u l d have b e e n liable assuming that the factual basis
                         of the c laim agai n s t him could be established."
G
                        My Lord, the w a y we u n d e r s t a n d that is that having made a
               bona fides s e t t l e m e n t or compr o m i s e with the P laintiffs we are
               n ow e n t i t l e d to r e c o v e r c o n t r i b u t i o n from those who we say
               u n d e r Sect i o n 1(1) are liable in respect of the same damage.

        MR.    JUSTICE JOWITT:  That involves an acceptance, does it not, by
               the Police that if the factual basis of the p l a i n t i f f ' s claims,
    H
D.L. S E L L E R S 8t C o . / W. LLOYD WOODLAND




               w h i c h I u n d e r s t a n d is not s u b s t a n t i a l l y in dispute,    the Police
               are t h e m s e l v e s u n d e r l i a b i l i t y to the plaintiffs.

       MR.      PAYNE: My Lord, I accept that.                     What your L o r d s h i p is asked         to
               d e t e r m i n e is the d e g r e e of l i a b i l i t y of each of the parties.

       MR.      J U S T I C E JOWITT:             Yes.

       MR.     PAYNE: My Lord, the test of the a p p o r t i o n m e n t and the de g r e e
               is in S e c t i o n 2 headed "Assessment of contribution" w h i c h says

                         "Subject to s u b s e c t i o n (3)" w h i c h I don't t h i n k I n eed to
                         trou b l e you with, "in any pr o c e e d i n g s for c o n t r i b u t i o n
                         u n d e r section 1 above the amount of c o n t r i b u t i o n
                         re c o v e r a b l e from any p e r s o n shall be such as ma y be found
                         by the Court to be just and equitable, having regard to
q                        the extent of that p e r s o n ' s r e s p o n s i b i l i t y for the damage
                         in question."

                         My Lord, what we t h i n k we have to do, the Police have to
               do, is to p rove that if the p l a i n t i f f s had p r o c e e d e d w i t h the
               actions against the C lub and the Engineer, then they w o u l d have
               wo n the case, and we the n ask your L o r d s h i p to a p p o r t i o n
               l i a b i l i t y to them in our fa v o u r on the basis of what is just
D              and e q u i t a b l e having regard to the extent of their
               responsibility.          My Lord, I hope that is helpful.

       MR.       J U S T I C E JOWITT:            Yes.   T h a n k you.

       MR.       PAYNE: My Lord, I n eed to make two comments about the shape of
               the case in passing so that t hey have been said.                   First of all,
                from time to time as the case p r o ceeds it ma y become apparent
E              as y o u r L o r d s h i p may have a l r e a d y seen from the T a y l o r report,
               that others also may have b een at fault and bear some
                r e s p o n s i b i l i t y for what happened.    Those parties are not before
               the C o u r t and have not bee n brought in by any of these who now
               ap p e a r before you.

        MR.      JUST I C E JOWITT:      That m eans that those who are before me,                       as
„                b e t w e e n them, a h u n d r e d p e r c e n t has to be allocated.
F
        MR.     PAYNE:          My Lord,          th at's right.

        MR.     J U S T I C E JOWITT: It does not m e a n                 that   all parties must bear
                it, that depe n d s on the evidence.

        MR.      PAYNE:        My Lord,           that's right.

        MR.     J U S T I C E JOWITT:  Two or three of t hem between                     them pay the
                h u n d r e d percent.

        MR.     PAYNE:          That's correct.   My Lord, it would have been open to
                any of us to bring in some o ther parties.          None of us c hose to
                do so.          That does not mea n to say that there may not be
                s u b s i d i a r y actions at the end of this one, but at the m oment



                                                                3
D.L. S E L L E R S 8t CO. / W. LLOYD WOODLAND




                your L o r d s h i p is c o n c e r n e d wit h one hund r e d percent b e t w e e n the
                three of us.

        MR.     J U S T I C E JOWITT:   Does that m e a n it wil l not be n e c e s s a r y to
                c o n s i d e r the fault of others?

        MR. PAYNE:  We do not t h i n k it will be n e c e s s a r y to do that.                            We
            don't ask you to.
B
                         My Lord, the second comment in p a s s i n g is that this a c t i o n
                before your Lords h i p is not f o r m a l l y a test or r e p r e s e n t a t i v e
                ac t i o n and r e g r e t t a b l y there is no formal agr e e m e n t b e t w e e n the
                part i e s that the result in this a c t i o n should be bind i n g upo n
                them in other cases arising out of the disaster.                         However, as
                your L o r d s h i p knows the parties hav e agr e e d u pon a n u m b e r of
r               issues w h i c h they ask the Court to d e t e r m i n e and as we the
                Police u n d e r s t a n d it, it is a c c e p t e d by all parties that the
                result of y o u r Lord s h i p ' s d e t e r m i n a t i o n s will be b i n d i n g u p o n
                them in o t h e r cases of death and injury in pens 3 and 4.

                     My  Lord, that               is as far as we are able to take that as p e c t
                of the case.

D       MR.    JUSTICE JOWITT:     Hav i n g read the T a y l o r report and the issues
                and the experts' reports, it occurs to me that some of the
                issues m a y in the end not have any r e levance w hen one looks at
                the causation.                                                    ~

         MR. PAYNE:            Yes.

         MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:           If that is so it m a y be, unless I                       am p e r s u a d e d
E            to the contrary, that it will not be n e c e s s a r y for                          me to come
              to a c o n c l u s i o n about those issues.

         MR.     PAYNE:     My Lord, we c e r t a i n l y t h i n k that some of the issues
                 emerge as more si g n i f i c a n t than others.        In fact, it boils dow n
                 to a v e r y few w h i c h I hope to t ouch on later on in the course
                 of my o p e n i n g .

 F       MR.     JUSTICE         JOWITT:        Yes.

         MR.     PAYNE:          My Lord, the causes         of ac t i o n before  your L o r dship
                 m e r c i f u l l y are quite narrow.          The Police rely upon two causes
                 of action, namely negli g e n c e and b r e a c h of the common duty of
                 care u n d e r the O c c u p i e r ' s L i a b i l i t y Act 1957, that is to say
                 against the Club those two causes of a c t i o n apply.                      A g a i n s t the

A        MR.     J USTICE JOWITT:                   In line with the Police allegations.

         MR.     PAYNE:          Yes.      M y Lord, we anticipate that w hen your L o r d s h i p
                 has heat'd the case the result will w o r k out or will be most
                 c o n v e n i e n t l y e x p r e s s e d in p e r c e n t a g e terms of a p p o r t i o n m e n t of
                 such l i a b i l i t y y o u r L o r d s h i p finds against each of the parties.

                           My Lord, as y o u r L o r d s h i p knows the parties have agreed
B                u pon 45 in total issues to be d e t e r m i n e d by the Court and the
                 evidence to be relied u p o n comes from a total of five sources
                 w h i c h are li s t e d as follows:         first of all the reports of the
                 e nqu i r y by Lord J u s t i c e T a y l o r into the H i l l s b o r o u g h Stadium
                 disaster. The inte r i m report was p r e s e n t e d on 1st A u g u s t 1989
                 and the final report in J a n u a r y 1990.           For our part we think
                 that frankly the w h o l e case centres on the interim report
C                a l t h o u g h it is n e c e s s a r y to refer just to one aspect of the
                 case to the final report.

                           As you r L o r d s h i p knows all the p a r t i e s have stud i e d the
                 report and the y have indicated by u n d e r l i n i n g those parts w h i c h
                 they do not accept.               The result is, if I can put it in broad
                 terms, that the p a r t i e s have a c c e p t e d more tha n      95 p e r c e n t of
                 the findings of Lord Justice Ta y l o r and t h e y have t a k e n issue,
D                again putt i n g it broadly, w ith those findings w h i c h fall
                 a d v e r s e l y u pon each of them.

        MR.      J USTICE JOWITT:                   There   is v e r y little d i s p u t e as to fact and
                 the findings of                   fact.

        MR.     PAYNE:           That      is      right.

E       MR.     JUSTICE JOWITT:       In the Ta y l o r report it is the c r iticisms of
                the various p a r t i e s w h i c h those p a r t i e s c r i t i c i s e d do not
                accept.

       MR. PAYNE:  "To facilitate the calculations, aplan of the
           ground should be available with suchdetails as
           (inaudible) and 15.2:

                          "The method assesses the holding capacity of the
                           terrace, that is standing determined by the
                           number of seats."

B             And over the page at 15.3:

                          "The number of people that can be safely
                           accommodated on the terrace is however
                           either its holding capacity or the capacity of
                           an exit system from it, whichever is the
                           smaller."

C             15.4(1):

                         "The capacity of a terrace or viewing slope
                          should be assessed from the area available
                          for standing; that area of the terrace or
                          viewing slope from which the whole of the
                          playing area can be seen, excluding gangways,
                          while allowing packing density between 54 and 27
D                         persons per 10 square metres, depending upon the
                          condition of the terrace or slope."

              My Lord, I do not read on but the Police ask your Lordship
              to see that as long ago as 1976, very careful attention was
              being given to the formulae to be used to assess the
              capacity of particular areas in the ground. Certainly no-
              one is thinking that it should depend upon regional
k             impression.

       MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:   A                    standing area needs, for safety's sake,
           to be sufficiently                     small that the permitted maximum has
           meaning.  Otherwise                     it would depend very largely on simply
           putting to the test                     the permitted maximum. You may still
           have unsafe packing                     because they congregate in a particular
P          favoured area.   It                    is a matter of splitting it up?

       MR. PAYNE:  Indeed,that, as your Lordship may have in mind,
           was the cause of the introduction of the first set of
           radial fences in 1981 because of just such an incident
           earlier in the season when a number of fans in the then
           open west terrace, where people go where they like, crowded
           into one particular area.
G
                    My Lord, that completes looking at the 1976 Green
               Guide and it is now convenient to go straight to the 1986
               Green Guide, which I hope your Lordship has in a little
               booklet in the original form - looking, I hope, like this?
               My Lord, this is the edition of the Green Guide that
               was in force at the time of the disaster and accordingly is
               the one which ought to be complied with.
D.L. S E L L E R S & C o . / W. LLOYD WOODLAND




»                   My Lord, the introduction to the Guide, in the
               introductory paragraphs; I read 8 and 11:

                         "It should be born in mind when using the Guide
                          to assess whether existing circumstances provide
                          adequately for the safety of spectators, the
                          criteria to be aiming for is that of a reasonable
                          degree of safety. It would be unreasonable, even
B                        if it were practical to seek the absolute safety of
                          everyone attending the ground"

               and 11, using the Guide:

                         "The principles referred to at paragraphs 4 to 10
                          above should be kept in mind by both ground
                          management and where applicable by the local
C                        authority when applying the Guide to an
                          individual ground. The Guide is an aid to not
                          a substitute for professional judgment and
                          commonsense."

               The material paragraphs then start at 12:

                         "Although some of the safety standards are likely
D                        to apply to all sports grounds, however many
                          spectators are present, it is nonetheless
                          important to relate the Guide to the needs of
                          the individual ground. It should be born in
                          mind that in most circumstances the required
                          safety standard to be attained   oftenrelate to
                          the maximum number of spectators who are liable
                          to be admitted to the ground or parts of it.
L                         For example: a large football stadium with a
                          maximum spectator capacity of tens of thousands
                          is liable to pose significant crowd pressure
                          risks. To accommodate safely a maximum crowd at
                          such a ground might entail substantial remedial
                          work. Alternatively, consideration might be given
                          to accepting a much smaller number of spectators
P                         who, properly disbursed, could be accommodated
                          safely without having to incur costly repairs or
                          alterations."

                    The next passage which follows,we submit, is of great
               significance in this case. The fist    step, therefore, is to
               assess, using the Guide’s criteria, how many can be safely
               accommodated in the different sections of the ground, given
G              th® existing condition of the ground, i.e. to determine a
               safe spectator capacity. This should be done with a proper
               detailed plan, preferably drawn to scale.

                         23: "The safety of the public inside the ground is
                         the responsibility of those who stage the event and
                         administer the ground in which it is held, that is
                         the management. This responsibility applies in both
 H                       normal and emergency situations. The local
D.L. S E L L E R S & C o . / W. LLOYD WOODLAND




^                       authority’s safety officers, fire and police officers
                        will help management to discharge this responsibility
                        and in certain circumstances may require measures
                        to be taken in order to achieve reasonable safety
                        standards but the management is not thereby absolved
                        from its responsibility to the safety of its
                        customers."

g      MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: Of course, one then has to ask how has
           management chosen to carry out those responsibilities?
       MR. PAYNE:             Yes.

       MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: And that may raise then issues as between
           management and those carrying them out as to the way in
           which the blame falls?
C
       MR. PAYNE: Certainly. My Lord, your Lordship clearly has in
           mind that the Police were looking at and in a position to
           observe the entry of the fans into the west terrace,
           through the turnstiles and then entering on the terrace.
           The management cannot absolve itself of its responsibility
           for the system which is being employed by the Police.
           Then it is quite plain that what the Police were doing
D          was to operate a "find your own level" system, which the
           management themselves had devised.

                   My Lord, at 44: this repeats what was in the 1976
              Guide:

                         "Where admission to a ground or parts of it is
                          controlled by turnstiles, these by their number
k                         and location control not only the rate of
                          admission ...."

              My Lord, I will not read on. It is a direct repetition of
              the function of turnstiles in controlling the access of
              people to particular areas of the ground.

P                       101:        My Lord, another important paragraph:

                         "Division of spectator accommodation. The ground
                          should be divided into sections to prevent
                          potentially hazardous migrations by spectators.
                          Each section of the ground has its own limit of
                          safe capacity and a major migration can cause
                          dangerous overcrowding. Each section of the
G                         ground, for example, each end or side, should be
                          self-contained with its own entrances, exits and
                          toilet refreshment facilities.  In certain
                          grounds in particular there should be no access
                          from one such major section to another except
                          in an emergency"

               and he deals with other types of ground.
H
D.L. S E L L E R S & C o . / W. LLOYD WOODLAND




.                    217, my Lord. My Lord, this is the first paragraph in
              a chapter entitled, "Estimation of safe ground capacity"
              and it is headed, "To assess the number of spectators which
              can be safely accommodated account should be taken of the
              features of the individual ground; its configuration;
              general condition; use and any deviations from the Guide’s
              provisions." Your Lordship will have in mind the division
              of the west terrace by the radial fences. The previous
B             sections of the Guide give guidelines and safety
              considerations for individual features of the ground. This
              section suggests a method of calculating the number of
              people that can be safely accommodated when taking into
              account the interactions between these individual features
              and where there are deviations from the guidelines.

                   The following paragraphs contain as of necessity
C             generalised guidelines in view of the wide variety, the
              types, sizes and configurations of sports grounds, their
              use and general condition. Your Lordship can hear in that
              paragraph an echo of that opening paragraph of the Guide
              which refers to professional judgment and commonsense:

                         "To facilitate the calculations, a plan of the
                          ground should be available with such details as
D                         exits, stands, terraces, stairways and so on"

               and then I am not going to read the rest of it but your
               Lordship will see that the chapter goes on to give quite
               a helpful formula for the assessment of a safe capacity for
               each section of the ground, having regard to the individual
               features of the ground using professional judgment and
               commonsense....
     D.L. S E L L E R S & C o . / W. LLOYD WOODLAND




     ^                          .... so as to ensure its maximum capacity was not
                                exceeded. The plan was not adopted. The maximum
                                capacity for the new centre pen was calculated at
                                2,200, but no alteration was made to the Safety
                                Certificate so to limit it nor was there any means
                                mechanically of counting the numbers going into that
                                pen.

     B                My Lord, 132:

                                "Also in 1985, electronic counting equipment was
                                installed at all turnstiles. This conveyed the
                                running count for each bank of turnstiles, for example
                                A to G, to a television screen in the Club control
                                room where the figures were displayed. In 1986, an
                                electronic eye was installed i n e a c h turnstile booth
ip   C                          to catch and record anyone climbing over the
                                turnstile."

                      134:

                                THie result of these changes was to divide the terrace
                                into a number of small areas without providing any
                                computerised or mechanical means of limiting entry
     D                          numerically into any one area if all areas were open
                                for choice. Before the fences and pens had divided
                                the terrace, the overall figure tsf 10^100 could be
                                monitored via the turnstiles and in theory the crowd
                                could even itself out laterally. Even then, it was
                                not possible strictly to ensure compliance with
                                Schedule 3 Part 1 of the Safety Certificate which
                                prescribed the maximum of 2,900 for the north-west
                                terrace and 7,200 for the west terrace. Paragraph 3
                                of Schedule 2 of the Safety Certificate provides:

                                'The number of spectators admitted to the Stadium and
                                to the several areas of spectator accommodation within
                                the stadium shall not exceed the figures specified in
                                Part 1 of Schedule 3.'
     F
                                The club had to rely upon visual monitoring.

                                The situation became worse however with the division
                                of the west terrace into pens. Not only were there
                               more and smaller discreet areas, but some were likely
                                to attract more than their appropriate share of the
                                10,100               total.   It is well recognised that the a
     G                         behind the goal is very popular. Moreover the
                                position of the tunnel vis-a-vis the turnstiles A to
                                G, its labelling and the absence of signposts
                                advertising thew wing pens would draw it to those with
                                terrace tickets.  It was therefore highly likely that
                                pens 3 and 4 would fill to capacity and indeed exceed
                                it unless preventative steps were taken. Had
                                Dr. Eastwood's plan for separate turnstile access to
     H                         separate sections with separate toilet and refreshment

                          My Lord, I make a comment about those two paragraphs.
                     The club has underlined the words "the Club" in Paragraph
                     134 in the context of who had to rely upon visual
                     monitoring.  If by doing that "the Club" means that
                     everyone had to rely on visual monitoring, the Police
    B                accept it. Your Lordship will see that what Lord Justice
                     Taylor is saying here in these passages culminating in 134
                     and 135 is that the effect of the alterations was the
                     10,100 could be counted through the turnstiles but there
                     was no means of assessment of the capacity of the separate
                     pens and no means of counting and control of the numbers
                     who entered any particular pen and the system - if that is
                     what it could be called - relied upon visual monitoring.
#   c                         My Lord, 143:

                              "Whatever should have been the maximum capacities for
                              pens 3 and 4, the fact is that no figures at all in
                              respect of them were put into the Safety Certificate.
                              Despite all the changes in layout of the fences and
                              barriers, the two figures, 2,900 in the north-west
    D                         terrace and 7,200 for the west terrace, have remained
                              as the only maxima with which the Club has to comply.

                              Section 2(1) of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975
                              provides (so far as is relevant):

                              'A Safety Certificate shall contain such terms and
                              conditions as the local authority consider necessary
    E
                              or expedient to secure reasonable safety at the
                              stadium when it is in use.... I

                              2.2:

                              'Without prejudice to sub-section (1) above, a Safety
                              Certificate:

                              (b) may specify the maximum number to be admitted to
                              different parts of it."

                    Then he explains that Section 2.2 was repealed, but its
                    continued use was recommended by a Home Office circular.

                    He says in 145:

                              "It is clear that when the certificate was first
                              issued the South Yorkshire County Council went further
                              than simply to fix the maximum numbers for the whole
                              Stadium. They prescribed figures for each part of the
                              ground not merely by the four points of the compass
                              but by specified sections."

    A                My Lord the point he is making there is when the Safety
                      Certificate was first issued particular capacities were
                      allocated not just to the four sides of the ground but in
                      particular to the 7,200 across the west terrace and the
                      2,900 in the corner of that terrace, even though in fact
                      there was access between those two parts of the ground. My
                      Lord, I intend, having completed the exercise of going
                      through Lord Justice Taylor's findings, to go through the
    B                documents which illustrate all these points and to do it as
                      a separate exercise.

               MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: A criticism of the safety certificate
                   would have to proceed on this basis, would it not, that one
                   of the parties criticised was at fault in not alerting the
                   authority which had to grant the Certificate that this that
                   or the other needed to be considered.
•   C
               MR. PAYNE:             Yes.

               MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: Unless that is so, what is in the Safety
                   Certificate cannot be laid at anyone's door.

               MR. PAYNE: No. What your Lordship says is correct, but the
                   amendment to the Safety Certificate is merely one of
    D              several steps which ought to have been taken, the first of
                   which was to allocate a safe capacity number to each of the
                   pens; the second was to devise some system of controlling
                   the numbers who actually went into that pen; the third
                   stage would of course have been to amend the Safety
                   Certificate in order to reflect those changes.

                            My Lord, Lord Justice Taylor addresses this point
    E
                       exactly in the next paragraph, 147, under the heading "Why
                       was the Safety Certificate not amended?"

                                "Although Dr. Eastwood acknowledged that the various
                               changes to the layout would have had an effect on
                               capacity, he did not take active steps to see that
                               appropriate amendments were made. He says he
    p                          mentioned from time to time that the alterations would
                               have an effect on capacity and that he did not realise
                                the Safety Certificate was not regularly updated.
                               However, I find two memoranda in early 1987 highly
                                significant. Dr. Eastwood's assistant Mr. Strange was
                                concerned with queries from the F.A. as to
                               Hillsborough's capacity for a semi-final. Mr. Strange
                                recorded these questions in a memorandum:-
    G
                                 'Has any account been taken for alterations done on
                                 Leppings Lane over the last few seasons? Is the
                                 10,200 or so figure still correct? I said that in my
                                 opinion it needs to be adjusted, better do it now than
                                 later.'

                                Mr. Strange's next memorandum (a few days later)
    H                          records as follows:-


                                                      13.
D.L. S E L L E R S & C o . / W. LLOYD WOODLAND




^                            'Dr. Eastwood says leave the capacity at Leppings Lane
                             end as it is, providing police have gates under West
                             stand open so that people can distribute throughout
                             the terrace evenly.'

                            Although he says the last nine words do not report him
                            accurately, Dr. Eastwood accepts the rest of that
                            message."
B
                  My Lord, the Police comment is that the system which is
                  being devised and approved here by Dr. Eastwood and in that
                  capacity representing the Club and taking this decision on
                  behalf of the Club, is "Find your own level".

                            "Leave the capacity at Leppings Lane end as it is,
                            providing police have gates under West stand open so
C                           that the people can distribute through the toilets
                            facility."

                  My Lord, that is exactly what the Police are being
                  criticised about - "find your own level" - but we say it is
                  a system which was devised by the lay out of the structure
                  and expressly approved when it was drawn to his attention
                  by Dr. Eastwood on behalf of the Club.

                       My Lord, 156 (the narrative has now reached the
                  disaster):

                            "Meanwhile, the Safety Certificate has remained
                            unamended since 1979. The enlargement of the Kop in
                            1986 increased its capacity to 21,000 "
E
                  This is not directly material, my Lord, but it shows the
                  attitude towards the Certificate.

                            "Although this was known and agreed by the Council it
                            had not been the subject of any change in the
                            Certificate which still showed the capacity of the Kop
                            as 16,850. Mr. Mackrell, Sheffield Wednesday's
p                           Secretary, raised the question of amendments to the
                            Safety Certificate and in particular with regard to
                            the Kop in April 1987 with Eastwood and Partners, but
                            nothing resulted.'*

                            159:

                            "The Safety Certificate contained no maximum figures
G                          for individual pens. There was therefore no sanction
                            or provision focussing attention as to the need to
                            limit entry to the pens by numbers. The layout at
                            Leppings Lane as it evolved made electronic or
                           mechanical control over numbers entering individual
                            pens impracticable if all pens were to be available.
                            Given an important match and a capacity attendance,
                            fans were likely to crowd into popular sections like
H                          pens 3 and A. Those pens were likely to become
D.L. S E L L E R S & C o . / W. LLOYD WOODLAND




A                           overfull well before warning came from the turnstiles
                            that numbers were approaching the terrace maximum of
                            10,100. Control over numbers and the avoidance of
                            overcrowding therefore depended entirely on visual
                            monitoring of the crowd.

           MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: You will have, won't you, to show how,
               bearing in mind that the opening of Gate C by-passed the
B              turnstile, that if there had been an appropriate way of
               determining numbers the opening of Gate C would not have
               arisen.

           MR. PAYNE:             Certainly, my Lord.

           MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: In other words, you would have to say that
               the only proper way of monitoring and controlling the
C              different access to separate pens would have been such as
               would have precluded further entry if Gate C was closed.

           MR. PAYNE: My Lord, there are two points to be made there. The
               first is that if a proper system had been introduced of
               providing separate turnstile access to the separate pens,
               then the position would have been that the number in any
               one pen could have been counted through the turnstile so
D              that the number entering anyone pen at any time would have
               been known. Your Lordship knows that the numbers entering
               the turnstiles were counted and that this was shown on a
               television screen in the club's control room and as the
               numbers approached the maximum in a particular pen there is
               a warning signal given that the capacity was approaching.
               Therefore, if the access to each pen was controlled by its
               own turnstile this would have shown what numbers had gone
               into any pen at any time. That is what should have
               happened; that is what was designed to happen in the 1981
               changes and in the 1985 changes, although neither of them
               was implemented. My Lord, that is the first point.

                       The second point is, with regard to the opening of
                  Gate C, if there had been a proper system of counting and
p                 control of numbers in the individual pens, then in the
                  event of it becoming necessary to open Gate C it would have
                  been known in the club's control room and to the police
                  what numbers had already entered each of the pens, so that
                  all those watching the numbers going into the ground would
                  have known how many more could safely enter any one pen.
                  So that if it became necessary to relieve an emergency by
                  allowing the crowd into the concourse - that is to say
G                 between the turnstiles and the back of the stand and if at
                  that time, as it should have been, it was known what the
                  numbers were who had by then entered any particular pen,
                  then it would have immediately been apparent whether or not
                  further people could be allowed to go into those pens
                  having come through Gate C.

          MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: I am sorry if I keep interrupting you.            I
H             do not know how one can deal with this simply on a
S E L L E R S & C o . / W. LLOYD WOODLAND




            hypothetical basis. If you make this point, I cannot help
            feeling that you have got to be able to say there ought to
            have been this kind of advice at this particular point
            operating in a certain way.  I have read the engineer's
            reports, and unless I missed it I do not find that kind of
            particularity, but if you are saying that doing so-and-so
            would have prevented the ill consequences of opening Gate
            C, I cannot help feeling - and the evidence will tell
            whether it is right or wrong - that the need to be able to
            point in some concrete way to what should have been done,
            where it should have been done, and how and to say that
            that and not some other way which would still have left one
            vulnerable if Gate C was open was the only way of doing it.

     MR. PAYNE:             Certainly.

     MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                    There has got to be that kind of evidence.

     MR. PAYNE: My Lord, that is our case. Our case is that there
         ought to have been a system of counting and control of
         numbers entering the pens. Your Lordship has not yet seen
         the documents and I will have to look at them later on in
         the opening.  I could divert to the documents now to answer
         the point which your Lordship has raised.

     MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: I merely nurtured something which passed
         through my mind so that you can help me in due course.

     MR. PAYNE: I will take the point when it comes. We are
         absolutely conscious of the point your Lordship makes; we
         accept it and we say that the fault of the failure to
         allocate particular safe numbers of capacity - safe to each
         pen - and the failure to provide a system of counting the
         numbers into each pen meant that the opening of Gate C when
         it happened did not cause anyone to be alerted to the fact
         that any of the pens was approaching capacity.
D.L. S E L L E R S & C o . / W. LLOYD WOODLAND




                because the system  devised by the Club depended upon visual
                monitoring, visual  impression, of how many people there
                happened to be in any pen at any particular time


        MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: We shall have to consider      whether thatis
            the only way, i.e.   looking to see how many  people thereare
B           in a particular pen. You may look at this pen and say
            "That looks rather full." It may be difficult, I accept,
            to say that it is at capacity or it is near or it is over.
            Then you may say "There is not an empty space there, there
            is not an empty space there.   If we open Gate C, a lot of
            people still have to come in. We know what the numbers are
            so far, and we are going to have to make sure that at least
            some of the people being admitted in this way are going to
            be diverted to the other" --


        MR. PAYNE:              My Lord, quite.


        MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:   "Even though I cannot make a count of who
j)          is in pens 3 and 4, they cannot all go in there because
             this is a capacity match and a capacity match means that
             your other pens are going to be full.


        MR. PAYNE:     Everything that your Lordship is saying
             demonstrates the weakness of the system of visual
             impression.  It may be that under the pressure of the
E           event, mistakes were made. Your Lordship may make findings
             about that.   Lord Justice Taylor describes what the police
             did as "a blunder", and this may be a finding which appeals
             to your Lordship; but the case for the Police is that if
             the whole system of the safety of people's lives depended
             upon the Police making the right decision in an emergency
             which occurred, and if they just happened under the
             pressure of events to make the wrong decision, this would
F           cost 95 lives, then the case for the Police is that the
             system was not safe. My Lord, that is the way we put it.


        MR.      JUSTICE JOWITT:                 Yes.


        MR.      PAYNE:         My Lord, continuing with this exercise, page 170:

                          "At League matches at Hillsborough, the Police
                          practice was to decide in advance how many and which
                          pens would be used. If a modest crowd was
                          anticipated, only one or two pens might be needed. It
                          was best to confine the fans to limited spaces to
                          prevent them running about and to reduce the number of
                          police required.   The practice was then to fill the
D.L. S E L L E R S & C o . / W. LLOYD WOODLAND




A                            pens one by one. This involved making a judgment as
                             to when a pen was full.

                   May I just say, in passing, that the use of the expression
                   "full" raises the question, which is addressed by Lord
                   Justice Taylor later on, "In order for a pen to be full,
                   this presupposes that there is some safe capacity, and if
                   the capacity of the pen had never been determined, then
“                  what 'full* was to be interpreted as in any particular case
                   depended upon the visual impression of whichever policeman
                   or steward or Club official happened to have the task ons,
                   that day of trying to work out what was full." We say that
                   this was an unsafe system.

                             My Lord, he then goes on:
Q                                                                            '   “    .......




                                                                             .
                             "There would then be a police decision to close that
                             pen and fill another. It was regarded as impractical
                             and unsafe for police officers, just like stewards, to
                             go on the Leppings Lane terraces with away supporters.
                             This meant that monitoring the numbers in any pen had
                             to be done from vantage points outside it. Here the
                             police were much better placed than the stewards,
j)                           There was a good view from the control box and
                             television screens there. There were officers on the
                             perimeter track. No stewards were placed there
                             because having both police and stewards interfered
                             with the viewing. There were also police in the west
                             stand who could look down on the pens.  Intelligence
                             from all those sources would give the police a good
                             appreciation of the state of the terraces. When it
E                           was necessary to shut off access to the pens, officers
                             on the concourse could be informed by radio and could
                             take the necessary steps. At Cup semi-finals, a
                             different approach was adopted. All the pens were
                             open from the start and the policy was to let the fans
                             find their own level. This phrase was repeated again
                             and again by police officers at the Inquiry. What it
                             meant was that no specific direction was given to fans
F                           entering through the turnstiles. They were free to go
                             wherever they wished on the terraces. If they became
                             uncomfortable or wished for any other reason to move
                             their position, then theoretically they could move
                             elsewhere."

                   My Lord, your Lordship has the point that at the back of
                   each of these radial barriers there was a gate which was
**                 a gate which was left open. This is the find your own
                   level point.


           MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                   Yes.


           MR. PAYNE: As if it is water filling up a pen until it
               overflows from one to the next.
D.L. S E L L E R S & C o . / W. LLOYD WOODLAND




A            MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                 Yes.


             MR. PAYNE: "In this way, it was hoped that the fans on the
                 terraces would level themselves out and that distribution
                 would be achieved without police intervention. On these
                 occasions, the gates at the top of the radial fences were
                 locked in the open position.  It was sought to be argued,
                 therefore, that there was freedom of movement from one pen
                 to another, enabling fans to find their own level."

                          My Lord, may I just pause there to say this: Lord
                     Justice Taylor is reporting here what happened in the
                     context of the police practice, but what the police were
                     doing was operating a system which had been provided for
                     them by the Club and the Engineer. The design of the
                     ground was that the fans should find their own level. The
                     gates at the end of each radial fence were specifically
                     provided for that purpose, and, when his mind was addressed
                     to the point, Dr. Eastwood confirmed that that was the
                     purpose of the design.  So although this is being said in
                     the context of the police, it applies equally to all
                     parties, that they all intended that this should be the
                     method.


             MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: Do I read paragraph 170 correctly when I
                 read it as meaning the Police considered that on the
                 occasion to which paragraph 170 refers, they were able from
                 their vantage point to make a sensible and sound decision -
                 "This pen is full enough; we won't let anyone else in
E                there; they will have to go to another pen"?


             MR. PAYNE: Yes. My Lord, this was the fault of the Police,
                 which has to be faced - that the Police wrongly tried to
                 make a system work which was a bad system. They should
                 never have used or attempted to use any judgment as to
                 whether a pen was full or not merely by visual impression.
                 The events of the 15th April make it quite plain that the
                 system is hopelessly ineffective. The Police did not
                 deliberately overlook the crowding in the pens;  they did
                 not shut their eyes to it. They saw how many people were
                 there. They did not think that it was unsafe. They did
                 not react until they realised that people were being hurt.
                 They responded when the situation became dangerous, simply
                 because what they were doing was operating a system which
                 had been devised for them by others.

                          My Lord, may I illustrate it by doing something that I
                     said I was not going to do and to divert from Taylor and
                     ask your Lordship to look at the Safety Certificate for the
                     moment, which will assume some importance in the case. It
                     is in Bundle 1 of the agreed bundle, I think at 115; I am
                     sorry, it is 151.

            MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                  What document am I looking at?


            MR. PAYNE: My Lord, in the bottom right-hand corner, these
                pages have been renumbered and reorganised so often that
                they have now got several numbers, and the numbers which
                are being used are the numbers in the circles. Can your
                Lordship find in the bottom right-hand corner the number
B               159 in a circle? I understand your Lordship has got a
                slightly more up-market version than we have. It should be
                159 in the bottom right-hand corner of what is described as
                the core bundle, volume 1.


            MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                  Schedule 3?
c                  .....                                         '                        ~
            MR. PAYNE:              Schedule 3, yes.


            MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                  Yes, I have that.


D           MR. PAYNE: What your Lordship is looking at is a Schedule to
                the Safety Certificate.   I do not say anything more about
                the Safety Certificate at the moment; it was simply to
                answer the point that your Lordship is drawing attention to
                arising from 170 in the Taylor report. Now, here is the
                schedule of crowd capacity allocated to the several
                sections of the ground in 1979 and still in force at the
                time of the disaster.   If your Lordship's eye runs down the
E               column, it will come to "West Terrace, 7,200" and "North
                West Terrace, 2,900." Would your Lordship be kind enough
                to look to the diagram at the back, which is described as
                Appendix 4, just to see where those sections are?


            MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                  Yes.
F
            MR. PAYNE: My Lord, the West Terrace is the broad width of the
                terrace which your Lordship rap see across the page. The
                North West Terrace is the right-hand corner of the diagram.
                Your Lordship can see that there is access between the two
                by means of a small opening in the barriers in the bottom
                right-hand corner of the diagram.
G
            MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                  There are two openings, are there not?


             MR. PAYNE: Two openings, yes. On the question of visual
                 impression and the task mistakenly undertaken by the Police
                 of looking at the crowd to see how many there were there,
                 one can usefully ask this question:  "Suppose at the time
                 that this Safety Certificate was being drawn up and these


                                                          20.

                    very precise numbers were being put into Schedule 3,
                    carefully calculated by reference to the means of escape
                    and the square metre area on the terrace, suppose these
                    numbers having been allocated to the the particular areas,
                    someone in the room had asked the question, 'Now we have /
                    got these numbers, how are we going to make sure that these
                    numbers are not exceeded when the crowd actually comes in?'
                    and suppose somebody had said "Well, what we are going to
B                   do is build a Police box at one end of the West Terrace*
                    raised up on stilts above the ground, with very good
                    windows all round it, and we are going to place a line of
                    policemen across the end of the ground looking at the crowd
                    and they are going to look out of their --


            MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: You obviously cannot monitor precise
                numbers save by some form of counting, and that is not
                going to be done from a Police box, however advantageous
                its position on the terrace.


            MR.      PAYNE:          My Lord, that is the point.

D
            MR.      JUSTICE JOWITT:  Because one of the purposes of crowd
                    capacity figures in a safety certificate is to say "As a
                    matter of safety, you must not exceed those figures."


            MR. PAYNE:              Exactly.

E
            MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:  So that the operator of the stadium cannot
                say "Well, I know we have exceeded the figures but it was
                not uncomfortably full." The answer then is "I am sorry,
                but those are the maximum."


            MR. PAYNE: It is to provide safety so that there are no
                crushing incidents and so that people do not get hurt.
                That is the reason that the numbers are allocated, my Lord,
                and it is the reason that the Safety Certificate ought to
                have been amended when the terrace was divided up so that
                attention was drawn to the need to limit the capacity of
                each pen to particular numbers. Your Lordship has seen
                171.


             MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                  Yes.


             MR. PAYNE: Lord Justice Taylor then goes on to criticise the

           "This argument, i.e. that theyccoiiild find their own level was bad both in
           theory and in practice. In theory the whole object of this radial fencing
           had been to achieve even distribution by directing fans:; into desired
           positions." Your Lordship sees that that sentence is underlined by the
A          Police as objected to. The only thing we object to is the word distribution.
           As your Lordship willisee in thedocuments, the whdle object of the radial
           fences had been to achieve segregation. This was what was in everybody's
           mind because of the danger of rival factions of the supporters fighting~with
           each other. The purpose of the introduction was segregation not distribution
           as your Lordship will see eventually in the documents. That is the only thing
           we object to.
B                "To say 'that they could move freely from one pen to another" says Lord
           Justice Taylor, "would defeat the object and enable fans to go from a less
            popular to a more popular area without inhibition. In practice this did not
            happen because the position and size of the gates, that is the ones at the
           back, of the radial fences was such that once a substantial number of
           spectators were in the gates were unnoticeable and inaccessible, especially
           to those towards the front who might have most need of them. The same
           argument is deployed to suggest that individual maximum capacities for
C          individual pens need not be assessed, since the presence of an open radial
           gate still meant that the terrace was one area.In practice this simply    was
           not so. The photograph in appendix 5— " Your Lordship has seen that
           terrible photograph. "This gives the lie to a suggestion that the fans
           could if uncomfortable find their own level."
    MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: The weakness of the find your own level theory is that the
D       only people who can find their own level are those perhaps near enough to
        the back who would think if they really have not enough room where they are
        can move to a radial gate into some other pen. The people at the front may
         have discovered a good deal earlier that it was too cramped but because they
        were at the front they can do nothing.
    MR. PAYNE: That is right.
E MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: I should be, I would have thought, apparent to anyone who
       applies his mind to it, a police officer, club steward, engineer or man in
       the street, that finding your own level does not work for the people at the
       front.
  MR. PAYNE: My Lord, the Police are accepting these findings by Lord Justice
      Taylor and they are accepting that they tried to put into effect a bad system.
      That was their fault. They were given this bad system and they tried to work
F     it mistakenly.
                 My Lord, 174. "The effect of this policy was that whereas at league
           matches the Police had to make a positive decision when to close one pen
            and open another, at semi finals when over-crowding was much more likely
            the Police left it to the fans themselves to find their own level.
            Effectivley they were left to monitor their own comfort and safety so as
            to avoid overcrowding. The Police would only intervene when there was some
G          overt sign that an area was full. This is what had been designed to happen
            there being no means of counting of numbers going in the pens.
                 My Lord, the Police have underlined the phrase about over-crowding, ando
            the reason is this: Lord Justice Taylor says: "At semi finals over-crowding
            was much more likely"and the comment the Police would make about that is
            that the converse ought to be true because at semi finals this was an all
„          ticket occasion and the number of tickets issued corresponded with the safe
            crowd capacity certified in the safety certificate. The number allocated to
D.L. S E L L E R S 8t C o . / W. LLOYD WOODLAND




            each particular area of number of tickets issued for each particular area
            of the ground corresponded with the certified number of people who could
            safely go into that ground. So that since in the safety certificate a
            particular number is fixed for the west terrace area and since only that
A           number of tickets were sold in theory there could be no risk of over-crowding.
    MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: I do not accept that for this reason: if you have a find
         your own level basis, then of course there can be overcrowding. If it is a
         sell out, the greater the risk. You are not saying are you that on other
         than all ticket occasions the practice was to admit more people than the
         total capacities.
® MR. PAYNE:           I am not instructed about other occasions.
    MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: I think all Lord Justice Taylor is saying is this, is it not:
         if it is a semi final it is going to be a sell out and so you are going to
         have maximum numbers.
    MR. PAYNE: Yes.
C
    MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: And as you have maximum numbers filling a part of the ground
         on a find your own level because you have got the maximum number and more of
         them will want to concentrate in the centre pens than to go out on the wings,
         then you have the greater risk of over crowding.
  MR. PAYNE: Of course what your Lordship says now in the light of what we know
       happened is correct. The mistake of the police, we say caused by a system
D      designed by others, was to fail to heed this. They thought that because that
       number of tickets had been sold and because the system wasfind your own
        level and because the Club intended the fans should beableto distribute
       themselves through the radial fences by the gates they thought it was
       perfectly safe,,wrongly.
                My Lord, 178. "Even taking the highest figure suggested in the green
           guide the problem remains that those supposed to be monitoring the pens
E          visually had and have little idea of what 54 persons per ten square meters
           looks like." My Lord, as your Lordship knows that is the prescribed safe
           capacity in the green guide. "Mr. Duckenfield's opinion was that when a
           pen was full to capacity the spectators should be shoulder to shoulder or
           would be shoulder to shoulder and chest to back. That view may derive from
           seeing the sort of density crowds regularly endure without injury resulting,
           but it is much more dense than the green guide maximum."
F                   Then continuing to 180, taking 179 first:
    MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: He enlarges on that in paragraph 179, does he not?
    MR. PAYNE: That is right. He is saying that the visual impression system is
         hopeless. We accept that now that we know what happened. We should not
         ever have agreed to try and make it work.
Q
                180: "The tendency has been to allow the pens to fill until fans
           complain or show some sign of discomfort." My Lord we do not really quarrel
           with that. We feel that the word ought to be effect but I do not really
           think there is a serious dispute about that. I am not quite sure why it is
           underlined.
                "If the density at the front appeared less than at the back the tannoy
H          would invite the fans to move forward to make room for more. The evidence
           before the Inquiry and many anecdotal letters I have received clearly shows
D.L. S E L L E R e * < a o . /W.jJLCMTD WOODLAND




            there have been frequent occasions when the packing on terraces, not only
            Hillsborough's, causes discomfort and sometimes for brief periods, fear.
            Usually the surge recedes and the sway returns, the pressure eases and the
A          incident passes unnoticed.
                     183:
     MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: Just before we go- to 183, help me about this. I am not
          sure that Lord Justice Taylor is not in paragraph 178 and 179 criticising
          Mr. Duckenfield's assessment.
B MR. PAYNE:            He is.
     MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                 In deciding what is full.
     MR. PAYNE: Yes, he is saying that Mr. Duckenfield's attempt at visual impression
          did not work.
  MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: I think he is saying, is he not, and this may be of importance,
C     he should not have regarded a pen as not full even on a visual estimate.
       If two people are actually shoulder to shoulder and chest to chest. He
       should have been stricter in his assessment of what is full. It should not
       have been as packed as that before he said it was full. Is that not really
       what paragraphs 177 and 178 are saying?
     MR. PAYNE: It may be. My Lord, if it is a criticism of Mr. Duckenfield that his
n        criteria for making a visual assessment of the crowd was mistaken, then my
          Lord this illustrates the danger inherent in having a system of capacity which
          is left to depend upon the impression of whoever happens to be in charge
          on the particular occasion.
     MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: Hence the need for certified numbers.
     MR. PAYNE: Of course and a means of controlling how many go in and counting them
E         in. My Lord 183: "Although the Police had accepted de facto responsibility
          for monitoring thepens their policy on the day was to leave fans to find
          their own level and to concentrate their own attention on possible disorder.
          Whilst in theory the Police would intervene if a pen became full in practice
          the permitted the test of fullness to be what the fans would tolerate."
                 I do need tomake a comment about the first sentence or part of the
           sentence which is underlined my Lord and it deals with the question of the
F          interpretation of the word "monitoring". Now your Lordship will remember
            174 which describes what the police in fact did, i.e. left it to the fans
           themselves to find their own level. Effectively they were left to monitor
           their own comfort and safety so as to avoid over-crowding and the Police
             would only intervene when there was an overt sign that an area was full.
            In other words the Police responded when they they saw that something had
           gone wrong. Otherwise they left the fans to find their own level. Therefore
           what is being found in the report is that what the Police did was to permit
G          the fans to follow the system which had been designed for them by the layout
           of the ground. My Lord, that is what in fact the POlice were doing. They
           were saying: "Right this is the ground. This is the policy. We are letting
            it happen. We are watching. If we see anything go wrong we will intervene.,,
                  Here it can easily be said with hindsight that they ought tohave seen
             earlier that people were in great distress. As a matter of fact they did
             not see it until it was too late and when they did see it when they realised
 H          what was happening they responded as quickly as they could.

         MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:    Iwonder is that not accepting de facto responsibility
             for monitoringin that we let them find their own level and we step in
             if we think it is over full.
     A MR* PAYNE: My Lord that is it. Your Lordship has it.
         MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:               It is accepting de facto responsibility for monitoring.
       MR. PAYNE: Quite. My Lord, the only thing I think that we are drawing attention
            to is that the word monitoring should be given a broader meaning, namely that
            the Police had taken on the duty of trying to make avisual assessment of the
            numbers in the pens because that is not accepted. They did not accept any
     B     responsibily for trying to?make good the defects of having nomechanical
            or structural means of controlling the numbers going into the pens.
       MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: Mr. Payne tell me if this properly sets out what you are
            sayingabout this:      "The Police accept theyllet the fans find their own
            level but assumed the responsibility of intervening if on a visual assessment
            they considered an area to be too full for safety." Does that express fairly
^    ^     what you are saying?
         MR. PAYNE: I think my Lord, yes that is right.
         MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:               I will substitue that for the word you have underline in red.
       MR. PAYNE: My Lord, yes. My Lord, I would like to add to your Lordship's note
            by saying that the system did not include any means by which the Police could
     P     make a reliable assessment of the capacity or numbers to had been admitted to
            any pen. The system did not include any means by which the Police could
           make a reliable assessment.
                     My Lord, I should add that no-one — no-one at the Club, nowhere in the
                papers, nowhere that I am aware of, was it ever said that the duty had been
                allocated to the Police, that they should count the numbers going into the
                pen or assess what the capacity was. I think I have said enough about that
     E         t0 tryto convey what the case of the Police is.
                     My Lord, now I go on to 232. My Lord, it may be Lord Justice Taylor
                here has dealt with his view of the action which the Police ought to have
                taken upon the opening of gate C and in summary he found that the Police
                ought then to have taken action to block off entry to the tunnel, and he
                says at 232: "Significantly when permission was" — he is commenting about
                a different gate here — "given to open gate A Mr. Duckenfield did order
     F         serials to go to that part of the concourse and monitor the influx towards
                the north stand. He did this because he feared that if fans went to the
                north stand without tickets they would not get seats and there being no
                perimeter fences at the north side they might invade the pitch. This
                illustrates again the preoccupation of avoiding pitch invasion as against
                safety and the risks of overcrowding. Because those entering through gate
                C could not get on to the pitch it was not though necessary to alert officers
                to monitor them. The possibility of overcrowding simpy was not considered."
     G
                     We say that that is a consequence of the fact that no attention had been
                drawn to the fact that these pens did in fact have a capacity and everyone
                had fallen into the mistaken belief that the fans could find their own level.

                             c l e a r l y a f f e c t e d c a p a c i t y but no specific al l o w a n c e was

                        M y Lord, that c o m p l e t e s that e x e r c i s e t h r o u g h the report
              and I go on to page 5 of the o p e n i n g . I m a k e these

              w h i c h y our L o r dship has seen, are as follows, there are three

              to l o o k at the documents.

                        The failure to p r o v i d e a s y s t e m of control was c a u s e d by
              the fault of the p a r t i e s in o r d e r of i m portance as follows:

              for the d e s i g n and layout of the structure; secondly, the

              o b j e c t i o n to radial fences, and third, if the P o l i c e w e r e at

              and the E n g i n e e r and the y o ught to hav e r e a lised tha t wha t they

              corr e c t report of w hat is said by Dr. Eastwood, t hen so far as
              his c r i t i c i s m of the radial fences is c o ncerned it is
D             a b s o l u t e l y a c c e p t e d and his a t t r i b u t i o n of fault and c a u s a t i o n
              to the e x i s t e n c e of the radial fences is c o m p l e t e l y a c c e p t e d by
              the Police, he is right.                    But in his attempt to put the blame
              on o t h e r s he is c o m p l e t e l y w r o n g b e c a u s e as your L o r d s h i p will
              see in the docum e n t w h i c h I a m going to go into in the next
              stage of the opening, the i n t r o d u c t i o n of these fences w as
              c o m p l e t e l y u n d e r the s u p e r v i s i o n of hims e l f and w i t h his
              approval.             The y w ere i n s talled by the Club w i t h the approval
E             of the Club, they r e m a i n e d there y e a r after yea r w i t h the full

              his d u t y u n d e r the S a f e t y Certificate, 1979, every y e a r the
              E n g i n e e r issued a c e r t i f i c a t e that the ground was safe to be
              used up to the c a p a c i t y s p e c i f i e d in the Safety Certificate.
              So it is v e r y s u r p r i s i n g now to find, if this is a correct
              report of Dr. Eastwood, that he should be trying to put the
              b lame on ot h e r s for              the e x i s t e n c e of these barriers in w h i c h he
              had b e e n c l o s e l y i n v olved b o t h in            t h e i r introduction and in
              their a p p r o v a l y e a r by year.

        MR.    J U S T I C E JOWITT:       I w o n d e r if the i nhibition of lateral m o v e m e n t
               of the radial fence d e p e n d s to a large extent on the state of
               packing.          If you have relative f r e e d o m to mov e I can see well
               ho w a radial fence stops any rapid m o v e m e n t of large n u m b e r s of
q             p e o p l e to one side.          On the o t h e r h and if people are a l r e a d y
               d e n s e l y p a c k e d I suspect that w i t h or with o u t a radial fence
               the p a c k i n g is such          as to prevent lateral movement. I think it
               is g o i n g to be v ery important n e v e r to lose sight of          the
               im p o r t a n t issue of causation.

        MR.     PAYNE:         My Lord, p a c k i n g is an aspect of capacity. If the

                    The point that is being made is that this is something
               that has been known for many years. His Lordship will see it
               is repeated in the 1986 Guide in due course.

                        7.6.1:  "A ground should be divided into sections to
                        prevent major migrations by spectators.  For example,each
                        end or side of a ground should be self contained with its
                        own entrances, exits and toilet/refreshment facilities.
                        There should be no access from one such major s e c t i o n to
                        another except in an emergency.

                        15.1:  "Estimation of safe ground capacity. The foregoing
                        section of the code recommend guidelines for individual
                        features of a ground in isolation. This section suggests
                        a method of calculating the number that can be safely
                        accommodated when taking into account interactions between
                        these individual features w h e n there are deviations from
                        the guidelines.  To facilitate the calculations, a plan of
                        the ground should be available with such details," and so
                        on.

    ^         MR. PAYNE: "To facilitate the calculations, a plan of the
                  ground should be available with such details as
                  (inaudible) and 15.2:

                                "The method assesses the holding capacity of the
                                 terrace, that is standing determined by the
                                 number of seats.”

    B               And over the page at 15.3:

                                "The number of people that can be safely
                                 accommodated on the terrace is however
                                 either its holding capacity or the capacity of
                                 an exit system from it, whichever is the
                                 smaller.”

#   C               15.4(1):

                                "The capacity of a terrace or viewing slope
                                 should be assessed from the area available
                                 for standing; that area of the terrace or
                                 viewing slope from which the whole of the
                                 playing area can be seen, excluding gangways,
                                 while allowing packing density between 54 and 27
    D                            persons per 10 square metres, depending upon the
                                 condition of the terrace or slope."

                      My Lord, I do not read on but the Police ask your Lordship
                      to see that as long ago as 1976, very careful attention was
                      being given to the formulae to be used to assess the
                      capacity of particular areas in the ground. Certainly no-
                      one is thinking that it should depend upon regional
    k                 impression.

              MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: A standing area needs, for safety's sake,
                  to be sufficiently small that the permitted maximum has
                  meaning. Otherwise it would depend very largely on simply
                  putting to the test the permitted maximum. You may still
                  have unsafe packing because they congregate in a particular
                  favoured area. It is a matter of splitting it up?

              MR. PAYNE: Indeed, that, as your Lordship may have in mind,
                  was the cause of the introduction of the first set of
                  radial fences in 1981 because of just such an incident
                  earlier in the season when a number of fans in the then
                  open west terrace, where people go where they like, crowded
                  into one particular area.

                           My Lord, that completes looking at the 1976 Green
                      Guide and it is now convenient to go straight to the 1986
                      Green Guide, which I hope your Lordship has in a little
                      booklet in the original form - looking, I hope, like this?
                      My Lord, this is the edition of the Green Guide that
                      was in force at the time of the disaster and accordingly is
                      the one which ought to be complied with.

    ^                      My Lord, the introduction to the Guide, in the
                      introductory paragraphs; I read 8 and 11:

                                "It should be born in mind when using the Guide
                                 to assess whether existing circumstances provide
                                 adequately for the safety of spectators, the
                                 criteria to be aiming for is that of a reasonable
                                 degree of safety. It would be unreasonable, even
    B                            if it were practical to seek the absolute safety of
                                 everyone attending the ground"

                      and 11, using the Guide:

                                "The principles referred to at paragraphs 4 to 10
                                 above should be kept in mind by both ground
                                 management and where applicable by the local
                                 authority when applying the Guide to an
                                 individual ground. The Guide is an aid to not
                                 a substitute for professional judgment and
                                 commonsense."

                      The material paragraphs then start at 12:

                                "Although some of the safety standards are likely
                                 to apply to all sports grounds, however many
                                 spectators are present, it is nonetheless
                                 important to relate the Guide to the needs of
                                 the individual ground. It should be born in
                                 mind that in most circumstances the required
                                 safety standard to be attained often relate to
                                 the maximum number of spectators who are liable
                                 to be admitted to the ground or parts of it.
                                 For example: a large football stadium with a
                                 maximum spectator capacity of tens of thousands
                                 is liable to pose significant crowd pressure
f                                risks. To accommodate safely a maximum crowd at
                                 such a ground might entail substantial remedial
                                 work. Alternatively, consideration might be given
                                 to accepting a much smaller number of spectators
     F                           who, properly disbursed, could be accommodated
                                 safely without having to incur costly repairs or
                                 alterations."

                            The next passage which follows,we submit, is of great
                       significance in this case.   The fist step, therefore, is to
                       assess, using the Guide's criteria, how many can be safely
                       accommodated in the different sections of the ground, given
                       the existing condition of the ground, i.e. to determine a
                       safe spectator capacity. This should be done with a proper
                       detailed plan, preferably drawn to scale.

                                23: "The safety of the public inside the ground is
                                the responsibility of those who stage the event and
                                administer the ground in which it is held, that is
                                the management. This responsibility applies in both

                           authority's safety officers, fire and police officers
^                          will help management to discharge this responsibility
                           and in certain circumstances may require measures
                           to be taken in order to achieve reasonable safety
                           standards but the management is not thereby absolved
                           from its responsibility to the safety of its
                           customers."

          MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:   Of course, one then has to ask how has
B             management chosen to carry out those responsibilities?

          MR. PAYNE:             Yes.

          MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:   And that may raise then issues as between
               management and those carrying them out as to the way in
               which the blame falls?

C         MR. PAYNE: Certainly. My Lord, your Lordship clearly has in
              mind that the Police were looking at and in a position to
              observe the entry of the fans into the west terrace,
              through the turnstiles and then entering on the terrace.
              The management cannot absolve itself of its responsibility
              for the system which is being employed by the Police.
              Then it is quite plain that what the Police were doing
              was to operate a "find your own level" system, which the
D            management themselves had devised.

                       My Lord, at 44: this repeats what was in the 1976
                  Guide:

                           "Where admission to a ground or parts of it is
                            controlled by turnstiles, these by their number
                            and location control not only the rate of
^                           admission ...."

                 My Lord, I will not read on. It is a direct repetition of
                 the function of turnstiles in controlling the access of
                 people to particular areas of the ground.

                           101:        My Lord, another important paragraph:
F
                            "Division of spectator accommodation. The ground
                             should be divided into sections to prevent
                             potentially hazardous migrations by spectators.
                             Each section of the ground has its own limit of
                             safe capacity and a major migration can cause
                             dangerous overcrowding. Each section of the
                             ground, for example, each end or side, should be
G                            self-contained with its own entrances, exits and
                             toilet refreshment facilities. In certain
                             grounds in particular there should be no access
                             from one such major section to another except
                             in an emergency"

                  and he deals with other types of ground.

A                      217, my Lord. My Lord, this is the first paragraph in
                 a chapter entitled, "Estimation of safe ground capacity"*
                 and it is headed, "To assess the number of spectators which
                 can be safely accommodated account should be taken of the
                 features of the individual ground; its configuration;
                 general condition; use and any deviations from the Guide’s
                provisions." Your Lordship will have in mind the division
                 of the west terrace by the radial fences. The previous
B               sections of the Guide give guidelines and safety
                 considerations for individual features of the ground. This
                 section suggests a method of calculating the number of
                people that can be safely accommodated when taking into
                 account the interactions between these individual features
                 and where there are deviations from the guidelines.

                      The following paragraphs contain as of necessity
C               generalised guidelines in view of the wide variety, the
                 types, sizes and configurations of sports grounds, their
                use and general condition. Your Lordship can hear in that
                 paragraph an echo of that opening paragraph of the Guide
                which refers to professional judgment and commonsense:

                           "To facilitate the calculations, a plan of the
                            ground should be available with such details as
D                           exits, stands, terraces, stairways and so on"

                 and then I am not going to read the rest of it but your
                 Lordship will see that the chapter goes on to give quite
                 a helpful formula for the assessment of a safe capacity for
                 each section of the ground, having regard to the individual
                 features of the ground using professional judgment and
                 commonsense....

^                My Lord, that completes the examination looking at the
                 Green Guide.

                      I turn now to see how this worked in the particular
                 case of the west terrace at the stadium by going to
                 bundle 1 at page 57. When I say how it worked, I ought to
                 have said how it did not work.

B        MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                     Yes.

         MR. PAYNE: My Lord, this is a document produced, as your
             Lordship sees in the heading, by South Yorkshire County
             Council in connection with the application by the
             management at the Hillsborough football ground for a
             Certificate of Safe Capacity under the Safety of Sports
             Grounds Act 1979. It was produced, therefore, in the lead
C           up period to the Certificate which your Lordship saw a
             little while ago, which gives the estimation of safe
             capacity of the ground. Your Lordship sees that it is
             headed: "Notes for the guidance of applicants for Safety
             Certificates".

                      This document came into the hands of the Club, which
                was then thinking of making an application for a Safety
D               Certificate. If your Lordship keeps page 57 open and turns
                 to page 66, this is a letter of the 25th October 1978 from
                 the Club addressed to the Engineer:

                           "Dear Sir,

                           SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975
F
                          Under the above Act this Club has been designated as
                          from the 1st January 1979 and it is necessary for us
                          to provide certain information to the South Yorkshire
                          County Council in order that we can apply for a
                          General Safety Certificate.

                          For your information, I am enclosing a copy of a note
p                         which sets out the type of information and plans which
                          the County Council will require.

                say, it is helpful just to go on to 70 which is the letter
                of Dr. Eastwood's appointment. It is dated a few months
                later - sorry, it is five weeks or so later, the
                1st December 1978, and here is the part about appointing
                Dr. Eastwood officially:

                                                             36.
D.L. S E L L E R S & C o . / W. LLOYD WOODLAND




\                           "Dear Dr. Eastwood,

                           Further to your meeting with my Chairman,
                           Mr. H. E. McGee yesterday, it was unanimously resolved
                           at our Board Meeting last evening that you be
                           commissioned to act on our behalf in our dealings with
                           the South Yorkshire Council and/or the Sheffield
                           Metropolitan District Council in relation to our
B                          ground being designated under the Safety of Sports
                           Grounds Act."

                  My Lord, with those letters in mind, would your Lordship be
                  kind enough to look at the memorandum from South Yorkshire
                  County Council at page 57 to see what matters were drawn: to
                  the attention of the Club and the Engineer as being
                  requisite to put into the Safety Certificate or the
C                 application of the Safety Certificate.  It says who they
                  should go to in paragraph 1, In paragraph 2 it says that
                  they have got to be submitted in quadruplicate with a
                  remittance and a fee, and a number of plans must accompany
                  the application (which I do not think I need to trouble
                  your Lordship with except that they are very detailed).

                           Then at paragraph 4 (at the bottom of the page):

                            "The following additional information must be       c
                            supplied:-        ■

                            (a) The estimated spectator capacity of each separate
                                stand, and each separate area for spectator
                                standing.
E
                            (b) Details of all general and emergency lighting
                                arrangements,"

                  and all sorts of other safety measures which your Lordship
                  sees down to (g). So far as capacity is concerned, it is
                  4(a) which is the important point.

p                    My Lord, having received instructions from the Club by
                 the letters which your Lordship has just seen, and having
                 been given the brief from South Yorkshire County Council,
                 Dr. Eastwood set to work and he produced two editions of a
                 report which I intend to pass over the first one (which is
                 the first draft) and go straight to the main report which
                 he produced on the 17th January 1979 at page 92 in the
                 bundle. My Lord, this is a report dated the 17th January
G                addressed to the Club, headed "Application for a
                 Certificate of Ground Safety under the Safety of Sports
                 Grounds Act, 1975". I do not need read any of it, except
                 what is material for the assessment of the capacity of the
                 particular areas, which are at page 9 5 at the bottom. He
                 is dealing with the West Terrace - and I do not read the
                 narrative - and over the page on page 96, about six lines
                 or so down, I think I ought to read this in order to put it
D.L. S E L L E R S & C o . / W. LLOYD WOODLAND




^                in context.  I start at the bottom of 95 (I beg your
                 Lordship's pardon):

                           "The west terrace has a total area of 1480 sq. m. but
                           there are no gangways. We feel that some allowance
                           should be made for circulation space as spectators
                          have to move quite considerable horizontal distances
                           to achieve good packing. The full area would justify
B                         about 8,000 spectators, but we suggest it would
                          probably be appropriate to allow 10% as the equivalent
                          of gangways giving a capacity of 7,200 spectators.
                          The barriers should be designed to match this figure
                          approximately. Those barriers which cannot withstand
                          6kN/m should be appropriately strengthened, and extra
                          ones provided where necessary.

C                         The extra barriers required to achieve approximately
                          7,200 capacity are shown in red on the attached copy
                          of drawing 1610/2X.

                          The three exits have a total width of about 11.5m
                          which would permit about 1,250 people per minute to
                          leave the ground. Thus the terrace could be emptied
                          in about six minutes, which is very satisfactory.

                          The guide suggests thateveryone on a terrace should
                          be within 12m of a gangway or exit. There are no
                          gangways and some spectators will be 25m from an exit.
                          But we feel this is of no consequence as movement
                          horizontally along this terrace will be easy and
                          quick."

                     My Lord, it may be helpful, both at this point and
                also later in this examination of the history, to have open
                the   drawing at Appendix 4 in the Taylor Report, which is a
                diagram of the west terrace. You see the point that
                Dr. Eastwood is making here. Of course, at this time the
                whole of the west terrace was open - none of these radial
                fences were in position except the one between the north-
P               west corner and the rest of the terrace - so that when
                Dr. Eastwood says that the distance between spectators (in
                his last paragraph - he says:

                           "The guide"

                 (he has got in mind the Green Guide)

G                          "suggests that everyone on a terrace should be within
                           12m of a gangway or exit. There are no gangways and
                           some spectators will be 25m from an exit."

                That is more than double what it says in the Green Guide.
                He is pointing out that with the configuration of the
                 terrace as it was at this time in 1979, he says at page 96
                that he feels this would be of no consequence as movement
H               horizontally along that terrace would be easy and quick.

    A                 The comment has to be made here that nothing changed about
                      the means of escape between 1979 and the date of the
                      Disaster, except that these radial fences were put in
                      blocking horizontal movement along the terrace, which
                      Dr. Eastwood was relying on in 1979 as an easy and quick
                      movement if people needed to leave. My Lord, however, the
                      main point to be got out of this paragraph is that
                      Dr. Eastwood has done his arithmetic and arrived at 7,200
                      spectators for the whole width of the terrace.

                           Then he goes on to look at the right-hand corner, "The
                      North West Corner Reinforced Concrete Terrace", and he does
                      the arithmetic and arrives, on the next page at 97, at
                      2,900 spectators. Does your Lordship have that at the top
                      of the page?

^   C         MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                    Yes.

              MR. PAYNE: He says that this would bring the total standing at
                  the Leppings Lane end to 10,100.

                           My Lord, those figures then were the ones which were
                      incorporated in the Safety Certificate which your Lordship
                      has seen. That, as your Lordship knows, is at page 159.
    D                 There are Dr. Eastwood's figures in Schedule 3 Part 1,
                      "Crowd Capacity: West Terrace 7,200, North West Terrace
                      2,900".

                           My   Lord, as a matter of fact the figure of 2,900 which
                      remained unamended from 1979 up to the date of theDisaster
                      was significantly wrong and should have been 2,242, which
                      is about a 20% error.
    E
              MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                    It should be?

              MR. PAYNE:              It should be 2,242.

              MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                     That is the north west terrace?

    P         MR. PAYNE: That is the north west terrace. My Lord, that
                  figure appears at page 1266, which will be in bundle 3.
                  Perhaps your Lordship would just be kind enough to look at
                  that for a moment. My Lord, this is a recent letter from
                  Dr. Eastwood to Sheffield City Council dated the
                  4th January 1990. He says:

                                "Please excuse the delay in giving a detailed response
    G                           to your letter of 6 December 1989."

                      This is under the heading "Sheffield Wednesday Football
                      Crowd Capacity of North West Corner".

                                "I needed to have some checks made on the measurements
                                of the terrace. Arrangements were made for these
                                measurements to be made on two occasions. Each time



                                                              39.
                                                                                         A
    D.L. S E L L E R S & CO. / W. LLOYD WOODLAND




    ^                          there was heavy rain all day.         The work was completed
                               just before Christmas.

                              By way of background, you will no doubt be aware that
                              we did not carry out a survey of the Leppings Lane end
                              of the ground when the original safety certificate was
                              applied for in 1978-79.”

    g                My Lord, we are surprised to see that, because in view of
                     the detailed letter your Lordship has been looking at, it*
                     certainly looked as if it was based on some sort of a
                     survey and some sort of arithmetic to arrive at these
                     figures which were put here.

              MR.     JUSTICE JOWITT: Isn't the answer found in the next
                     sentence of the letter?
•   C
              MR. PAYNE:            Quite.

              MR.     TOULSON: If my friend is taking this point, I wonder if
                     your Lordship would be kind enough to note pages 67and 69
                     in the core bundle, that I will come back to later.

              MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                  Yes.
    D
              MR. PAYNE:            Thank you very much.

                               I would like to finish reading this letter, please:

                               "The Club provided drawings"

                     -                     so he is saying it was based on drawing provided by the
    E                Club.

                               "There were no drawings available of the older parts
                               of the ground (the Kop and the South Stand) and we
                              were commissioned by the Club to make the necessary
                              measurements on site, for which we quoted a specific
                               fee. This is all well documented in our
     P                        correspondence with the Club at the time and in our
                               report to them in January 1979.

                              We have now measured the upper part of the North West
                               corner, and there is considerable discrepancy between
                               the actual measurement and those scaled from the
                               drawings based upon that provided by the Club.
                               Instead of the 2,900 which is notionally being
    G                         considered to be the capacity of the upper North West
                               corner, the total area available would in fact only
                               take 2,242 on the basis of 54 spectators to 10 sq. m."

                      So it is basically the fault of the drawing.

              MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                  What do you say I get from this point?

     H

              MR. PAYNE: My Lord, what you get is that the figure which had
                  been put in the Safety Certificate was significantly wrong.

              MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                  That is the figure of 2,900.

              MR. PAYNE: That is the figure of 2,900, was significantly
                  wrong. No-one noticed this for ten years. Dr. Eastwood
                  made - as your Lordship is about to see through the
    B             documents, frequent visits to the ground and himself (as he
                  says in one of his letters) frequently attended as a
                  spectator when matches took place. The Club, of course,
                  ran the ground year in and year out through a decade of
                  seasons and it never crossed anyone's mind until after this
                  disaster that there was a significant discrepancy between
                  the certified capacity of the ground and what it ought to
                  b e . If your Lordship considers that point in the context
•   c             of the case for the Club and the Engineer, that the Police
                  were wrong in their visual assessment of the capacity, then
                  your Lordship will see in context what we say is the
                  futility of the system introduced by the Club upon which
                  they now found their case. They are saying the Police got
                  it all wrong, the visual assessment failed and it is their
                  fault.
    D         MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: In other words, the history in relation to
                  the north west terrace shows how unsafe the guide is in
                  relation to      (inaudible).

              MR. PAYNE:            My Lord, that is the point.

A                    Your Lordship has seen the run up to the Certificate and
                     the issue of the Certificate. The next incident which took
                     place which gave rise to the introduction of the first set
                     of fences was the overcrowding incident in 1981. I am not
                     going to dwell upon it, but your Lordship needs to just
                     know where it is and to see the points made in the bundle,
                     which are at 185. I will pass over this shortly. This, is
                     a letter from Sheffield Wednesday to the County Council,
                     and it reports in the middle paragraph:

                               "From our enquiries, it appears the crushing was
                               caused through Tottenham supporters arriving late due
                               to problems on the motorway, rushing to their places
                               after the game had commenced, causing problems to the
                               spectators at the front of the terracing who had been
£                              in the ground a considerable length of time."

                      My Lord, I pass over any further reference to what
                      happened, merely recording that there was a crushing
                      episode, and go on to what they did about it, which is at
                      196. This memorandum is referred to by Lord Justice Taylor
                      in his report at paragraph 124. It is the memorandum
                      itself which is useful to look at.


              MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                Do you want me to read what is said in the
                  Taylor report?


              MR. PAYNE: My Lord, it would be helpful if yourLordship would
                  be kind enough to look at 124.
E
                                "Those being crushed called for the perimeter gates to
                                be opened on to the track."

                      This is 1981.

                                "There was no immediate reaction according to Mr. Vaux
                                who was there, but fortunately a Police Inspector gave
F                               instructions and the gates were then opened. About
                                250 came out on to the track. There were broken arms,
                                legs and ribs.   ... It is clear from the documents
                                (a) that the turnstile readings showed the capacity
                                figure of 10,100 had been exceeded by over 400; (b)
                                that the police shut off further access to the
                                terraces because of crushing;"

                       In other words, they responded to what they saw on that
                       occasion.

                                "and (c) the police view after the event was that the
                                capacity figure of 10,100 in the Safety Certificate
                                was too high. This latter view was communicated to
                                the Club by the Chief Superintendent then in command
                                of F Division but it was not pursued."



                                                          42.

                       If your Lordship has that document, 196 in the bundle, the
                       Chief Superintendent is Mr. Herold. The memorandum
                       referred to is on this page. The paragraph concerned is
                       about half-way down:

                                 "I have informed Mr. England, the Club Secretary, that
                                 our consensus view is that the 10,100 crowd figure
                                 specified in the Safety Certificate is too high*
                                 Understandably, he refutes this and defends the
                                 position by stating that the former capacity, prior to
                                 the implementation of the Safety at Sportsground Act,
                                 at Hillsborough in December 1979 was 11,100, and that
                                 on a number of occasions in previous all-ticket
                                 matches the terracing has accommodated that number.
                                 Certainly at the 1980 semi-final, when we again had a
                                 capacity crowd of 50,000-odd, we also had some
                                 hundreds of forged tickets all for the Leppings Lane
                                 end and, apart from one very minor crushing of
                                 spectators, there was no problem.”



               MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                   Just remind me, who is Mr. England?
    D
               MR. PAYNE:              He is the Club Secretary, my Lord.

                                 "Mr. England has been acquainted with our view that
                                 the Leppings Lane terracing should be sectioned
                                 vertically front to back to produce pens to enable
                                 more accurate crowd control and prevent sideways
    E                            movement, and he is already actively considering this.
                                 He has also considered using turnstiles 1 to 4 for one
                                 part of the terracing and 5 to 6 for another part, and
                                 controlling the crowd entering through those
                                 turnstiles by the placing of safety barriers in that
                                 open area between the Leppings Lane turnstiles and the
                                 back of the west stand terracing. I agree with him
                                 that for most matches that would possibly work, but
    F                            have grave reservations as to its efficacy for the
                                 potentially troublesome games. Additionally, to
                                 implement it, he would have to find some way for
                                 spectators to enter the west stand without crossing
                                 the other corridors of supporters."

                       So your Lordship can now see here the germ of the idea
                       which eventually was to result in the first partitioning of
                       the terrace. The initial idea which is being considered is
                       not only that the terrace should be partitioned but also
                       that separate turnstiles should be provided for what would
                       now be the separate sections of the terrace.

                            In consequence of this incident in 1981 and the
                       discussions which your Lordship has seen reflected in the
    H                  papers, Dr. Eastwood, in his capacity as the Engineer
                       employed by the Club, was then commissioned to draw up


                                                              43.
    D .L S E L L E R S & C o . / W. LLOYD WOODLAND




                      various designs to put it into effect. My Lord, this
                      exercise beings in the bundle at page 206; records of this
                      exercise, I should say.

                           This is a note from the files of Dr. Eastwood
                      entitled, "Entrance arrangements at Leppings Lane":

                                "Present System: Turnstiles 1 to 6 inclusive give
                                access to the north stand seating. Turnstiles 7 to«18
                                inclusive give access to the west and north west
                                terraces. Turnstiles A to E inclusive give access to
                                the west stand seating. All spectators using
                                turnstiles 7 to 18 and A to E mingle once inside the
                                ground."


•
                      Now, I think it necessary, my Lord, in order to follow this
                      exercise now, to look at another Appendix at the back of
    c                 the Taylor Report bundle. It is Appendix 1. Your Lordship
                      can see the areas that are being referred to here. The
                      layout of the turnstiles as it appears in this diagram is
                      substantially the same (although with one minor alteration
                      which your Lordship is going to see in the documents) as it
                      was at the time in 1981 when they were considering the
    D                 introduction of these fences. The configuration of the
                      turnstiles is certainly the same.   The area between the
                      back of the stand and the turnstiles is the open area that
                      they are talking about and which is being referred to in
                      the memorandum by Mr. Herald when they were talking about
                      putting in fences to provided separate access from the
                      turnstiles, and so on.

    E
              MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: It looks as though at the time of the
                  incident we are enquiring into, two extra turnstiles had
                  been taken from --


              MR. PAYNE:              From the big section.
    F
              MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: From the big section, to be included in
                  the north stand.


              MR. PAYNE:              My Lord, yes, broadly that is correct.


    G         MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                    Yes.


              MR. PAYNE: The rest of this memorandum goes on to discuss
                  possible alternatives and, unless I am asked to, I do not
                  intend to read it, because it is best illustrated by the
                  drawings or the sketches which were prepared, which really
    jl            say everything that is in the narrative.  So I go on to
                  those at page 208 and 209. Starting at page 208, this is


                                                            44.
D.L. S E L L E R S & C o . / W. LLOYD WOODLAND




                     one of the schemes considered by Dr. Eastwood to give
                     effect to what the Police and the Club have been talking
                     about. There are various points which your Lordship may
                     find helpful to notice. First of all, looking from the
                     bottom of the plan upwards, it is proposed that there
                     should be a new turnstile block and queueing area which, as
                     it has been designed in this sketch, looks as if it has
                     been designed to provide access only to this bottom or
B                    south end of the west terrace. People find their way round
                     the end of the stand.  I think where that dotted line goes,
                     they can get under the stand there; and then round the
                     corner and into the bottom, south, new section, which has
                     been allocated the number 2,400 plus 550. "Turnstiles
                     provided, 3 plus 1." In the little block in this sketch -
                     and it is obviously a very preliminary drawing while they
                     are just considering the ideas — he has actually put "Four
                     turnstiles". But the important point, we submit, is that
                     the Engineer here has correctly directed his mind to the
                     criteria in the Green Guide and also to the Notes for
                     Guidance provided by the City Council, that particular
                     capacity numbers should be allocated to each separate area
                     of the ground, and he is providing separate turnstiles for
                     that area. As your Lordship's eye runs up the page, it can
D                    be seen that that is being done for each of these new
                     sections. The middle section has got 2,400 crossed out.
                     Somebody has thought of a number and then something has
                     gone wrong with it, but a separate number of turnstiles is
                     provided for that.


              MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                That seems to be the tunnel to pens 3 and
E                 4.


              MR. PAYNE: What eventually became pens 3 and 4, but at                this
                  stage, of course, there was no dividing fence. The                only
                  new fences they are putting in are those two which,               as your
                  Lordship can see, are marked "New radial fence", up               the
                  right-hand side of the diagram.


              MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                And that effectively makes your pens 3 and
                  4, does it not?


              MR. PAYNE: No, pens 3 and 4 were made by further sub-dividing
                  the middle pen.


              MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: What I mean is that that gives you your
                  overall area which now is pens 3 and 4.


              MR. PAYNE: Correct, that is right. Your Lordship has the
                  point that separate turnstile access is being provided.                A
 H                particular number of turnstiles is being allocated to a


                                                          45.

A                particular capacity in each new section - we say perfectly
                  correctly;  the design is as it should be.

                       Over the page at page 209, this is an alternative
                  scheme which contains many of the same elements of the
                  previous scheme, although there are a lesser number of
                  walls or fences on the concourse area. It again proposes
                  that there should be a new turnstile and queueing area for
B                the bottom part of the terrace. As your Lordship's eye
                  runs up the terrace, your Lordship can see that particular
                  numbers and particular numbers of turnstiles are being
                  planned for each of the new sections.


           MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: Effectively, it provides                    more turnstiles
r             for the 3/4 area, does it not?


           MR. PAYNE:             Yes, my Lord, that is the difference.


          MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                    And a larger concourse?


          MR. PAYNE: That is the difference. The relevance of it is
              that, bearing in mind the advice which is to be found in
              the Green Guide about the assessment of capacity for
              particular pens, the point which the Police make is that
              this had been taken on board at the time by the Engineer
              and by the Club, to whom these drawings were submitted, and
              they were correctly directing their mind to the correct
E             criteria in the interests of safety to comply with the
              requirements that they had been shown by the Notes for
              Guidance and by the Green Guide.

                       My Lord, this exercise continued correctly for a
                  little while until it went wrong. My Lord, at 217, the
                  Engineer is writing to the County Council;

F                           "We have been instructed by the Club to organise the
                            installation of two radial fences on the terrace at
                            the Leppings Lene end of the ground.   It is intended
                             that these fences are so positioned that they divide
                             this section of the terrace into approximately three
                            equal areas, each served by its own entrance. By
                            dividing the terrace, more control over supporters
                            should result. A visiting team with only a few
u                           followers would be allocated one section, the other
                             two sections retained by the home supporters. Larger
                            contingents of visiting spectators could be
                            accommodated in two or three areas as their numbers
                            dictate. A 1.15 metre wide gate is proposed at the
                            rear of each fence to give access for maintenance and
                            also policing during the game."
H
                   So that was the idea of it to start with.
    D.L. S E L L E R S & C o . / W. LLOYD W OODLAND




                                 "The gate could be left open but fastened back to
                                 connect the areas during a game if adjacent ones ace
                                 occupied by supporters of the same team."

           "If the two new sections are to be occupied by supporters of the same
           persuasion then the gate will be left open so that they can sort themselves
           out between the two terraces. When establishing the height consider that
           the views of the corner flags should not be restricted any further than they
A          are at present by the perimeter fence. We propose the top of the fence
            should be approximately 1680 mms above the terrace." My Lord unless I am
           asked to I am not going to read the rest of the letter and my Lord the work
           then proceeded and the documents which record it are at 233. "The work on the
           radial fences and security gates indicated in our drawings 3563 1 - 3 which
            is sent to you on the 2nd September 1981 is now substantially complete."
                 My Lord, we do not have and it has not emerged on discovery and I am
B          not criticising anybody because these documents are quite old, but we dor
           not appear to have anywhere, and if it exists we request that it be shown
           to us, a copy of drawing number 63/3. The drawings which your Lordship
            looked at were 1 and 2 at pages 208 and 209. Thfey are the ones which had_
            the concourse .area divided up by the new walls or barriers so it is possible
            that drawing 3 is the one which dropped that part of the idea altogether,
            because in fact what happened was that instead of proceeding as proposed
            in drawings 1 or 2, that alllin fact was done was to introduce the new
C          radial fences without at the same time providing separate turnstile access
            to each one and without dividing up the concourse, so that the number in a
            particular area could be controlled by its own turnstiles.
                 Your Lordship sees in the Taylor appendix 4 drawing where those two
            new radial fences went in on the terrace.
D MR. JUSTICE 00WITT: They are the grey ones?
     MR. PAYNE: Yes, pale green/grey. Light grey on the photocopy.       Is that a
          convenient moment to break off?
  MR. JUSTICE 00WITT: May I mention something which I would be grateful if
       Counsel would consider. It is about the way in which one tackles the
       evidence in this case, because having read the Taylor report, studied the
E     issues and read the experts' reports I have given some thought to what
       ought to be my own approach. Reading the Taylor report and in due course
       you will tell me if I have reached the wrong conclusion about the state
       of the evidence, prior to 252, pens 3 and 4 were uncomfortable but it is
       unlikely there would have been any fatality had not they (inaudible) at *a
       time when the tunnel remained open. The pressure which then quickly built
        up in those pens consequent upon the inrush of spectators following the
        opening of Gate C was such that for practical purposes movement sideways
F      and to the rear was impossible. The only way was forwards which was
        stopped by the perimeter fence, hence the crushing injuries, as one could
        see from the video equipment which I am invited to look at and compare one
        can see police officers and spectators gesturing to the fans. I think
        anyone who has read the report can understand what was happening, which
        was really an appeal to those further back to move back to relieve the
        pressure.
G                 If I am correct so far it may be that whether there were adequate
             means of evacuation save on to the pitch has no real bearing on causation.
             The only means of escape, had it been there, would have been on to the
             pitch. It seems to me the issues really can be grouped under three heads.
             Why did pressure build up at the turnstiles and in Leppings Lane to the
             point at which gate C had to be opened? I say had to be opened because, as
             I understand it, it seems to be common ground that the time came when
 H          gate C did have to be opened. Secondly, ought the tunnel to have been closed
             off before gate C was opened; and thirdly, what other factors contributed
             to the crushing injuries in pens 3 and 4?
D.L. S E L L E R S & C o . / W. LLOYD WOODLAND




                 Shall I read those again? Why did the pressure build up at the
            turnstiles and in Leppings Lane to the point at which gate C had tobe
            opened. Secondly, ought the tunnel to have been closed before gate C
.          was opened? Thirdly, what other factors contributed to the crushing
            injuries in pens 3 and 4?
                 That has seemed to me to be a sensible way in which I might think
            about the discipline in the case in order to arrive at a conclusion..
            Also it seems to me it concentrates one's mind not simply on fault but
            on the causative fault. That is, I stress again, going to be important.
            If Counsel are agreed that is a useful way to approach the case, and if
B          it not I hope to be told, it may be that the adducing of evidence could
            have some relation to that, and one can try and group the various issues
            under those, three considerations. I suspect it may be discovered that
            not all the 45 issues are really going to assist when one comes to the
            question of causation. I say that now T- I know you have not finished
            opening your case, so that counsel can consider it.

q                                                Lunch adjournment
  MR. PAYNE: My Lord, I have got to page 8 in the skeleton opening and your
       Lordship has been looking at the 1981 designs. My Lord, for our part,
       the three questions which your Lordship posed before the adjournment
       we of course accept that they are helpful. My LOrd, what I would hope
       to do to answer them constructively would be to proceed with the opening
       and then to answer them in the light of has emerged during the opening
D     at theconclusion of doing that.
    MR. JUSTICE OOWITT: Is it agreed that is a sensible way to try and approach
         the issues in the case?
  MR. PAYNE: My Lord, I have not been able to discuss this with my learned friends
       unfortunately. I do not think for the moment my Lord I would like to
       abandon the issues upon which we have previously agreed, and to which we
E     have all pleaded — at least we have pleaded and the others have commented.
       So I do not quite want to go as far as to say that these three issues should
       be decisive.
  MR. JUSTICE OOWITT: No, I do not see it like that. It seems to me that the 45
       issues can be allocated among those three heads. There may be one or more
       issues which belong to more than one had, but in a case where there are so
       many issues and so much evidence, if one is thinking about a case one needs
*     to have some plan of campaign, and I suggest this one as being one which
       relates the issues to the story of the case and keeps one's eye on the
       important issue of causation.
  MR. PAYNE: Quite. Yes, causative fault as your Lordship correctly says. My
       Lord, the idea of trying to devise some headings under which the issues
       can be collected in groups is certainly one we would subscribe to. My
G      Lord, our case is as being opened, and our headings are those which I am
       proceeding to deal with at the moment and, my Lord, we say in fact the
       questions which your Lordship raised do actually fall exactly under the
       headings which I am endeavouring to deal with, and they are aspects of an
       unsafe system. That is really the way we would put the case, but I do not
       want to dodge the questions which your Lordship poses. They are very
       helpful, but they need to be seen in the context of an unsafe system.
        I think that is what we will be saying at the end, whilst answering exactly
H      the questions which your Lordship puts.
D .U S E L L E R S & C o . / W. LLOYD WOODLAND




    MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: As it seems to me, one really asks what role this unsafe
         system had in considering those three issues and considering particularly
         the first and the third.
A MR. PAYNE: Yes. My Lord, I think by the end of the opening our position will
       be clear about that.
    MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: Do you mind if I just ask Mr. Toulson and Mr. Glasgow? Do
         you accept this as a useful approach to the facts in the case?
  MR. GLASGOW: My Lord, we do. We think it is absolutely right, and if I may say
       so we do think there is a danger in having a new series of issues, so to speak,
       being introduced. I make no criticism of my learned friend. It is most
       helpful. He has kindly let us have a written copy of the opening, but although
       well seen from the Police point of view simply to have a new list of5headings
       using the word "system" now for the first time is not really as helpful as
       concentrating people's minds on the real issue. We think that to take the
       45 issues under the 3 heads is in fact far more useful, and perhaps after
       the opening has finished my friend could see the wisdom of that without
^     abandoning any of the good points he has made.
    MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: I have perhaps been a little unfair to Mr. Payne. I have
         sprung this upon him in an opening, but I did it at an early stage so that
         counsel had an opportunity to think about it.
    MR. GLASGOW: We think it helps.
D MR* JUSTICE JOWITT: Mr. Payne will open his case in the way he chooses and
       marshall his evidence in that way.
  MR. TOULSON: We are very grateful to your Lordship for raising it at an early
       stage. The answer is an unequivocal yes. It seems to us it goes straight
       to the heart of the three matters which are essentially one: why the build
       which led to open the gate; two: the question surrounding the opening of
       the gate itself, and then the third, are there otherrelevant causative
E     factors? If so they must be identified and looked at if they fall into
       place in that way.
  MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: I did ask at both the earlier hearings before me whether
       there was any issue which could be dealt with separately from others. It
       does seem to me that barrier 144A, whether that was negligently carried
       out is one issue which perhaps can be dealt with separately, but again I
       do not invite any answers to that at the moment. I merely throw it out
F     for consideration.
    MR. TOULSON: My Lord, we have had no proposals and I am very conscious of my
         friend's difficulty with Mr. Wilbraham being ill, about which we are very
         sorry. I appreciate my friend's difficulty opening the case in that way.
         My Lord, it seems to us that that is really a sub-issue of your Lordship's
         3, and when my learned friend has had an opportunity of considering your
         Lordship's formulation and indicated what he says are the relevant causative
         factors under category 3, it may be that there are a number which could be
         identified separately.
    MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: May I say I on the whole like to keep on with the case, but
         if at any time the parties say "Will you retire for a few minutes because
         we want to think about so andso because it mayhelp to speed matters along"
         I shall be very amenable.

         MR. PAYNE: My Lord, as often happens in an exchange like this the position
              adopted by the parties really becomes quite interestinly polarised and
              your Lordship will have noticed that the comments which are made by the
              Club and the Engineer are directed very much to the events of the day,
       A      whereas our case is directed to the systems which gave rise to the
              events.
           MR. JUSTICE 30WITT: That is precisely why I have added the third head, but I
                think what precedes the day may also have a hearing upon the first head.

        MR.     PAYNE:         My Lord, I will      go on. The p oint that             we are asking
                your Lords h i p to no t i c e      at the m o m e n t is that        in 1981 the C lub
                and the E n g i n e e r were con s c i o u s of the n e e d to         assess the
                c a p a c i t y of the n e w a reas w h i c h they were then           c r e ating b y the
                d i v i s i o n of the terrace.

                          If you r L o r d s h i p w o u l d be kind e n o u g h to look at bundle 1
                at pag e 230 one can see a letter p a s s i n g b e t w e e n t h e m w hich
B               shows ho w they had that v e r y m u c h in mind.                 Y o u r L o r d s h i p sees
                the terms of the letter.                   It is from the E n g i n e e r to the C lub
                e n c l o s i n g two co p i e s of a drawing m a r k e d up to indicate the
                standing c a p a c i t i e s of the five areas at the L e p pings Lane end.
                The date is significant, 6th November, 1981.                          Inconveniently
                that d r a w i n g is       in a different bundle, bun d l e 3              at 932. I am
                mistaken, it is             in bundle 2, 932.

C     MR.     J U S T I C E JOWITT:              Yes.

        MR. PAYNE:         Y o u r l o r d s h i p will notice at once that the n u m b e r w h i c h
             was being r e f e r r e d to in 1981 is 64A w h e r e a s the c opy that we
             have got at 932                is 64E rather quaintly, so that     this isa later
             e d i t i o n and it is c l e a r in fact that it has been u sed for
             a n o t h e r p u r p o s e later on to show the dates of testing the
D           barriers beca u s e against eac h of the b a r r i e r s is        a date. That
             is wh y this is a later edition, as we u n d e r s t a n d it.

                          The im p o r t a n t thing for this point is that, having
                intr o d u c e d the n e w barriers, the C l u b and the E n g i n e e r were
                d i s c u s s i n g b e t w e e n t h emselves the c o n s e q u e n c e s and here is this
                d r a w i n g w h i c h shows the numbers w h i c h they a l l o c a t e d to the
                d i f f e r e n t pens.         Y o u r Lordship sees, one's eye runs along the
E               terrace, the s outh west pen is 2,600.                         C e n t r a l pen is given
                2,200. It has got that central barrier in it so o b v i o u s l y this
                has been put on in a later edition of the drawing.                               Originally
                it must have been one pen w ith 2,200.                       T h e n the next one is
                1,600, n o r t h west c o r n e r lower 800, n o r t h west c o r n e r u p p e r is
                still said to be 2,900.

                      Y o u r L o r d s h i p has seen the schemes w h i c h were talked about
F              and d e v i s e d and the w a y in w h i c h the p a r t i e s gave a t t e n t i o n to
               the capacity, but the schemes were not put into effect and if
               y ou r L o r d s h i p goes b a c k to bundle 1 at page 6 8 ---

        MR.      JUST I C E JOWITT:              That    is a list of drawings.

        MR.      PAYNE: Yes it is.        Sorry, I got the wrong numbering, I am
                m i s l e d by that. The one I had in m i n d a c t u a l l y is 233 but that
                is in e r r o r so I a s k y o u r Lordship to go straight on to 342 in
                v olume 1.

        MR.      J U S T I C E JOWITT:           Still       in volume   1?

B       MR.     PAYNE: 324 in V o l u m e               1.     This time the n o t e r   has m a n a g e d   to
                get it right.

        MR. JUST I C E JOWITT:                   Yes.

        MR. PAYNE:          N o w the value of this d r a w i n g is to s h o w the result of
             the 1981 exercises.             Y o u r L o r d s h i p wil l see that this         is a
£            d r a w i n g by E a s twood and Partners.              It is d a t e d in the bo t t o m
             right hand corner J u l y 1985 and it is part of a series of
             d r a w i n g s w h i c h your L o r d s h i p will be c o m e f a m i l i a r with, the
             6705 sequence.              This is drawing n u m b e r 1, and it shows the
             existing layout of the Leppi n g s Lane entrance, my Lord,
             'existing' meaning a f t e r the 1981 w o r k s ha d b een done and it
             r e m ained in the same c o n d i t i o n as it was until J uly 1985.                    What
             your L o r d s h i p sees is the b a n k of twelve b a r r i e r s in the big
D           semi circle, the b a n k of five b a r r i e r s in the s m a l l e r                line, no
             div i s i o n s at all on the concourse, so t h a t ---

        MR.     JUST I C E JOWITT:               I a m sorry,      w h i c h did you say are the
                barriers?

        MR.     PAYNE:         There are no b a r r i e r s on the co n c o u r s e at all, the
                c on c o u r s e being the a r e a betw e e n the t u r n s t i l e s and the back of
E              the west stand.

        MR.     JUSTICE JOWITT:                  Those are the stairs up to the w est stand,                      are
                they?

        MR.     PAYNE:  That's right, you r L o r d s h i p has that. The tunnel is
                shown as if there wer e noth i n g ove r the top of it.

F       MR.     JUST I C E JOWITT:               Yes.

        MR.     PAYNE:          Therefore, the p o s i t i o n is that the comm e n t I make
                before passing q u i c k l y on is that in 1981, having c o r r e c t l y
                a d d r e s s e d t h e m s e l v e s to the safe c a p acity of the ne w pens w h i c h
                they c r e a t e d and also the nee d to introduce d i v i d i n g w alls or
                b a r r i e r s on the c o n c o u r s e area in o rder to control access to
                those n e w pens, and also the need to have a p a r t i c u l a r nu m b e r
                of t u r n s t i l e s for a p a r t i c u l a r capac i t y in e a c h pen, in fact as
                your L o r d s h i p has seen in all the documents, having c o r r e c t l y
                c o n s i d e r e d those m a t t e r s w h i c h are all in line as r e q uired by
                the G r e e n Guide and the Safety Certificate, in fact those ideas
                were all not followed up and no d i v i s i o n s were made on the
                t u r n s t i l e s to the b a c k of the stand.

                              The next thing that h a p p e n e d was that a fter the pass a g e of
                    several years in 1985 the q u e s t i o n arose a g a i n of further
                    s e g r e g a t i o n of the Leppi n g s Lane end, the purpose b e i n g to
                    e n a b l e the Police to separate groups of suppo r t e r s into home
                    an d away.           So your L o r d s h i p will find this s e g r e g a t i o n idea
                    first being p r o p o s e d and your L o r dship will the n see the
                    a t t i t u d e w h i c h the police took w h e n the idea was first put up.

                              As you r L o r dship looks at s ubsequent d o c u m e n t s we a s k your

                             Item B at the b o t t o m of the page:

                             "The C l u b r e c a l l e d the p r a c t i c e following c o n s u l t a t i o n

                             v i s i t i n g s u p p o r t e r s at the rea r of the stand in ce rt a i n

                             oc c a s i o n s it is the p o l i c y of the Police to e nter
                             e x c lusive use by v i s i t i n g s upporters of the west stand and
                             t e r r a c e ."

                             Then the y go on a bout the weather.                 O v e r the page:

                              "It was agreed (i) That the Clu b w ould c o n s i d e r at some
                              future date a scheme for p e r m a n e n t barriers at the rear of
                              the stand, subject to any pro p o s a l s being s u b mitted
                              for p r i o r a p p r o v a l by the O f f i c e r Working Party."

                              So here comes the idea a gain of s e g r e gation on the
                    concourse.         At 275 the Police put their two p enny w o r t h in, a
                    l e t t e r from Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t M o s e l e y to Mr. C h e s t e r of the
                    C l u b e a r l y in 1985:

                              "With r e ference to our c o n v e r s a t i o n of last w e e k r e garding

                              forward h e r e w i t h our thoughts.

                              Y o u wil l see that we favour the e r e c t i o n of a stone wall
                              on the ground side of the current terraces, w i t h such wall

                             s p e c t a t o r goes thro u g h the t u r n s t i l e s he should then be
                             s e g r e g a t e d from the o ther fans, and this can be a c h i e v e d
                             by the e r e c t i o n of per m a n e n t h i g h metal railings on that
                             c o n c r e t e area at present b e h i n d the stand.          Similarly,
                             there should be a h i g h metal rail i n g d own the cent re of
                             the west stand."

                    That does not affect this case.

                             "What is then crea t e d is total s e g r e g a t i o n of all three
                             p o r t i o n s of the terrace and the two areas of the west
                             stand, w i t h eac h of these s e g r e g a t e d areas having its own
                             re f r e s h m e n t and toilet facilities."

                             So that letter speaks for itself and the comment that
                   n e e d s to be m ade about it is that the police are c o n c e r n e d w i t h
                   the segregation, but, of course u n d e r their duties in respect
•   C
                   of the S a f e t y C e r t i f i c a t e and the G r e e n Guide, the Clu b and the
                   E n g i n e e r o ught to have been c o n c e r n e d wit h the safety aspe c t s
                   of these alterations.                In fact, if what the Police were
                   pr o p o s i n g had bee n i m p l e mented then there w ould have been
                   barriers, m e t a l railings, on the c o n crete are a at the b ack of
                   the s tand d i v i d i n g up the pens and pro v i d i n g separate access
                   from s e p arate turn s t i l e s to s e p arate pens.         That is the n o t i o n
    D              that the Police are advocating, but they are a d vocating it for
                   the r e a s o n of segregation.

           MR.     J U S T I C E JOWITT:     I am not quite clear.         What is then c r e a t e d is
                   a total s e p a r a t i o n of all three p o r t i o n s of the terrace.

           MR.     PAYNE:          Yes.

    E      MR.      J U S T I C E JOWITT:            W h i c h three p o r t i o n s are those?

           MR.      PAYNE: Y o u r L o r d s h i p has the d i a g r a m appendix 4 at the bac k                      of

           MR.     J U S T I C E JOWITT:             Yes.

            MR.     PAYNE: We are still pre the 1985 radial fences, so that the
                   terr a c e is d i v i d e d up into the left hand section as we are
                   looking at it from the south stand to the first barrier.

            MR.     J U S T I C E JOWITT:            That   is the b a r r i e r mid tunnel,      is it?

            MR.     PAYNE:         No,     not mid tunnel.

^          MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: Can I just see on the plan, the stone
                wall on the ground side of the current terraces and such
               wall, housing and bank of terraces? Whereabouts would that
               have been looking at Appendix 1?

          MR. PAYNE: I think I am going to have to take instructions
              about that, my Lord, to give you a reliable answer.

B          MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: Just so that I can understand the letter
                on (inaudible).

          MR.      PAYNE: I will come back to that, if              I may?

          MR.      JUSTICE JOWITT:               Very well.

          MR.      PAYNE: It appears as if that letteractuallyaccompanied     a
C                  drawing because he is saying, "You will see that we favour
                  the erection of a stone wall. I forward herewith our
                  thoughts", but regrettably, as far as my researches go, we
                  have not actually been able to unearth "our thoughts."
                  That might be the answer to the question your Lordship is
                  asking, but we will see what we can do about that. That is
                  at the beginning of the letter.

D          MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                   Yes.

          MR. PAYNE: If your Lordship goes on then to 281? This is the
              first of the schemes that was proposed. Now one needs to
              just spend a moment or two looking to see what is being
              contemplated. The three sections of the terrace are still
              as before. The position of the central tunnel can be seen.
              The existing small bank of turnstiles is proposed to be
              removed and two further new banks of turnstiles are to be
              constructed slightly closer to the back of the stand than
              the ones they are replacing. Now looking down the means of
              access to these various sections of the terrace, one looks
              -           starting from the bottom of the plan - at five turnstil
              (counting 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) are provided for south west
              terrace and visiting supporters. Does your Lordship see
P             that, with an arrow showing the way for the supporters to
              go, round the corner of the stand at the bottom of the
              drawing? So that when coming through the south or bottom
              section of turnstiles, a& your Lordship looks at it?

          MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                    Yes.

          MR. PAYNE:   Then they go down the arrow with south                west terrace
G             visiting supporters, round the corner and they                 go into
              visiting supporters terrace and then into five                 turnstiles
              and they are segregated from everybody else by                 a wall or a
               fence with a gate in it.

          MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                    Yes.

          MR. PAYNE:  Then there are three turnstiles in that same bank
H             which give access to the stairs leading into the west


                                                              57.

                  stand. Then there are five new turnstiles which give
                  access to centre terrace visiting supporters and ----

           MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                 What is now pens 3 and 4?

           MR. PAYNE:            Yes.

           MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                 At that stage they are not separate?
B
           MR. PAYNE: Yes. Then the next one is three turnstiles for
               west stand home supporters, going up the stairs. Your
               Lordship sees that?

           MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                 Yes.

           MR. PAYNE: Then there are seven turnstiles allocated to north
C              west terrace home supporters and there is their section of
               the terrace at the top of the diagram, marked "Home
               supporters terrace." By arithmetic, that then provides a
               total of 17 turnstiles for 10,100 certified capacity and
               each section is serviced by its own set of turnstiles and
               segregated from others by new walls or railings with gates
               in them. My Lord, that was the first scheme.

D                      The next scheme is on the next page, 282, which is
                  what your Lordship has just been looking at with some notes
                  on it. Unless I am asked to draw attention to any of the
                  notes, I pass over it and I go on to 283, the relevance of
                  this being to show that this was not a private matter being
                  kept by the engineer to himself but it was being done in
                  discussion with the Club, as you can see:

E                           "I h a v e p l e a s u r e i n e n c l o s i n g t h r e e c o p i e s o f our
                             sketch 2, showing the possible layout which
                             segregates visitors from home supporters
                             reasonably well. Also it allows flexibility in
                             allocating various amounts of accommodation to
                             visitors.         Suggestions are made for new refreshment
                             and toilet areas (inaudible) and so on."
p
                  Now that is as far as drawing number 2 got and the next
                  develoDment was drawing number 3, and I have to ask your
                  Lordship to look at some more documents before I come to
                  drawing number 3. The first one is at 286, while they are
                  still discussing drawing number 2?

           MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                 284 is simply ---
G
           MR. PAYNE:             Is another addition ---

           MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                 A neater form of 282?

           MR. PAYNE:            Yes, it is, my Lord.             It is another copy of drawing
               2.

 H         MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                 Or 286?


                                                            58.
D.L. S E L L E R S & C o . / W. LLOYD WOODLAND




^       MR. PAYNE: 286. Your Lordship remembers now that drawing
            number 2 has been sent by the    Engineerto the Club and here
             is a conversation arising out   of it toMr. Chester of the
             Club from (the initial is Mr.   Strange)and the subject at
             the top, "Alterations to turnstiles at the back of the west
             stand"; a bracket, which does not matter, and then
             "Turnstiles at back of west stand." "He will speak with
             his colleagues" - that is he, Dick Chester (this is a Dr.
B           Eastwood note) - "to decide how many turnstiles are
             required fundamental to scheme, including in the scheme new
             toilets and refreshment areas; keep it basic; it does not
            want any fan's toilets better than home supporters. Told
            him that would be inevitable if we are doing it. O.K., re­
             furbish the old toilets then to the same standard."

        MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:   This is part of a conversation about
C           camera surveillance, I see, from the words in spare
            brackets?

        MR. PAYNE: Yes. My Lord, it is. At 287, there is a further
            record. The significance of all this is merely just to
            draw attention to the fact that they have got well in mind
            the number of turnstiles they need and the importance of
            it, the significance of which will become apparent when one
D           sees what eventually they did.

                     At page 287, here is another discussion about
                turnstiles. Mrs. Sharon Lane from the Club is speaking to
                Mr. Strange and they are discussing the number of
                turnstiles at the back of the west stand wanted. Ten to
                serve the north stand. My Lord, that would be at the north
                end of the large bank of turnstiles. They want 8 to serve
                home standing; 8 to serve away standing and then 4 and 4
                for the west stand. They want 34 total. "We have 29 in
                our scheme. Turnstiles have to be in pairs." He said, "I
                will re-do our scheme and submit it to Dick", Mr. Chester.
                That is 16 turnstiles being called for.

                     My Lord, the next page at 288; this is a meeting....
p              I am hesitating because this is not a meeting which is
                attended by either the Club or the Engineer.  So I am
                reticent really about opening it as part of the case. It
                relates to a letter which was sent by Dr. Eastwood to the
                county council and I am going to pass over that and go on
                to 290.

                     Now here is a letter from Mr. Strange of the Engineers
G              tothe Club, Mr. Chester:

                          "After speaking to Mrs. Lane last Wednesday
                           about the number of turnstiles required to
                           serve spectators using the Leppings Lane end
                           of the ground, we have altered our proposed
                           layout accordingly. Three prints of our
                           drawing 3 are enclosed.

                                                 59.
D.L. S E L L E R S & C o . / W. LLOYD WOODLAND




^                            The eighteen existing turnstiles will remain.
                             Ten will serve the North stand and eight the
                             terraces for the home supporters.  In addition
                             to four turnstiles from from (A - E), which can
                             be re-used, twelve new turnstiles will be
                             required."

                 Then there is narrative but this all comes out in the wash
B                in drawing 3, which is at page 292.  This is scheme 2,

         MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: Any scheme that has home and away
             supporters coming in at the Leppings Lane entrance, albeit
             there is segregation in the ground, has them moving as they
             come to?

         MR. PAYNE: Yes, I think this was an unfortunate feature which
C            worried all the parties but they were trying to provide
             segregation for the safety of visitors to the ground and
             this was the best that they could do, in discussion between
             themselves.  It consisted, that is of course, with the
             rules.

                      At drawing number 3, your Lordship sees what the idea
                 is here? There is again a separate bank of turnstiles for
D                visiting supporters to the south west terrace. This time
                 we have four of them. Then there are four turnstiles for
                 visiting supporters in the west stand; four for visitors
                 in the centre terrace; four for going up the stairs to the
                 home supporters' west stand and eight turnstiles for home
                 supporters' north west terrace. That leaves the remainder
                 of the bank; ten turnstiles for home supporters going to
                 the north stand. Your Lordship sees at the top the
E                diagram. That makes a total of 16 turnstiles provided for
                 10,100 capacity at Leppings Lane end, 16, and separate
                 entrances for each of the three sections or areas of
                 spectator accommodation on the terrace.

                       My Lord, that was discussed and a memorandum of a
                  discussion about that proposal appears at 299, between Mr.
                  Chester and Mr. Strange:

                            "Asked him about central fence down terrace.
                             Yes, seems a reasonable idea. Do it that way
                             to satisfy the Police. He isn't worried about
                             loss of capacity.

                             He still isn't satisfied about the number of
 q                           turnstiles are right. Left it with him."

                  Then, o v e r t h e p a g e -------

D.L. S E L L E R S & C o . / W. LLOYD WOODLAND




A         MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                    Yes.

          MR. PAYNE: My Lord, another similar conversation a few days
              later at 300, which starts, I think, on the right hand
              page. There are two separate memos here. On the right
              hand page they are discussing again:

                            "Discussed copies of our drawing he returned
B                            marked u p ....
    D.L. S E L L E R S & C o . / W. LLOYD WOODLAND




                                "I do not agree with what he wants, but in essence it
                                is. The area wasted in front of the turnstiles
                                (something) early visitors, gate them in, four banks
                                of three turnstiles and a gate to let people in if all
                                ticket."

                      He does not agree with that and he puts the word
                      "Disaster”, but that has got no relevance to this case
    B                 except he does not like the idea that has been proposed.

                                "Don't partition (something) first floor level. Maybe
                                13 turnstiles to the north stand. OK to use the old
                                ladies' toilets as refreshment rooms. No separation
                                on seating. Agreed to alter drawings, send in a copy
                                and then hold a meeting with the South Yorkshire
                                Police early next week to discuss. Would like cost
•   c                           estimate for 2nd May."

                           Then over the page at page 301, from Mr. Strange to
                      Mr. Chester:

                                "Thank you for returning the marked copies of our
                                drawings 6705/2 and 3. After our telephone
                                conversation yesterday we have altered the layout
    D                           accordingly. The prints of our drawing 6705/4 are
                                enclosed for your comments."

                      Drawing 4 speaks for itself, over the page at 302. There
                      has been a change again now and for visiting supporters
                      south west terrace there are three turnstiles; for the west
                      stand visiting supporters there are three; three for the
                      central pen; three going up the stairs to the west stand,
    E                 and then six for the home supporters on the north-west
                      terrace. That is a total of 12 turnstiles for 10,100
                      capacity, all segregated.

                           If your Lordship now goes over to 304, here comes the
                      first hint of something going wrong, from a telephone
                      conversation between Mr. Strange and Mr. Chester:
    F
                                "Would like a note from us with a guess at the cost of
                                the work at Leppings Lane end. OK, can't do it
                                accurately."

                      Then the rest of it does not work.

                           I ask your Lordship to go on in the bundle to 317. I
    G                 am skipping over some pages which I will have to return to
                      in a moment just to do another exercise, but I want to
                      complete this sequence of drawings without losing the
                      thread of it. At 317, Dr. Eastwood is sending to the Club
                      drawings 5 and 8 showing two possible alternative
                      arrangements, and drawing 5 your Lordship will find in the
                      bundle at 319.

     H        MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                    (inaudible).

                                                     62.
D.L. S E L L E R S & C o . / W. LLOYD WOODLAND




         MR. PAYNE: Here is drawing 5 which he has been describing in
^            the narrative which your Lordship has just read. The
             immediate thing to be noticed is that the new lay out of
             the turnstiles has the idea to be dropped and we have gone
             back to the original shape of the turnstiles except that
             two turnstiles at the south end of the main bank are going
             to be removed and two further turnstiles are being added to
              the shorter section of turnstiles. So what is proposed
             here now is in the smaller of the two banks there should be
B            four turnstiles for south-west terrace; the next three are
             for west stand seating accommodation; then home supporters
             on the big bank, the first three are allocated to the west
              stand, the next five go to north-west terrace - that is
              standing - and then the remains of the bank go to north
             stand - that is eight turnstiles.

                      So that what this drawing number 5 is proposing is
C               that there should be a total of nine turnstiles for 10,100
                people standing on the north-west terrace and also that
                there should be one division on the concourse between the
                turnstiles and the back of the stand by the erection of a
                new wall which your Lordship sees, the result being that if
                one looks to the left of the drawing four turnstiles are
                now allocated to the area which, if your Lordship still has
                open Appendix 4, the area from the left-hand end of the
D               terrace at the junction with the south stand right theway
                across until the second of the 1981 radial fences. There
                 is no segregation within those two pens within that
                 section, so that having come through the four turnstiles
                which are allocated for the whole of that section, the
                visitors can choose whether they want to go into the
                 central pen or whether they want to go round the corner to
                 (as we look at it) left-hand south pen. My Lord, that is
E               all that can usefully be said about drawing 5.

                      The other one (which was sent with the letter which
                your Lordship read) is at page 320, which is drawing number
                 8 . This is from the same family as drawing number 5 and
                allocates the same number of turnstiles - four - standing,
                 for visiting supporters to the south-west terrace, as your
p               Lordship can see.

                      Then three for the west stand, then the other side of
                 the dividing wall and gate, three for the west stand,
                 followed by five for the north-west terrace, followed by a
                 batch for the north stand. That makes a total of nine
                 turnstiles for standing 1 0 , 1 0 0 0 spectators.

G                      My Lord, at 324 there is a memorandum of a telephone
                  conversation about these proposals.  I just pass over that
                  to show that they are discussing it between themselves:

                            "Did Dick give agreement to re-organisation of
                            Leppings Lane? Yes, in principle. Which scheme?
                            Don't know."

^                 So Eastwood is trying to find out which one of these
                  schemes the club is proposing to adopt.

                      At 332, my Lord, we come to the final edition which
                 was then put into effect after several months of work, a
                 letter from the Engineers to the Club:

                           "We have pleasure in enclosing a set of prints of our
3                          drawings showing details of the work at the Leppings
                           Lane End.

                           Drawing 6705/8A is worth a look at because it shows
                           the proposed layout of the turnstiles and fences.
                           South Yorkshire Police have given their approval to
                           the scheme though we have not received anything from
                           them in writing."
C
                 Drawing 8 A is at the next page, 333. 8 A is from the same
                 group as 5 and 8 . Two turnstiles are being demolished at
                 the end of the existing large bank, and Dr. Eastwood is
                 proposing that the south-west terrace should be
                 accommodated by four turnstiles (as your Lordship can see)
                 on the smaller of the two banks, three for the west stand,
                 and then the other side of the partition, three for the
D                west stand followed by five for the north-west terrace
                 standing, followed by eight for the north stand. So the
                 final edition, as agreed and as devised, intended that
                 there should be nine turnstiles for people standing on the
                 west terrace, divided almost equally between the pens to
                 the south and the pen to the north. The scheme, in its
                 final edition, provided no system of counting or control of
                 people going into the centre pen or the--
E
          MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: This is much like the lay out in
              Appendix 1, is it not, and which turnstile you use for
              which area which that turnstile can give access will depend
              on the notices you put up on the particular day.

          MR. PAYNE:             Yes, quite.
p
                       The result of it, as your Lordship can see - and now I
                  intend to do that brief exercise to see how that happened -
                  is that the number of turnstiles has gone down from the
                  originally proposed 16 or 17 to the final edition of nine.
                  The reason that happened, exercising just briefly through
                  the papers, going back to 304, is entirely expense. At 304
                  your Lordship has seen the memorandum of that telephone
G                 conversation, where the Club are calling for a note with a
                  guess of the cost of the work at the Leppings Lane end.
                  That is on the next page at 305, where Dr. Eastwood
                  replied, half-way down the page:

                            "The proposed layout of the turnstiles etc. at the
                            back of the stand is shown on our drawing 6705/4, a
                            copy of which is enclosed. Including the radial fence
 H                          on the West terrace, we estimate that the cost of this

     ^                          work, including professional fees, is likely to be in
                                 the order of £66,600."

                       The other figure at the bottom of the page relates to
                       construction of the toilets and so on. But the material
                       figure, we think, for your Lordship's attention is the
                       £66,600.

     B                      At 316 - I am sorry, would your Lordship be kind
                       enough to stop on the way at 310? This is a memorandum
                       which starts on the right-hand side of the page and goes on
                       to the left. It is a telephone conversation between the
                       Engineer and the Police; Inspector Calvert has called the
                       Engineers, speaking to Mr. Strange:

^                               "Discussed proposals for fences and terraces and
 -   C                          gates. Gates wanted by fire brigade, I don't seewhy"

                        (something about something fence).

                                 "Would like to meet tomorrow at 11 o'clock, I will see
                                 if Dick agrees."

                       Then on the left-hand side:
     D
                                 "Told him about discussion with Inspector Calvert.
                                 Dick thinks that the board won't go along with
                                 £1 1 0 , 0 0 0 ".
                       That is the cost of the new turnstile plus the lavatories.

A                  Let me think about it for a while. Okay, we won't need the
                   police tomorrow.  I will tell them."

                        Now 316. This is probably the decisive minute. My
                   Lord, it is the Minute of a meeting of the Sheffield
                   Wednesday Football Club Meeting of Directors on Wednesday
                   the 22nd May 1985, at Hillsborough. Present are various
                   members of the Board and the Chairman:
IJ
                             "Purpose of the Meeting: To consider in depth the
                             document prepared by Eastwood & Partners 'Possible
                             Long Term Development of the Ground'."

                   My Lord, we can go straight down to 2(c):

p                           "Reorganisation of turnstiles and new toilet
                            facilities at Leppings Lane end. Matter left in
                            abeyance pending further discussion.  Initial
                            estimated price deemed to be excessive."

                   At 318, my Lord, the situation goes further, where
                   5 was costed at £57,500, and Drawing 8 costed at £59,500.
                   At 331, by now Drawing 8 A has been adopted and the
D                  estimated cost that is given on 331 is £46,100 --


            MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: Remind me again, which number is          8 A?    Is
                that ...(inaudible)...


            MR. PAYNE: Yes, it is. Although the estimate given in this
E               letter is £46,100, there is another figure which appears at
                367 after the work had been done, which makes it look as if
                the price was better than that; that is at 367.


            MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                Yes.


F           MR. PAYNE:            The bottom of the page:

                             "Modifications at Leppings Lane end.
                             Segregation/safety work, professional fees and site
                             supervision - Total £30,579."

                   When this was all over, Dr. Eastwood gave his comment about
                   what had been done at 383. This is a letter dealing with a
                   large number of topics from Dr. Eastwood to South Yorkshire
                   County Council. Your Lordship will see that at paragraph 4
                   he says:

                             "Crowd flow at the Leppings Lane end of the stadium.
                             The Club is aware of the difficulties which the Police

A                            last closed season. We find it very difficult to
                             envisage anything more which could be done at
                             reasonable expense.”

                   My Lord, that completing the examination of the proposals
                   as to turnstiles, there is then a drawing --


B            MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:   Of course, an engineer may be governed in
                 what he can propose by what is planned before.


            MR. PAYNE: Certainly, and what they agreed between themselves
                is practicable and should be done. My Lord, what we say
                about this is that in all these exchanges there is no word
                about safety at all. Nobody here is giving attention to
C               the need to provide separate access to the separate areas
                on the terrace.


            MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                  Yes.


P            MR. PAYNE: If your Lordship would now look at page 613, which
                 I think is in bundle 2, we have not been able to find any
                 document which explains the circumstances in which this
                 Drawing was made - and it may be that my learned friend
                 will be able to help in due course about that - but it is
                  interesting and helpful because it shows a description of
                  the ground layout which was the upshot of the 1986
                 exercises, as it appeared in 1987. Your Lordship sees this
E                is Drawing 8945/1A by Eastwood and Partners, showing the
                  ground layout in 1987. At the Leppings Lane end, this was
                  the product of all the exercises which had been done. Your
                  Lordship can see the two banks of turnstiles, the idea
                  being that the way fans go in the left-hand segment, home
                  fans in the right-hand segment. There are now the terraces
                  divided into the final edition of radial fences, with the
                  left hand (as we look at it) south end pen allocated 2,600
F                away fans; and then in the middle the words say "West
                  Terrace covered standing. Away fans 1,200." That is pen
                  3. That is being given    anumber here of1,200.  To the
                  right of it is pen 4.


            MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                  It is not in fact covered, is it?
G
             MR. PAYNE: No, it is not.     Ido not quite know why it says
                 that. It is clearly meant to be pen 3.     To the right of
                 that is "Sterile area, 1,000 home/away", so they can use
                 that for whichever purpose is required by the particular
                 match. That is pen 4. The next pen across is "Home fans,
                 1,600", and in the right-hand corner, "North West Terrace,
 „              uncovered standings, a total of 3,700", and that is
                 including the top corner of 2,900 and the 800 in the bottom


                                                          67.

      ^                  section. So whoever drew this diagram - and we cannot
                         ourselves help your Lordship any further - for our purpose,
                         we say it is significant that it shows that in 1987
                         attention was correctly being paid to the need to assess
                         the capacity of these various pens and somebody had put
                         their mind to it and come up with a result, but they had
                         completely overlooked the need to provide the means to make
                         sure that that capacity was kept to, because behind the
      B                 stand the only thing that existed was the wall going from
                         the shorter of the two sets of turnstile to the back of the
                         stand, so that away fans going through their shorter
                         segment of turnstiles could all go into the west terrace
                         covered, as it says, pen 3, 1,200 --


                 MR. GLASGOW: My Lord, I wonder if I could help my friend just
      C              on a silly point, because it is a false one. The "un" is
                      in fact folded on the photocopy. It is the same word that
                      we see on the right-hand side. The "un" has been lost in
                      the photocopying.


                 MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                  "Uncovered".
      D
                  MR. GLASGOW:               "Uncovered."


                 MR. PAYNE: That makes sense. Thank you very much indeed.
                     That is very helpful. So from the point of view of
                     allocation, the fans could either go round the corner and
                     all, if they wanted to, go to the south end, or else they
      E              all could go in the centre pen.

                              My Lord, the last drawing which we ask your Lordship
                         to look at in this sequence is one which was made after the
                         event, and it is in Bundle 3 at 1238. I am sorry, one has
                         to change bundles again.


      F           MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                 1238?


                  MR. PAYNE: 1238. This Drawing, we submit, is significant
                      because it can be related to the disaster itself, and we
                      think it is helpful when seen in the context of the
                      developments which your Lordship has been looking at. This
      G              is a Drawing made by Dr. Eastwood's partnership and it is
                      dated 21st April 1989. It is entitled, "Layout of
                      Facilities at Leppings Lane end as at 15th April, 1989".
                      Now, what it shows is that in the shorter of the two banks
                      of turnstiles, there are seven turnstiles, A to G; and
                      then the other bank is divided in half by colouring, and I
                      think the middle section is probably highlighted over in
                      the original colour but it has not come out in the
       H             photocopying.   In that section there are six turnstiles.


                                                               68.

.                  The right-hand section as we look at it, Nos. 1 to 10, has
                    10 turnstiles. What your Lordship sees, looking at this,
                    is that in the wall which leads from the corner of the
                    shorter bank of turnstiles to the back of the west terrace
                    is the gap marked "Gate open".  In the top left-hand corner
                    of this diagram, the author has pointed out the
                    significance of what one is looking at. In the top box, he
                   has put "North stand, 10 gates, 9,882 person certified
3                  capacity." In the middle box, "West stand, 6 gates, 4,465
                    people." In the West Terrace standing, 7 gates, for 10,100
                   people. My Lord, if one converts that into numbers per
                    turnstile and then applies slightly more than the Green
                    Guide rate of counting, one gets the following exercise:
                   North Stand turnstiles are designed, by giving this number
                    of gates to that number of persons, for 988 people per
                    turnstile, and if each turnstile admitted 850 people per
C                  hour working flat out - so that is all the turnstiles flat
                    out -

                  at the rate of 850 per hour which is slightly above the Green Guide of
                  750 per hour. I am taking that because that is a figure which has been
                  used by the Club and the Engineer in correspondence, so I am taking the
                  higher figure. Then, all the spectators could get into the north stand
                  in just over one hour. The six turnstiles for the west stand with
                  approximately 4,445 people which means 740 per turnstile, which at the rate
                  of 850 per hour flat out will get them all in in 50 minutes. Now, contrary
                  to the designs by Dr.,Eastwood, which as your Lordship has seen in the other
                  drawings, proposed that one faction of supporters should go to the shorter
                  turnstiles, the supporters going into the west terrace, and the other factions
                  should go through the longer run of turnstiles.
      B
                       On 15th April 1989 the Club had issued tickets and allocated the whole
                  of the 10,000 standing capacity of the west terrace to the seven gates A to
                  G. Does your Lordship follow that?
          MR. 3USTICE 30WITT: Yes.
        MR. PAYNE: That means each turnstile working - - - Eachturnstile has got to
      c     admit 1,442 people -- 7 into 10,100 — and at the rate of 850 people per
             hour if all the turnstiles are working flat out--
          MR. 3USTICE 30WITT: About an hour and forty minutes?
        MR. PAYNE: That is right, my Lord, the reason being that the idea was that all
             the supportershaving come through that line of turnstile, as your Lordship
      D     knows, had open to them the choice of going anywhere on the terrace. My
             Lord, this drawing we say is of considerable help in considering your
             Lordship's question about the reason for the build up outside the turnstiles,
             and I intend to say more about that later on in the opening.
          MR. 3USTICE 30WITT:   Of course, you cannot just look at the rate of admittance
               of the turnstiles in isolation from the volume of people waiting to come
               through.
      E
          MR. PAYNE: Certainly.
          MR. 3USTICE 30WITT: There is, of course, the evidence about the late arrivals.
               At that stage the small number of turnstiles would exacerbate the problem
               of getting the crowd into the stadium, and more so that they would want to
               be in at the kick-off.
      F MR. PAYNE: My Lord, the only comment with which I leave the point is that the
             design of giving 10,100 tickets allocated to this number of turnstiles medot
             that those responsible for allocating these turnstiles to those particular
             people meant that they were relying on the crowd arriving, starting to arrive
             at full flow one hour and forty minutes before kick-off. So that your
              Lordship has the point that for this to work then if they are all       goingto
             get in by three o'clock they have got to start pouring through the turnstiles
              flat out at 850 per hour an hour and forty minutes earlier. My Lord, we
      ^      submit that that arithmetic speaks for itself and that it shows that those
              responsible for the management and the issuing of the tickets bear a heavy
              responsibility for the build up outside the turnstiles.
                        My Lord, I have got to page 9 in the skeleton opening, and I have got
                   to paragraph 10.    My Lord, this I have completed now. My invitation toyour
                   Lordship is to look at the documents which are helpful on the way in which
      H           the system, or lack of system, to control capacity evolved, and what in fact
                   arrived on the 15th April. Having done that, my Lord, the Police adopt the

                    conclusions in the report by Lord Justice Taylor at the paragraphs which
                    I have noted in the opening. May I ask your Lordship to go through those
                    paragraphs in the Taylor report. The first is at 116. My Lord, we do not
                    take issue with anything on this page, and for the purpose of this point
                    about lack of counting, capacity and control, we adopt the comments made
                    at 116:
                           "The over-crowding up to 252 was due to a number of factors which
                           can be considered broadly under three heads, the layout of the
                           Leppings Lane end, the lack of fixed capacities for the pens, the
                           lack of effective monitoring of the terraces."
         B
                    which we say means lack of any system to act as an aid to those responsible
                    for trying to work out how many people were in at any particular time.
                         My Lord at 266 in the Lord Justice Taylor report under "Brief summary
                    of causes."
           MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: May I just alert you to this. I am looking at Roman IX
         q      in 116 "The perimeter gates were too small". When I watched the video
                film it seemed to me it was difficult to get people out of the gates. On
                the other hand, query if the gates had been as at 1.1 meter, the Green Guide
                figure, whether that actually would have made any appreciable difference
                whether in order to deal with the problem which had arisen, one really would
                have needed what I will call multiple gates, i.e. the sort of gates you can
                 (inaudible) while one is secure and then open another. In other words not
                just something 1.1 meter wide but something very very much more. I mention
         D      that so that you know it is something that is in my mind which needs tobe
                dealt with.
             MR. PAYNE: Your Lordship will not find the Police arguing that the fact that the
                  perimeter gates were slightly less than the Green Guide had any significance,
                  made any significant contribution to the course of the disaster.
             MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: But the conventional wisdom at the time of this incident at
         E        the time was that you do not regard the pitch as an evacuation --
             MR. PAYNE: My Lord, we do not agree with that. When your Lordship looks at the
                  Green Guide we submit that it is made perfectly plain that the evacuation
                  on to the pitch must be available for emergency use.
             MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: You will be drawing my attention to it.
         E
             MR. PAYNE: I will, my Lord. If your Lordship is kind enough to go on to 266,
                  we adoptthis comment under brief summary of causes by Lord Justice Taylor.
                           "They" -- meaning the pens — "were already over full because no
                           safe maximum capacity had been laid down, no attempt made to control
                           entry to individual pens numerically and there was no effective
                           visual monitoring of crowd density."
         G
                    My Lord that is our case in a nutshell under this head. 291:
                           "The alterations inside the turnstiles and on the terraces clearly
                           affected capacity, but no specific allowance was made for them. In
                           that respect both Dr. Eastwood and the Club should have taken a
                           more positive approach, either a scheme such as one of those Dr.
                           Eastwood put forward should have been adopted, giving more turnstiles
         H                 and total separation areas, or at the very least the capacity of the
                           pens and of the terraces as a whole should have been treated more
                           cautiously. The Police view in 1981 of 10,100 was too high a figure
                                                          - 71 -
D.L. S E L L E R S & C o . / W. LLOYD WOODLAND




                    was known to the Club, although Dr. Eastwood says not to him.
                    Yet despite that in the sub-division into pens the figure remained."
A                   MyLord, at 313:
                    "In the assessment of figures for capacity the criteria at chapter
                    16 of the Green Guide were not at Hillsborough and may not elswhere
                    have been applied with sufficient rigour."
                 My Lord, the result of all that, to put a gloss on it, is that we
            make these comments before passing from this topic, these two comments.
B           First, that in consequence of the alterations that had been made in 1981
            and in 1985 by dividing up the terrace by the introduction of radial
            barriers into separate pens without providing any separat means of access
            and control, and without making any alterations in the safety certificate*
            the result was that the whole of the certified capacity of the west terrace
            could in fact have attempted to go into any one of the pens without
            creating any breach of the terms of the safety certificate.
C                The second point is that what infact happened was that far more
            people than could safely be admitted to the pens 3 and 4 in fact attempted
            to get in and the numbers which demonstrate what happened are found in the
            bundle and in the Taylor report as follows.
    MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: Far more than could safely beadmitted.
D MR. PAYNE:            Into pens 3 and 4.
    MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: And the evidence is?
  MR. PAYNE: The certified capacity, as yourLordship know, was 10,100 for the
       whole terrace and that is in the bundle at 159. The numbers in fact
       admitted to the Leppings Lane standing terraces both through the turnstiles
       and including those who came through gate C on the 15th April, has been
E     estimated by an accounting exercise from the video film by the Health and
       Safety Exececutive, and which was adopted and accepted in the Taylor report,
       at 10,124. My Lord, the Taylor reference is 202, so that in fact those who
       came inboth through gate C and through the turnstiles approximately were
       thesame as the certified capacity, theinference being    that not many people
       came in who did not have tickets.
                 Those who in fact went into pens 3 and 4, the evidence is as follows:
F          that the capacity of those pens taking into account the introduction of the
            radial barriers and the configuration of the crash barriers as per the
            Green Guide, 54/10 square meters, was worked out by the Health and Safety
            Executive and adopted in the Taylor report as follows: pen 3 822, pen 4
            871. The Taylor reference, my Lord, is 142.

            MR.     PAYNE: If the n u m b e r s had been a s s e s s e d as they ought to have
                   been, and if they had bee n e n t e r e d on the sa f e t y certificate,
                   those are the figures that ought to h ave gone into the safety
                   c e r t i f i c a t e for those two pens.         T h o s e who in fact went in have

                   w h i c h pro rata, then, would produce 1675.                   The r e f e r e n c e to
                   that is in the report of Mr. Norton, H e a l t h and S a f e t y

                    by d e d u c t i o n of the a pproximate 2,000 if that helps your
                    Lordship.

           representing the Club, and they ar e (in addition to 112)
C          73, 120, 142, 147, 173 and 391. My Lord, we think in fact
           it does go slightly further than acting within his remit as
           the Engineer and he truly was representing the Club at a
           number of these meetings and appearing on behalf of the
           Club as a spokesman, and that the closeness of the working
           relationship between the two, which we certainly do not
           criticise; it is a very sensible and commendable procedure;
           that over many years these two should work together, but at
D          page 391 the close working relationship is illustrated.
           Representing the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club is Dr.
           Eastwood and the Groundsman. Then there are various other
           officials from all sorts of different departments of the
           Officer Working Party and this was an occasion of the
           retirement of Mr. Vaughan of the South Yorkshire County
           Council, when words were said appropriate to the occasion
           and at the end of the first paragraph, Dr. Eastwood was the
E          spokesman for the Club in expressing the Club's comments on
            the occasion. I am told Mr. Vaughan was a groundsman. Is
            that right?

       MR. GLASGOW:                The only other person there was the groundsman.

       MR. PAYNE:  Then that person was the groundsman.                That is
P          precisely the point.

                    My Lord, I move on now then to the next topic which is
               that the system of management was unsafe. My Lord, this
               topic largely is directed to the allocation of the number
               of turnstiles to the number of tickets issued and also to
               the responsibility of the Club for the familiar topic of
               segregation and control of spectators between the different
G             divisions of the ground.

                     My Lord, the evidence about the unsafe system of
                management is to be found in the Taylor Inquiry report at
                the paragraphs listed on page 10. My Lord, these start at
                paragraph 2 1 :

                          "On the 20th March 1989, the Football Association
H                          requested that their Cup semi-final between


                                                   78
D.L. S E L L E R S & C o . / W. LLOYD WOODLAND




a                         Liverpool and Nottingham Forest be heldon 15th
                           April at Hillsborough Football Stadium. The
                           corresponding semi-final between the same two
                           teams had been held there in April 1988. The
                           the arrangements had been successful in the view
                           of the police and of the host club. Sheffield
                          Wednesday (the Club) were therefore willing to
                           accommodate the 1989 match. South Yorkshire
g                         Constabulary were prepared to police it but only
                           if the ticketing arrangements were the same as
                           those for 1988. Otherwise, the FA would have to
                          look elsewhere. Those arrangements did not please
                          Liverpool or its supporters either in 1988 or 1989.
                          They thought the ticket allocation was unfair for
                          reasons to be explained later. Reluctantly, however,
                          the police requirement was accepted and the match was
C                         fixed for 15th April."

                     The Police requirement, my Lord, was that all the
               supporters of the two rival teams should respectively have
               to   attend at the ground at different ends. I have     made
               rather a mess of that. I mean that the Liverpool
               supporters should enter at one end and the Nottingham
               Forest supporters should be allocated the other. That is
D              the only Police requirement. The Police did not mind which
               turnstiles were used; it had nothing to do with them. The
               Police did not mind how the tickets were issued or printed
               or what was said on the tickets; it had nothing to do with
               them; that is entirely for the Club. All the Police were
               concerned about was the direction from which the fans
               should approach the ground and how they should get in, so
               that they would not fight with each other outside.

       MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: That inevitably had some effect on which
           turnstiles should be used?

       MR. PAYNE:                Well, that is a matter for the Club.

       MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                       I think it is a matter of geography?
F
       MR. PAYNE:   Yes. It had an effect on which turnstiles couldbe
           used because it meant that the Leppings Lane end turnstiles
           had to be used to get the Leppings Lane end people in,
           certainly, but how they were allocated between the
           different banks of turnstiles was not a matter for the
           Police.

q      MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: That is a matter of how the ground is
           laid out, is it not?

       MR. PAYNE: Certainly.   It is outside the control of the
           Police. That is the point that we make about it. It is
           not something in which the Police have any hand. They are
           not responsible for the design, layout or turnstiling
           arrangements at the ground.
D.L. S E L L E R S & C o . / W. LLOYD W OODLAND




        MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: They would not be aware of the
            decision, which is accepted by all as a sensible one, to
            have the Liverpool fans come to the Leppings Lane end and
            the Nottingham fans to Penistone Road. The Police would
            not be aware of the effect that would have upon the
            availability of turnstiles, if they wished to apply their
            minds to it?

g       MR. PAYNE: Yes. Your Lordship's last comment has it really
            but it is not something which the Police themselves would,
            we submit, be expected to have to apply their minds to.
            That is something within the remit of the Club and if
            anything turned upon it, if it were liable to cause a build
            up at the turnstiles, then the   difficulty in not providing
            enough turnstiles for the particular numbers of people
            attending is something of which the Club ought to have
C          warned the Police. That is our submission about it. I
            have made that submission and, my Lord, the point we make
            is one which was found by Lord Justice Taylor which we
            adopt, as your Lordship will see a little later in this
            exercise at 21. Your Lordship has seen that. At 29 to 32,
            Lord Justice Taylor reports upon the arrangement of the
            turnstiles, which I pass over because it is largely covered
            by what your Lordship has been seeing in the drawings and
D          is peripheral, I think, to the main point.

                          At 39 - does your Lordship have that paragraph?

        MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                       Yes.

        MR. PAYNE:   "On the other side of the dividing fence in the
                  approach area, there wre only seven turnstiles to
E                 serve 1 0 , 1 0 0 with tickets for the west terracing.
                  Those seven turnstiles were labelled A to G. This was
                  because there had originally been 18 turnstiles at
                  Leppings Lane land the sequential numbering continued
                  from 19 upwards on the south side of the ground. When
                  the number at Leppings Lane was brought up to 23 the
                  present arrangements; of 1 to 16, A to G and then 19
P                upwards was adopted to avoid re-numbering all round
                  the ground."

                     I do not need to read any more of that paragraph and I
                go on to 130:

                          "At the entrance", this is following the 1985
                          modification, and this is Lord Justice Taylor's
q                        findings in the documents your Lordship has been
                          looking at, "modification but no increase in number
                          was made at the turnstiles. The ba;nk 1 to 16 was
                          divided from A to G by the metal fence now in place
                          and that division was projected across the concourse
                          inside the turnstiles in the form of a brick wall. A
                          personnel gate was provided for access through that
                          wall lbut was enlarged to its present size at the
H                        request of the police. Those alterations were made in


                                                         80
D.L. S E L L E R S & CO. / W. LLOYD WOODLAND




.                       the interests of segregation. The more elborate
                        divisions which Dr. Eastwood had suggested, giving
                        separate access to each sub-division of the
                        accommodation, were not pursued for financial reasons.
                        In May 1985 the Bradford disaster occurred. The south
                        stand at Hillsborough had wooden decking and the Club
                        realised it would have to undertake expensive remedial
                       works there. The cantilever roof of the same stand
g                      was also discovered to require expensive repairs as
                       well.”

                         187: "The decision to fill the whole of the north
                        stand from the Leppings Lane end required the 23
                        turnstiles there to admit 24,256 spectators. Of
                        those, the seven turnstiles A to G serving the
                        terraces had to admit 1 0 ,1 0 0 , i . e . a n average of just
C                      under 1,450 through each turnstile.”
              At 188:

                        "The Green Guide recognises that the rate at which
                        spectators can pass through turnstiles depends on a
                       variety of local circumstances but states "in general
                       based on observation and experience, it is unlikely
D                      that the maximum notional rate per turnstile would
                       exceed 750 per hour". Since the semi-final was an all
                       ticket match requiring no cash transactions, the Club
                       considered that a higher rate of about 1 , 0 0 0 per hour
                       per turnstile could be expected. Even at this higher
                       rate, which assumes the turnstiles working at maximum
                       efficiency non-stop, it would have taken nearly l\
                       hours to admit all those with terrace tickets. At 750
E                      per hour, it would have taken nearly two hours.”

              The Green Guide provides:

                       "Turnstiles should be of such numbers as to admit
                       spectators at a rate whereby no unduly large crowds
                       are kept waiting for admission...

F                      The Officer Working Party had discussed in 1985 the
                       need and Dr. Eastwood's various schemes, for
                       improvement of the -ai.astile arrangements. The
                       mathematics are elementary. Both the police and the
                       Club should have realised that the Leppings Lane
                       turnstiles and the waiting area outsidel them would be
                       under strain to admit all the Liverpool supporters in
G                      time. Success depended on the spectators arriving at
                       a steady rate from an early hour and upon the maximum
                       turnstile rate being maintained.   In fact neither of
                       these requirements, which are inter-linked, was
                       fulfilled. That they might not be so was in my view
                       foreseeable."

                   Let me make this comment, my Lord, that the primary
H             liability, we say, for ticketing allocation to particular


                                                81.
D.L. S E L L E R S & CO. / W. LLOYD W OODLAND




.            turnstiles and that subject rests with the Police ... I am
              sorry, rests with the Club. I am looking at the words
             underlined in red because I have to address those where wei
             say that although clearly the primary liability rests with
             the Club, we dispute that the Police has any liability at
             all. I appreciate the significance of the questions which
             your Lordship asked a few moments ago and it might be that
             your Lordship may find that the Police have some
g            involvement in this.

      MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: To take an example of movement: if all
          1 0 , 0 0 0 had got to go through one barrier door, one would
          expect any sensible Policeman to say, That is going to
          create a problem, isn't it?"

      MR. PAYNE: Quite.
C
      MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: You will get a build up in Leppings Lane.
          When it is known to the Police that the sensible decision
          is to have the Liverpool fans coming in at the Leppings
          Lane end and the Nottingham fans in Penistone Road,
D.L. S E L L E R S & CO. / W. LLOYD WOODLAND




                    they know that turnstiles which could have been used would
                    not now be used;  they know that there is going to be a
                    large number of people; and here one is not only looking
                    at the people on the terrace but the people going into the
                    stands as well, a large number of people going into
                    Leppings Lane, some of whom, but for the sensible decision
                    to ...(inaudible)... would have gone in at Penistone Road.
B                   It is question of whether the Police, regardless of whether
                    or not they are alerted to this kind of trouble, should
                    themselves say, "Now, what effect will that have on the
                    build up of people?” Equally, it may be said that the
                    Club, knowing the requirement of the Police, with their own
                    responsibility, should have said to the Police, "You do
                    know, do you, what effect this will have on the build up of
                    people waiting to come in?"
C

             MR. PAYNE: Yes. My Lord, we largely accept what your Lordship
                 says. We would say that the origin of the ticketing
                 arrangement was with the Club. If the Police were at
                 fault, it was their failure to heed that which was being
                 devised and what tickets were being allocated and what the
                 consequences of it might be, failing to heed that. My
D                Lord, this is a trial about apportionment between the
                 parties. Your Lordship knows the position which the Police
                 have taken, and what we are asking your Lordship to do is
                 to apportion liability between the parties. On this
                 particular point, our submission is that the bulk of the
                 responsibility rests with the Club. It is possible that
                 some rests with the Police, but we do not admit it, because
                 we say that it was the responsibility of the Club to give
E
                 this information to the Police so that they could then
                 respond to it.


             MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:  It may be a bit of over-optimism    when you
                 say "That's not our pigeon."


             MR. PAYNE: My Lord, these will be findings for your Lordship
                 at the end of the day.


             MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:               Yes.


             MR. PAYNE:            We are here for contribution.


             MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:               Yes.


             MR. PAYNE: My Lord, the last paragraph which deals with this
                 topic is at 29A, where Lord Justice Taylor gave his comment
H                on the point that your Lordship has just been discussing.


                                                      83.
D.L. S E L L E R S & C o . / W. LLOYD WOODLAND




                   There is a lot of this paragraph underlined by the Club and
                   the Engineer but the part which has survived towards the
                   end of the underlining - so I am not going to read out what
                   is underlined - is the part which begins, "The plan...”


           MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                   Yes.

B
           MR. PAYNE:              That says:

                             "The plan for the semi-final, involving as it did the
                             loss of 1 2 turnstiles to the north stand and the liarge
                             numbers to be fed in from Leppings Lane, was one
                             agreed between the Club and the Police. The Club knew
                             best what admission the turnstiles could manage and
C                            ought to have alerted the Police to the risk of the
                             turnstiles being swamped."

                  We say, "Here, here!" My Lord, those are the passages in
                   the Taylor report which illuminate this topic and give his
                   findings of fact, and then we proceed now to criticise the
                  management of the Club for defects and failing to comply
                  with the guidance given by the Green Guide. My Lord, I
D                 then turn to that now.

                        This is the first of a number of documents in which
                   the responsibilities of the Club are spelt out, so that the
                   Club ought to have been conscious of the effect of what it
                   was doing by the allocation, in this particular topic that
                   one is now dealing with, of a certain number of tickets to
F                 a particular number of turnstiles. My Lord, in the Green
                   Guide, management responsibilities are spelt out in the
                   paragraphs listed there on page 1 0 , at 1 2 .1 , beginning at
                   paragraph 12. I draw your Lordship's attention to this but
                   I am not going to read it again, because I have already
                   read it under "Safe Spectator Capacity". What it enjoins
                   the Club to do is to work out how many spectators can
                   safely go into each area of the ground", the relevant part
 p                being the last five or six lines, "How many people can be
                   safely accommodated in different sections of the ground?"
                   This is the responsibility of the Club, assisted, of
                   course, by the Engineer.   It is not a responsibility of the
                   Police. It is particularly spelt out in the Green Guide,
                   and we submit that on the question of contribution as to
                   who is responsible for what we say is the primary cause of
                   the disaster, namely the lack of capacity assessment for
 G                each pen, this guidance here, if followed, would have
                   prevented the disaster having taken place, i.e. by the
                   assessment of a particular capacity for each of these pens
                   and a means of controlling capacity.

                         That goes on in the other paragraphs in the Green
                    Guide. If your Lordship goes on to paragraph 23 --

A           MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:I was just thinking about the point you
                have just made.   It may depend, may it not, on what is the
                state of pens 3 and 4 at the time when Gate C is opened?


           MR. PAYNE:             No, my Lord.     My learned friend tells me ---


B           MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:  And the nature of the means of putting up
                the shutters which you say there should have been?


           MR. PAYNE: Yes. My friend says that it is a different point,
               but we do not agree with him. I accept what your Lordship
               is saying, and we think that this is at the centre of the
               case. My Lord, may I come back to the topic which was      —
C              covered this morning?    When your Lordship refers to Gate C
               and the consequences of opening Gate C, we submit that this
               must not be looked at only in the context of the 10 minutes
               or so between 10 to 3 and 3 o'clock on the 15th April. It
               must be looked at in the context of the layout of the
               ground and the systems which had been put in place long
               before any emergency arose.
D
           MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:                 But one has got to look at causation.


            MR. PAYNE:   Quite. Our submission about that, which I have
                perhaps inadequately explained - but it is a strong
                submission or we attempt to make it a strong submission -
                is that if the guidance in the Green Guide has been
E
                followed and the rules in the Safety Certificate had been
                followed about allocating safe capacity to each of those
                pens, then once you allocate a safe capacity, then you have
                got to institute a system for ensuring that the capacity is
                not exceeded. You have got to have some means of counting
                and control of the numbers going into the pens.    So the
                crucial point is that, once you identify the capacity, then
 p              the systems of counting and control follow. The Green
                Guide says quite clearly that you have got to assess the
                capacity for separate pens, and it is quite clearly stated
                in the Safety Certificate that that has got to be done. If
                that had been done, i.e. assess the capacity, then there
                would have to be a means of counting and control, which
                physically means separate turnstiles to provide separate
                access to each pen.
 G
                         Once you have got a system like that, then the
                    turnstiles are counting the number of people going into
                    each pen and they are displaying it in the Club control
                    room with a warning bleep as the number is approaching.
                    Once such a system is established, if an emergency takes
                    place as here, so that something has to be done under the
                    pressure of the event, then the Police would have an aid in
 H                  front of their eyes to know what the capacity of each pen

^               had reached.

                      The consequences of opening a gate to let some people
                 in would have been twofold: First, all those people would
                 have come into a particular area;   they would not have been
                 able to spread across or to choose where they wanted to go
                 inside the concourse;   they would have come into one
                 particular area of the concourse, which would have been
B               divided up as per Dr. Eastwood's schemes by the various
                 barriers. That is one consequence. The second consequence
                 is that those responsible for watching the counters in the
                 television screens would have known how many people had
                 already been admitted into that area, and they would have
                 known what the capacity was, so that they would immediately
                 have been aware of the effect of opening the gate upon the
                 already existing capacity in that particular pen; and if-
C               the consequence of opening the gate to let a lot of people
                 in was going to be that they would all go into that area
                 which was, for example, already at capacity, then the
                 effect of doing so would immediately have been obvious and
                 somebody would then have formed a human barrier to stop any
                 further ingress into the pen. But where the whole thing
                 failed was that there was nothing to draw to the attention
                 of the Police or the Club the fact that those central pens
D                had already reached any particular capacity, because nobody
                 had it in mind because of the find your own level system,
                 no-one was thinking in terms of a particular capacity for
                 those pens, so that when the influx came through Gate C, it
                 was not in anyone's mind to think what the particular
                 capacity of those pens was. The safety and the deaths of
                 those people was all left to depend upon the visual
                 impression of the Police Officers who happened to be there
E
                 at the time. The whole system fell back on to that.


          MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: You say, in other words, that nobody,
              neither Police nor Club, is to be criticised for the fact
              that when Gate C was opened a cordon was not put across the
              tunnel, and so the fault comes before that in not having
p             counting devices which would have alerted both Club and
              Police to the need to put a cordon across the tunnel if
              Gate C was tobe opened.


          MR. PAYNE: That is our case. The primary cause is that the
               system was unsafe. My Lord, your Lordship may find - and
              Lord Justice Taylor found in strong terms - that upon
G             opening Gate C something ought to have been done. It may
              be that under the pressure of the emergency, the wrong
              decision was made. Lord Justice Taylor certainly thought
               that it was, but this does not mean that it was negligence
              by the Police.   It may be that under the pressure of the
               incident as it developed between about quarter-to-3 and 3
               o'clock, the anxiety of the moment caused those responsible
               to make the wrong decisions.  I am not admitting that they
H             were wrong, but they may have done so. But to make a wrong

    ^                 decision in an emergency like that is not an act of
                      negligence. What is negligent is to have devised a system
                      which put the Police into that position in the first place.

                           My Lord, the case for the Club and the Engineer can be
                      looked at in this light: If they are right and if it is
                      all down to the Police, having opened Gate C, then failing
                      to block the tunnel and failing to realise that pens 3 and
    B                4 were already full - it is all the fault of the Police;
                      that is their position, absolutely solid, all the way
                      through this year and still remains the case today - if
                      that is so, then the consequence of it is that the system
                      which they have designed and organised and built, bearing
                      in mind the cost limitations and all the difficulties that
                      they had, left the lives of 95 people and the health of
                     many others to depend entirely on the Police getting it
    C                right under the pressure of an emergency in the space of
                      about half an hour before the kick-off. Our comment about
                      that is that an analysis like that demonstrates quite
                      plainly that the system was not safe and that the unsafe
                      system is the primary cause of the disaster. My Lord, that
                      is what we say in answer to your Lordship's Gate C
                      intervention.   I hope it is helpful.

    D                      My Lord, I will continue with what we say unless your
                      Lordship thinks that this is a convenient --


               MR.     JUSTICE JOWITT:             No, I shall go on a little longer.


               MR.  PAYNE: My Lord, I am asking your Lordship to look at the
    k             Green Guide which gives guidance to management. Your
                   Lordship has looked at paragraph 12. Your Lordship has
                   also seen paragraph 23, but I am collecting the paragraphs
                   together again and I do not intend, unless your Lordship
                   would like me to, to spend much time on paragraph 23, which
                   says that the management cannot be absolved from its
               responsibility by using other people like the Police.
    F
                            29 consists of a summary of management
                       responsibilities, and at 5 it says that included amongst
                       those is to draw up in consultation with the emergency
                       services contingency plans including arrangements with the
                       Police for stopping the event, including coping with
                       exceptionally large numbers of spectators arriving at the
                       ground.
    G
                            The point here, my Lord, is that the Club are saying
                       that this is entirely the fault of the Police in that they
                       did not plan this properly and did not get themselves
                       organised. We are saying "Not so."    We are saying that
                       the Club had these management responsibilities clearly
                       spelt out, if they needed to be spelt out, in the Green
                       Guide.

    D.L. S E L L E R S & C o . / W. LLOYD WOODLAND




      MR. PAYNE: At 44, this is another one your Lordship has seen already which
           directs the attention of the Club and the Engineer to the importance of
           turnstiles to control access to different sections of the ground. At 101
           another familiar paragraph, about dividing up the ground into sections and
    A      each section of the ground having its own limited safe capacity. At 195
           this is the stewarding chapter. Your Lordship has not seen this before.
                        "Manning levels and stewarding requirements will vary depending
                        upon the size and configuration of the ground, the nature of the
                        event and crowd levels, but there are five basic duties which
                        stewards are called upon to carry out. These are: controlling or
                        directing members of the public who are entering or leaving the
    B           7       ground to help achieve an even flow of people to the viewing areas
                        and safe disperal of spectators on the terraces or viewing slopes."
                     My Lord, that is interesting looked:at in the light of no division
                on the concourse to direct spectators to any particular pen or to have any
                attempt, given that there is no mechanical or electronic method of counting
                spectators coming into the turnstiles and given that there is no separation
    „          for separate capacities for the pen, then a fallback position would be to
    c          have stewards on the concourse physically directing people to go to one pee
                or another, and that is what is being contemplated here under 195A. But
                the Club never suggested that any such system should be introduced, and they
                never took any steps themselves to introduce such a system.
                        "B. Control of the ground to deal with emergencies and so on.
                         C. Manning entrances, exits and other strategic points and so
    D                   on.
                         D. Assisting Police as appropriate or as requested for crowd
                        control.
                        E. Undertaking specific duties in an emergency."
                     The Police comment about that is this: that these Club' responsibilities
                listed here under 195 cannot be shuffled off by saying: "Oh well the Police
                were responsible for what happened at Leppings Lane end", because since
    E           these - - - They are described as the basic duties. They are set out in the
                Green Guide and if the Club does intend to allocate these duties to someone
                else, like for example a firm of security guards, or the Police, then it is
                the job of the Club to make sure that the Police know what they are supposed
                to be doing and given instructions as if they were stewards, so that the
                Police then know that they themselves are supposed to follow in lieu or in
                place of the steward duties at 195, then it is the Police who are supposed
                to be doing that; but there is no evidence anywhere in the papers and it
    F           never happened, that the Club gave any such instruction to the Police that
                they should act as it were as supplemental or replacement stewards. My
                Lord, that is the significance of that paragraph.
      MR. JUSTICE 00WITT: You would say if the Club wanted to say for example, 195A
            in the Green Guide, that was really the responsibility that rested upon
           the Police, the Club should have said to Mr. Duckenfield who was in overall
    r      charge: "Now Mr. Duckenfield we must have have some policemen on the
           concourse to direct fans, not just down the tunnel, but round the side to
           make sure there is an e v e n   11
      MR. PAYNE: Certainly. The Club cannot wash their hands of their stewarding
           duties by simply saying "Oh the Police are doing it" without even bothering
           to find out what the Police are doing or what methods the POlice are using
           and without giving any instructions or guidance to the POlice as to what in
    H      fact they were supposed to be doing.

             MR. JUSTICE OOWITT: Did the Police, when the devised their operational order,
                  consult the Club about terms?
             MR. PAYNE: About the terms of the Green Guide?
        A
             MR. JUSTICE OOWITT: No, no.
          MR. PAYNE: About the terms of the operational order, no. My Lord, our submission
               is you would not expect them to. The safety of the ground as clearly
               envisaged by the document which deals with safety at sports ground,renvisages
               that the Club has those responsibilities inside the ground. My Lord, if I
               may say so it is one of the recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor's final
        B      report that there should be better liaison between theClub and the Police to
               make sure this problem does not arise.
             MR. JUSTICE OOWITT: I ask that question simply because I wonder what the answer
                  would have been if someone from the Club had given this instruction to
                  Mr. Duckenfield.
             MR. PAYNE: My Lord, I am actually informed that the Police do supply to the
•       c         Club a copy of the operational order so they inform them of its contents.
                  I am getting contradictory information, so there we are. My Lord, just
                  to complete this exercise under the Green Guide, I see I have missed out
                  178, so would your Lordship kindly go back to that. This isa management
                  responsibility. My Lord, I will come to means of escape later on, but it
                  needs to be collected here under management responsibility.
        j)                  "Means of escape. Structural means whereby a safe route is providede
                            for people to travel from any point of structure to a place of safety
                            without outside assistance. In a sports ground the means of escape
                            in the event of an emergency will usually be the same as the normal
                            egress routes plus any additional routes ... The kind of emergency
                            most likely to occur at a sports ground is fire but other types of
                            emergency such as bomb threat may arise which might necessitate the
                            evacuation of spectators from all or part of the spectator accommodation.
        E                   It is the management's responsibility to ensure that all exit routes
                            for use in an emergency are capable of being safely and effectively
                            used at all times when the ground is occupied."
                         My Lord, I have a note to look at the Corbundle at 697. Perhaps your
                    Lordship would kindly bear with me to see what that says.
          MR. JUSTICE OOWITT: I suppose it might be said that 178does not really contemplate
        F     the kind of emergency which arose on this occasion, because if the Green
               Guide is followed you do not get this kind of emergency, whereas even if you
               follow the Green Guide you cannot szy you will not get a fire or a bomb scare.
          MR. PAYNE: My Lord, I find difficult in dealing with the idea of having been in
               breach of the terms of the Green Guide, that would then absolve the Club
               from its duties to take care of emergencies, they themselves having created
               the situation which caused the emergency. They then cannot be expected to
        G     cope with it by means of escape because they have devised the unsafe
               situation themselves.
             MR. OUSTICE OOWITT: The Club are responsible for the emergency, if the Club
                  are responsible for the emergency there is no easy way out of it.
             MR. PAYNE: My Lord, our submission about emergency is that an emergency is an
         H       emergency, which means that it is not really foreseeable what it is goingg
                  to be. The only thing that one can see throughout the Green Guide is that

                                                                           x                      i

             constantly, and I have not done this exercise yet, your Lordship will see (
             that I think it is about 14 places in the Green Guide the document is
             addressing itself to emergencies and consequently the need to provide
             mean of escape and means for people to leave the ground at any time.
A MR. OUSTICE OOWITT: Is not your better way of putting it this: if the Club
       were responsible, whether in whole or in part, for this emergency, the
       responsibility was the greater — and the same argument canbe used against
       the Police -- in that this emergency, once it developed, was one to which
       there was no solution. If you look at that video film, unless you could
       have collapsed the perimeter fence there was no way out (inaudible) right
       at the back you would not have got through to people. "Please turn round
B     and go out the back." The point which is made I think in the Taylor report
       and a point born on me listening to as well as watching the video is the
       problem of communicating to football fans because of the noise. It makes
       all but the crudest kind of communication impossible.
  MR. PAYNE: Everything your Lordship has said emphasises the importance for
       having a system of counting and control and securing that the-capacity
       of what in fact was a trap was not exceeded. Once it is recognised that
C     the people at the front could not excape and that probably no practicable
       means of escape, certainly none was available, and the only practicable
       mean would have been removal of the fencing which trapped them in, once
       one realises what a horrible cage it was, then the means of counting and
       control of capacity to make sure it does not become overcrowded so that
       people cannot escape because all the more important.
     MR. OUSTICE OOWITT: You see I raise this point.. Your Engineer has gone through
D        the Green Guide comparing the stadium with the Green Guide with a fine tooth
          combe. How much was causative may be a different matter. For instance
          whether someone is 12 yards or 12 meters or 20 meters from the exit,this
          kind of situation may be neither here nor there. It is like saying that a
          man who cannot swim and is in the water. It does not matter whether it is
          10' deep or 100' deep or whether he is 12 meters or 20 meters from the
          quay.
  MR. PAYNE: Your Lordship's point is a good one, and we submit that if the club
       and the Engineer had heeded the numerous references throughout the Green
       Guide of the need to provide a means of escape, the means whereby people
       could leave the ground safely at any time. That is what the Green Guide
       keeps on saying.. There must be facilities for people to be able to leave
       if they want to at any time without outside assistance, the phrase which
       we have heard. Once one is aware of the fact that you have got to provide
p      that, then you look at the cages 3 and 4 and you realisethat when the
       crowd is far short of being overcrowded. There does not have to be a
       terrible crush as occurred, but when you have got a dense crowd in there,
       people at the front are trapped, people at the front cannot get out with
       an ordinary size crowd. They cannot see the gates and the radial fences
       and they cannot practically make their way back up to the top and there
        is no escape route. Once that is realised then the overwhelming importance
       of controlling the capacity of the pens and providing the means to do so
G      becomes self-evident.
     MR. OUSTICE OOWITT:                It seems to me that the importance of not allowing this kind
          of over filling               to develop should be seen by all of those who have to
          contemplate the               safe handling of the crowd at this ground.That may be   the
          Club, it may be               the Police, it maybe the Engineer.
      MR. PAYNE: The action is for contribution my Lord.

      MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: But I do not think you are going to get far by saying
          "Well they were only 20 meters from the radial gate. The radial gate
          could not be seen. If you make out a case against the Club that there
          ought to have been adequate means of access through the perimeter fence
    A     on to the pitch, that is another matter, but I do not think you are helped
          by saying people could not have got up at the back, because even if you
          had been able to knock down all the structures at the back the unfortunate
          people at the front were stuck there.
         MR. PAYNE: My Lord, we recognise that the situation should not have been allowed
             to arise. That is our case.
    ® MR. JUSTICE   JOWITT:     That is why I am not sure that in the end all the 45
          issues would bear on the important issue of causation.

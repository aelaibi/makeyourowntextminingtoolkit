STEVEN ROBER T SEWELL

INSPECTOR




Since    October           1987,    I     have       been     the    fifth       Inspector at           'FI'    Sub-Division

and     from     that      time     I    have     had       responsibility              for    the    preparation       of   the

’F I ’ football            orders       at   ’F I ’ .       I took over from Inspector Calvert who had

been doing         the football              orders at Hammerton Road for a number of years and

the systems of organising the manpower etc. are largely based on systems he


introduced.

I was       involved with            the organisation                of    the     1988       Semi-Final       for Liverpool

and     Nottingham          Forest.          This       was    done       together        with Chief        Inspector        Beal

and     Inspector Calvert                in consultation with Superintendent Murray and Chief

Superintendent Mole.

As    the    semi-finals            for      1989     were     drawing near             I was        watching which      teams

were     likely        to be      in the semi-finals.                  During the week commencing 13 March

 1989,      it   looked       as    if a semi-final                 could be staged at Hillsborough and at

 that     stage        I    started          addressing         my     mind        to    a    possible         semi-final      at

 Hillsborough.

 On Saturday           18 March 1989,            the F.A. Cup 6th rounds took place.                             On 20 March

 1989,       the    draws      for       the     seni-final           took    place          and   again,      Liverpool      and

 Nottingham         Forest         were      drawn      to play.          I believe           it was later on that day

 that       Chief      Superintendent                Mols     informed        me    that       the     semi-final       between

 those      two teams was due                 to be staged at Hillsborough.                           Easter Bank Holiday

 weekend         was    due    on    24,       25,    26 and        27 March        1989       and    together with Chief

 Superintendent Mole, a meeting was arranged for Wednesday 22 March 1989, of

 all persons involved with the semi-final.                                    Chief Superintendent Mole, Chief

Tr a nsport        Police        and      British            Rail Sector           Superintendent           Commanders and

their      Chief     Inspectors,             South      Yorkshire            Highways        Department,      Headquarters

Op e rations        staff,          Football         Liaison           Officer.           Through Football          Liaison

Department,             liaison        was      made       with        Sheffield          Wednesday        Football       Club,

Not t i n g ha m    Forest          Club,       Liverpool         Football          Club,      Merseyside         Police    and

N o t t in g hamshire       Constabulary.                  Through          Operations        Room,      liaison    was    kept

with South Yorkshire Ambulance Service and South Yorkshire Fire Service.

After the formal meeting on 22                             March 1989,            close liaison was kept with               all

parties          until    the       semi-final             on    15 April         1989.        Close co-operation           was

maintained throughout.

To g e t h e r   with     Chief       Inspector        Beal,          the   previous match order              for the 1988

semi-final          was    studied        and     as    this      was       a successful           operation,      it    formed

th                   "              the      1989      semi-final. Briefs               were       prepared       with     Chief

Superintendent- Beal,                 these were all discussed in detail with Superintendent

Murray and approved b y Chief Superintendent Duckenfield.

Basically,          the    serials        were       the    same       as    for the         1988 semi-final        with    the

following main            changes.            I will deal             with these briefly as I am aware that

Chief      Inspector        Beal       will     be    dealing with the changes                      in minute detail         in

his report.

Three      Inspectors           who    acted     as     liaison            officers     to    sector      commanders       were

di s pensed        with as       they were           under      employed.           One      reserve serial stationed

at    South        Stand/Spion            Kop    was       dispensed          with      as    it   was    superfluous        to

requirements.             Supervision of mobile units was reduced by ^                                      T ~
in practice        they      could          only be with          one    unit at       a time.        Serials        1 and 2

were     increased           by        two     Police        Constables               and     one     Police        Sergeant

respectively .

Serials     11   and        12    (North       Stand)       were        decreased       as    their    main       tasks    for

ensuring    that      supporters              did    not    use    the      Penistone         Road North egress            did

not    require     the manning               afforded       in    1988.       Serial        15 was decreased by one

Sergeant,    leaving one Sergeant                      supervising one serial.                      Further serials on

the    outskirts      of     the       ground       patrols       were      reduced        from one Sergeant and 10

Police    C o n stables          to    one     Sergeant          and     eight     Constables.             None    of   these

serials     were      directly              involved       with    access        or    egress       from    the     football

stadium and it was considered by all that these extra two Police Constables

per serial were additional to requirements.

Better use was made of resources and at Phase III,                                          four serials from within

the ground,        that was serials,                 2,8,20 and 21 were to assist the track serial

to prevent any pitch invasion at the end of the match.

Also,    during       the    1988       semi-final,          all       serials     deployed outside               the ground

were on s t a ndby for refreshments at Claywheels Lane through the duration of

the match.         They were some quarter of a mile away from the ground and were

too far away to deploy in the ground at short notice.                                             This year,       following

an idea put          forward by Superintendent Murray,                             from 2.45 p.m.           on the day of

the semi-final,             a Police          coach was stationed in Leppings Lane, near to the

ground and       a    further Police                coach was          stationed       in Penistone Road near to

gate     'O’ .       Of     the       men    who    were     due       to   meal      at     Claywheels      Lane       Police

Station     throughout            the match,          five       serials,      i.e.        five   Sergeants        and forty

Police C o n s t a b l e s , were detailed to get on EACH coach at the two locations

at     3.00 p.m.          They would remain on standby until 3-30 p.m.                                     when the coach

would drop       them off at Claywheels                      Lane Police Station for a meal and then

 pick up five further serials on EACH coach to return to t
deployment.

This    would make           better use                of 20    serials           throughout Phase II of the game.

In actual fact,             the five serials wh i c h were making their way to EACH of the

two coaches           for    3.00 p.m.             brought       them to the ground for that time instead

of     the    men     being           a    quarter        of    a        mile     away       at    Claywheels             Lane    Police

Station.         These           10       Serials       being        in    the       vicinity       of    the       two    coaches     at

3.00     p.m.       were     all          in     addition       to       manpower        resources         to    the       1988    semi­

final, as all these men would have been at Claywheels Lane Police Station.

The    serials        around          the      turnstiles           at     Leppings        Lane and Penistone Road and

in     the    enclosure          to        the    same    were       the        same    as    for       1988    which had proved

                      The    intelligence                 supplied          by       Football       Liaison          and    Detective

Sergeant        Charles w o r t h              local     intelligence,               did     not    throw      up    any    different

problems        from       the    1988          semi-final          which proved             to be a success.                   However,

even     though       the        1988       semi-final          had       been       a success          earnest      consideration

was     made    when        preparing             the    1989       semi-final          and every effort was made                      to

improve on an already successful operation from the previous year.

The Operational              Order was              approved         and        circulated on 6 April                  1989,      to all

Senior Officers              of Chief Inspector and above involved in the operation.                                                    A

 pre-briefing was arranged for sub-sector Inspectors and above on Friday,                                                               14

 April       1989     in    the           North    Stand       of     the       Wednesday          Ground.          All     Inspectors

 involved        in    the        operation             attended           or    a     Sergeant         deputing          for    the   few

 Inspectors who were unable to attend.                                       This Sergeant then liaised with the

 respective Inspectors prior to the match.

 On    that pre-brief,                Inspectors were handed an Operational Order and details

 q   J' serials       under           their       command       and        their       duties.          They    were       also    given

 serial orders for their respective Sergeants under their command.

 At     the     pre-brief,                these     officers              were       briefed       by    Chief       Superintendent

 D u c k e n f ield on policy, by Superintendent Murray on what was r e q u i re d at the
match and by m y s e l f on admin procedures which included r e p orting on and off

duty,    overtime        claims,    the       issue of radios          including all ground serials to

have    an    earpiece,      the       issue    of    meals     and    the   issue    of       vehicle      keys    for

those on transits.              T h e individual sector commanders then briefed their men

taking       them   to    all    relevant        parts     of    the    grounds      to    examine          locations

pertinent to their duties.

A personnel carrier was made available for Inspectors on out-lying parts of

the order to v i e w        their duties.              Whilst placing the         individual manpower on

the     Operational        Order,       every        consideration       was   made       to    using       the    best

resources       available        and    in     particular       supervisory     officers         with       extensive

experience of the ground used in locations familiar to t h e m .                                      With this in

mind, key Inspectors were placed in the following loca t i o n s :-

serials,     'F2' Officers and one 'E' Division Officer all worked these duties

before.          The     Sergeants           in      particular               have       extensive           knowledge   of      this

particular day.

Other      duties      were       considered          when         the manpower             was     placed on the serials

and great         thought         was    used when        identifying                    officers       to particular       duties

so    as    to    make        the       best      use     of        resources.               Also,        I    personally        made

 In addition I have close liaison with the senior stewards on all match days

 and with Mr Macrell, Secretary SWFC and Mr Lock, Security Officer.

 During      August          1988,       I     had      attended              a    steward's        meeting        at    Sheffield

 Wednesday          Football            Club        and   briefed                 all      the    stewards        re     emergency

 On     15 April        1989.       I commenced           duty          at        'FI'    at 7-00 a.m.           At 7-30 a.m.           I

 At approximately                 10.30 a.m.          the briefing finished and everything was going

 At    10.^5         a.m.     that       day,    with       Chief    Superintendent               Duckenfield         and Police

barriers      in position.             Near    to Leppings             Lane    traffic       island,         a minor road

traffic       accident        had    taken     place.           Officers           under     command         of     Inspector

Millett dealing.

At   12.30     a.m.     approximately,             liaising          with    Mr.     Lock,    Security            Officer         in

club    video       room     and    general        patrol       of     ground       with     Chief          Superintendent

Duckenfield - no problems,                   there were not a lot of fans about.                               Fans spoken

to in vicinity of the ground all                       in good spirits,                  no problems, no evidence

of alcohol at that stage.

At   1.30 p.m. with Chief Superintendent                            Duckenfield we went to the gymnasium

for a hot meal, outside C I D officers and track serials also mealing.

At     1.45    p.m.        approximately        to     Control          Room,       left     Chief          Superintendent

Duckenfield,           Superintendent               Murray,          Police         Sergeant        Goddard,              Police

Constable       Ryan,         Police     Constable             Bichard        in    Control        Box.           I    believe

Assistant Chief Constable, Mr. Jackson,                               in civilian clothing also present.

Between       1.50     p.m.    and     2.30    p.m.       general       patrol        of    North      Stand        and     South

Stand area upp e r concourses checking on betting booths, no problems noticed

and that South Stand                concourse were busy,                 quite a lot of Nottingham Forest

fans     arriving          early.      No     evidence         of     alcohol       in     South    Stand.            Checking

North     Stand       betting        booths     -    not       so     busy     in    Liverpool          side,         still       no

visible evidence of alcohol.

At     2.45    p.m.    in     the vicinity          of the          gymnasium and Police                Room area I was

 aware    that there were a number of prisoners on the cell buses and that the

 Police       Room    were     busy     but    I     spoke      with        Inspector        Barker,         who,      did    not

 report       any     problems         other       than        busy,     but        this     was       to    be       expected.

 Everything          was    still     going     to    plan.           About        this    time    I    was       aware      of    a

 message       from    Control        that     there      were       problems        at    Leppings          Lane     and     that

 further       manpower        was     required.               About        this     time     problems            with      radio

 reception.           I recall Police Sergeant G o d d a r d ’s (Control) vo
'warbling'        effect.            I    thought   my    radio    battery was          faulty,    other officers

were     e xperiencing           difficulty,          obvious       a   radio      fault,    not    my    particular

radio.        I      got    the          impression       that    Control        were   receiving        calls,     but

officers outside were having d i fficulty in receiving Control.

It was apparent            by the         tone of Police          Sergeant Goddard's voice that urgent

assistance was required at Leppings                          Lane.       I returned to the gymnasium and

informed Control that there were a large number of                                  ’D ’ Division officers on

standby     who         were     available          for    deployment.              I got from     Control        that

officers were           required at the             track,       Leppings    Lane end, west        Stand and       ’A'

gate.

I   grouped       the      serials together               and as     the    Sergeant        incharge      left     the

gymnasium,        I got Police              Sergeant      467 Sewell        on    logistics    in the gymnasium

to record who was being deployed and where to.                                   The following Sergeants and

serials     of       approximately            eight       men in    each     were deployed           as follows

(All    'D' Division)

Police     Sergeant 2916                                  Track

Police     Sergeant 1055                                  West Stand

Police     Sergeant            915                        Track

Police     Sergeant 2379                                  West Stand

Police Sergeant                916                         ’A' Gate

Police Sergeant                993                         'A' Gate

I   radioed       to     Control          where   these     officers       were    being    deployed,       but   I am

unable to say if Control received my messages.                                    All the above officers were

deployed        at      2.50    p.m.         It   was     obvious       from Control        that   they     required

further m a n p o w er         to the Leppings            Lane end.        I do recall some radio message

about     the     gates        being      opened    and    that    people        were on    the    track.     I then

regrouped         'E'    Division Crime and Vandal from Penistone Road turnstiles, who

were a reserve serial and deployed them through Control to Leppings Lane

track at 3-00 p.m.

Further s e r iaPs from            'D' Division arrived in the region of 3-00 p.m.,                                     these

were d e p loyed as f o l l o w s :-

Police Sergeant              690                         and serial to

Police Sergeant             628                          Leppings Lane track.

Followed       by Police       Sergeant         1379,     Police          Sergeant          593,   Police    Sergeant         7,

Police    Sergeant          1415   and a number of                 'D'    Division Police Constables to the

track.      Some       few    minutes      later,        I       saw Chief           Superintendent         Nesbit      who    I

think came       into the ground from Penistone                               Road end.       I spoke to him and he

went    onto     the    track.       At    this     stage which was now approximately                             3-10 p.m.

as I recall , it just              still        seemed       as     though there had been trouble at                      the

Leppings Lane end and that there had been a pitch invasion.

I then went down onto the track between the North Stand and the- K o p .

There     were    a    lot    of   officers        in    front           of    the    Leppings      Lane    terraces      and

obviously a number of fans in front of them.                                     The Nottingham Forest fans on

the     Kop were       chanting      and I got the                 impression at that stage that a large

number     of    fans       were   going        onto    the        pitch       at    Leppings      Lane     end   and    that

 there was going to be               severe       public d i s o r d e r .            At that stage I feared that

 fans may       get    to the      Police       Room and attempt                 to release        the prisoners.             At

 £his    stage    also       I could      hear    over           the radio that fans were                 trapped at the

 Leppings       Lane    end    and      that    medical           care     was      required.       Ambulancemen were

 arriving and          I assisted with getting medical care and ambulances down onto

 the track.           The    crowd was continually hostile and I was aware of about ten

 to twelve Police dogs and handlers being on standby near to the rear of the

 Kop/North       Stand       entrance.          Then    a number              of injured and dead were brought

 from     the    track        up   to     the    Kop/North               Stand       exit    on    the   stretchers       and

 hoarding boards.

 At first it seemed as if there were just a few, six or so, dead or injured
                                                                   -   11 -




and    then     people         came        running      off        the         track       with        dozens.           At     this        stage

which    was     probably            about       3-20    p.m.           Superintendent                 Bates        arrived,           he    came

into    the     gymnasium             with       me,     the           tables     and        chairs           for    the        meals        were

cleared       and     bodies         were        placed       on        the     floor        in       the     gymnasium.               Injured

people     were      taken        to    the      far    end      of       the    gymnasium.                  Many Police Officers

were    bewi l d e re d        and     some were         crying.               As bodies were being placed on the

floor,     friends          were        with      some       and        they     were        hysterical.                  Two     Liverpool

males,     one      with a dark moustache                        was          drunk and shouting at the Police,                                  he

was restrained by                 Detective Sergeant Smith and another CID Officer.                                                    He was

wanting       to     fight        and      was    obviously in drink                       and    shock.            The        bodies        kept

being brought             in      fast and I was asking Control for a doctor to ensure                                                       that

they were          dead.          There       was      nothing to suggest that any of the bodies                                             were

alive, but I was conscious they had not been certified as dead.                                                                  The bodies

were     covered          with       the    table       cloths          previously               laid out         for     the meals.              A

 doctor with a beard attended after about 30 minutes and certified the dead.

 I recall        Detective            Superintendent                   McKay     in the gymnasium and                          arrangements

 were getting in hand for the bodies to be numbered and an officer allocated

 to    each     of    them.            Outside         the       gymnasium            there           were    numerous           bodies          and

 injured       people          lying       on    the     ground           near        to    the        cell    buses.            St.        John's

 A m b ulance        personnel,             Police       Officers              and     civilians              were        in    attendance.

 There were about six young St. J o h n ’s personnel who were all under 14 or 15

 years     of      age,        who     were      very       distressed            near       to        the    Police           room.         I   got

 these     sat       in     the      cab    part       of    a     cell         bus    and        a    Policeman           from        ’B 2 ’ was

 d e t a il e d to look after them.

 I     remained        in      the      vicinity         of       the         gymnasium           for       the     next        hour        or   so.

  Inspector          Charles         was     detailed          to       start     making              records       of    the bodies             and

  several CID Officers came to assist.

  About 4.30 p.m.               I saw Chief Inspector Beal and together we grouped all the
remaining         officers             who    were     not     involved         with    bodies          or   other    duties

together in the North Stand.                          A short de-brief took place telling Sergeants

to hand        their de-brief                sheets    in at       that     location before being stood down

by Control           from the ground.                 A r rangements were made via message switch for

a message to be relayed to all Police Stations and over local radio that no

Police Officers had been injured in the incident.

About 4.30 p.m.              I saw Chief Superintendent Mole in uniform at the ground.

At    6.00 p.m.           I returned           to the    gymnasium          and assisted with supervision of

the Casualty Bureau forms.

Throughout           the evening I was                involved with liaising with                     the relatives and

social        workers       and        arrangements          for   extra       telephones        to    be placed      in the

gymnasiumn for the use of relatives.

General        liaison            of     events        re-busing          of    relatives          from      Forbes    Road.

Casualty        Bureau       duties          were     completed       and s ^ ^ g ^ t h a t       the     ancillary admin

staff and civilian staff were supervised ancktfcounted for.

At     5.30    a.m.       on Sunday           16 April       1989,    I left the gymnasium after the last

body had been removed and returned to duty at 11.00 a.m.                                              the same day.

numerous social workers and clergy attended the gymnasium,                                              this boosted the

morale         and        efforts        of     the    150     plus       Police       Officers         involved      in    the

gymnasium.                Many    Police       Officers       have     been     in deep       shock       since    the event

and     in    particular,              six    of my A r e a Officers            who were         in the      front    line on

 the    track        in    front       of Leppings        Lane       terraces,        went    off sick due           to shock

 and    stress        related          illnesses.         All      the Police Officers                I saw involved         in

 the    event         acted       in     a    professional         manner       and    are   a   total       credit    to   the

At    3,00pm          (1500)              a     loud cheer                went       up, o b v i o u s l y       the    game           had       started.

This       caused          the       Liverpool              supporters                 to     start         jogging          and       quicken           t he

pace       to    get       to       the    ground*               Just       after           the       game       had    started             a    group        of

ana    there          was       trouble,              also       that       they         had       six      tickets          “seating*1 on ly

to    find       six       Liverpool              supporters                sitting              in       their       seats       and       proauced

ticket          stubs          to    prove        it.

FOOTBALL SPECTATORS' BILL ANB SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS

Thank you for your le tte r of .lQ^ifuly seeking colleagues' policy agreem ent to two
amendm ents to the Football Spectators' Bill and to the establishment of the licensing
auth ority under the Bill as a non-Departmental public body (NDPB).

The Prime Minister, P eter Walker and John Major wrote agreeing to your proposals.
P e te r Walker asked th at there should be provision for him to be consulted about
appointm ents to the licensing authority and th a t the relevant amendment should provide
for any recommendation by the licensing authority th a t a Welsh club's stadium should be
required to convert to all-seated accommodation to be made to him. I understand th a t
you are c o n ten t to take both these points on board. The Prime Minster was concerned
th a t the licensing authority should not become a pressure group for additional
expenditure or engage in em pire building. John Major indicated th a t he would be looking
to you to find offsetting savings within your programmes for any costs in the current
year arising from the establishment of the licensing authority.

No other colleague commented and you may take it, therefore, th a t you have H
C o m m ittee 's policy approval for the proposals set out in your le tte r. I note th a t you
will be tabling the necessary amendments to the Bill in Standing C om m ittee.

I am copying this le tte r to the Prime Minister, members of H C om m ittee, Sir Robin
Butler and First Parliam entary Counsel.

              In April        1983,       as D e t e c t i v e       Superintendent                at    *F* D i v i s i o n ,       I

              attended a football                   match        being        p l a y e d at    the      home      ground       of S h e f f i e l d

              Wednesday Football                C l ub,        Hillsborough.                 The     gams was         a Cup Semi-Final'

              and     was    played       b e t w e e n L i v e r p o o l FC a n d N o t t i n g h a m F o r e s t             FC.          Thare

              was     a   capacity        c r owd    and admission                 was     by t i c k e t     only.

              My    remit     on that        day     was to         organise         an d     supervise           all e l e m e n t s           of

              crime       prevention and             crime          detection.

              At    about" 2 . 4 0 p m     that      day I found              myself        outside         the    ground          in the

              Leppings        Lane    turnstile               area.          The    crowd      usi n g     those      turnstiles                were

              mostly        good    natured         but,       about         2.50pm,       there        was   a build         up     in the

              numbers        of    people      using          the    turnstiles            an d a s i z e a b l e       queue

              developed.           There      was        increasing            evidence         of      drunkenness          amongst             the

              supporters           who were         all       Liverpool            fans.       T h e r e was a g o o d          deal        of

On Friday          14 A p r i l     1 9 39    I took         part     in a        'phone       in p r o g r a m m e 'w i t h

Radio       Marsevside,            when      I spoke w i t h          the     presenter           of that -programme

passed       on v a r i o u s      pieces         of advice          for    fans who wers              travelling              to

Sheffield.            One     of    the      areas      w h ich      I s t r e s s e d was        that     it was         an all-

ticket       match and          that      fans      who      did     not    have a ticket              should           not    come.

At    S.QDpm       that     same     afternoon             I gave       similar          advice,       by telephone,

w h i c h was      recorded         by a m e m b e r         of s t a f f     at R a d i o      Nottingham.

Qn Saturday            15 A p ril 1 9 3 9          I was     responsible              for all       matters          in

relation        to     crime        at the     C u p Tie S e m i - F i n a l          between Liverpool                   FC and

Nottin gha m Forest                FC.       As    it was a          c ar b o n    copy of the m a t c h w h i c h                  had

been    played        before        it m a d e      sense       to    use what           had    previously              been

successful           arrangements             as     the bulk         of    the      supporters          would          have

attended        the     previous          m a t c h and w o u l d          be a w are        of the      locations             of

On    the    day my s t a ff         were         split      into     two     teams.           A team      of      12

officers,          under      the    command          of D e t e c t i v e        I n s p e c t o r T ow a l l ,     wh o were

to    operate        in a n d a r o u n d         the g ro und.            E i ght     of    those     officers           were       to

be    engaged        ombssrvations,                   l o c king      cut     for      pi ck-po eke t s .

Outside       the      ground        Detective            Inspector           Scaife        had    charge          of a team         of

14 o f f i c e r s     who w e r e to         be    responsible             for      the    p r e v e n t i o n and

detection          of s t r e e t    crime.           Two     of     these        officers        were     in      plain

clothes       on n o n - d e s c r i p t      motor       cycles        and       it had       been e n v i s a g e d that,

whilst       the     game     was    in progress,              these        officers           would     patrol          the

quiet       s treets       l i n ed w i t h       par ke d    cars      in a n ' e f f o r t      to   prevent           and

detect       theft     from        cars.

I a t t e n d e d the       briefing          at S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y FC at             10.00am and

following          this     b r i e f e d my       own d e t e c t i v e s .         I was      accompanied              through

the    first       part of         the    d a y by P o l i c e        Constable             2439 Bocking,               who    was     '
in    civilian         clothes.

At    10.30am,         together         w i t h PC B a c k i n g ,         I went       to a m o b i l e         p ol i c e       radio

cont ro l ,      who w e r e     monitoring              all    CID     transmissions                on    channel           1?.

This     c a r a v a n was      placed        on     land at         the    side    of H i l l f c o t          br i d g e    and

o n l y a few y a r d s         from the           frontage          of a p u b l i c     h o us e        called       "The Owl*

E v e n at     that      stage     supporters             were       queuing       outside,           waiting          for the'

Owl    to be o p e ne d ,        and     at       11.00am       the     bars    o p ened.

I remained            in a n d a r o u n d        that    l o c a t i o n for      some      4-0 m i n u t e s       and      during

that     period,         trade     at    the       publ i c     house       increased           as    f o o t b a ll     fans

g a t h e r e d thsrs.

The    location          of t h i s     public          house    would       lead me         to      believe         t ha t the

majority,         if not all,            of       these     fans      were     Nottingham Forest

supporters.            I had     nothing           to    do w i t h     them a n d       cannot           say    for     certain.

I patrolled            in m y    own     vehicle          with       PC S o c k i n g    a n d at a b o u t          I. O Op m         had

a meeting         with        Detective           Inspector          Scaife     and      some        cf his        staff          in

the    p a r k i ng    area     for     Wadsley Bridge                Section Station.                     This      lasted a

few minutes            and a fter        the       departure          of D e t e c t i v e      Inspector Scaife and

his    sta f f    I was        joined        by the       two    motor       cyclists           and       I gave       them

further       instructions.

At    about      1. 3 0 p m    I went        to    the S o u t h Y o r k s h i r e       Police           S p o r t s and

Social       C l u b at N i a g a r a        as    traffic       was       building       up a n d         it was        my

intention         to     leave     my    car       in the       car     park    there        and      spend        the       time

between       t h e n an d      the     start       of the match,              on foot.              W h i l s t at      that

location         I went        into     the       Club with          PC 2 o eking        an d     sou g h t      out     the

and    for w h o m      I had a r r a n g e d           nearby       parking.           I had        not met Mr.              Baxter

before       and,      having      introduced myself                    as a m a t t e r        of    courtesy,              PC

      this     point.              Th e    turnstiles             A-G were            arranged         on      the      left     by the

      contained           behind           this       barr i e r .

      It was       apparent               that     the      turnstiles              were       not    coping          efficiently with

      the    crowd,           which        was     swelling          by the mi n u t e .

      Forest       turnstiles               into       the S o u t h         S ta n d .        They were          having         no

      difficulty with                     the    people          in that        area and             I spoke          to a m a n        I ■know

      as    Sergeant           Hodgstt           and       told him          that        I anticipated                that,      as    the

      crowd       i n c r e a s e d at          the L e p p i n g s       Lane        turnstiles,              m or e    po l i c e     officers

      would       be     required and                 I asked        him      to      post an         officer           from his serial

      nearer       to     the       turnstiles              at L e p p i n g s        Lane      and    in view of the.

      I remember              at    one     time,          Inspector P ur dy               standing            on the        b a rrier        with

      walker,          vainly        trying           to a d d r e s s       the      crowd.          r-ie was        beginning          to     lock

      frightened              and,        frankly,          I was       not     surprised.

      A    young       boy     of s o m e        10 or       12 y e a r s       climbed          to    the       top of         the    wall

      deterred           him f r o m        dropping             over     and       he    returned          to    the       c r owd    on this

      side.        I was           dismayed           to   r e a li s e      th a t      in this       swelling             mass      of p e o p l e

marked       ’C*      were      opined and             closed        on a nu m be r         of    occasions              by

stewards         on the         other        side,       eit h e r    to a l l o w     officials              and       police

injuries.             One     of * hsse           was a c h i l d who was              carried             bodily        in and who

had been         removed          from       the     crush at         the     turnstiles.

At    some    stags,          I would         guess       at a b o u t      £.4Gpm,         I sa w S u p e r i n t e n d e n t

Marshall         directing           p ol i c e      operations            in this         crush.           He wa s       having        to

understand            the     reason         for     this      requ e s t .      I did        not      see S u p e r i n t e n d e n t

Marshall         again.           I wa s      later       to    learn,        in fact,           that       he     remained

there     continuing             ta d i r e c t       operations            in the a r e a            of    the L e p p i n g s

Lane    turnstiles             bu* 'such was              the     thronging           mass       of    people           that     I did

Not    long      afterwards             I spoke          to    Inspector         Purdy and             said        I t ho u g h t     the

gates     should         be    opened.

At    some    sta g e       it was       decided          that       some     large w r o u g h t           iron g a t e s        which

lead    out      into L e p p i n g s         Lane       should       be    closed         in o r d e r       to     prevent        the

now    seething          mass      of    pe op l e       in L e p p i n g s    Lane        from       continuing              to a p p l y

pressure         to the        queue         to    the t u r n s t i l e s .        This     was       done        successfully

but    it s e e m e d       to be o n l y mi nutes               before        the     gates          were       forced        open

again     and the           p r e s su r e    resumed.           At     one    stage,        still          pre-occupied

with    the      p i c k - p o c k e t s , I moved nearer                   to t h ese       blue          gat e s      but.\_‘\

During    these        f e w b r ief         moments           I was        frightened          for my        own     safety and

kick-off       had     been        delayed          for     15 m i n u t e s .

The    crowd    became           more     a n d more           unruly and           nasty        and      I c o uld hear

officers,       wh o       were     ca u g h t      in       the       press,       y e l l i n g f r a n t i c a l l y into

their    p e r s on a l     radios.

I began     to have          grave        fears          that       the     situation          cou l d      only    end     in

disaster.           The     c r o w d were          beginning             to    swarm       over      the w a l l s      into     the

ground.        People        in the          crowd w e r e            shouting         and     screaming           for

     At     va rious       times      during            this     period         the m o u n t e d       police       officers           had

     been      supplemented              by a num b e r            cf o t h e r s      and       I would        estimate          there

     b e ing     in the       region          cf S to          10 m o u n t e d       officers          in that          small       area.

     T h e y were,         for    the m o s t           part,      engulfed           in the       crowd a n d           unable        to

     contain         it.

     A    few m i nu t e s       before        2o " d o c k ,        perhaps          three       or four,          I heard, the

     message         given over              a uniformed            o f f i c e r ’s radio            "Op e n      the    gate"        and

     almost       immediately                the    concertina            doors         of     gate     'C*     were      opened.            I

,(   wa s    stan d i n g     o n l y a few yar d s                from       the     gate.        I should          say at          this-

     point       that      these     g a tes        had n e v e r        been        u n der     severe       pressure          as     the

     c r o w d had      recognised             that       there        was      no    probability             of    entering

     through         that     gate.           The       people       in the          immediate          vicinity          of th e gate

     began       to gc t h r o u g h          it and        it     seemed         to taka         the    bulk       of    the     crowd 30

     seconds         or so to         r e a l i s e what           had    o c c u r re d .

     The     trickle        of    pe o p l e       going       into      the      ground         through        this      gate

     i n c r e a s e d and       for a sho r t            period         t h e r e was         containable           entry        through

     t he   gate.          It was        a    relief       to me         to     see    the       gate   o p e n e d and, .at this

     p oint,      I rema r k e d         to PC S o c k i n g           “T h a t      gate      should     have       been opened                 •

     Over      the    ne:<t two          cr    three m i n u t e s            the     flow t h r o u g h        this      gate

     increased and               it was        apparent           to me         that       the    situation          at     the

     turnstiles            would     soon          be    eased.          It was        a b o ut    this       time       that     I heard

     a    roar    from      the     c ro w d       inside        the     g r o u n d an d        assumed        that      e i th e r    the

     having       thought         that        the       game was         going        to     be d e l ay e d .       This       roar

     increased          the      urgency           of    the     people         entering          the   ground.             I, t u r n e d       to

      would        be     contained and              I left          the     pitch at          the      north     east       corner.

      minute        or so,         I decided            to w a l k      over.          I had        gone    o n l y about          40 y a rds

s e n i or    o f f icer      present.

People        started arriving                 into      the     gymnasium            carrying            vict im s .          The

first.victim             to a r r i v e      was a y o u n g         man    an d      I believe              he was       c a rried

in by two          police       officers           and a civilian.                    He     was       t a k e n to     the wall

opposite          the    door a n d         laid down.            Other       people          were        now    flooding            into

the     gymnasium          carrying          vict i m s .       Th e    f i rst       m a n wa s        apparently             deed

and     I t o u c h e d one       of    the     officers-            introduced myself,                       and     explained

to him that             that    body was           his      res p o n s i b i 1 ity a n d          that       under       no

c i r c u m s t a n c e s was     he    to     leave        that body.                He was       to        ensure      that no

one     else had a ny d e a l i n g s              with     the      property           or    clothing           or

identification                of that        body.        These        were      instructions                 that      I was        to

repeat        dozens       of t i m e s      on that        afternoon.

Brought        in w i t h      the d e a d w e r e        the     injured and                these       were        d i r e c t e d to

dead were a r r i v i n g          in s u c h       numbers          that     it was          impossible              to try to

e s t a b l i s h whet h e r ,     in fact,           they w e r e         dead,        but       I have        to    say that

e v er y     body that         I saw        bore w h a t       I recognise              to    be       classic        signs      of

asphyxia and             I am s a t i s f i e d       that      every       body        that       I s a w an d         directed

Although          I saw most           of    the    bodies        I have         to     say       that       I di d     not see

them all.           Indeed       they w e r e        arriving           in s u c h         numbers           and with          such

frequency         that      on m a n y       occasions          it was        impossible                to    give

instructions             before        the    officers          who     had      brought           the       body     in had

t h sse      people       were     distressed,              weeping          openly,           screaming,          aggressive

and     I saw s e v e r a l        -fights an d s c u f f l e s              brea k         out    in the a r e a around,

between and            over      the     bo d i e s    that        were      being          deposited.

Some      drunks       we re a s s i s t i n g        to    br i ng      the      d e a d and        i nj ured     pa r sons          into

trouble.            Officers         and      c i v i l i a n s were         attempting              to    resuscitate            some

of     the    victims        and     I sa w at         least          two    such groups a t t e m p t i n g                to

revive,         what      were     quite       obviously              to me,        dead       bodies.

Of     the     people      arriving           in the        g y m n a s i u m m a n y were            s t a n d i n g a r ound,

remaining           there.         Police        officers             were       g o in g    back out        to f e t c h more

casualties           and     the     scene       was       one     of    general            confusion with             bodies

being        put d o w n     haphazardly.

At     some     stage      I saw D et ec t i v e             Inspector            Charles,           apparently            having

come      into      the    gy m w i t h       a body,         about         to    leave        the    gy m n a s i u m .     Mr.

Charles         had a t t e n d e d      the m a t c h        on      duty       in full          police     uniform.             I

shouted         to Mr.       Charles          and whan           ha     came      to me        I told him          that this

public        order       situation           in the        gymnasium             ha d to be          c o n t r o l l e d and         told

him     to get       some     men and          get     on w i t h        it.        He      immediately          started

gathering           police       officers         to hi m and               giving          them     instructions            -and I

noted        that    he g a ve p r i o r i t y         to     the       g y m n a s i u m floor.            It was

impossible           to    count        the    bo d i e s as          they a r r i v e ,          out w h e n    there       were

about        2-Q I r e m e m b e r      thinking           that       there       c o uld      not    be m a n y more            dead.

As     the    bodies       were      laid      n ea r e r     and       nearer        to     the g y m n a s i u m     door

s ome o n e ,     I believe          it was       Detective              Sergeant            McSioy,        said to me            "If

we     don't      start      la y i ng     the    bo d i e s       out      n e a t l y we will            never     get     them

all     in".        I told       hi m    to    grab        some       m e n a n d 'get on w i t h            it.

Two     officers          in u n i f o r m     from        the U n d e r w a t e r          S e a r c h Unit     came       to me at

some      time.        They      were      carrying           a hand-held                video       unit.       They      told me

that      they had         been      recording             the     scene         in a n d a r o u n d       the a r e a      of    the

Leppings Lane              goalmouth          but      that        t he y ha d       b e e n assaulted, on two
occasions           by f o o t b a l l       supporters               and    they        had    had to        r etreat        for

their       safety.            I recognised                need       for     evidence          gathering          a n d t ol d t h e m

to     start     filming           the     s c en e     in the          gym.        I do       not    reme m b e r    seeing          them

again.

I find        it v er y       difficult            to      recall         the      events       in the       gymnasium.               My

overall        perception             is     one      of    dead        bod i e s     arriving         and     bei n g       carried

by s h o c k e d a n d        perspiring              p ol i c e      officers;           by d i s t r e s s e d     pe o pl e who

were      obviously           friends         and       relatives            and      by d r u n k e n      people,          some     of

w h o m were        shouting          and wanting                to     fight.           Injured       people w e r e

arriving and               b e ing    directed             to    the      far      end    of the       h a 11 a n d      the       scene

was     one    of      increasing            c o n f u s i o n.

Some      de g r e e    of    regulation              began        to     take      place       as    Inspector          Charles

a n d his      team r e g u l a t e d         the       p eo p l e      in the        gym a n d       ejected        the      u nr u l y

ones.         it w o u l d     have        been       folly        to     try a n d      separate           the    grieving

relatives           and      friends         from       the      bodies          a n d many,         many     people w e r e          left

standing         around         in the        gymnasium               helplessly,              in ail       stages       of    d i s t re s s

On     several         occasions           I went          through          to     the P o l i c e     Room       to m a k e       use     of

the     te l e p h o n e     w h ic h was        in there,                but        the        Police       R o o m was       busy, the

telephone           was      in use        and     when         1' b u l l i e d    my w a y     to    the     telephone            the.

At     some    stage         I recall h av i n g           seen       a   police         officer        sat    on        a    chair        by

th e    tel-ephone           in the P o l i c e            Room.          He ha d a big          tear       in his

tro u s e rs .         He was        weeping          openly.             He was      quite      obviously           shock e d .         I

had. a few wor d s             with        hi m w h i c h        seemed          to me     to    be    totally        inadequate

and     left him.

At     a very early            stag e        I had         deputed          someone         to a r r a n g e      for the          maj o r

I had a l s o       asked         for     the      Coroner        to bs     informed - which                  s e e m e d at       the

time     to    be a n a b s o l u t e l y          incongruous         request.

At    some     st ag e ,      I think         after       half     an hour,         I needed          to m a k e      contact

with     the     control          box     inside       the     ground       to     inform      them of          the

situation         in the         g y m n a s i u m a n d as        I was      unable       to c o ntact          them       by

telephone         and      I knew         that a n y       radio      message         passed w o u l d          be    relayed,

over     every      o f f i c e r ’s radio           in the        ground,         I went      on foot.              I am now

informed         by D e t e c t i v e        Inspector        Towell        that      he a c c o m p a n i e d me,          but my

recollection             of     ev e n t s    is so       b l u r r e d and      distorted           that     I cannot

remember         him     doing       so,      although         I have       no     reason      to dou b t        that       he did

At    the P o l i c e      Control           Box    I spoke        to Mr.        Addis     and,       whilst         I cannot         ,

remember         what      I s a i d to         him,      I must      have       t o l d him the s i t u a t i o n            in

the    gymnasium.               I do     remember          speaking         to the ACC O p e r a t i o n s ,            Mr.

Jackson,         and mentioning                 that a m o n g s t     other        prob l e m s      we w o u l d     have

were     the     press,         who w e r e        present        in numbers.            Mr.    A ddis        a s k e d tne tc

Other      than     that        I h'ave no          idea     of   what      time      it was.

O n my     return        to the         g y m n a s i u m w i t h Mr.       Addis       I saw        se n i o r a m b u l a n c e

officials,          in     particular              Alan Hopkins           who      I i n t r o d u c e d to Mr.         A d dis

a n d who      would       be    responsible.

Mr.    Addis      then        took      charge       in the       gymnasium          and a f t e r a fe w m i n u t e s

of a s s e s s i n g     the     situation           he    stood      on a chair,             called for             order       in

Most     of the         bodies         by this         time      had     bean       draped with what                  appeared            to

 It was a b o u t          this    time        that       I remembered              that        my y o u n g e s t     so n was

somewhere          in the          crowd and almost                   all    of the         bodies,        the feet           of

w h i c h were        protruding             from      u n der    these          tablecloths,             s e e m e d to      have

t rai n e r s    on     identical            to his.            I had       to     re s i s t    the urge         to go and

 look at        e a c h of       the    bodies.

It was d e c i d e d         that       I should            return       to H a m m e r ton Road,              assist,        in

setting         up a M a j o r         Incident           Room    there          and also          arrange        for    the

f r i e n d s a nd      relatives            to    be b u s s e d      to H a m m e r t o n R o a d P o l i c e          Station.

I arranged            to    be    taken        to H a m m e r t o n R o a d         by a m a r k e d       police        car and

Detective          Inspector            Tcwell         travelled            in w h a t      I believe was               t h e ' prison

bus,    with anxious               relatives              and    friends.

O n a r r ival        at H a m m e r t o n R o a d          I found         the     place        under     virtual           siege.

Liverpool         supporters                were wanting              to m a k e      urgent        enquiries,           many were

standing around                  not    knowing           what    to     do a n d       someone         had    put      out     a call

for all         off-duty          sotial          workers        to    rep o r t      to H a m m e r t o n R o a d a n d           ther e

were    many social               workers.             My    f i rst     r e a c t i o n was        one of d i s m a y at the

thought, of so m a n y                 social       workers           being       directed          to this          area     but,     in

a   very short             time,       it    be c a m e     apparent         that      t h e y were        to be        invaluable

and    prov i d e d a b u f f e r            between         distressed             relatives          and     fans,        who     had

lost    contact w i t h            relatives              and    friends          in the         crowd,       a n d the       police.

I called t o g e t h e r           the       Incident           Room    staff,- who              had a r r i v e d at         the

Station         to set       up    the       Incident           room,       and     briefed         them as          to w h a t     had

o c c u r r e d at     the       ground and            the      situation           there.          I should          say     here

that    I was a w a r e           that      arrangements               had       b e en m a de      for    the C a s u a l t y

B u r e a u to be a c t i v a t e d .              I was        shortly       to     be    informed           however         t h a t '.,

      I tried       to m a k e       a telephone                 call        to x-y home        but    could net          ge.t an

      t h e r e was      a direct           outside           line.           I t e l e p h o n e d home a nd e s t a b l i s h e d

      I can say          for      car t a i n          is    that          it was         still       daylight.

      I was     surprised            to     see S u p e r i n t e n d e n t          S i e a t h at H a m m s r t o n R o a d     Police

      a    potential        firearms             situation              in    'FT     Sub-Division;             another        was      a

      i n v o l v e d the      body       of an        old       lady which           had been         found      in a f i r e at

      her    home     u n der       suspicious               circumstances.                  I asked Detective                Chief

      Inspector          Addison          to     go    to E c c l e s f i e l d       Police      S t a t i o n and       deal    with

      the    body a n d        deputed Detective                        Inspector        Scaife        to deal         with    tine

      firearms        incident            there.

      I needed        to    spe a k       to D e t e c t i v e          Chief       Inspector         Addis     on m a n y

      occasions          during         the      evening           but       c ontact w i t h     him was        only       possible

      by    contacting            people with               him       on     channel     25 of        the    police       r a d i o an d

      then    requesting             him       to     return          to     channel      19,    in the       hope      that     our

      conversation would                   be mo re s e c u r e .
At    some    time     during         the       eveni n g ,          but     not, long a f t e r             Mr.    Addison         ha d

left     for E c c l e s f i e l d ,       I returned                to    the       gymnasium           for a      conference

w i t h Mr.      Addis     and       found       that          the    Coroner,            Mr.    P o tter,         a n d the H o m e

Office Pathologist,                   Professor                Usher,        were       in a t t e n d a n c e .         Professor

usher     said     that        t h e r e wa s        little          he    cou ld      do at         the s c e n e a n d a g r e e d

to go over         to E c c l e s f i e l d          to    look       at     the      scene a n d the              body     there.         I

arranged         transport           for    him.

The    scene at        the      g y m n a s i u m was           now much more                orderly.              The     bodies      had

all    been      certified           dead.           There       were       a n um b e r        of    doctors         in

■attendance;         the r e      were      social             workers;          m an y     grieving          relatives and

m a n y many      po l i c e    officers,             all       of    whom       looked         shocked,           d r a w n an d     tire

I believe         that     it was          at    this          stage       I saw a m a n             I r e c o g n i s e d as Dr.

trauma       connected with major                         incidents             and,      in p a r t i c u l a r ,       in.his

Mr.    A d dis    d i s c u s s e d w i t h me            his    plans          to    p h o t og r a p h ,    with a        Polaroid

..part of the        gymnasium             and       to h a v e       relatives             brought,          one     lot at a

time,     to the       gymnasium            to       be s h o w n         the    photographs              and,      if a

p h o t o g r a p h wa s   picked          out,       to       have       the    body       relat in g        to    that

photograph         removed           from       the       hall       into       a temporary              viewing         room a n d

We    also    d i s c u s s e d at     that          time       our       priorities            and decided              that    no

p olice      enquiry       cou l d     commence                that       night      an d    it was          imperative          that

all    police      efforts           should          be d i r e c t e d         towards         the      s i t u a t i o n at    the

gymnasium;           identification                   of       the    bodies         and     providing             what

assistance         was     possible             to    the       relatives.

I retu r ne d      to Hamrnerton R o a d P o l i c e                       S t a t i o n and         closed        down    the

During        the      evening           the        rel a t i v es       had been          r e m o v e d first         to

I had at          least        two       other         conversations,                 during       the       even in g ,         w i t h AC C

Mr.    Jackson           to    update             him,      but      I cannot         r e m em b e r    the       c on t e n t    of    the

conversation.

I returned             to the        g y m n a s i u m at Hi 1 1 s b o r o u g h , spoke                     to Mr.         Ad dis      and

t o l d him       of     the    conference.

I decided           that       I otight t h e n                to have a            look at       the       stand and            terraces

where     the d i s a s t e r            had       occ u r r e d ,       (even th o u g h         it was          in d a r kn e s s )        in

order      that        I co uld          be       properly           i n f o r m e d for      tine c o n f e r e n c e w h i c h was

to    follow.            Although             the      light was            not      good     it was         light       e no u g h     to

give     me     some       indication                of     the     d e v a s t a t i o n w h i c h had           o c curred.           I was

accompanied              by D e t e c t i v e          I n s p e c to r     Towel 1.

Uie went        f r om    there          through            the tunnel              and    round       to    the     turnstile a r e a

and    on our w a y            back       to       the      gymnasium           saw       the C h i e f      Constable            with a

'jroup of people               at        the       scene.

I informed             the C h i e f          Constable             of    the m e e t i n g      being        set      up at

              against          it.

              After      I had        returned          to       the     gymnasium            I went        to H a m m e r t o n R o a d P o l i c e

Myself         a^d     other        officers           received          numerous

outside         attempting              to    enter        the     ground were                being

side      of    thg^ates               began      hammering             frantically             on

them and were                 repeatedly attempting                        to   forcibly

open      them.           Fans      entering          the       ground were              by    this

time      complaining                  h y s t e r i c a l l y at       officers          o n the

inside         of    the      ga t e s ,     demanding            for    them       to    be

opened.         Numerous            fans      were      of      the     opinion          that

people         outside         would         beykilled,            unless        the      gate

I went         though         the      gates      and      could        see     that      the

situation            outside           had    eased with about                  2 hundred

waiting         outside.               A short         time       late r      all    officers

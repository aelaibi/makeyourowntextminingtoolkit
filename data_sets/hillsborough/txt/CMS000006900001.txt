Secretary of State
  REVIEW OF ALL-SEATING REQUIREMENT AT FOOTBALL LEAGUE GROUNDS

1. I understand that Mr Key has cleared the terms of the
proposed review of the all-seating requirement at football
grounds   and  the draft announcement,    which accompanied my
submission of 15 May. The papers are now on their way to you and
I would like to suggest an alternative way of making the
announcement instead of an answer to an arranged PQ. Assuming
that the announcement cannot be cleared this week, then the
earliest you would be able to give an answer to an arranged PQ
would be 3 June. You may therefore wish to consider making an
announcement by means of a letter to Tom Pendry accompanied by a
Press Release during the recess. If this could be timed for
Thursday 28 May, you could make the announcement at the Sports
Editors lunch that day. Press Office are happy with this
suggestion.

2.  The letters to Kenneth Clarke, Ian Lang and David Hunt have
all been revised to take account of this option.

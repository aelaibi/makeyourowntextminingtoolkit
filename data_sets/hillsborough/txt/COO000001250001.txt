                     Hillsborough Scrutiny : O ral statement


As you may recall the Home Secretary made an oral statement in the House on 30
June 1997 to announce the scrutiny into the Hillsborough disaster.

Lord Justice Stuart Smith has now delivered his report to the Home Secretary and
we are now considering it. The Home Secretary’s initial reaction is that he would
like to respond and publish the report in an oral statement. There is also the high
expectation of the Hillsborough victims’ families that he will do this.

I would therefore be grateful if Business Managers could consider whether the
Home Secretary could make an oral statement during the week beginning the 16th
February, as we should be able to respond by then. This would follow an away
fixture for Liverpool Football Club on the 14th February at Hillsborough. I was
going to recommend a statement on the 16th February, as some of the families are
coming down to London on that day but I now understand that the second reading
of the Human Rights Bill in the Commons could be scheduled then. Our
preference would then be for Wednesday 18 February although I fully understand
that the timing is for the Business Managers to determine.

I am copying this minute to Angus Lapsle;y and Alun Evans.

Thank you for your assistance.

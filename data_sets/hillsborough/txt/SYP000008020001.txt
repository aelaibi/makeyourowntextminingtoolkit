          became     engulfed      in the      crowd and      I had to         push and struggle         to get

          back    into a relatively            clear    space    near    to the       light    portable    barriers.



          During     these      few brief moments          I was     frigh t e n e d for my own safety and

          it made me        realise what        conditions must          have      been    like    in the more

          s e v erely    packed area behind the barrier                  leading       to the turnstiles.             I

          was    getting     quite    concerned and          remember         remarking     to PC Bo eking       that

          they were       going    to have      to open the         gates.

          Conditions        deteriorated,        missies were         t h V o w n , a beer     can w ith a drink

          spilling       from    it striking         a police    officer        on h o r s e b a c k . There was

          As    it got nearer        to 3 o'clock        it became a p p arent            to everyone     that       it

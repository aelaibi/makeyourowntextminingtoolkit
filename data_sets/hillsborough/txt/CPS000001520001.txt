   Dear Sirs

  ADLINGTON -V- DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

  We acknowledge receipt of your letter of 31 December by fax which the writer has only
  seen on his return to the office today. We are also aware today of a letter written by
  Hammond Suddards to Hillsborough Family Support Group which does seem to be
  slightly at variance with the first part of the third paragraph of your letter. The letter
  inter alia says “the South Yorkshire Police do not propose to delay disclosure on the
  basis that such proceedings are being considered (the application for Judicial Review)
  but will review the position if such proceedings are actually instituted and reserve the
  right to suspend disclosure pending the outcome in that event”.

  On balance we feel that the disclosure should follow the decision in the Judicial Review
  application, that simply being a logical course. However, we are not a party to the
  application for the witness summons and the production of documents and it will be a
  matter for the Stipendiary Magistrate to decide whether he will accept any
  representations from us in this regard. We are content to know that whatever disclosure
  is made and whatever facilities for inspection are given that we shall see the disclosure
  and have the same facilities for inspection.

  Yours faithfully




■YR B Manning

                                                          22 January 1990




                         TAYLOR REPORT


     As you know, the Prime Minister will chair a meeting
at 11 a.m. tomorrow to consider Lord Justice Taylor's
final report on the Hillsborough disaster.      The Home
Secretary will be minuting the Prime Minister on the
subject later today.    In the meantime you may care to
have this copy of the report.

     I am copying this letter and its enclosure to the
Private Secretaries to other Ministers attending the
meeting, with the request that they ensure that access to
the report is restricted to those officials whose advice
must be sought, and also to Philip Mawer (Cabinet
Office).

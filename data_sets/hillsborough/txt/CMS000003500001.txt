W e spoke about the above letter and you kindly agreed to address the point about the safety
certification o f H illsborough at the time o f the disaster.


Lord Justice Taylor's report fully addressed this issue and w e w ould suggest som ething along the
following lines in your draft reply:-


"Lord Justice Taylor's com prehensive report into the H illsborough disaster addressed the issue
o f the safety certificate in place at the ground at that time. I have nothing further to add to his
findings. T he G overnm ent has acted on the recom m endations o f Lord Justice Taylor to ensure
that the safety certification system is properly m onitored through the establishment o f the
Football Licensing A uthority."


I you w ish to discuss this further, please contact me.

Dear Dr. Norris,

Thank you for your letter of the 13th December, received today.

There is certainly no objection to your attending the inquest next Tuesday. I look forward
to meeting you. I shall be receiving verbal evidence from the pathologist who carried out
the post mortem examination and of course from Dr. Howe, who was in charge of Tony’s
care for so long.

Yours sincerely,




J. A. Turnbull

  Dear Sir,


       I recently attended a lecture oil the management of Persistent Vegetative
  State at the Soyal Hospital and Home, Putney.    Professor Bryan Jennett showed
  two slides of Tony Bland's brain and gave an interesting talk.

         Would it be possible for me to attend the inquest on December 21st?




                                             Yours faithfully.




                                            Hon. Secretary

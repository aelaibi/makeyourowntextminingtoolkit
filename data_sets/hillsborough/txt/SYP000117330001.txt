              One       of    the       Liverpool             horses       had       fallen       down       in       the    horsebox             whilst

              travelling                to   Sheffield.                  It w a s     decided          that       a    tranquilliser               would      be

              required             for       the    horse        on      the    return       journey.

              At    12.30          pm    I therefore                took       the    plain       Fiesta          police          car    to       attend      at

              the       Forces          vets       at    B r o o m h i 11.       My       route    took       me       along       Penistone              Road

              into       Sheffield             and       up    Netherthorpe               Road     towards             the    University.                  Even

              at    this       time          traffic          was     heavy.          I was       surprised             to    see       football

              supporters                on   Penistone              Road       outside       Charlie          Browns          and       along

              Peniijtone            F<oad      towards           city      sat       on    the    walls       with          "four       packs’

              drinking             beers       avid      lagers.           Due       to    the    heavy       traffic             along       Penistone

              Road       I decided             to       make     the      return          journey       via       Crosspool,             Riveiin           and

              Wisewood             where       there          was     less      traffic.           Travelling                down       Far       Lane     from

              Dial       House          Club       to    Dykes        Hall      Road       I saw       outside          the       Beehive          Public

            House    at    this    junction            approximately             30     football          supporters.            The

            Beehive       was    all    boarded         up    with       "sorry        closed"          signs    showing.

            However       the    front       door      was    partly          open    and     the       supporters           appeared       to

             be   trying    to    talk       their      way       in.        Travelling        down       Far   Lane         right    into

            Wadsley       Lane    and    to      the    Park       Hotel       I saw       football        supporters

            wandering       about,       a       number      of    them       with     beer     cans      in    their        hands    and

             drinking.

            Outside       the    Park    Hotel         which       was       closed      I saw      two    foot     officers          and

             told    them       what    I had       seen.         However,           n e i t h e r of    them had        a    radio    and

             they    did    not    know       the      area       being      from     Doncaster.            At t h i s       time?    about

             1.30    pm   I stopped          a    passing         Police       transit        and       told    them     to    have    a

             look    at    the    Beehive.             I then       returned          to    the stables via              Parkside

             Road    and    Penistone            Road,       where       I   remained         on duty      in t h e      stables

             until    7   pm.

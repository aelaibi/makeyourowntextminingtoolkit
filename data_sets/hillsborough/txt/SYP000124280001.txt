AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

I THINK THAT SUPPORTERS WERE AT FIRST, SCARED TO ESCAPE ONTO THE PITCH IN

CASE THEY GOT ARRESTED.    THE POLICE APPEARED TO BE SLOW TO REAC/ TO THE

PROBLEM, AND IN FACT ONE SUPPORTER WHO WAS ON THE PITCH TRYING TO BREAK THE

PERIMETER FENCE DOWN WAS ARRESTED.     PEOPLE WERE GIVING THE KISS OF LIFE TO

OTHERS ON THE PITCH, THE ANNOUNCEMENT WAS MADE OVER THE P.A. - TO CLEAR THE

PITCH.

054

IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

      LATERAL FENCES IN PENS 3 AND 4 CAUSED THE PROBLEM, THEY TRAPPED PEOPLE IN

THE PENS, SUPPORTERS WERE PUSHED TO THE FRONT AND THE PRESSURE COULD NOT

DISSIPATE SIDEWARDS.    ALL THE SUPPORTERS WANTED TO GET INTO THE GROUND TO SEE

THE KICK O F F , THERE WERE TOO MANY PEOPLE ALL ARRIVING TOO LATE TO THE GROUND.

THIS CAUSED THE BREAKDOWN OF THE ORDERLY QUEUES OUTSIDE, AND THIS LEAD TO THE

DECISION TO OPEN THE GATES.

FROM WHERE I WAS STANDING I COULD SEE THE PROBLEMS OUTSIDE THE GROUND,       I THINK

THAT IT WAS CORRECT TO OPEN THE GATES TO RELIEVE THE CROWD PROBLEM OUTSIDE,

BUT ONLY IF THE CROWD COULD HAVE BEEN CONTROLLED INSIDE THE GROUND AND

DIVERTED AWAY FROM THE TUNNEL.     I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY WE WERE GIVEN A

S ® _ L E R ALLOCATION OF TICKETS THAN FOREST.   THIS LEAD TO US BEING GIVEN THE

SMALLER END OF THE GROUND.

THE WHOLE ORGANISATION AS FAR AS THE LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS WERE CONCERNED, WAS

COMPLETE CHAOS, FROM THE TRAVEL ARRANGEMENTS TO THE CHOICE OF GROUND AND THE

ACCOMMODATION SIZE OF THE GROUND, PLUS THE SMALL ENTRANCES WAS A RECIPE FOR

DISASTER.

Hillsborough Stadium Disaster Enquiry


LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR MEETING WITH JOURNALISTS: 30 NOVEMBER

You asked that I compile a list of possible invitees who might
welcome an opportunity to put constructive ideas to Lord
Justice Taylor on a number of the matters which have arisen in
the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster. The list below,
which incorporates suggestions from the Department of the
Environment's Press Office, is forwarded for consideration.

The Times          - John Goodbody*, Stuart Jones**, Tom Clarke+
The Independent    - Patrick Barclay*, Vic Robbie+
Daily Telegraph    - David Miller, Colin Gibson* **, David Welsh+
The Guardian       - Martin Thorpe*, David Lacey**, Mike Avers+
Daily Mail         - Trevor Haylett*, Jeff Powell**, Peter Lea+
Daily Express      - David Emery*+, Steve Curry**
Today              - David Alexander+*, Roy Collins**
BBC                - Bill Hamilton, John Motson
ITN                - Peter Wallace*, Brian Moore, Glen O'Glaza
BBC Radio          - Brian Butler*
Sunday Times       - Brian Glanville**, John Lovesey+
Observer           - Ronald Atkin**, David Hunn+

     *     Department of Environment nomination
     **   Chief Football Writer
     +    Sports Editor

I realise, of course, that the total of 28 names listed above
exceeds Lord Justice Taylor's recommended number but I am sure
that we will not be able to secure the attendance of them all
and it would seem prudent to seek to ensure the presence of at
least one representative from each of the newspapers and
broadcasting concerns we have selected.  I also had it in mind
that Lord Justice Taylor may himself wish to select a
representative from amongst the names put forward in
particular cases.

them      into        the       ground.            They    were      advised accordingly.

By     12.13        p.m.        the m a j o r i t y        of    the      turnstiles               at     the       Leppings         Lane

entrances             were       open        however,           very      few        supporters               were    taking

advantage             of    this          f ac t    and    those       in the             area were            st i l l    quite        happy

to     be w a n d e r i n g          around.          There was             becoming              quite        a build-up            of

supporters               on the           opposite         s id e    of     t he      r oa d a c r o s s        from       th e L e p p i n g s

Lane      entrance,              apparently               I was       informed             by o t h e r        officers,            that     the

majority            of     these          people      had       no   tickets              a n d were          waiting        for     somebody

offering            to     sell       their         own    tickets.              A    lot     of       supporters            it     could       be

n o t i c e d at         this        time were            carrying          and       drinking            bottles          and      t in s   of

ale.        I as         well        as    numerous         other         officers,               advised           supporters

regarding             drinking             ale      before       entering             the     ground and               numerous

supporters               were        required         to    dispose          of       their        intoxicants               in b l a c k

b ins     provided              by    the P o l i c e .          They were                then advised accordingly.

Also      at     t his      time          supporters            were      arriving            in       privately           owned motor

vehicles            and     h i r e d m i ni         buse s.         On     several           occasions               I saw       vehicles

p a c k e d full           of    supporters               and a       lot    of       those        travelling               in    privately

owned motor                vehicles            could       be s e e n       to       be    consuming            alcohol.             Those

still       arriving             on       buses      were       by    now    being           directed            to    the       turnstiles

and     enter         the       ground         to    stop any          further             build-up            of     people        wand:: " i n g

nearer      to     th e    kick       off,       more        and more         people         were         being        required          to

dispose       of    intoxicants                 they were           drinking             and more and more                       people

were     gathering             in the a r e a w h o              it w a s     known         had      no    tickets.               On    two

occasions          I h a d to a d v i s e             l a rg e     groups         to     disperse          when        they were

bidding       for       tickets           being       sold       by o t h e r      supporters,               as     not      only were

they     blocking          the       footpath,            but      people were              spilling onto                the       road

and    causing          traffic           to    come      to a s t a n d s t i l l .          A lot of             people          advised

re    consuming           alcoho 1 and             disposing            of    it       1o o k e d    to    be     under          age    and

these      supporters,               more       than     the       other      older         age      groups,           were       abusive

towards       myself           and    other        officers            when       they were              required           to    dispose

of    their      intoxicants.

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y     1.15          p.m.     my    duties         were        deviated          b a ck      to    normal          and

to m a n    the     turnstiles mentioned                           earlier.              Some       of    the     officers             on my

serial      had a r r e s t e d           supporters             for    being          in p o s s e s s i o n       of      drugs       which

left     one m a n        to    each        turnstile.              There         wa s    by n o w a s t e a d              influx       of

supporters          entering              the    ground,           mainly         at     t hi s     stage       the      older         end,

forty years             of a g e      upwards.               Several         attempts             were     made        by y o u n g e r

supporters          to     obtain           entrance without                  tickets,              these       were        turned away

following          being        advised.              Some       supporters              were       coming        to     the

turnstiles          in     pairs          and    they        had    torn      one        ticket          into     two       pieces

trying      to     deceive           me     into      believing          they          h a d one         full     ticket          each.

These      were     also        advised and              turned away.                    People          of a g e s      16 y e a r s

upwards       were        walking           up to       the      turnstiles              smelling          of      intoxicants and

also     carrying          such       in       plastic        carrier         bags.           They were             required            to

empty      the     containers               of a l e     in a       black         plastic           bin.        However,           they

children and women                        from    bei n g      squashed against                   the    turnstile            walls.

At    th is       time       it w a s      impossible             to    search any              supporters          fo r    tickets,

alcohol           or    drugs        etc.    and my attention                     was      drawn       solely       to     people

being       squashed.                I c o ul d       see    that       th e    same       situation was             occurring              at

all      the      other        turnstiles             at    the L e p p i n g s       Lane       end.        I also        saw

younger           supporters              trying       to    climb        ove r      the w a l l s      of    the    turnstiles

to    gain        en t r y .        Supporters             being       crushed and              those    who       were      pushing

were       no w    becoming           very abusi ve               towards         myself         and    other       officers,

threatening                 violence        and       requesting           for       the    concertina             doors      at      the

si d e     of     the       turnstiles           to    be    opened        to a l l e v i a t e        the    problem.             People

were       becoming            injured with                squashed        ribs,        grazing         their       faces against

turnstile walls                     and    finding          it h a r d     to     keep      their       feet.        The      longer

t ime      went        on    the     s i t u a t i o n w as       becoming           worse.           I could       see     the

officers           on       horseback        trying          to    force        the     crowds         back    but w e r e         having

no    luck.            One     of    the    horses was             virtually            being         lifted       off     the

ground.             I was       by    now    being          squashed against                    the    turnstile           w a l l,    the

black       dustbin which                  had    contained alcohol                     disposed         of    by s u p p o r t e r s

had      col l a p s e d a n d        the    contents             also     squashed.              I made       my way         to the

turnstile              which        I was    at a n d w e n t           through         it a n d       told a senior

officer           at    the     other       sid e      of w h a t       was     happening.              People       on     the       other

side       were        now     becoming          very angry and were                       trying       to    force        the

concertina              doors        open which             led    to     the     NorJir^Stand.               People        who       were

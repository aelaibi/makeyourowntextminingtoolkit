             Mr R Whalley
             Mr A Collins, QC

             Superintendent SteVenson
             Dr C E Nicholson
             Mr
             Mr

Pre-mee__tinq ~ts from Mr Jones
Oral hearings will probably be concluded by 30 June 89.
Interim report will be produced and then further evidence will be considered in
closed session. Tnis may last until Jan/Feb 90. Inquest will be held before
Christmas if possible. He anticipates the final report of the Inquiry may not
be available until April 1990.
Meetinq notes
Mr Collins stated that the barriers were the main priority and the wall was now
irrelevant.
Dr Nicholson distrikxrted copies of a document ~ising HSE work so far. Tne
subjects referred to in this document were ~.
Barriers
It was agreed that a barrier test would be useful for establishing the sequence
of events and it was accepted that the loads obtained may not be applicable to
the failure of barrier 124A. Mr Jones asked Dr Nicholson to supply a list of
questions to be put to Eastwoods. Mr Collins read Annex C of the ~Green Guide’
and initially stated that there was only one interpretation of the load test
procedure. However, following discussion he agreed that "re-zeroing" was a
contentious point. Professor Maunder suggested that HSE should consult other
ccmpanies which carry out crush barrier testing. He also asked what Professor
Smith’s role would be. Dr Nicholson explained that Professor Smith would carry
out calculations relating to the collapse of barrier 124A. Professor Maunder
said that a view of the importanoe of the amount of bend on the tubes with
respect to the failure load would be useful. Dr Nicholson suggested that a
report on the condition of other barriers in the central pen could be produced.

After the meeting, the barriers were viewed and Mr ~inted out the
significant features.
Turnstiles

Mr ~ explained how the tests on turnstiles A-G had been carried out and
also how the number of people passing through these turnstiles had been counted
by HSE. He em~hasised that the only discrepancy with respect to the ccmputer
figures was on turnstile G. Mr Collin@, concluded that it was reasonable
therefore to rely on the computer figures for turnstiles A-F. He also stated
the importance of an explanation of the malfunction of turnstile G. Mr
said this was due to a badly positioned microswitd%. Mr Collins mentioned that
at some stage before the match a PC was required to re-position ’ loose wood’ in
one of the turnstiles. He stressed that hourly rate figures for turnsile
thr~ w~uld be most helpful to the Inquiry. Professor Maunder suggested
that an assessment of the egress routes might be useful. H~wever, Mr Collins
did not oonsider that this was necessary.
Perimeter qates
Mr Collins asked whether the perimeter gate in pen 3 cculd be opened by
pressure. He stated that there was some witness testimony suggesting that this
had occurred. Dr Ni~holson said that HSE would be able to carry out load tests
on this gate, although he suspected that Eastwoods had already performed some
tests without authorisation. It was therefore necessary to obtain Eastwoods’
results before proceeding with further tests.
Cc~mmications
Professor Maunder asked whether the public address system in the ground would
have been audible above the noise of the crowd. Dr Nicholson suggested that
Noise & Vibration Section could carry out tests to ascertain this.
Crowd density
Dr Ni~holson explained how the crowd density ~ were being carried
out by HSE. Mr Collins said that statements on the method and the results would
be required with the highest accuracy possible.
Dr Nicholson emphasised that counting of spectators entering the ground during
the opening of gate C was prQblematic. HSE need to see the polioe video
recorded from the south stand to ascertain whether the accuracy of counting may
be improved.
Human factors
Mr Collins did not think a psychologist would be mu~h use at this stage.
Mr Whalley informed the meeting that a book by Professor Canter on crowd
psychology was available at the Town Hall. Mr Collins said that oonsideration
of human factors was a lower priority.
’Green Guide’
Mr Collins said that breaches of the ’~ Guide’, in oonnection with barrier
height and spacing etc, shc~id be mentioned in HSE’s initial report. Mr Taylor
stated that there were two versions of the guide (1973 and 1986) and he
believed that Professor Eastwood had been consulted in the preparation of the
ist version. Mr Collins drew the meeting’s attention to para 206 dealing with
radial fences.
Slmmary of immediate actions on HSE
Tne following actions are required withinthenexttwoweeks:
1 A list of questions for Eastwoods to be supplied.
2 Professor Smithto be instructedto carry out calculations.
3   A ~ report, covering in particular barriers, crowd density
    r~sur~ents and turnstiles, to be written by Dr Ni~holson.
4   Noise ~ to be performed and effectiveness of the PA system to be
    assessed.
Su~ry of lonq-term actions on HSE
1   A barrier test to be carried out in order to establish the sequence of
    failure events.
    A load test to be carried out on the perimeter gate in pen 3 (pending
    results frum Eastwoods).
3   Possible oonsultation with other barrier testers.
4   Consideration of deficiencies in the ’Green Guide’.

VISIT TO HILLSBOROUGH GROUND 24 APRIL 1989

The following people visited Hillsborough Ground on 24 April 1989 in
order to remove parts of barrier 124A:


Mr                 RLSD


               )
Mr             ) Sloane & Roebuck
               )
Mr                 Diamond Drill

Mr                 TD was present during core sampling

The locations from which the concrete cores were to be taken were
marked by MrS. The cores were identified as P,Q and U, and their
positions are given in the items list below. After cutting, core P was
found to contain a piece of the front foot of 124A/4 and core U
contained a piece of the rear foot of 124A/3.

Excavation of 124A/4 front foot

It was apparent that the foot had been made by flattening and shaping the
steel angle at the base of the leg. Thus the leg had been bent forward
to form a foot which was roughly perpendicular to the barrier tube. The
foot had been held in position by two studs. Part of the foot had
been removed during core drilling and this weakened the support further,
particularly at the bend between the leg and foot. One side of the angle
was very thin in this region and there appeared to be a fracture which
extended across at least 50% of this side of the angle. This fracture
was accidentally extended across the full width of this side of the
angle during excavation/extraction. The extent of the "new" fracture was
marked with black ink.

Part of the foot on the uphill side was in contact with a reinforcing
wire in the surrounding concrete. A length of this wire, containing the
contact region, was cut out for examination. The nuts on the two studs
were unscrewed and retained.

Excavation of 124A/4 rear foot

This foot was shaped in a similar manner to the front foot, except that
it had been bent backwards. The angle reinforcement was found to extend
down to the bend. The nuts were removed and the support was lifted out of
the ground.

Excavation of 124A/3

Both feet were shaped and bolted in a similar manner to 124A/4. In this
case the nuts had to be cut off using an angle-grinder.

During excavation/removal the tube which had been between joints 3 and 4
slipped out of the strap on support 3. It appeared to have been held in
position by rust and debris only. The mating positions of tube and strap
were marked with parallel yellow paint marks.
Items taken to SEL

A list of items was left with PC            The items removed on 24 April

Ground at the time. For your information the complete lis~ of items
taken from Pen 3 on the West Terrace, and now in my possession, is as
follows:
1} A piece of steel tube found by Dr Nichoison near the foot of support 4
barrier 124A in the central pen.

2) A piece of steel tube found by Dr Nichoison on the terracing of the
central pen between supports 2 and 3 on barrier 124A.

3) A piece of steel tube which had been located at one end in the strap
on support 3 on barrier 124A.

4) Support 4 from barrier 124A.

5) Support 3 from barrier 124A.

6) Items from the front foot of ~upport 4 on barrier 124A, recovered
during excavation and comprising: two nuts: a slice from the foot
itself (detached during core drilling]; a piece of reinforcing w~re.

7] Two nuts from the rear foot of support 4 of barrier 124A, recovered
during excavation.

8) Two pieces of concrete iound by Hr ~riear the fron~ ioot of
support 4 on barrier 124A before excavation.
9) A concrete core, identified as "P". cut from the terracing near the
front foot of support 4 on barrier 124A.

i0) A concrete core, identified as "Q", cut from the terracing between
the front and rear feet of support 4 on barrier 124A.



                                  -i-
11~ A concrete core, identified as "U". cut from the terracing near the
rear leg of support 3 on barrier 124A.

If you require further information, or you need to see the above items,
please contact me at the above address, or via Dr Nichoison.


Yours sincerely.

VISIT TO HILLSBOROUGH GROUND 17 APRIL 1989

At the request of Mr                Sheffield Environmental Health
Department, the following HSE staff visited Hillsborough Football Ground
in order to examine the crush barriers in the central pen at the
southern end of the ground:

Mr               ) TD
Mr               )
Dr C Nicholson   )
Mr               ) RLSD
Mr               )
Mr               )
Mr               )
I examined the failed barrier, 124A, including the detached tube, and
sprayed all fractures with a clear aerosol laquer. All fracture locations
were covered with plastic bags. A small piece of steel tube was
recovered from the debris by Dr Nicholson and this was placed in a
plastic packet and removed for safe-keeping.

A survey of each joint on each barrier in the central pen was carried
out and I noted the following:

Barrier 149

This was a relatively new barrier fabricated by welding four RHS uprights
(4"x 2"on ends and 5"x 3"in the middle) to a 2.25" OD steel tube. There
was no significant corrosion.

Barrier 136

Joint i (east end) - some corrosion at feet, evidence of yielding having
occurred on support leg near junction of gusset plate and third rivet.

Joint 2    Strap welded at both sides to tube - evidence of cracking in
strap material near junction with support strap.

Joint 3    Strap welded at one side only - a 5" long tube had been
inserted    support not vertical.

Barrier 136A

Joint i - an usually wide strap which overlapped the end of the tube
no welding

Joint 2 - slightly bent rear leg - gusset deformed by rust jacking -
strap welded on LHS (east) side only. There was a double-welded joint to
RHS of the strap.

Joint 3    tube insert welded - insert visible on LHS of joint where a
piece of the original tube had been removed, the insert had been welded
to the two cut ends of the original tube - strap deformed and rear bolt
not tight.
Barrier 124A

Joint I - new strap with welded joint 2" to RHS     lower edge of gusset
plate curved

Joint 2 - failed - new strap, welded on LHS - tube insert protruding.
The tube insert was 6" long but there was a weld 8" from the end (?)
on LHS

The length of tube which had been between joints 2 and 3 had been
detached found on the playing field.

Joint 3     fractured and bent to the ground

Joint 4    fractured - front part of leg pushed out of concrete but not
bent - detached pieces of concrete lay nearby.

Barrier 125

Joint i    overhanging tube, new strap not welded - new gusset plate - tube
perforated by corrosion

Joint 2 - strap not welded, new gusset plate

Joint 3 - strap itself not welded but welded joint on RHS of strap - old
gusset plate

The tube passed through the railings into the RHS of the central pen
(4). A reinforcing outer tube (tack welded to the fence) was present at
the junction with the fence.

Joint 4 mottled surface, old gusset plate, rust jacking - strap not
welded, some tube overhang.

Barrier 144

Joints i & 2    Tube with blanked ends, -i" overhang, straps not welded
Rear support legs just touching a step. Rear leg of joint 2 braced.

Barrier 137

This barrier had been tested on 16/4/89 and the tube was bent
Max deflection between joints i & 2 - i"
Max deflection between joints 2 & 3 - 1.5"

Joint i - tube overhang, strap not welded

Joint 2 - rear support leg bent possibly cracked

Joint 3 -

Barrier 138

Joints i & 2     tube overhang, rust jacking at gusset plates

Joint 3    end of tube covered with a reinforcing outer tube, the latter
welded to a plate in turn welded to the railings.
    Barrier 128

    This barrier also had been tested on 16/4/89

    Joint i       tube perforated by corrosion, small amount of overhang

    Joint 2 - paint cracked around strap

    Joint 3 - strap welded on RHS only

    Joint 4 - very near fence - appeared to have a tube insert

    Barrier 127

    Joints i & 2    3" OD tube with blanking plates welded on the ends
    - some rust jacking. Rear leg of joint 2 braced.

    Barrier 132

    Relatively new with three RHS uprights to which tube welded

    Barrier 150

    Relatively new (RHS uprights) with thre joints and north end welded to a
    plate on the railings.

    Barrier 126

    Relatively near - two RHS uprights and welded tube

    In addition the barriers in Pen 6 and 7 were given a cursory inspection.
    There were many different designs and numerous modifications had been
    carried out. In Pen 6 one support was severely deformed and the attached
    tube was bent. Several (3 or 4) tubes had been perforated by corrosion.
    In Pen 7 one tube was severely bent with maximum deflection of 4.5" and
    another had been bent by 1-2" at mid-span. Also in this pen several
    barriers had had the feet of the supports renewed (evidenced by welded
    joints and re-concreting).

/   In the ~ Kop many of the barrier had been severely corroded and tube
    perforation was apparent in several cases.

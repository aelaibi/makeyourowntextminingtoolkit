              I am a Liverpool            s u p porter and         I live at        the above address            w i t h my

              pare nt

             On S a t u r d a y    15.4.89     (150489),          I attended        the FA Cup semi            final    match

              betw e e n Liverpool         and N o t t i n g h a m Forest         at H i l l sborough,         Sheffield.

              I obtai n e d my ticket            from Anfield.              I paid £6.00.             It was    for    the

             L a p p i n g s Lane T e r r a c e s.        I went    to the      football      ma1.ch t o g ether wit h a

              group of my friends.                We hired          a van and we          left L i verpool        at about

             £&iTii>

             We    did not        stop a ny w h e r e along        the    route and we a r r i v e d        in S h e f f i e l d

             at about       11.00 am.           After a r r i v i n g       in S h e f f i e l d we    parked    the    van    in

             a side     street about           a mile away          from     the ground.           Then we      star t e d

             walking      towards       the    ground.        Along       the way we       did not       see/ a n y    police

                                                                                                              S 1426

but    they     refused to        let us      iin.    We then went          to another           pub-        I had

a bout 3 pints           then we      left    the    pub

about       2.00    pm and w a l k e d      slowly towards          the    ground.         There     were         other

s uppo r t e r s walking w ith us b u t d i d                   not see any fighting                or disojj<fei

 E v e r y o n e was     happy and         looking    forward to see              the match.

I a r r i v e d outside        the g r oymd at about 2.45                 prn.     There was        a y f k ssive

crowd of people             pari;:iw q f \ he area      in front      of the t u r n s t i l e / a n d

reaching        out    past    the m a i n gates.           We joined the           back oA^the          crowd and

s t a r t e d making      our way towards            the turnstiles.

I got       pushed to the         extreme      right hand side and                 realised       that       I had

become       sep a r a t e d from my friends.               I saw one m o u n t e d        police       officer

trying       to push the        crowd      back with        his    horse.         As he went        past      I

managed       to dart       by his     side and found my s e l f            behind a sa f e t y          rail.

I ducked under            it and m a n a g e d to get           to one     of the turnstiles.

Although        there was a m a s s i v e       crowd       it took me about              10 m i n u t e s    to work

and wriggle my way              b e t w e e n the    people       until    I got           the    turnstile.              I

knew where          I w a n t e d to go      because       I had    been to Jffi 1 lsborough             before.

I ente r e d the ground at about                    2.55    pm,    I did irot see any gates                   open

apart       from the t u r n t i l e s and      I saw       people    pealing        the wall        and      jumping

inside       the ground w i t h o u t        going    through       'Une turnstiles.I             saw the

tunnel       in front      of me and wa l k e d t o w a r d ? it because                  I i n t ended to

w at c h    the m a t c h from       behind the goal.

I did not          see any Po l i c e O f f i c e r s      or   stewards         standing      by the        tunnel

There were a lot of               people making            towards        the    tu^fne! but I was able              to

walk       freely along        its    length.        As I got       tg/Vthyother            end I saw

that       /here were a        lot    of   people     standing       inv^he        exit    .     I headed

towafrds the          right an d was able            to    push my way about 6 or 7 feet                      into

p e/ 3.       This was a few minu t e s              before       kick     off    because        I remember        that

 ne teams were a l r e a d y           on the       pitch.

Having       pushed my way 6 or 7 feet                  I e nded up pressed against                     the       end of

a crush barrier.                 As more       people      kept    coming       from behind            I kept       being

pressed against              the     barrier and          it became        quite      painful.          I tried to

breath        in to create           some     space   so that        I    could escape          from behind the

barrier        I was     turning          to my   left and for            an    instant I found myself                 in

a little        bit of space.                I managed      to get m y J b o d y and my            left       leg    From

behind the barrier,                  but     then a surge         cany? from behind.               I was       pushed

forward        lost my balance and fell                    down / o n the       terrace      u nd e r n e a t h     the

feet     of    people who          had been standi                a r o u n d me.      Someone         else    fell       on

top of me and he was                     pushing me on the           floor as we a t t e m p t e d            to get       up.

I was     trapped        on the          floor with       nowhere        to go.       As more      people         came

from behind           I could feel            their   feet    tr a m p l i n g all      over my body.                I had

fal l e n forwards w ith my arms                   down by my side.                 someone     step p e d on my

face     squashing my face                 onto   the stone        floor.         I could only breath

thro u g h one        nostril.            I was   really     panicking          because      I realised             that       I

was     going    to die.           I tried to kick           out wit h my           legs     but   it was         to no

avail.         I therefore          tried      to conserve my             energy and w i l l e d my s e l f to

breath as        best      I / o u l d because        that was          the    only    chance      that       1 had.           I

then     lost    consciousness.

W hen    I came'round            I found myself            lying     on the       floor.      There were             other

people        lying on either              side   of me.      Some were alixe and some were

motionless.            I think           they were    dead.        As     I loaded      round      I

realised that            I was      lying at the back              of ti^T West S tand a n d              r e a lised

that     someone       had saved my            life by dragging me                up off     the floor            from

inside Pe n 3 and              carried me out of tAe/tunnel.

I was     still       ex t r e m e l y    groggy and felt          someone        holding my hand and a

female        voice    saying,           " H e ’s still   w i t h us."         I saw a p o l iceman

crouching        over me and              he told me to stay where                  I was.      Then anot h e r

L i verpool      fan     came over          and began       talking        to me asking me my name and

where     I lived.           The    p o l i c e m a n then went          looking      for an a mbulance.                  As

I was     lying       there      I could feel         nothing at all              because     I must          have    been

in deep shock           from my experience.

1 then began to think about my mates                            and what might             have    happened            to

any of       them.      Although      I was       still    very groggy and unsteady                       I got        up

and w a l k e d out of the           ground.        I stopped a pol i c e m a n and a s k e d him

what    had happened.              He told me that             the m a t c h had been a b a n d o n e d and

that    people       had been killed.              I was       panicking       then because              I c o u l d n ’t

see any of my mates.

1 started wandering                outside     the ground          looking       for my mates.                  I

remember asking             some    po l i c e m e n some street         d irections            to w here we           had

left    the van but u n f o r t u n a t e l y       they were          not    local.           After about            20

minu t e s    I m a n a g e d to    recognise       the street and             I started          running.

Residents       were     outside      their       houses and they             kept asking          me w h e t h e r         I

wanted       to use their          phone    but    I just       ran    past    them until          I saw the               van

and two       of my mates were             s t a nding    by    it.     After about             "10 or    15 minutes

all    my mates arrived.              T hen a w oman a p p r o a c h e d        us and a s k e d us                 if we

wanted       to use her       phone    to     inform our         relations          that we were               all

right.        She    took   us to her        house,       let us use          the    phone and also                  gave

us drinks.           After a while          we all       thanked       her,    got       in the    van and            left

Sheffield       for Liverpool.

On the       journey     back      I realised that             I had no feeling at all                    in my

right    hand.        I tried       lifting       up my    fingers       w ith my         left hand            but    every

time my arm went             floppy.        I could not feel             any     pain because my arm was

numb.        When    I got home       I went       to bed hoping             that my arm w o u l d              be

better       in the morning.                                                                               /

However       the    next   day there was           no change and             I found a la rife bruise

covering       the top of my arm.                 I also       found    bruises          all    o^?r my body

from where          I had been t r a m p l e d      upon.                            /    ^

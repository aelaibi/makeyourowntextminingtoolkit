             the    ground.

             After     the briefing we             had A    packed meal,             then commenced       our    duty    on

             the S pi on Kop.          The    duty. I was       d e s ig n at e d was        to segregate       the    small

             number     of Liverpool          f^erys w i th tickets         for       this    end of the     gr ou nd from

             the Notts Forest. f%/s ./ /Tfie Liv er po ol                   fans were          to be ho us ed     in a

             small     t r a i n g 1e on the       far^feft     of the Kop,            as you    looked from the

             pitch.

             I p erformed this           duty for       the whole        time        I was at H i l l s b o r o u g h until

             the    tragedy occurred.              At this      time     I was        still    on the S p i on Kop,        when
                                                                                                                 PAGE

             I saw fans from the oppos ite end of the ground climbing over the
                            '/
                ci   and spilling onto the pitch.   I saw a Senior Police O f f i c e r

             run^p.to        tjrfe football       pitch,    a p p r o a c h the   referee and a short         time

             later     the    flayers     left the       pitch.      At    this   time,     the number     of fans

             either     coming     onto     the    pitch over       the    fences,    or being     pulled up       into

             the seated area of the L ap pings                  Lane      stand was    greatly     increasing.

             I r ea lised at       this time        that    s omething was        s e ri ou sl y amiss,    but was

             unable     to move       from the      point    on the S pion Kop,           due   to the    pressure

            from the         fans at this         end.

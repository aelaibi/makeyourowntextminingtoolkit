             I am PC 128 LYNSKEY stationed at Main Street at Rotherham.                                  I was on

             duty at the 1988 Semi-Final             b e t w e e n Live r p o o 1 a n d Not t in g h a m F o r e s t

             From about          12.00 pm (1200)   on that day I was           i n v o 1v e d :in t h e s e a r c h :i.n g

             and supervising of Liverpool             supporters entering through the

             turnstiles at the Leppings Ln end of the Hillsborough Football                                    Ground.

             At the start of the afternoon the influx of fans was steady and we

             were able to quickly search them.                 I remember that quite a lot of

             canned beer and soft drinks were                 left at the turnstile gates when

             supporters opted not to drink              it.

             As the kick off got nearer the build up of fans increased and I found

             that      it was impossible to search everyone and establish whether they

             had tickets or were drunk. At this the p we 11 of the crowd carriecl me

             along and I felt that our presence was almost futile.
                                                                                 PAGE
                                                                                 S2963

Police horses tried to break the crowds down but only forced them                     into

tighter     spots,    causing more    crushing.

Once     inside I canremember that there were a (1 ot of peop 1 e stood             in

the tunnel     under the s t a nd and that myself and the Officers           in our

serial had to push out way through the crowd to get onto the terracing

which was packed tight.           We ended up standing with our backs against a

wa II.

We remained in this position throughout the game.               I cannot    ret:a 1 1 any

of the tunnel gates being blocked off by either Police Officers or

Site wards.   Although there was very little room to manoeuvre               I do not

t h ink t h a t t h e t errac i n g was seriously over crowded.

Ten minutes before the end my serial went back               into the area in front

of the turnstiles within the ground to supervise the Liverpool                   fans

departure.     As    the    fans came down the stairways there was a great          deal

of bangi ng on       the    corrugated sides.     I can a 1so remember that 1

attended several           locations on the stairways with other Officers after

reports    that fans were urinating through cracks            in the walls and

stairwells onto people below.           Several youths were spoken to regarding

their behaviour.

We then left the ground and were           involved in the supervision of the

c rowd onto Halifax Rd and onto the awaiting             coaches and train.

In my opinion I would not like to say that the situation at the                   i988

semi-final was any different from the              1989 semi-final. This     is formed

from the videos I have seen of the Leppings Ln turnstiles                  before kick

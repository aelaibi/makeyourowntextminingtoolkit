              Dear Mr Johnston

              COMPLAINT AGAINST MR WALTER JACKSON, ASSISTANT CHIEF CONSTABLE,
              SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE

              I refer to your letter of 2 October 1989 in which you enclosed the
              statement of complaint made by Mr Trevor Hicks against Mr Walter Jackson.
              The copy statement has been received safely. Mr Dear is presently away
              out of the Force and I am, therefore, as full-time Investigating Officer,
              replying on his behalf.

              I note the decision of your Police Authority of last Friday to invite
              Mr Dear to formally carryout the Inquiry. Before Mr Dear left he
              indicated to me that he agreed to accept the responsibility to
              investigate the complaint against Mr Jackson. On behalf of Mr Dear,
              therefore, I confirm that he has accepted the appointment as
              Investigating Officer and has already charged me to continue the
              investigation which I am so doing.

              Yours sincerely




              Assistant Chief Constable
              (Hillsborough Inquiry)

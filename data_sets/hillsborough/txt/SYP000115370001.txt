             at the top of H a l i f a x             Road.       As we    pat r o l l e d the    road      I noti c e d that

             large        numbers       of fans were           queueing    outside       the G a t e w a y S u p e r m a r k e t .

             Du r i n g    this     period       I noticed that          the    staff    of the       supermarket          came

             outside and d r o p p e d three                  of the    four    roller     shutters.         As   the      fans

             left       the    supermarket         most were          carrying     between 4 and 8 cans               of beer

             each.        T hey then        lay on the grass             outside      Halfords        and on the        verges

At    sometime        a r o u n d E . 0 0 pm        (1400)         the    special         train a r r i v e d at the

Once      the    road was           cleared         of fans         from the train,               we    r e q uested the

fans      in the H a l f o r d s        area to make                towards         the ground.           This      they did

   Subject:•
                                  Saturday 15th April. 1989



          At 11.30am on Saturday, 15th April,               1989, I was
  deployed, by Inspector Davies of the South Yorkshire
   Police, to patrol the Halifax Road area of Sheffield in
   company with Constable 357 mounted of South Yorkshire
   Police.


          Many Liverpool fans were entering Sheffield, along
   Halifax Road, to attend the Hillsborough football ground,
   on the occasion of the F.A. cup semi final, between
   Liverpool F.C. and Nottingham Forest.                The majority of
   fans I had seen, were drinking outside of a**public* house
   at the top of Halifax Road.                As we patrolled the road I
   noticed that large numbers of fans were queuing outside
   the gateway supermarket.              During this period I noticed
   that the staff of the supermarket came outside and dropped
   three of the four roller shutters.               As the fans left the
   supermarket most           were carrying between 4 and 8 cans of
   beer each.          They   then lay on the grass outside Halfords
   and on the verges of Halifax Road where they were
   consuming the beer.


           As the time progressed the fans proved themselves for
   the most part good natured.                It was a carnival type
   atmosphere.          Some of the fans were arguementatlve, but              J
   these were always persuaded, by other members of their                      |
   group, to quieten dwon, and there were no incidents of any
    consequence that I was aware of.                                           1

    Halfords.     The escort of 4 mounted offic.ers waited until
    all the fans had alighted and reached the road before the
    went to the ground.

            Once the road was cleared of fans from the train, we
    requested the fans in the Halfords area to make towards
    the ground.     This they did with no arguements; the
    majority being good natured.

            We followed them along Halifax Road towards the
    ground.     The personal radio's were permanently being usee
     there was little chance of being able to interrupt the
     communications traffic.

            When we reached the roundabout at the bottom of
     Halifax Road, there was a radio message calling for all
     mounted personnel to go straight to the Leppings Lane enc
     of the ground to assist with the crowd.      Both 357 and
     myself went straight there/following a large group of
     Liverpool fans as we went.      As we approached we could sec
     that the area inside the iron gates was packed sol idly:bv
     fans pushing up to the turnstiles.      My side of the gat«s
     was a space, and then a cordon of police horses keeping i
      large crowd of fans from pushing up and Into the Iron
     gates.     I do not know at what time I arrived at the
     ground.

            The Mounted Inspector was In the horse cordon.
     motioned to the two of us to move through the crowd *i»dg
      bolster the cordon.    I then rode my mount through the
      crowd.    I shouted to those In front of me to make way,
      but they refused to do so until my horse was pushing
      to either side.

             The crowd were shouting abuse at the police officer;
      and were trying to push through the cordon to reach thej
      iron gates. I joined the cordon behind the Inspector.            J|l
      cordon was positioned from the corner of a shop, by the|

gate 15 the West Stand,     to the roads edge.    At this point
                                              «

there -were fans crawling underneath the horses and also
pushing through any gaps that they could make.        After a
short while the gate to the West Stand was opened and the
fans pushed through and around the cordon and ran straight
through that gate    and gained entry to the ground.         Some
were also climbing the wall on the right hand side of the
 turnstiles to gain entry over the top of the turnstiles.
The Inspector instructed me to stop the fans going over
 the wall.   At this point the crowd inside the iron gates
 had thinned out allowing me easy access to the wall.              I
 then stopped any other fans from climbing the wall.           I
 then turned my attention to the crowd at the turnstiles
 and got them into two orderly lines for the end two.gates.
 As the noise around the ground was so intense I could not
 tell whether the game had started or not.


        We then withdrew and as the problems became evident I
 prevented any more supporters from going Into the ground
 at that point.    If they had tickets, or not.


        At this point we were stood in readiness to go into
 the ground if required.        By this time fans were being
 brought out and cardiac massage and artificial
  rescusitation were being administered by police
  officers and others.  We then went back into the road and
  kept the roadway clear for emergency.


        After a few minutes the crowd on the bridge In
  Leppings Lane became thicker and very aggressive toward||
  us so we made back to the ground where we met up with
  mounted men, under the command of a South Yorkshire
  Sergeant we all withdrew then to a side street where we |
  stood to, awaiting instructions.
                                                                   ■   •'




        As the fans left the ground a large number of the*

  moved in our direction.       Some were exceptionaJ ly abusive
   towards us.                                                               #
    Neither I or any of the other mounted officers
replied as we felt that this might antagonise the fans.


    Approximately one hour passed and amongst all the
other radio messages came a call that there were
supporters fighting in the park nearby.   We all made our
way towards the park but within a couple of minutes a
message said that all was quiet at that location.     We then
continued to patrol around the ground until approximately
18.30 hours when we returned to the Niagra complex.

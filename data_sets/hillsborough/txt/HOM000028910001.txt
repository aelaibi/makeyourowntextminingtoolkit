Transcription of VHF Channel 1 Tape.

Attached are amended timings between 1441 hours and 1559 hours.  These
timings have been taken from the master tape at South Yorkshire Police
Headquarters, and I am satisfied that they are accurate.

The inaccuracy of the previous timings was as a result of a gaining of
tape speed when taping from the master tape onto smaller -40 minute
tapes. As a result of this approximately one minute was gained in
each hour from the commencement of the master tape at 0407 hours.

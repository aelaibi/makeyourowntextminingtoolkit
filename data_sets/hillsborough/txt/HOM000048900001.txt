             EVIDENCE OF DR. S. L. POPPER
 1

 4   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I think I set out in my letter most
 5       of the things that I wanted to ask you about, Dr. Popper.
 6       One of the points that has been raised in my Scrutiny
 7       relates to these video tapes.         I think what I really
 8       wanted to know from you is whether you could confirm my
 9       understanding of what happened in relation to the various
10       exhibits and so on.
11                If you recall, there were two tapes taken on two
12       different monitors in the police control room on the day
13       in question.       I have got photographs of the police
14       control room inside, and you may like just to refresh your
15       memory.       There were five screens, each for a numbered
16       camera, and then two monitors which were recording various
17       things;     various bits were seen taken by these different
18       cameras.
19                Tape TB1 ran from 1159 to 1504, and TB2 from 115 9 to
20        1534.     The reason why it was longer in this case was
21       because it was on time lapse and so it extended over a
22       rather longer time.      There was a gap, so far as TB1 was
23       concerned, because Police Constable Bichard forgot to
24       replace the tape, and they were not replaced until 1534
25       when we have got TB3 and T B 4 .
26                Am I right in thinking that so far as you were
27        concerned, you saw all those four tapes.
28   A   The short answer is that I cannot answer that question
29       because I cannot remember.         I know I did not see all the
30        71 hours of video recording.         I am unable at this stage
31        to say which of the video recordings I did or did not see,
32        so I cannot answer that question truthfully as of now;            I
33        just do not remember.
34                What I can tell you is, that as you very rightly say,
35        there were documents 109 and 110.        I had a copy of the DPP
36        submission which in fact contained those documents.          In
37        fact, I went up last Monday and looked through a few of
38        the papers.      I obviously could not do it all but I just


                                        2
 1       did a little bit of work.    I have brought a photocopy of
 2       document 110, and it is obvious that I must have looked at
 3       this document because I have marked on the side.     What I
 4       cannot tell you is whether these markings indicate I
 5       merely looked at the paper or whether they indicate that I
 6       also viewed the video;    I do not know.   I know from one
 7       reference somewhere in the transcripts that I must have
 8       seen a video which the jury had not seen because I make a
 9       comment,   "Oh, you didn't see this" or something like that.
10            I also know that when I looked through these various
11       schedules, there is at least one of them where I have
12       written the word "No" on to the sheet of paper.     Whether
13       that means I have read the papers and it doesn't look
14       relevant, or whether that means I have viewed the video
15       and I didn't think it was significant, I cannot say.
16       There is one here where I have written a word which looks
17       like the word "good", but I cannot remember now what it
18       means.
19   Q   At all events, is this right:    that since those tapes and
20       the schedules were exhibits at the Taylor Inquiry, they
21       were made available to legal representatives at the
22       Inquest?
23   A   As far as I know, the legal representatives had access to
24       them, but not necessarily because I made them available.
25       Again,   I have tried to refresh my memory as best I can,
26       and I have found several references which I talk about
27       statements as opposed to videos, and I say we will let the
28       witnesses refresh their memory before they give evidence
29       but we will not give copies to the legal representatives.
30       That was partly because of the way I think Coroners
31       usually run their affairs, and anyway I thought it was
32       good to do i t .
33            I have a feeling that at some stage during the
34       Inquest, the videos were made available in one of the side
35       rooms where anybody who wanted to see them could.     I feel
36       there is a reference to this in one of the transcripts,
         but I have looked through the first five transcripts.


                                     3
 1       Unfortunately, you have got all the transcripts and there
 2       are none in Sheffield.      The police photocopied the first
 3       five because I thought it would be in there, but it was
 4       not.    I have got a feeling that at some point this issue
 5       is referred.     I said,   "You can go and look at them if you
 6       want to."      Without checking through the transcripts - or
 7       somebody checking through the transcripts - I cannot be
 8       sure.
 9              I found another note to say that Mr. Bernard Hytner
10       did ask Taylor LJ for an opportunity for him and the
11       families to see all the videos because my note says
12       something to the effect that they did not want any cover
13       up.     Taylor LJ agreed to that.    When we discussed it
14       amongst ourselves, we were not entirely happy with that,
15       but if Taylor LJ authorises it that is the end of the
16       matter.     We were very concerned about the family seeing
17       the videos because of the ---
18   Q   Distressing nature of some of them.
19   A   It was very painful, some of it.
20   Q   I know there was a vast amount of material        from the BBC
21       and all sorts of other things as well.        I am chiefly
22       concerned with these two tapes, TB1 and T B 2 , which it is
23       now being said were suppressed.
24   A   As far as TB1 and TB2 are concerned,       you mentioned that
25       Sergeant Killock has extracted - I think he says wrongly
26       in the transcript TB1 - T B 2 .    Again, when I went to
27       Sheffield on Monday the police supplied me with a copy.
28       Unfortunately,     the copy they supplied me with does not
29       track properly so I have not been able to view it very
30       easily.      I could see enough of it.    It is quite clear that
31       it starts at 1502 and goes to about 1516, I think, or 15.
32   Q   I think it     is 1525 actually.
33   A   Yes, but the bit we showed didn't        go right to the   end.
34   Q   It doesn't     alter;   it is the same picture.
35   A   The answer     to the first question, although I had not
36       initially showed them TB2, they did actually see what I
37       considered presumably at the time was the relevant bit.


                                        4
 1   Q     That was following their question about it?
 2   A     Yes, they asked whether there was any video, or words            to
 3         that effect.     I cannot remember the exact wording.       That
4          is what we arranged.      TB1 and TB2 were both, of course,
 5         referred to viva voce by Inspector Leyton on day 1.
 6   Q     I have read that.       He explains how the compilation tape
 7         was made u p .
 8   A     That is right.     I have looked through PC Bichard's
 9         statement to Taylor LJ and I found two references where he
10         actually refers to an early incident which you mentioned
1L         in point 8.      He actually refers to that in his evidence
12         before Taylor LJ.     So, although it may not have been
13         before the jury - it could not have been before the jury,
14         because the only videos before the jury I think were five
15         videos that we showed them, and that was not included.                It
16         was certainly available to Taylor LJ.        Of course,   it was
17         in respect of a very early incident, and for practical
18         purposes an empty terrace.        I think you say,   "I assume
19         they were not thought relevant".        The truth of the matter
20         is I cannot actually tell you what I thought at the time,
21         but I think that is an assumption which is probably
22         correct.
23   Q     I imagine if you thought it was relevant you would have
24         shown it to them?
25   A     Yes, I showed them quite a lot;        I cannot say I would not
26         have shown them tha t.
27   MR.   BURGESS:   Sir Murray, I think it was in fact showing a man
28         dropping his trousers.
29   LORD JUSTICE-STUART SMITH:       No, it didn't show that.       It was
30         thought a man was dropping his trousers and therefore the
31         camera was focused on that particular thing.          Presumably,
32         he had put his trousers back on by then, so all it shows
33         is an incident of some five minutes or so of people
34         jumping around and having fun.        There is nothing improper
35         about their behaviour at all.        It was obviously thought,
36         that there was some improper behaviour.        That is why they
37         concentrated on i t .


                                         5
 1                 You cannot remember whether you saw TB1 and TB2
 2         throughout?
 3   A     No.
 4   Q     It wouldn't surprise me if you thought that was
 5         irrelevant.        One of the things that has struck me slightly
 6         is that the quality       of the original tape,    and particularly
 7         this bit in time lapse, is rather clearer          than the copy of
 8         TB1 and TB2 and the       copy which we have which was that clip
 9         from - what was the       number of it?
10   MR.   BONE:     C53 9.
11   LORD JUSTICE-STUART SMITH:         C53 9.   When you had the clip made
12         of that short section, did you view the TB2 at           that stage
13         yourself or not?
14   A     I couldn't possibly       remember.
15   Q     You can't remember.        You made    the comment in   the course
16         of the day that the       quality ofwhat was      shown on that clip
17         was not very good (with which I entirely agree).             It is
18         somewhat better on the original, but it is certainly not
19         good because of the time lapse thing.
20   A     That is right.       The time lapse does not help. The South
21         Yorkshire Police, through the Coroner, have actually
22         supplied me with a copy which is even worse than the one
23         we had on the day.        It does not track;      it sort of jumps
24         part of the time lapse.        If you pause it, you can actually
25         see a bit - you can't see very well - but you can see
26         people and you can see faces, and you can see movement.
27   Q     One of the problems, of course,        is that    every time you
28         copy these things they get worse and worse?
29   A     Yes, that is right.
30   Q     I understand that you and the jury went to view the
31         ground.     Is that right?
32   A     That is right but we didn't go together.
33   Q     You didn't go together?
34   A     No.
35   Q     So you don't know what they were shown?
36   A     That is correct.       There is a provision which       says that    the
37          Coroner should not accompany a jury on a site visit, so we


                                            6
\

    1       all went to the site but we all went separately.         I think
    2       in the middle of Mr. Bichard's evidence, somebody said,
    3       "Did the jury have the cameras demonstrated to them?" and
    4       my reply was,     "No."   One of the jury interrupted (page 96
    5       on day 75 at B) and said,      "Yes, we did."    In fact,
    6       probably they should not have had it demonstrated,          if I am
    7       to be a purist, because somebody must have spoken to them
    8       and shown them what was happening.
    9   Q   Mr. Holdswurth evidently demonstrated it to them?
10      A   I know nothing about that.
11      Q   I see.      I hadn't realised you weren't there.    At all
12          events, he told me that he had demonstrated it to them and
13          so they were in a position to see, in so far as they
14          could, what you would see from these cameras.
15      A   That is what was said in court and      I had   no reason to
16          disbelieve it.
17      Q   Was there any suggestion, so far as you know, that there
18          had been any correction made to camera 5.         Camera 5 is the
19          o n e ---
20      A   Looking at Leppings terrace.
21      Q   Very close to the police box.
22      A   Yes.
23      Q   Had it been altered in any way since the incident?
24      A   I wasn't aware of it.
25      Q   You weren't aware of it?
26      A   No.     I knew from the evidence of Mr. Bichard     - what was
27          the name of the other fellow?
28      Q   Ryan?
29      A   No.
30      Q   Holdswurth?
31      A   No, not Mr. Holdswurth.      Sorry, it is one of the police
32          officers in the control box but it doesn't really matter.
33          Mr. Bichard is quite sufficient.      I knew from him that
34          that camera had been faulty for a few weeks and Mr.
35          Holdswurth had attended on the Saturday morning, had made
36          some adjustments and that the picture had been improved,

)

     1         although Mr. Bichard and the other officer whose name
     2         escapes     me ---
     3   M R . BONE:     Murray?
     4   A     No, it wasn't Murray.
     5   LORD JUSTICE-STUART SMITH:       Goddard?
     6   A     Sergeant Goddard.     It was     better but not as good as it
     7         might b e .
     8   Q     There is some conflict of evidence about that.        Mr.
     9         Holdswurth says it was working perfectly.        So far as I can
    10         see, it doesn't make a great deal of difference because
    11         actually the police could see perfectly well out of the
    12         control box.
    13   A     This is with hindsight, and if you don't want me to say
    14         this, you must stop me.
    15   Q     No, I would like you to say what you feel.
    16   A     I have looked at Mr. Holdswurth's statement, and Mr.
    17         Holdswurth was not in the        police control box but in his
    18         own viewing room.      He did    have a facility for seeing at
    19         least one of the TB - it was not       entirely clear to me
    20         whether he was in a position to switch or whether he was
    21         linked;     whether the police transmitted that picture.
    22         There is a little bit of conflict.        What he says in his
    23         evidence is that on the day in question ---
    24   Q     Is it in the original statement?
    25   A     Yes, dated 27.5.89.      It is page 9.
    26   MR.   BURGESS:      Of course, Sir Murray, he wasn't called.
    27   LORD JUSTICE-STUART SMITH:       No.
    28   DR.   POPPER:     If you look at page 7, he says,      "The position
    29         was such ... "
    30   LORD JUSTICE-STUART SMITH:       Wait a minute.     I have got a
    31         slightly different version of this.         You have got the one
    32         which was made to the police?
    33   A     Yes.
    34   Q     My original copy was made to the Club.
    35   A     The one I am looking at is the copy you sent m e , and that
    36         is a copy which I have made.
    37   Q     Page 7, y e s .


                                                8
I

     L   A   It is that middle paragraph there.      He says in the second
    2        half of it, if you like (that was at 2.50) :       "The police,
    3        of course, were monitoring the situation themselves from
    4        their own CCTV system, and in particular using the camera
    5        on the South West corner of the West Stand."       That is not
     6       camera 5.
    7    Q   No.
     8   A   "We could, of course, see that that figure was trained on
     9       Leppings Lane turnstiles because we were able to monitor
    10       the police pictures       on one of the monitors within our
    11       control room, although      we did not have the facility to
    12       record the picture."      So he was saying at 2.50 he was
    13       watching Leppings Lane, and he then says having seen what
    14       happened he left the room.
    15              Mr. Bichard-s evidence, if one accepts it (but he is
    16       consistent) is that at about 2.30 he started recording the
    17       picture from Leppings Lane, and that is where the
    18       recording continued until the film ran out on one of the
    19       screens, TB1, and TB2 is switched over at two or three
    20       minutes past 3.      So if Mr. Holdswurth is saying that the
    21       picture was perfect or very good, where did he see it?          He
    22       himself says,    "I was watching Leppings Lane."     He doesn't
    23       say he was watching the terraces.        In fact, there is no
    24       facility for watching the terraces.
    25   Q   He    does.   If he switches to camera 5 - which he can do -
26           and if camera 5 is pointing at pens 3 and 4, both of which
    27       are hypotheses, then he could see what camera 5 shows.
    28       That is the point.       He is now saying - and I absolutely
    29       take your point that he has never said it before - that
    30       that is what he saw.
    31   A   As    I say, I cannot say what he is saying now.     All I know
    32       is that at the time in 198 9 his evidence which I access
    33       to, was that he was watching Leppings Lane      as opposed to
    34       the terraces.     That    is why I said there is a bit of doubt
    35       as to whether he can switch.       The implication from this is
    36       he cannot.     I think the West Midlands Police in their
    37       submission to the DPP made some allusion that he was able


                                            9
 1           to switch between the cameras, and from what you say it
 2           sounds as if he is saying he could do.         I don't think I
 3           can add very much more apart from saying TB1 and TB2 are
 4           available and one can make one's own judgment as to the
 5           quality.     I accept what you say about re-recording.       Every
 6           time you re-record you get a diminution in quality,         and I
 7           never watched the videos.       The first thing the police did
 8           was to make a copy so that they wouldn't destroy the
 9           original.
10   Q       Can we just go back to Mr. Holdswurth for a moment.         You
11           had his statement.     You didn't think it was necessary to
12           call him as a witness.
13   A   I   I have looked through the papers, and when I was making my
14           original list of potential witnesses, he was on it.          In
15           fact,    I had him marked with two questions marks on the DPP
15           index which I used as my screen, if you like.         I then put
17           him on to a list as a potential witness, and I circulated
18           that list to the legal representatives,        so they knew it
19           was on it.      I think the list went out some time in
20           November;     I am not quite sure when but it went to the
21           legal representatives.
22                   Then on 14th January,   I think - here is the DPP list
23           with the two question marks on.         I think on 12th January
24           or thereabouts, I went through the witnesses again and I
25           made a relatively long list which I headed,         "Excluded or
26           postponed names at present".         On that list is Mr.
27           Holdswurth.     As you can see, there are quite a lot of
28           names.     I have not counted them but his name is included.
29           I would not be true to say that I have never had him in
30           mind as a potential witness;         I did.   It would be
31           guesswork if I now said why I did exclude him.          I can give
32           you my present view, but it would not necessarily be the
33           view I had seven years ago.          I just cannot remember why I
34           decided these witnesses were not needed.
35   Q       If I may say so, it doesn't surprise me particularly you
36           decided he wasn't necessary.

)

    1   A     If I look at his statement and the evidence which we have
    2         had, and you must accept that this is with a degree of
    3         hindsight, and I notice that, inter alia, he says at 10 to
    4         3 he had noticed something going on, he decided to leave
    5         his control room to go and look to see what happens,       he
    6         does not get to the tunnel until about 6 minutes past 3.
    7         He says the match is just finishing.     We know what time
    8         that was so it took them a good 14 minutes to traverse
    9         that distance having said he thought something had gone
10            wrong.    He then still does not realise anything has
11            happened because he says he sits down, or words to that
12            effect.     I probably did not feel that in the light of all
13            the evidence I had, that he was going to add very much.
14            Of course, there was no dispute about the cameras.       Nobody
15            suggested that the camera was not working or that it had
16            not worked or that he had not repaired i t .
17      Q     I think that probably covers all that.
18      MR.   BONE:     I think it does, Sir Murray.
19      LORD JUSTICE-STUART SMITH:       Can we go on to the question of the
20            315 cut off point.     I have read your reasons forimposing
21            this, and your reasons were upheld by the Divisional
22            Court.     It seems to me that there has been a great deal of
23            misunderstanding as to what your reasons were.       Basically,
24            you did not think it was necessary, as I understand it, in
25            deciding how they came by their deaths to deal with
26            matters after it was perfectly plain that they had
27            received the injuries from which they died.      That is
28            right, isn't it?
29      A     I think that is correct.     I have used different
30            phraseology in various places but I have said in part that
31            they had suffered the injury which was the cause of death.
32            They may well have survived for longer than 315.       We know
33            this is true because Lee Nichol was not certified dead.
34            He is a very interesting case actually, and I can comment
35            on that if you like.     We know that he was not certified
36            dead until 17th, and the brain stem criteria was not
37            completed until, I think, 8 o'clock that evening.


                                            11
 1                 Adam Spearitt, he got on to ITU, and I think there is
 2         evidence from one person who said that there was a flicker
 3         of his pupils.     So if your pupils react, even though they
 4         may only just react, then you cannot say that person is
 5         dead.
 6   Q     So far as I can see, you were under no illusion that
 7         everybody had died by 315.      You never said so and you
 8         never,    I would have thought, thought so.
 9   A     I would prefer to rephrase it and say that I was under no
LO         illusion that anybody who died had not suffered the injury
LI         from which he died after 315.         The fact that they may have
L2         breathed or had a heart beat say at 320 or 330 or 400 was
L3         neither here nor there.
L4   Q     So far as I can see everybody else appreciated that,
L5         didn't they?     Was anybody under any illusion so far as you
L6         could see?
L7   A     I do find it very difficult to understand.           I have taken
L8         quite a bit of trouble to go through looking for
L9         discussions on this, and it is quite clear that Mr. King,
20         for example - that we discussed it.          We had a business
21         meeting at one     stage.   Have you seen that?
22   Q     No, I have not     see that.   I do not think we have got         this,
23         Chris, have we?
24   MR.   BONE:     No, Sir Murray.
25   A     I can let you have this and         make a photocopy of it.
26   LORD JUSTICE-STUART     SMITH:    What is the date of this meeting?
27   A     This was on 3 0th October.     We discussed various things.
28         It was supposed to be to sort out procedural matters.               It
29         was in the absence of the jury and just legal
30         representatives basically.          Mr. King at that time raised
31         the question raised the question that the families were
32         unhappy about the 315 cut off.          He said,   "A number of
33         those I represent are anxious that there be an inquest
34         into the nature of the medical attention which was given
35         to those who had been in the crushing in regard to the
36         allegation which certainly they wish to make and wish to
37         investigate, that the absence of proper medical care


                                          12
 L       facilities and attention and technique led to those -
 2       certain of them in any event - dying perhaps when they
 3       might not have died at all." It makes various other
 4       points.     Again on day 1 on page 45 onwards he talks about
 5       investigating the medical attention and care.
 6               It seemed to me - and still seems to me to a large
 7       extent - that it is a misconception of what an inquest can
 8       do.     The late Lord Taylor, of course, was in a different
 9       position. He was looking at the overall matter, and so far
10       as I know he did look at the medical intervention and what
11       happened.     I am not saying that the medical people
12       couldn't have been called sooner; that more could not have
13       been done;     I am not saying anything like that;        it is
14       quite possible that better quality           care could have been
15       achieved.     In the final analysis, there are two things.
16       First of all, what was it that caused the death of these
17       poor, unfortunate people?       I don't think it was medical
18       care;     it was crushing.    In fact, I put it to Mr. King,
19       was he asking me to say that there was a novus actus?
20   Q   Yes,   I have seen that.
21   A   In the end he did actually       say that.    I couldn't believe
22       that he was serious.       I didn't   put it like that.    You
23       cannot on the one hand say (which they did, but they
24       didn't say,    "We know it was the fault of X, Y and Z, but
25       they had nothing to do with this death, it was a novus
26       actus."     I just didn't think he could say .that.
27   Q   I think, if I may say so, there was simply no evidence of
28       a novus actus at all in any case .        Although you did not
29       expressly, in your reasoning, reject the novus actus, by
30       implication you plainly did because he made that
3L       submission and you did not accede to that.
32   A   In addition to that, there       was one case which,    if you    will
33       allow me,    I will find in a moment, where there was a
34       person who had a haemothorax.         There was a question of
35       whether an intercardiac catheter had been put in.             This
35       must be one of the people in the hospitals.            Here we are.
37       It is Victoria Hicks.        It is page 514 to 531 in the


                                        13
I

    1       interim Inquest.    I think you will find it at page 520.
    2       The pathologist comments on the fact that he did not think
    3       the haemothorax had anything whatever to do with the
    4       medical intervention.    So we actually explored the
    5       question of whether there might have been a medical mishap
    6       in this particular instance.      Of course, we did not do it
    7       in all the cases, but I just instance this of an example
    8       where the thought crossed our minds because there was an
    9       intercardiac needle plus a haemothorax.      We discussed it
10          and I was given evidence which I accepted as satisfactory
11          at the time.
12                In fact, as you point out in your letter, there are
13          plenty of examples of people where we went beyond the 315
14          cut off.   It is fair to say that it was in respect of the
15          who, where and when.    We did not do very much during the
16          main Inquest, although even there we did see the
17          compilation video which goes on till about 416, I think is
18          the last shot, and we also took evidence.      One of   the
19          things I wanted to avoid was the discussion between Mr.
20          Duckenfield and Mr. Kelly, but I was persuaded - you have
21          probably seen it in the transcripts - by the
22          representatives that it was proper that we should hear it.
23      Q   It might have been relevant.
24      A   I have been through the interim Inquests, not very
25          thoroughly because I have not had much time, but I think I
26          have picked out over 20 people - and I can give you their
27          names and their reference numbers if you want them - where
28          there is reference to events after 315.      Do you want me to
29          read them o u t .
30      Q   Yes, it would be helpful.        Could you give me a copy of
31          that.
32      A   It is a bit untidy, but I   can tidy it up, if you like and
33          send it to you.
34      Q   I have not read all these   mini Inquests yet, but my
35          impression is that what was happening was that the West
36          Midlands Police had put together,      first of all, a summary
37          of the evidence culled from various witnesses who traced


                                        14
 1        the movement of the deceased from the moment he left home
 2        in the morning to how he came through the turnstyles:
 3        where he was in the pens; where he was last seen alive;
 4        the attempts to resuscitate him, either on the terraces or
 5        behind, or on the pitch;       and then, so far as he could be,
 6        traced to the gymnasium or hospital;         and a sequence of
 7        people certifying death, police officers being with them,
 8        and so on, until they were eventually identified, and then
 9        through to the post mortem, and that is what was happening
10        at these mini Inquests, wasn't it?
11   A    That is right'.   In addition to that, there were usually
12        two police officers who gave evidence:        one who gave
13        evidence based on these summaries which had actually been
14        circulated (the- summaries were circulated), and the
15        evidence was given, of course, viva voce in court.           We
16        circulated them so that the representatives/families could
11        (a) know what was coming - in broad outline anyway - and
18        (b) comment if they thought there was anything wrong.
19        They, of course, could not comment on the statements
20        because they were in what we called our "body files".             So
21        that was one thing.
22             The second thing was that Inspector Layton gave
23        evidence on identification.         This is rather confusing
24        because he gave all those map references and picture
25        numbers.    It was done so that if anybody wanted to check
26        at some point in the future         what basically he had seen at
27        this spot or that spot or the third spot, we could point
28        them to the correct picture.        As far as I know, each body
29        file actually contains the photos and what have you on
30        which it is based.     So, one does not have to search
31        through thousands of photographs; they are actually there.
32        We did our best because they were prepared.         They were
33       i checked by police officers, and I personally went through
34       | every single one of the summaries and checked the
35        summaries against the statements.         If I thought there was
36        an error,   I sent them back, and there is a big file where
37        I have said,   "Check this",    "Do this",   "Do the third


                                         15
 1             thing".     The intention was to get them as correct and as
 2             accurate as we possibly could, given the one limitation
 3             that they were not to be controversial because we did not
 4             want to prejudice the DPP.
 5     Q       I can't quite see how they could have been controversial,
 6             could they?
 7     A       They could if they slipped into the "how".           If they were
 8             talking about,    "It was the fault of this man or that man".
 9             So we had to leave those bits.
10     Q       The thing that seems to be bugging families now is that in
11             some cases they don't know whether their relative died at
12             6 minutes past 3 in the pen, or 20 minutes later somewhere
13             else.
14     A       It is true that for some of the cases there is extremely
15             limited evidence as to what happened.          They are seen in
16             this position.     Somebody might say,    "We think he is alive"
17             because they can see movement.       Then they will see him 20
18             minutes later apparently dead in a totally different part
19             of the ground with no intervening evidence as to how he
20             got there, or what happened to him.           This is a fictitious
21             example, as you appreciate.
22                     With others, like the Hicks girls, there is quite a
23             lot of evidence as to what happened.           It is hard on the
24             families when you cannot pinpoint to the minute what
25             happened, but the fact of the matter is that the evidence
2 6-           was not there and I was in no position to invent it for
27             them.     I could not say,   "This is what happened to your
28             loved one" if there was nobody who could say it.
29                     Our objective was to say as much as we possibly could
30             about each one, to try to narrow it down and pin it down
31             as closely as we could, and we succeeded in many cases.
32             That is why, as I say, I have got whole lists here apart
33             from Adam Spearitt and Lee Nichol.        I have mentioned
34             Victoria.     I will just read two or three because I can
35         t   give you this afterwards.

 1          interim Inquests.      Kester Ball, 877, 1525 but there is a
 2         bit of conflict of evidence in this particular case.             Two
 3         witnesses give slightly different opinions.         Lee Nichol.
 4          I have already mentioned Lee Nichol.        The interesting
 5          thing about Lee Nichol is that we also actually called Dr.
 6         Appleyard who is a clinician;         not a pathologist but the
 7          clinician who looked after him.        There is another one
 8          called David Brady, 1221.       There was a question of a pulse
 9          and he went to the Northern General.        Dr. Jacob tried to
10          resuscitate him, and we called him to give evidence.            We
11          did not do it in every case.         There was another one, may
12          be Adam Spearitt, where there were a lot of named doctors
13          but we did not call them.        There was another one, Stephen
14          Harrison.    We actually had Mr. Wardrope in court.        That is
15          page 246.    Mr. Wardrope is the A & E consultant.         It
16          turned out we did not need him.         The solicitor for the
17          family said he was satisfied with what he had heard.
18                As I say, I could go on.        There was a Mr. Edwards who
19          was passed out of the pen when Chief Superintendent
20       ! Nesbitt was on the scene.        I think if you look at the
21          videos that was about 19 minutes past.         Then I called
22       !, three witnesses.     They are all on day 70.      The family
23       I| were very concerned about this young man, and there was a
24          bit of confusion as to what actually happened.         We had
25       / three witnesses:      Hemmingway,     Ibbotson and Smith, who
26       ' tried to help.      They didn't do very much;     but one of them
27          said (Ibbotson) that he probably did not have contact with
28          him until after 330.        I think that is at page 45F.
29   Q     So these are all cases where you actually called witnesses
30          to try to resolve these matters?
31   A     Yes.   As I say, there is a chap called Michael D. Kelly.
32          I think he may have been one of the people in the judicial
33          review.     In volume 70.    We must have called a witness.          I
34          have forgotten the name of the witness.         There was some
35          suggestion that he started breathing, but then he was
            found dead at 1535.         There was one poor chap who I
            noticed yesterday,    86 4E who was put down.      He was taken


                                            17
I


    1       out and put in Leppings Lane and the police officer says,
    2       "He was breathing. I left him.                  I went and fetched another
    3       person, came back and he was dead.”                  We d o n ’t actually
    4       know what time that was.                  It could even have been before
    5       315.
    6   Q   Do we know who that was?
    7   A   Yes, it is Graham J. Roberts.                  Whether if somebody had
                    V -    «__         y__ _______     —
    8       been there something could have been done for him, I don't
    9       know.         Even if something had been done for him, would he
10          have been another Lee Nichol or Adam Spearitt?
11      Q   Roberts is an interesting case                 because there is a complete
12          conflict of evidence between two police officers as to
13          what happened to Roberts.                 One says that he was taken to
14          the gymnasium and certified dead.                  I think that is a
15          Police Constable Sinclair as I recall.                  There is another
16          one called Wadsworth who says he was taken out the other
17          side.
18      A   I think this is the police officer who is called B e s t .                  I
19          wonder if we are thinking of a different person.                   There
20          were quite a few where it was very difficult to reconcile
21          them.         For example,       Ian Glover.    That was another one who
22          came up in the judicial review, but it is an interesting
23          case.         Page 1215B.        Ian Glover’s brother was with him for
24          a good bit of the time.                  He saw him in the pen and was
25          with him.            He said he tried to resuscitate him.         On the
26          day of the interim Inquest he said,                 "He was taken to the
27          gymnasium and we found a pulse.                  The doctor tried to
28          resuscitate him for 15 minutes" which clearly must have
29          taken him beyond 315.
30                  There is some evidence from a PC Fodgett about this
31          chap as well.            He says he had something to do with him and
32          identified him by his clothing.                   He thought when he first
33          came across him he was breathing or that there was some
34          sign of life.            The brother said there were no police
35          officers involved in carrying this young man across.                   I
35          think we actually discussed this and, on the whole,
37          decided that identification by clothing is not the


                                                      18
I


    1       strongest identification and if a brother says there was
    2       not a police officer, we were more inclined to accept that
    3       bit of evidence.     Of course, the brother could be
    4       mistaken. It is very easy in a situation like that not to
    5       see people.   The other interesting thing about this chap
    6       is that I think I recalled Professor Usher because I
    7       wanted him to discuss the evidence of the brother who was
    8       alive.   I wanted him to say what he thought.      I cannot now
    9       remember what he said but it      is in the transcript.    I
10          think he was not impressed.       I think he felt it   made no
11          difference.
12      Q   I imagine that sometimes in these cases      there is a bit of
13          wishful thinking?
14      A   I am afraid so.    Perhaps this page can be photographed.
15      Q   At all events, when you were considering the question of
16          who, when and where, you did not impose a cut off time of
17          315 as I understand it?
18      A   No, that was when I was considering how to deal        with the
19          question of how.
20      Q   I understand that.
21      A   Can I go back to one more thing for the record.        I think
22          in my direction to the jury, which I know you have, and
23          have probably seen it, day 75, page 68-73 and page 71, I
24          actually deal with the cut off and I talk about the 315
25          evidence, perhaps not in great detail, but I do actually
26          speak to the jury about it for what it is worth;
27      Q   I will look at that again.    I have read    your summing up.
28      A   I think you also asked about people who      were unconscious.
29          As I say, I have not done a proper search, if Ican        put it
30          like that, because I have not had the facilities or        the
31          transcripts, but I did look through some of it, and I
32          found - subject to checking the transcripts - a Mr.
33          Oitch - O-I-T-C-H - who I referred to in the summing up at
34          well, volume 77, page 59.     There is Mr. Edward Spearitt,
35          who you picked up, and who is also mentioned in the
36          summing up, 77, 46.     Mr. Jolly, Mr. Ball and Mr. Lloyd
37          were all, I think, actually unconscious but gave evidence.


                                         19
 1       Then there are three other people who are mentioned in the
 2       interim Inquests:                     ]            and Mr.
 3       O'Keefe.     The respective pages are 1084F, 1226E and 1226E.
 4       They were described as being unconscious.         I referred to
 5       it in the summing up, day 75, page 72G.        Of course, Mr.
 6       Wardrope in his evidence, refers to 10 patients who were
 7       deeply conscious on ITU who made a good recovery.
 8   Q   Does he actually refer to them as being "deeply
 9       unconscious"?
10   A   Yes, he does.
11   Q   Oh, does he?    Have you got the reference     there?
12   A   I can probably find    it quite quickly for you in the
13       transcript, but all I have written down is 15.          "Deeply
14       unconscious.     Two severely brain damaged.     Three with
15       significant damage, and 10 made good recoveries."         He also
16       says that all the patients who came in with cardiac arrest
17       died.     With respect, sir, you talk about the people who
18       went to ITU and how many died, but I think that actually
19       incorrect.
20   Q   I may have got that    wrong.
21   A   My understanding is     that 17 went to ITU, two died     - that
22       was Adam Spearitt and Lee Nichol - two others were
23       severely brain damaged (I suspect one of them would be
24       Tony Bland, and the other one was somebody called Divine
25       but I can't remember his first name), 3 had significant
26       damage and 10 made a good recovery.       All the rest never
27       made i t .
28   Q   I picked that up from an article which Dr. Wardrope wrote
29       later.     I could not find it in his evidence, but I have
30       not read all the evidence at the Inquest, and may be I
31       have missed it.
32   A   I am     sure it is not in the evidence, and I have got a
33       copy of his statement.     Have you got a copy of his
34       statement?
35   Q   Yes, we have.
35   A   He did write a paper, you are quite right.        Did somebody
37       say it was in the Lancet.


                                         20
 l   MR   BO N E :   BMJ
 2   A    I made a note of it.        It wasn't the BMJ;   I think it was
 3        The Journal of Emergency Medicine.        Unfortunately,   I had a
 4        copy of it and I returned them all to Sheffield.
 5   LORD JUSTICE-STUART SMITH:        I have certainly got a copy of it
 6        somewhere here .
 7   A    The reference I have got, but I have not checked it, so it
 8        may not be right, is The Journal of Emergency Medicine,
 9        Volume 7, 379-384, 1989.
10   Q    That is not the one I have seen.
11   A    I could be mistaken there because, as I say, I have not
12        had the opportunity to look, but I know he wrote the
13        paper.      I can remember that paper but I cannot remember
14        what it says.
15   Q    No, this is the BMJ and it is 30th November 1991, but if
16        you have got an earlier one that would be even more
17        helpful.
18   A    It might be worth looking that up to see whether it is
19        relevant.        It is possible that I have made a mistake.
20   Q    Is there anything else you would like to tell me about
21        that aspect?
22   A    315?
23   Q    Yes.
24   A    I don't really think there is.        I gave a reason which the
25        Divisional Court accepted and in fact, I think it is fair
26        to say, they were-complimentary about the choice, not that
27        that makes any difference, but they accepted it.           I had a
28        very good reason for choosing a time.        I had to try to
29        control the Inquest in some way.
30   Q    If I may say so, I have great sympathy with you.
31   A    I did not want to stray into all kinds of other things
32        which I thought were not relevant to my Inquest, and which
33        if you allowed it could be very prejudicial, possibly.            I
34        decided that this was as good a way of doing it as any.
35   Q    I think I follow that.
36   A    Unfortunately, as you say, I have not been able to get
37        across, if you like, the limitations on an Inquest, and


                                          21
I



     1       the reasoning to some people.        It is a shame, but that is
     2       how it i s .
     3   Q   Can I just switch to something else now which is Dr.
     4       Walker.    I see I don't seem to have referred to him in my
     5       letter.    One of the people who much emphasis is now laid
     6       on is a man called Dr. Ed Walker.         He was a junior doctor.
     7       He was an anaesthetist.     He arrived at the Northern
     8       General Hospital because he had seen Hillsborough on the
     9       television, and he arrived, and I think he was the first
10           anaesthetist, at any rate there, and he dealt amongst
    11       other people, we now know, with Lee Nichol and Philip
    12       Hammond.    He made a statement to the West Midlands Police.
    13       Actually, he says he did not make it to them, he made it
    14       on their paper, but it was clearly handed to the West
    15       Midlands Police, and it is dated 20th July 1989.           I
    16       imagine you had that?
    17   A   No.
    18   Q   You didn't?
    19   A   No.   As far as I can recollect, I never saw a statement
    20       from Mr. Ed Walker.
    21   Q   Do you know why that would be?
    22   A   No, I don't.   I can imagine it was an error.          I had loads
    23       of statements.   I have a whole file.        At least, there is a
    24       whole file in Sheffield of statements from medical people.
    25       We had officers who were supposed to        be checking out the
    26       hospital scene, if I can put it like        that. The only, thing
    27       I can imagine is that it was an oversight, assuming for a
    28       minute that it was on the homes computer.          If it was not
    29       logged on then when you said to the officer,           "Please find
    30       me all the doctors" it would not have come up.           Has he
    31       actually put "Dr" or has he put "Mr"?
    32   Q   No, he is Dr. Edward Walker.        This is the   statement.
    33   A   Can I read i t ? . .    .                          .
    34   Q   Yes, do.   Take your   time.    (Pause)
    35   A   Yes, I have read it. It is the first time         I have seen that
    36        statement, as far as I can remember.




                                            22
\

    1   Q   The first two patients that he refers to, I think are -
    2       and I am reasonably satisfied that he has correctly
    3       identified them as - Lee Nichol and the second is probably
    4       Philip Hammond.
    5   A   Lee Nichol we have already spoken about.      The problem was,
    6       apart from the fact that I had not seen the statement,
    7       there was nothing in the notes.      I am not really blaming
    8       him for not putting his name down in the notes because in
    9       a situation like that it is very easy for me to say,           "What
10          about your written record" but the fact remains that if
11          there is nothing in the notes which enable you to identify
12          the person, that is why we had Mr. Wardrope in court and
13          that is why I went through all the people.         I had the
14          hospital notes there, and I asked him about each.         With
15          regard to Lee Nichol, we know there was intensive
16          resuscitation.     He went up to the ITU.    We had Dr.
17          Appleyard down at the Inquest, and Dr. Holt did the PM.
18          This is the interesting bit.       She says when you actually
19          looked at his brain three days after the event, the damage
20          - the way the brain was - indicated that the insult had
21          occurred on 15th, so although he appeared to be alive
22           (because he was being ventilated) and his heart had a
23          spontaneous rhythm,    in fact, if I accept Dr. Holt's
24          evidence he was brain dead fro much longer.
25                  If we come on to Philip, that is number 93 in the
26           list of deceased, Dr. Wardrope says there were no notes
27          but there were ECG marks on him.        It is number 93, page
28           1045   to 1057.   I have just made a note here.
29      Q   I think    we have slightly different numbering.
30      A   This    is the transcript.
31      Q   This    is the mini Inquest on him, is it?
32      A   All these numbers are interim Inquests.       The evidence
33           about it is that there were marks of resuscitation so that
34           would fit in with what Mr. Walker says.      ECG electrodes in
35           place but the pathologist actually.expressed surprise that
35           this patient had gone to the Northern General because he




                                          23
 1       felt he was brain dead at Hillsborough.         That is what he
 2       says at 1049.
 3               At 1054 somebody called Stephen Taylor gave evidence
 4       that he could feel a pulse, and that is why he was taken
 5       to the hospital.     No doubt that is why Mr. Walker tried
 6       his best.     I put this to Dr. Slater, who was the
 7       pathologist, and he maintained his position and thought
 8       the chap had felt his own pulse.      Did Mr. Walker say he
 9       thought he was alive, or not?
10   Q   Yes, he did.
11   A   Or did he merely say he was trying to resuscitate       him.
12       Can I just have a look at that.
13   Q   I will read it to you.    "A second victim arrived.      He was
14       of similar age.     Long hair.    He was also in
15       cardiopulmonary arrest. I intubated him and noticed
16       evidence of gross inhalation of the stomach contents. He
17       also had marked gaseous abdominal distension possibly
18       indicating that he had had mouth to resuscitation at some
19       time.     I also establish venous access ... " - I think he
20       made a mistake about that - "... and gave appropriate
21       drugs.     This boy was also established in a normal sinus
22       heart rhythm but his pupils were fixed and dilated
23       throughout.     I believe he has since died."      That is what
24       he says.
25   A   If he didn't establish venous access, I find it difficult
26       to see how he would have re-established a rhythm.
27   Q   He says now - if I can just bring you up to date on this -
28       in some other submissions that he made to me, he
29       criticised what Dr. Slater was saying because he says in
30       those submissions that he administered the drugs through
31       the intubation which is inconsistent with what he says in
32       his earlier statement.     When I asked him about this, he
33       said he now could not remember.       Presumably, if he had
34       administered the drugs through the tube, that might have
35        started t h e „rhythm again, might it, or not?
36   A   Actually, come to think of it, it is not really drugs that
37        start the heart.    Adrenalin might.    It depends what


                                      24
                                                                                   ■■'Srxyy




 1           condition the patient is in.        If he had a rhythm not an
 2           effective one, then it may be that the drug might have
 3           started it, but very often you need defibrillation, and I
 4           would expect that if a person is resuscitated and if he
 5           was defibrillated,    I think you would find a mark.       We
 6           discussed this in fact.       You don't always do so.      The
 7           trouble is he saw how many patients - he has listed eight.
 8           Certainly his description of the patient,       irrespective of
 9           what he says about his cardiac status, indicates that he
10           was in a very, very poorly state - his pupils were dilated
11           throughout.
12    Q      There is no doubt that he was certified dead a few minutes
13           later.
14    A      Despite every effort that he had made.         It is a pity if
15           that statement was available, that I had not seen it at
16           the time, because I think it is impossible for me to say
17           what I would have d o n e .   I d o n 't think with regard to Lee
18          ; Nichol I would    have done anything because wehad plenty       of
19           other evidence.       I would almost certainly haveput to Dr.
20           Slater anything that Mr. Ed Walker said because, after
21          : all, I put to Dr. Slater what the other chap said about
22           the pulse.     I can't swear to that.     I am guessing.     I
23           would imagine I would have done that.        I doubt very much -
24           particularly in the events - whether it would have made
25          , one iota of difference to the conclusions as to the cause
26           of death__
27    MR.    BURGESS:     Sir Murray,   I am sure you have taken aboard one
28           of the things that Dr. Popper said a few moments ago, and
29           that is that unlike the other statements that does not
30           appear to have     been into the home system.
31    LORD JUSTICE-STUART SMITH:        Doesn't it?    Why not?
32    MR. BURGESS:      Because it is handwritten.      The home system is
33           the major inquiry system that police forces have.           There
34:          is a search facility normally on it so that those making
35           enquiries can say,    "Can you please identify for me all
36           witnesses who were at a particular place at a particular
37            time?" and a list of witnesses is then produced.          If this

)



     1          wasn't on the home system, they well not have been in the
     2          core of statements that Dr. Popper would have had.
     3    DR.   POPPER:     I would expect all the statements to be on the
     4          home system, and if one was not on it, it should have
     5          been.     I was not responsible for that system.
     6    MR.   BURGESS:     If I can just dwell on that for a moment, the
     7          Holdswurth statement, the one that I think you had, is in
     8          capital letters, and the old home system that was then in
     9          existence had everything in capital letters which suggests
10              that was pulled off the home system.     The one that Dr.
11              Popper had - which you sent him - was not capitals, and
12              that was either a transcript from that ---
13        LORD JUSTICE-STUART SMITH:      I am going to try to clarify this
14              because the statement we have got from Holdswurth is one
15              which he says he made to the club solicitors.      I am not
16              actually conscious of having seen this one before.
17        A     That is the one you sent me.      The one you are holding in
    18          your hand is not the one you sent me, but I can give you
    19          back the one you sent me.     This is the one I picked up at
20              Sheffield on 10th because I have written on it.
    21    Q     The one I sent you looks like this, I think.
    22    A     I have not got your letter attached to it,     I am afraid,
    23          because I did not want to carry unnecessary paper, but
    24          this is the one that came in the post from you.      It is
    25          exactly the same as the DPP one.
    26    Q     What is the date of that?
    27    MR.   BONE:     This is dated 27.5.89 and this one is dated
    28          28.4.89.
    29    LORD JUSTICE-STUART SMITH:      That seems to be a copy of the one
    30          made to the Club.
    31    MR.   BONE:     He says this is what he collected from the police.
    32          What Dr. Popper collected from the police is a three page
    33          document.
    34:   MR.   BURGESS:     I am sorry, Mr. Bone, it was actually collected
    35          from the Coroner's office.
    35    LORD JUSTICE-STUART SMITH:      This deals with the disappearance
    37          of those tapes, which is irrelevant.


                                             26
 1   MR.    POPPER:   Are they different.
 2   LORD JUSTICE-STUART SMITH:        What happened was that there were
 3          two Club tapes which were stolen or disappeared.
 4          Holdswurth made a couple of statements about that matter.
 5          One was dated 28th April 1989 and is not relevant to my
 6          inquiry at all.   There is actually another short one dated
 7          5th December 1989 which you may not have;       I don't know.
 8          The material one is dated 16th May 1989 which is the
 9          statement he made to the Club solicitors, and I think that
10          was translated verbatim into a police statement dated a
11          little bit later, 27th.
12   A      Ye s, and that is in fact the one that you have sent m e .          I
13          have now worked out what it i s .     There were two statements
14          in the DPP submission.      The first one is dated 28.4.89 and
15          the second is dated 27.5.89.        That is, if you like, the
16          principal statement.       The first one deals with the tapes.
17          Incidentally,   it is actually a bit confusing because in
18          the first statement,   I think he refers to 14 monitors and
19          cameras, and in the second one he refers to 19 or 18 plus
20          1.   I am not sure how many monitors there actually were,
21          not that that matters because nothing turned on it so far
22          as the Inquest was concerned.        It does raise a question as
23          to whether the tapes were missing.        It depends what your
24          starting numbers a r e .
25   Q      I suppose we had better try to look into the question of
25          what happened to Mr. Walker's statement and whether it got
27          on to the home computer.
23   A      May I come back to one more point on Dr. Walker's
29          evidence, and that is that although it obviously would
30         i have been better if I had been aware of it (that goes
3L          without saying)   the fact of the matter is that we did at
32          the Inquest deal with the possibility that this young man
33          was alive - not alive, showed signs of life       (I think that
34          is better)   - and he did make it to the Northern General
35          and some resuscitative efforts were made.        The fact that
36          we did not know it was Dr. Walker is a lacunae but I do
37          not think it is fundamental, and it does not actually,          I


                                           27
I

    1         do not think, very much to we already knew about this.
    2         That obviously is a matter for you.
    3   Q     I am inclined to agree with you.       I would be very grateful
    4         if you could turn up this evidence of Dr. Wardrope which
    5         you were referring to earlier on, because the passages I
    6         have got, and what I took and put in paragraph 12 of my
    7         letter, really come from his evidence.        He is called and
    8         gives his name and so on, and he deals with all the cases.
    9         He says that there were 87 patients, more than a day's
10            work in an hour, and then he says 17 went to intensive
11            care, and in addition also patients who never made it to
12            coronary care unfortunately were dead.        That is correct.
13            Then he deals with his role and so on.        I am not quite
14            sure where this comes from.
15      A     I am wondering whether it came from this       statement.
16      Q     You were certainly referring to his statement.        Would you
17            like to look at that?      The applicants referred to it as
18            19th November.    I do not think that is right.
19      A     No, that is wrong.
20      Q     This is what he says anyway.
21      A     Can I just look at it.
22      Q     Yes, do.   (Pause)
23      A     Is it the question of the output that we       are looking for?
24      Q     The outcome of these people who went       to intensive care.
25      A     I must admit I cannot see it       in hisstatement.
26      MR.   BURGESS:   It is in his statement.       It is the very last
27            paragraph of his statement.
28      A     I am sorry about tha t.    That is where he    talks about the
29            number of people who went out.       That is right.   The point
30            about nobody in cardiac arrest surviving is in his
31            evidence, but not about the people who went to ITU.
32      LORD JUSTICE-STUART SMITH:       Is this the CJA statement?
33      A     Is there a date in i t .
34      MR. BURGESS:     6th June.
35      LORD JUSTICE-STUART SMITH:       That is slightly different.      He is
36            not quite so explicit in his evidence.        I have summarised
37             his evidence in this way, from what he was saying to you:


                                            28
 1   that there were 87 patients in all received;     13 of these
 2   were suffering cardiac arrest;     some of these were triaged
 3   dead on arrival.     I am not quite clear how many this
 4   applied to, but it seems to have been not more than four;
 5   others received resuscitative treatment but died.        These
 6   patients were not dead on arrival otherwise resuscitative
 7   treatment would not have been attempted.     It is not
 8   entirely clear whether some of these patients were
 9   admitted to intensive care at the intensive care unit but
10   it seems unlikely.    At least two patients, V. Nicoll and
11   Alan Spearitt", were admitted to the intensive care unit
12   but subsequently died.     Of the 87 patients, 17 were
13   admitted to the intensive care unit.     Although Mr.
14   Wardrope's article    (this is the BMJ) is somewhat more
15   detailed, it does not differ significantly from his
16   evidence.     What is apparent from Mr. Wardrope's evidence,
17   is that a substantial number of patients were not dead on
18   their admission to hospital but died subsequently, and
19   that of the 17 patients who were taken into intensive care
20   and were therefore almost certainly unconscious and
21   undoubtedly very seriously ill, the great majority lived.
22   It is clear therefore that the evidence of Dr. Walker,       Ian
23   McDermott and __________________ |add nothing to the evidence
24   given at the Inquest.      That is what I was proposing to
25   say.    That is the draft of what I had in mind to say.          I
26   picked that up from what Wardrope said in his evidence.
27   I think, with respect, sir, 87 patients arrived in the
28   first hour.     I think you will find a lot more patients
29   arrived.     I do not whether you have got that 13 of these
30   were suffering cardiac arrest.
31   He says that all those died.      I can check this if
32   necessary.
33   Yes, 13 patients came in who were eventually certified
34   dead.
35   And they were all suffering from cardiac arrest is what he
36   said somewhere or other.
37   You may well be right.


                                  29
 1   Q     I can look at that again, I suppose.       I must correct that.
 2   A     I am not sure whether it is fair to say that 13 were
 3         suffering cardiac arrest.     There may have been but I do
 4         not think he says it.     In fact, there must have been
 5         because they died.     He says explicitly in his statement
 6         that the 15 who went to ITU had a cardiac output.       In
 7         other words, they were not in cardiac arrest, plus the two
 8         Adam and L e e .
 9   Q     When they eventually died, they died of cardiac arrest,          I
10         suppose.
11   A     Yes.
12   MR.   BURGESS:     The mathematics does not actually add up, Sir
13         Murray, certainly on his statement;        it depends upon the
14         view you take.
15   DR.   POPPER:    I was merely just trying to establish how busy
16         they were.     I was not interested in the living people.
17   LORD JUSTICE-STUART SMITH:      I know you weren't.    The point now
18         is made, you see, that the jury did not appreciate that
19         people who were admitted unconscious survived.
20   MR.   BURGESS:     Some of them gave evidence.
21   LORD JUSTICE-STUART SMITH:      I know.     I am also looking to see
22         whether one can get it from Dr. Wardrope.
23   A     I will have another look through Dr. Wardrope's evidence
24         to see if I can find that.
25   MR.   BURGESS:     In his statement he says this is in addition to
25         the patients mentioned above.       The maths may be very
27         askew.
28   LORD JUSTICE-STUART SMITH:      I had better check it with his
29         statement.     I was trying to get it from his evidence
30         because that was heard by the jury.         I will check that.
31   DR.   POPPER:    I mentioned Dr. Wardrope's evidence in my
32         summing-up on page 70 on day 75.        It is only what I say
33         he said so it is probably not worth more.        Between page 70
34         and 73, I talk about the people who went to ITU.
35         Certainly my understanding of what happened.        I will have
36         another look if that is satisfactory to you.




                                        30
 1   Q   It would help.    One of the points made is that either you
 2       or the jury did not appreciate that a lot of people were
 3       unconscious and recovered.
 4   A   With respect,    the jury certainly heard it.      I have given
 5       you a list of I don't know how many.        Subject to checking
 6       with the transcripts,    I do have to say this, because I
 7       have picked this out from bits and pieces, although I have
 8       not looked to see if the witness then says,        "I then became
 9       unconscious."
10   Q   I have looked    through a number of them.      I have got
11       Garrett|                                        Crawford;
12       Anderson;   Langley;    Jolly;    Ball;   Gray; and two Lloyds.
13   A   On my list I have only got Jolly and Lloyd and there is           a
14       chap called Oitch, page 32, number 118.
15   Q   I have not got Oitch.    I have got two who      recovered
16       consciousness in hospital, Spearett and a man called
17       Barron.
18   A   You have obviously got a lot more than I.
19   Q   And you have given me Oitch.      That may be    a better one.
20       One of the things that is said - and at the moment I
21       cannot find anything to support it - is that when you were
22       dealing with where and when they died you somehow misled
23       the families into thinking that any questions that might
24       not have been answered then would be answered later in the
25       full Inquest.     Speaking for myself,    I have not found
26       anything to suggest that, and I have not really been
27       referred to anything, but it is say that this is the
28       implication of what you said.       I am not sure whether it is
29       really fair to ask you to comment on that.         Would you like
30       to comment on that?
3L   A   I don't think I comment on i t .    I think I have to stand       by
32       what I said in the transcripts.       Without reading through
33       what I said - presumably it will be in some of my general
34       remarks when I opened the Inquests.
35   Q   I can tell you it is not there.
35   A   I think if you look at this business“meeting which you
37       have now got a copy of, I think you will find that we


                                      31
 1   talked about - in fact, I think I said,     "Tell me who you
 2   want to call."     I know, strictly speaking, they are all my
 3   witnesses and the representatives understood that, and
 4   they then came back to me and said,     "Look it is very
 5   difficult.    You tell us who you have in mind, and then we
 6   will give you additions because it is easier for us."
 7   That is why, in the end, I let them have the preliminary
 8   list of witnesses. In fact, they did supply me with a
 9   whole load of names of witnesses who they raised and they
10   also raised quite a lot of questions on things which had
11   happened at the mini Inquests where there was some
12   concern.      __
13         We looked into those and in some cases I decided to
14   call extra witnesses, which I have already referred to
15   earlier, and there were one or two others where we called
16   people to try to clarify things which had not been right
17   or where mistakes had been made.      There is a whole pile of
18   these.     I have brought a small number.   I did not know
19   that you were going to raise this but I thought this was a
20   relevant point.
21         The Hillsborough Steering Committee wrote to me on
22   3rd January 1991 and referred to queries which various
23   people had, and the list was James Aspinall, Jonathan Owen
24   and various other people - ,          Spearitt, three pages of
25   it.      These two sheets of paper are basically my (they are
26   duplicates), Stan Beachey was one of the members of the
27   team - I must have given him the letter.      He had come back
28   with responses.
29         I probably then wrote to this lady.     She is one of
30   the solicitors.     I would have said this is what we have
31   found and what we are going to do or what we are not going
32   to do.     I remember,   for instance, Paul Murray is one of
33   the people mentioned and there is a Sergeant Fox.       I think
34   it was obviously my intention to call this Sergeant
35   because in the margin I have said       "You have already
36   indicated the'Police Sergeant will be called to give
37   evidence" but in the event I did not.       Why that is, I


                                   32
 1        cannot say now.     So far as I know, whenever somebody
 2        raised a point they were not happy with, we looked at it.
 3        Sometimes it was dealt with at the Inquest.        Sometimes I
 4        refused to call witnesses. Sometimes I think somebody
 5        explained what was said and what had happened.         It is a
 6        matter of interpretation.      I do not know whether I did
 7        mislead them.     I cannot comment on that.    I just don't
 8        know.     I don't remember.
 9   Q    Have you got a copy of your letter      back to them on that,
10        or not?
11   A    I haven't actually got a copy of my response to        this lady.
12         I am sure it is somewhere in the filing but I have not got
13        it.     All I have got is my handwritten note - Mr. Beachey's
14       - responses to some of these queries.     There were quite a
15         lot.    A limited number of people - it was not all by any
16        means - but quite a lot of concerns from time to time.
17   Q    This was between the mini Inquests and the main Inquest?
18   A    That is while the main Inquest is actually running.        That
19         is in January 1991.      While we were running the main
20         Inquest, the objective was to try to - if I can put it
21         this way - tidy up and correct errors which could have
22         occurred, or where    I felt that the families had a
23         legitimate reason,    or even perhaps I felt sorry for Mr.
24         Spearitt.     Everyone felt sorry for Mr. Spearitt.     Even
25         though I did call him as a witnesses,     I don't think I
26         thought it would help much, but it was the least I could
27         do for him.
28   Q    I would grateful if you could possibly look to see if you
29         have any more of these things where they raised points,
30         and you have tried to deal with them, and any
3L         correspondence you wrote back to them.       Would you be able
32         to do that, do you think?
33   A    I will try.     The trouble is that I am in Nottingham and
34         all the stuff is in Sheffield, but I will see if I can
35         retrieve some of i t .    I had quite a bit of it at home but
35         I returned it all.




                                         33
 1   Q   I am sorry to burden you with that, but I have got to try
 2       to deal with these points so far as I can.      I think there
 3       is one other area which I wanted to ask you about.        That
 4       was a witness called PC Bruder.      Do you remember him?
 5   A   I do remember   him only too well.
 6   Q   One of the suggestions   is that improper pressure was      put
 7       on M r . Bruder to change his evidence. I can tell you that
 8       I have seen Mr. Bruder and he does not suggest any
 9       improper pressure was put on him at all.      What he does say
10       is that he made a statement initially and it is in
11       relation to Kevin Williams.
12   A   Yes,   I remember.
13   Q   First of all, he says as   he approached Kevin Williams
14       lying on the ground he thought he .was convulsing.        He
15       also says that he tried to resuscitate him, and he thought
16       that   he vomited and that he felt a pulse.    He was then
17       seen by Inspector Sawyer because there was     some doubt
18       about whether he might have been right about that.     He
19       said he has a lot more experience now.     He had never     seen
20       him vomiting and he was mistaken about that. He now
21       thought that what he described as convulsions were not
22       convulsions but might have been a twitch of the head or
23       something, and he accepted he might have been mistaken
24       about the pulse.     That second statement was summarised to
25       the jury by Inspector Sawyer on 4th May.
26              I have seen Mr. Bruder, and the substance of what he
27        says now is that his second statement was correct in every
28        respect save one.    He does not accept that he was mistaken
29        about the pulse and he did not mean to say that.     That is
30        a question I have to deal with.     What he does say is that
31       when he was seen by Inspector Sawyer, they were confused
32        about the medical situation - or he at any rate was
33        confused - and Inspector Sawyer rang up the Coroner's
34        office and spoke to somebody there.     It looks as though he
35        spoke to Dr. Slater because there was some conversation
35        between Dr. Slater and Mr. Bruder about all this.        It was




                                      34
I
    1       as a result of that that he made the second statement.          Do
    2       you know anything about that?
    3   A   I know quite a bit about it.      My recollection is this.      I
    4       knew before we began this case that this was a very
    5       painful case for the family because there was this young
    6       man who had been on the terrace.      He was found lying on
    7       the opposite side of the pitch.      Mr. Bruder said he was
    8       convulsing and there were signs of life. He tried to
    9       resuscitate him, failed, took him to the temporary
10          mortuary where he was in the arms of a police and he said
11          "Mum" and opened his eyes, and I could just see how
12          painful this was going to be for the family.      Whether it
13          is true or not, is neither here nor there.      It was a very
14          painful situation.     So I was, in,a sense, forewarned that
15          this was going to be difficult.
16               We took the evidence.     You remember Dr. Slater said
17          this was one of the worst cases he saw of asphyxia.       His
18          larynx was broken in two places on both sides and that it
19          was a very bad case.      I cannot remember at that stage if
20          I put these various things to Dr. Slater, but when it was
21          over I thought about it and I decided that I wanted to
22          double check Mr. Bruder's evidence, and it was at my
23          request that Inspector Sawyer went to see him.        It was not
24          Inspector Sawyer's initiative.      I discussed it with my
25          coronial team, if I can put it like that, and I decided (I
26          have not got a note of it but I have it reasonably clear
27          in my mind) that I was not interested in getting a changed
28          statement. All I wanted to know is whether he was
29          satisfied that what he said was correct.      I wanted to be
30          sure that the evidence was right because it was difficult
31          to reconcile.   He then came back, as you know, with the
32          varied statement and he made certain alterations.        That
33          was then put to the jury.     Dr. Slater came back.     The
34          points were put to him. I cannot remember whether they
35          were put on the first occasion or the second occasion.
35      Q   They were put on the first occasion.




                                         35
 1   A   Was it the first occasion?      I went through them with him
 2       because I wanted to be sure, however painful and however
 3       difficult,    if you like, that we did not hide from the jury
 4       or indeed, the families, what the evidence was.          Whether
 5       we liked the evidence or not is neither here nor there.
 6       Whether we agreed with it was neither here nor there, but
 7       I wanted to be sure we put the evidence.
 8            I was still unhappy about it which is why I recalled
 9       Dr. Slater and Dr. Comben to try to give an explanation as
10       to what happens in this sort of situation, to try to
11       reconcile Dr. Slater's statement that this was one of the
12       most severe cases of crush asphyxia that he came across in
13       all this episode, with these accounts from other people
14       which would indicate that there was something happening
15       with this young man.      The position is that I felt I was
16       justified.     I was supposed to be doing the investigation
17       and if I feel I want a witness re-examined,      I find it
18       difficult to see how one can say I should not do that.             I
19       felt justified in having made that request.       I am
20       confident in my own mind that I made it clear that there
21       was to be no pressure.      I never spoke to Mr. Bruder myself
22       - not as far as I know anyway.       He says no pressure was
23       brought.     I would be very surprised if there had been, but
24       I wasn't there so I am pleased to here it.
25            As you know, this matter did come up for judicial
26       review and was actually dealt with by the Divisional
27       Court, but you know      what they said about that.     Idid not
28       call Mr. Bruder.     I   have already mentioned we had    a lot of
29       requests for people      who asked for witnesses to be
30       considered.     Nobody   ever asked me, as far as Iknow, to
         consider calling Mr. Bruder.       If you look at the
         transcript, you will see the solicitor expressed his
         satisfaction.
              As far as I was aware, the evidence and the
         explanation that had been given had been entirely
         acceptable to the people concerned.       I know that
         subsequently another pathologist has come along and has


                                       36
 1       given some further opinions.          Again, that was dealt with
 2       at the judicial review.         I must say I was not very happy
 3       with that.         It must have been very unsettling for the
 4       family.     Anyway, that is a different story.        Does that
 5       help you at all?
 6   Q   Yes, it does.        Can you help me at all as to the
 7       circumstances in which Dr. Slater talked to Mr. Bruder.
 8   A   As far as I know         - and again I think it is in the
 9       transcripts - I think Dr. Slater says that he             spoke to Mr.
10       Bruder.     He rang      them because he, too, wanted to be
11       satisfied in his         own mind.    Whether he should have done is
12       another question, but it is not uncommon.            I think you
13       will be able to correct me if I am wrong on this, but it
14       is not uncommon in coronial practice to find pathologists
15       contacting clinicians or other witnesses if they want
16        information relevant to their P Ms.         I think perhaps it
17       would have been wiser if he had done it through me rather
18       than directly.         As far as I am aware - I think it is in
19        the transcript - Dr. Slater admits he spoke to him.
20   Q   According     to    Bruder - he may be wrong about this - he says
21        that when he       was with Inspector Sawyer, they rang your
22        office and Bruder says he spoke to somebody there and had
23        this conversation about the medical side of thing which,                I
24        think by inference must have been with Dr. Slater.             Why
25        should Dr. Slater be at your office?
26   A    I can't imagine.        The pathologists were often at the
27        office because they brought in their PM reports, but it
28        would be sheer chance.
29   MR. BURGESS:      Dothey work out of the same place?
30   A   No, Dr. Slater does not.        He is    based, I think, at
31        Doncaster.        Professor Usher is in the same building.        I
32        know somebody at one stage suggested that Mr. Bruder had
33        spoken to me, but I have absolutely no recollection
34        whatever of speaking to him.           It is possible.   I did not
35        recollect it at the time of the judicial review and I
35        don't recollect it now.




                                          37
 1   LORD JUSTICE-STUART SMITH:      I do not think I am in any position
 2        to make a finding about this.       It may have been Dr.
 3        Slater.    Dr. Slater certainly says he spoke to Mr. Bruder.
 4   A   I am surprised that they rang my office and spoke to him
 5        there.     It doesn't quite make sense.
 6   Q   It did seem a bit strange to me.        I am not sure that I
 7        have anything very much more that I want to ask you a b o u t .
 8        One of the things that has struck me very forcibly about
 9        this whole case - and it is a matter which has been
10        considered by a Home Office Working Party about these
11        major disasters and the relationship with inquests - is
12        that it is very unsatisfactory to have a major inquiry
13        conducted by a High Court Judge which goes into wide
14        ranging questions, in particular how.and why people came
15        to their deaths, and then to ask a Coroner to ask that
16        question all over again.      The question who, where and when
17        may be different matters, but it does strike me really as
18        the most appalling duplication of effort, and presents
19        somebody in your position with a very difficult task.            I
20        don't know whether you have any views about that?
21   A    After the Inquest I actually wrote to the Home Office and
22        I made several points similar to those which you have just
23        made.     Unfortunately,   I have not brought a copy of that
24        letter with me, but I will send you a copy if I may.         I
25        think I made suggestions about how one could deal with
26        that situation.     I entirely agree with you.     It is
27        ridiculous really to do it the way we have done i t .
28   Q    I thought that probably would be your reaction.        It is no
29        criticism of you, but it is perfectly obvious that the
30        thing got out of control in        a way. It took far too long
31        largely because people kept on asking repetitive
32        questions, and they were trying to push the frontiers of
33        what is legitimate at an Inquest beyond what they should
34        have been and so on.       It seemed to me that it is very
35        unfair on a Coroner to have to deal with a situation- like
35        this.




                                        38
I

     1   A     It did take a long time;       you are quite right, but I would
     2         not necessarily put all the blame on the people.        It was
     3         my decision because I chose whom to call, but I did feel
     4         at the time that if we were going to put to the jury - and
     5         I knew I had to in a way - the possibility of an unlawful
     6         killing verdict, and bearing in mind the standard of proof
     7         for that is the criminal standard, and that I did not
     8         think it was fair just to put one side, that I had to do a
     9         pretty comprehensive job in order that at the end of the
    10         day the jury had information from different sources,
    11         different people, so that they could try and reach a
    12         justified verdict.        Although the burden of proof is the
    13         criminal one, the form in which we took the evidence did
    14         not follow the strict rules of evidence anyway.        We
    15         admitted evidence which in any other court would have been
    16         thrown o u t .
    17   Q     I think in a way, if I may say so, you bent over backwards
    18         to put the supporters' point of view because you called
    19         innumerable supporters who all said exactly the same
    20         thing, were all asked the same questions by counsel and so
    21         on.   Speaking for myself, it seemed to me that you were
    22         certainly erring on the side of caution.         I think one of
    23         the positive recommendations that I am minded to make is
    24         that in a situation like this, it really is absurd to have
    25         a long Inquest into how people come to their deaths when
    26         there has been a major Inquiry by a High Court J u d ge.
    27   MR.   BURGESS:     Certainly,    Sir Murray, the Society generally
    28         supports that view.        We were in on the Working Party which
    29         reported in March this year.         Many of us have assisted the
    30         Home Office in formulating their views on that.         They are
    31         not unknown to u s .      I think the difficulty arises, of
    32         course, in that we have in the Coroner's Court a much more
    33         focused and limited inquiry, and if the major incident has
    34         already been the subject of a far wider inquiry it becomes
    35         quite difficult to refocus, as Dr. Popper had to do in
    36         this case.




                                               39
 1   LORD JUSTICE-STUART SMITH:        Yes.    What would have been sensible
 2         in this case would have been to confine the Inquest to
 3         what took place at the mini Inquests in fact, which was
 4         who, when and where, and leave the how to Taylor LJ.              Then
 5         you would not have had any problems about cut off points
 6         or suggestions that you should enquire into the adequacy
 7         of the emergency services, and so on, which had all been
 8         done by Lord Taylor.
 9   MR.   BURGESS:     I was so bold as to say, sir, that High Court
10         Judges are ex officio Coroners anyway.
11   LORD JUSTICE-STUART SMITH:        Yes, they are.
12   MR.   BURGESS:    There is nothing to stop them sweeping up the
13         Inquest into their inquiry in so far as it is relevant.
14   LORD JUSTICE-STUART SMITH:        They could do, and I think the
15         recommendation is that they may be able to do that in some
16         cases.     Often the question of who, when and where somebody
17         died may involve simple issues.         I do not know.    I think
18         Taylor LJ could perfectly well have done it here, or he
19         might have delegated those issues to Dr. Popper.              At any
20         rate, I am minded very much to endorse the proposals of
21         the Working Party on this, but I did not want to do that
22         without hearing your views about i t .
23   A     I would support you, if I may put it as boldly as that.                   I
24         will try to find the copy of the letter because it might
25         be of interest if nothing else.
26              May I just say one other thing, sir.           I think you
27         mention in paragraph 2 that this material was kept in a
28         side room and the rest was at a local police station.                As
29         I say, I cannot actually remember what we did on site, but
30         it may be in one of these transcripts between 6 and 10, I
31         would suggest.     I do not think it is very important but
32         the only point I wanted to make         was       it was not kept atthe
33         local police station.          That is a point,    I think.    The
34         West Midlands Police had officers in Sheffield.           They were
35         at Furnival House.     If    anything was         kept anywhere,     it
36         would have been there.        Between the         interim Inquests and
37         the resumed Inquest,    the main Inquest, the key to Furnival

    1         House was with the local police for a time because the
    2         offices were not being used, but they were retrieved,         I
    3         think, about 16th, and then West Midlands Police had
    4         control because we obviously did not want our material to
    5         be     with the local police for obvious reasons.     I think
    6         they did have access.        There were problems.   I remember
    7         correspondence with Mr. Sharpe, the Chief Constable of
    8         Cumbria, because he wanted to release certain material for
    9         disciplinary proceedings and I was very reluctant that we
10            should do that because I thought it would give an unfair
11            advantage.     r cannot remember what happened, but I thought
12            I would just mention that.
13      LORD JUSTICE-STUART SMITH:         I got this from something said by
14            the Crown Prosecution Service, and I thought they had got
15            it from you.     I may be wrong.
16      MR.   BURGESS:     It may be more correct, sir, to say the rest        of
17            it was kept locally.
18      LORD JUSTICE-STUART SMITH:         Locally.
19      MR.   BURGESS:     Without necessarily identifying where.
20      DR.   POPPER:     Unfortunately,    I cannot remember what we actually
21            did.      I know we had a store room, a secure room, for the
22            legal representatives so they did not have to carry
23            everything.
24      LORD JUSTICE-STUART SMITH:         I have asked Counsel to try to
25            clarify this, and may be I shall get something from them.
26            I will check that.       Thank you very much for coming.      It
27            has been a great help to m e .

                    I am a Police Constable            in the South Yorkshire Police         presently

                    stationed at Woodseats Police Station,                 Sheffield.

                    On Saturday 15 April         1989 150489 I was on duty at the FA Cup Semi-

                    Final at Hillsborough,            Sheffield.

                    I commenced duty at Woodseats Police Station at 7.45am 0745 that

                    morning,      together with other Officers             I was   conveyed to Bright Side Ln,

                    Police Driving School.            At that location I was informed that my duty

                    for this event would be manning a traffic point situated on Halifax Rd

                    at   its junction with Kilner W a y .           Kilner Way is a public road which

                    gives access to numerous stores and shops.

                    At approximately 10am 1000 that morning myself, along with PC2723
                      fV 5*57(s>t
                    PLUMMER was dropped off at the above mentioned point.  Traffic and

                    pedestrian movement was slight.
                                                                        PAGE
                                                                        S2479

At 12.30pm 1230 that day pedestrian movement had increased with

football   fans.   The majority of fans in crowds were not making their

way to the Hillsborough Stadium but towards Parson Cross, a large

council estate situated off Halifax Rd travelling away from the City.

Traffic movement was moderate.

At jS..00 pm 1400 that day pedestrian movement was busy.       I noticed that

a large amount of people were consuming or carrying canned or bottled

beers and lager.

A supermarket believed to be     called   Gateway was being constantly used

by the football supporters for the purchase of alcohol.         This

supermarket   is situated on Kilner W a y .   Fans of all ages,   however the

majority were young men aged between 18 years to 30 years, were

sitting or hanging around on grass embankments at the side of the

Halifax Rd.

Two members of the Mounted Secti on were seen moving them on towards

the ground.

On numerous occasions    people approached me who were obviously from

Liverpool and asked me where they could get tickets from.

At 2.40pm 1440 that day coaches with Liverpool supporters were still

arriving on Halifax Rd.     They were directed to park on the nearside

lane of that road when travelling out of the City.         Pedestrian

movement still heavy,    people hurrying towards the ground.

At 3.00pm 1500 pedestrian movement on Halifax Rd was slight.

At approximately 3.05pm 1505     myself with PC PLUMMER were picked up      to

be transported to Brightside     Ln.

En route to Brightside Ln it was ascertained that there was a major

incident occurring at the Hillsborough Ground and we were d i r e c t e d _

back to that location.

I was aware that ambulances were       called for and together w i t h PC

PLUMMER made my way back to^ Halifax Rd.
                                                                                  PAGE    3
         .-                                                           S2479
    -4



              Traffic towards the ground were directed elsewhere and Halifax Rd when

              travelling towards the City was kept free for the use of ambulances

              and the like.

              Together with PC PLUMMER      I remained on the traffic point until 6pm

              1800 after which I made my way to Clay Wheels Ln.

              With other Officers    I was then conveyed to Woodseats PStn and reported

              off duty.

                                                                   S W WARD 2979 SIGNED

 ^ B e a r Sir

   RE:      HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY

   Lord Justice Taylor wished to know if the Oath was administered a t the Bradford Fire
   Inquiry.

   The transcript, shows th a t the Oath was given, but not on what basis.

   I am trying to contact the head of our team a t Bradford who has retired but who may
   have knowledge of what occurred.

   I think the Learned Lord Justice is already aware th at Counsel's initial reaction was
   th a t, if there is no power, th ere would not appear to be an appropriate basis on which
   the oath could be administered. However, I understand that Counsel is also giving the
   m a tte r further consideration.

      I will write to you again on the m a tte r as soon as possible. In the meantime, we have
^ ^ t h e Bradford papers and if the learned Lord Justice has any queries on th a t Inquiry
      perhaps you could contact me or one of my colleagues?

   I enclose a copy of Simon Inglis' book on UK grounds for the Learned Lord Justice.

                                                  Yours faithfully

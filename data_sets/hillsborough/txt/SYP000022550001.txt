Dear Mr Whalley,

                               Hillsborough Disaster

M yself, my wife and our two children were present in Section B of the
Leppings Lane end at the time of the above d i s a s t e r , and myself and rnywife
would be w i l l i n g t o giv e o r a l ev id e n ce t o t h e i n q u i r y . For your
information I enclose four statements each independently made on Sunday 16b
April 1989.




Yours sin c e re ly ,
F A Cup Senrf Final Hillsborough 15 April 1989



Arrived at 14.45 pm at Entrance B.

Large crowd milling around - noisy but not                         menacing.

No real crowd movement ; nobody appeared to be going in.

Police announced side gates opened.

Crowd walked through at f a s t pace but not running.

No t i c k e t s asked fo r or inspected.

Funnelled through tunnel onto packed t e r r a c e .

My w ife and I managed to get to the pitch                      side       of ab a r r i e r but our two
children (16 and 14) became separated.

Game kicked o f f - massive surging of crowd, much                         discomfort but no        sign of
trouble only obvious tremendous overcrowding.

Noticed people try in g to climb over b a r r ie r to pitch but police lin ed up on
pitch and t r i e d to push fans back (verbally and p h y sic a lly ).

Game then stopped by police due to number of fans on p itc h .

I was s t i l l unaware o f seriousness of problem except people were try in g to
push back from fro n t and much shouting.

Fans being hoisted up to           te r r a c e above.

Fans then began to disperse more quickly              as small door opened onto pitch
(not aware of t h i s at t h a t moment although c le a r l y fans wereleaving on to
pitch through t h i s opening).

Approximately now 15.15 pm.
Horror o f incident now emerging - a mass grave was appearing some 2 metres
in fr o n t.
People dying in fro n t of us - ashen white and beginning to turn blue.

Fans giving f i r s t aid - kiss of l i f e , chest thumping.

P o l i c e and f i r s t a i d e r s now g e t t i n g to d e a d / i n j u r e d and s t a r t i n g to
help/move.

Elder son located us and was O.K. and then sawyounger sonclin g in g to side
r a i l i n g s obviously O.K. but could not get back to us andendedup on pitch
from righthand area.
People stunned with d i s b e l i e f and began to f i l t e r out through entrance.

There i s no doubt in my mind the s itu a tio n was completely out of control
from the time of opening the side gates.

Problem caused by too many people in too small a space.
No communications.

Police on pitch watching had no idea what was happening and when they
re a lis e d did not appear to know what to do.

Had fro n t b a r r i e r been quickly taken down (ie wire c u tte r s ) then would have
been no d i s a s t e r .

The solution however was so so simple :

1        Should NOT have opened gates

2        Should have delayed k ick -o ff

3        Should have kept the crowd, both outside and in sid e informed of
         the reason f o r the delay and th ere would have been no animosity
         or in ju ry .

            I am as stated a b o v e .

            On 15th April        1989 <150489)        I was involved in duties a t .Hi 1Isborough

            Football Ground, S h ef fi el d .          On that evening my specific duties were

            accompanyi ng relatives of the deceased when they made identifications

            of bodies and subsequent ly tak i ng statements from t h e m .

            I, have read a statement           I took. on that evening from Mr John HARRISON

            referring to the identification of his son, who is I referred to in

            the statement as Peter Andrew FRITH.

            During the evening I took a number of statments and on each occasion

            the deceaseds details were provided by the next of kin.
                                                                  r fttS )                           //
            I now am aware that Peter Andrew FRITH is in fact Peter Andrew

            HARRISON.

            I can only say the discrepancy which has arisen can only be

         attributable to the pressure under which all     people were placed.     In

         each case the statements   I took were read to the next of kin and then

         given to them for them to read.      They were then signed by them.

                                                                           SIGNED

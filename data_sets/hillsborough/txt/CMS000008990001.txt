           Dear

           Thank you for your recent letters.            I apologise for the delay
           in replying to you.

           The information which you require is a matter for individual
           football clubs and local authorities to determine.  However, I
           enclose a paper outlining the initial response by the
           Government to the recommendations contained in Lord Justice
           Taylor's Final Report.

           I hope this information is of use to you.

                                                                     Yours sincerely

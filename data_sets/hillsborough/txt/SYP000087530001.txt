                 .an Area Constable



                 At 8 . 4 5 a m    (0845)    on S a tu rd ay   15 April          1989    (150489)    I commenced duty

                 at Woods eat s Pol Stn              in connection with the Football                  A s s o c i a t i o n Cup

                 Semi      Final      to be played at the S h ef fi eld We d n e s d a y ground that                   day.

                 I was      replacing                           who was unable to                carry out    his duties

                 on that        day.



                 To gether with other officers                 I was     tra nsp ort ed to the ph ef fi el d

                 W e d n es da y Football      ground arriving around                    9.30am    (0930).        A short

time    later we were        briefed on overall             duties at th\/f ground by

Chief Supt.      Duckenfield.           My Serial        Sgt.   was Effi,. McCall          w ho briefed

me   in more detail       in respect         of specific        duties which were

to assist Sh ef fie ld W e d n e s d a y stewards at / C h e             car    park entrance          to the

No rth St and from Pe ni sto ne Rd.



Together with POL PC           1015 G r i f f i t h    I took up position at the                   r park

entrance about        1 1.00am    (1100) /          As the day wore            on more    supporters

congregated      in Peni sto ne Rd and             it was    noticeable and o y concern that

many at this end of the ground had with                       them and were         drinking alcohol

from    pre-packed      containers,         some    carrying as many as S tins of beer                       or

larger.       These suppor ter s were              predo min abl y sporting         the    colours      of

N o t t i n g h a m Forrest as the Pen istone Rd end of the ground was al lo cat ed

to them.       However,      a number        of Liverpool       supporters were also seen

walkin g along Pe ni sto ne Rd but without any                    conflict with s u ppo rte rs               of

N ot ti n g h a m Forrest.



As the kick off time a pp ro ac he d more and more Liverpool                             supporters

a pp ro ac he d the gates     to the        car    parks asking     for entry to the ground,

I was    concerned wit h the         possibility that the gates might                      be rushed

and asked one of the stewards                 to    obtain the key to the            padlock for

the gates.        The    closer    the time         was to 3 . 0 0 p m    (1500)    the more

supporters were asking            for access          to the ground,           they were    instructed

to atte nd at the Lep pin gs Ln end of the ground wh ich had been

a ll oca ted to Liverpool         supporters.



Just after     the kick off        I heard two          loud cheers        from the       crowd    in the

ground and went         to the    pitgh access at the side of the No rth S t a n d and

the Spi on Hop to see          ifychere       had been any score.                 I was told at          that

time by f O L PC

                      1783 B / o u g h a m that all avai lab le            officers were          to

                                                                                              S 3179

atte nd at the Lep pin gs Ln end of the ground.                       I went with POL PC

B ro u g h a m to the track at the side of the                pitch    in front     of the North

Stand.      I saw that       the    players were          leaving the     pitch towards       the

players'    tunnel.         As we made our way to w a r d s the Leppings Ln e nd of

the ground along the Nor th Stand mi ss i l e% /w er e                 thrown from the Nor th

S ta nd on to the        pitch and       I was    obliges to take       cover against        the

perimeter wall       in front       of the Nor th Stand.              A large    propor tio n of

the    crowd in that stand were                chanting    ’What a fucking shitty g r o u n d ” .



It became apparent          to me that a serious             public    order situ at io n hac

deve lop ed with in the terr acing at the Lep pings Ln end of the ground*                                 I

could see       people   climbing        in to the West Stand and o n l o \ t h y fencing

at the front along          the No rth Stand side of the Leppings L K terracing,

I stood with POL PC B r o ug ha m between the goal and the N or th Stand

facing    the    crowd    in the terracing           behind the goal.           We were subj ec te d

to verbal       abuse and    I war ne d Pol PC B ro ug ha m that           coins were      being

thro wn from the West St and and                 raised terracing       between the No rt h and

West Stand.         At this time the             crowd app ea re d    in a very ugly Jffood.



My at te nt io n was     drawn to a youth            I now know to be

           who had run on to the                pitch/from the area around the Leppings

Ln goal and had run towards                   the &ftion Hop where N o tt in g h a m Forrest

supporters were massed.                  He        gesticulating       in a thr eatening       a nd

abusive manner       towards       the    crowd at the Sp io n Kop end of the ground

and he became the focus             of at te nti on of many          inside the ground.             He

was shephe rde d back        towards          the/l_eppings L . / e n d of the ground where              he

was    detained by Pol PC Broughj/m and m y s e ^ > as we did so a large                           cheer

went    up around the ground and we were subject                      to a t t en ti on   from the

Following!                    de te n ti on I left the         police    room and   returned to

the    pitch area     passing on the way a number                  of people    laid out at the

rear    of the North Stand.              It was    not until       the time    I realised that

the situation at the Lep pin gs Ln end of the ground was                          not   solely a

public order one.



I went    on to the        playing      surface where         I saw     ol^ce Se rgeant      Eddiso n

who was organising a cordon about the half way                          Vine to prevent a

substantial        number    of Liverpool         supporters\be«^>ming         involved    in

violence towards No tt i n g h a m Forrest               supporters at the S pi on Hop.

There was a great deal             of anger amongst          the    crowd and a number          of

scuffles     broke out.           But   for the serious ne ss         of the situ at ion and the

pr eo cc up ati on of      police officers wi t h the dead and injured many

arrest s wou ld have         been made at this time under                normal   circumstances.



F ol low ing an an nou nce me nt         to the    crowd that       the game wou ld not

continue and a request             that    they    remain     in t h e i / seats and on the

terraces     they began       leaving      from all       parts o-^the ground.            S li gh tl y

after we were direct ed on to J^enistone Rd                     i^ior    to a debriefing at the

N o r t h Stand,



I am fully conversent w i t h all             parts       of the H i l l s b o ro ug h Stadium,

having att end ed on many o ccasions                both as a Police Officer and a

spectator.          Over    the   past two years          I have    regularly wo r ke d at the

Sp io n Hop end of the ground at the turnstiles and inside the ground.

       Sheffield on Friday 28th April,                                                                            It has been suggested to us by a
       member of                      th e             inquiry staff that we might like to make written
       submissions in s u p p o r t o f the application we are intending t o make?
       for representation at the Inquiry.


                      The Football Supporters' Association was set up in August
       itc^               -tjliowing on the disaster at the Heysel Stadium in Brussels,
       The aims of the Organisation are to obtain representation for
       football supporters amongst the game's ruling bodies with -a v i e ^
       to obtaining advance and ongoing consultation on matters t i r e ^ ..
spr




       involved with football supporters.                                                                                     The matter encompassed by en.,/

       The identity card issue has been of particular interest to us in
       recent months.                                         This would now seem to be of vital importance

    Nottingham area,                 There are a total of 17 branches*                  The
    Association is funded almost entirely out of menl                                              e s # the
    currant m i n i m u m Membership fee being £2*00 per member.                              That fee
    is et'fec                   used up by the service given toy the Organisation to
    its members. Small donations have been received from time to time
    from football bodies such as the Football Trust and the l>PA,


           The Organisation is run entirely by its members on a
    roluntary b a s i s and it lias no full time employees.                             Since
    flifiost 8,000 football supporters have joined and since the
    introduction of a group membership scheme                                  year, many
    thousands of other supports have become                                      set.      Again

    launched on Merseyside,


           So far as we understand the terms of reference of the
    Inquiry, these                                     1 can be considered to be the
    following,* -


    1.     To investigate the background to the tragedy at Hillsborough
           which must'include an investigation into the manner in which
            football is administered and operates in this co


            To     in v e s tig a te   the actual events at Hillsborough on 15th
            April 1989 and determine the causative factors involved in
            the deaths and injuries.


            To make recommendations for the future administration of the
            national game, to ensure that tragedies such as this never
            occur again.



            our interests clearly coincide with that of the Inquiry,                                        AH
    of our involvement is concerend with                                V, crowd control,             and
    administration at football grounds.                             The terns of reference
    referred to above indicate an Inquiry which could not,                                    in our
    view, evor be complete and satisfactory without representation

           Our clients are in the perfect position to be able to assist
    his Lordship in explaining the effects of the manner in which
    football lias been administered from the consumer's point of view
    in the years leading up to this disaster. They                                             tble to
    give evidence as to the negotiations that have ensued between them
    and the football authorities and produce documentation which will
    assist his Lordship,                     They will be able to produce details of the
    recommendations our clients have ra                                  t-   '   football     v * uor


           Since October last year, the Football Supporters' h s s o
    has met with the Football Association on two occasions and has,
    sine© January of this year, sat on the ’’strategic committee11
    discussing the identity card issue.                                 This committee comprises
    members from the House.of Commons All Party football Committee,
    the Football Association, The Football League and Wembley stadium
    Limited and is chaired by Dennis Howell,


            In circumstances where many of their members v e ~ c                                -■> I tally

    present at Hillsborough,, they will also be in a position to
    provide his Lordship with Statements and, if necessary, oral
    ovidenea from witnesses present at the disaster.


            Most importantly# they will also be in a position to put
    forward their own recommendations to the Inquiry as to what fotm
    his Lordship's recommendations to the government and the football
    authorities should take for the running of the game in the future,
    because we feel it is essential that the views of the supporters
    toe cxjj                  and cons                  by your Lordship *


            To our mind, our clients are likely to be the only entirely
     independent organisation who will wish to attend the Inquiry.
    Whilst we are sure that all parties will wish to assist his
     Lordship in the formation of his views,                                  it is inevitable that the
     other parties present will- have a position which they will,                                        in
     some way, wish to defend or prosecute ,                                      t.ms other than the good

     they are represented individually or collectively, will inevitably

proceedings against several parties involved.                   0« the other hand,
all of the authorities and organisations involved with the
administration of that particular match and of football generally
will wish to in someway justify their actions and protect their                          ^
position.          They may owe obligations to insurance companies in this

regard.

         Our clients, on the contrary, have no position t...                     ld ot
 loSe« t e and can be « » n *» entirely independent.                      It is for that
/eason that both we and our clients feel that they require
independent legal representation at the Inquiry.


         TO put their case properly and effectively, they must be
independent of the various organisations involved and from the
representatives of the families of the bereaved and the injured.


          The problem with which our clients are faced Is that they
simply do not have any funds to meet the costs of preparing
 evidence which we feel may be crucial to his Lordship's Inquiry.
 The evidence which will be gathered from the many branches of our
 client o r g a n i s a t i o n will inevitably need sifting and arranging
 into a logical order for presentation to the Inquiry.                       This wou.d
 involve the collation of substantial documentation and
 investigation.           In addition, we anticipate that his Lordship a. y
 require oral evidence front several members of our client
 organisation.          That will require the preparation of pr
 evidence and the Inevitable taking o£ Statements.                        Our clients
 simply do not have the resources to undertake those tasks
 themselves nor do they have the financial backing to instruct
 solicitors to undertake that task.

               in addition to preparation for the Inquiry, our clients will

      Lordship.


             As we said at the outset we are attending the hearing on

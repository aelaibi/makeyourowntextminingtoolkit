                      Statess

                      I live at the above address with my mother.              I have been a fan

                      of Liva^paol
                          j^^'pOQj       football   club all my life.     I am a season ticket holder,



    fZp_S''-*-yJ~CL   1 got a ticket/as       I am a season ticket holder for the semi               final    of

      \x                     \
                      the F .Av    ciypX between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest          due to be played

                      at Hillsborough,       the ground of Sheffield Wednesday in Sheffield.



                      I travelled from my home         in Halifax on Saturday 15th April             1989

                      (150489),     to Hillsborough.      I 1 e/ft HaJr^ffax at about   1.00pm (1300) and
-
                                                                          PAGE
                                                                          S2079

I was able to walk up to the turnstile without any trouble,            hand my

ticket over and go straLg+fC into the ground.          There were only about a

couple of     people ijK'rront of me at that time.      I noticed two Police

Q ff^cers seargKxVig fans outside the turnstile        I used,   I think it was

  urnst ile

„C D   *

There were other people outside the ground as I went in but they were

standing back,     I assumed they may be people who had not got tickets.



I did see people on my way to the ground outside Pubs drinking.              I

also saw fans     in the ground who had obviously been drinking but I did

not see anyone drinking       in the ground.



As     I have said I got into the ground early,      went through t l y tunnel

directly in front of me and t*Kfi< up a position near the back of what            I

ryj-w know to be pen numbj»fr four.    This would be about (\ 405 liours „ and

the crowd was not u h 'f y   sacked.   In fact   I was a ble to find three

fr iends,               and a lad I know as             and one as           and I

stood with them,



At about half past two the crowd started to get packed tighter and

started to surge forward.        It was not too bad at first because you

could get back to your original        position after each surge.



By 144J& h o u r s , it was so packed that when a surge came, you were
/ x y
unable to regain your previous position and in fact after each surge              I

''was in a different   part of the pen.     In fact it was then that I became

separated from my friends and I did not see them again until after the

game had been stopped,       and we all met up again,
                                                                                          PAGE        3
                                                                                          S2079

                 I would say that sometime between 1445 hours and 1500 hours,            I knew

                 the situation was getting serious.        I had a girl    crushed next to me
                                                                           s'
                 who was screaming and crying.        I could not help/fier as none of us

                 could move.       1" was
                                      in the middle of pen fouj/at the time and another
                                                      PWv
                 girl,   not the one next to me, fell to tl- y f ground and she just could

                 not get up.      We we re trying to push back to get her up but     it was just

                 impossible.      This girl was not making any noise and I don't know if

                 she was    conscious or not.     I could not describe her or her clothing.


Q .M.      \o                                                                             r^Cj    i
             r   When the girl went down I saw a uniform male Pol i c ^ O f f i car standi ng

                 i n the seated area above u s .     The fans we re sf^titi ng at him,   telling
na_
                 him someone had fallen.        At first he just shrugged his shoulders as if

         or      to say what can I d
                                   do,
                                     o , then as we continued to shout he
                                                                       fie turnejJU^nd
                                                                           turnej

                 walked away.



                 The surges      continued to come from the back and I eventually finished

                 up just about three feet from the front fence.           As the match just

                 started,   so it would be about     1500 hour^f I saw people climbing out of
      c Ar T
                 the pen trying to get over the f er^gtTs onto the pitch.        At f irst the

                  o 1i ce were    pushing them hackVfn and on one occasion the gate at the

                 front was opened and fans put back in the pen through.           That was at

                 about   1500 hours.



                 Just before the game was stopped,       the Police must have    realised there

                 was a real      problem on the terrace and I saw that the small gate at the

                 front was open and fans were being let out.         Police were also trying

                 to pull the fences down,       to get fans out at about that time.



                 I eventually got out of the terraces by climbing over to side fences

            pitch by the front gate.



            I think that the people died on the terrace because of the volume of

            people    in the terraces and the fact that as the surges came they




            overall    plan.



            I think that ground conditions should be vastly improved and the crowd

            should be better controlled.         I suggest a filter system some way away

            from the gr o u n d .



            I also think that there should be more           communication between the

            people controlling the pens.         I would be prepared to pay for the extra

            cost of these m e a s u r e s .

 Dear MrsStringer
  Hillsborough Inquests — Photographs
 Thank you for your recent letter requesting photographs which were referred to in
 evidence at the inquest.
 As I am sure you will appreciate, we only hold one set of photographs in our records and
 we do not have the facility of copying these for you ourselves, nor I am sure, do we hold
 the negatives
^ h e re ls l/e ly T ittle option but for me to ask the police to let you have copies.
                V 'V
  Exactly what      4«t the police make copy photographs available to you is, to some
  extent, outside my control but I agree it is entirely reasonable to insist that you are given a
  good quality photograph. I am aware that there has been some problem in this regard
  recently.
  I am therefore writing to the police today asking them to provide you with copies of
  photographs and plans that your letter mentions. I have asked them to ensure that they
  are of an acceptable standard. If this does not turn out to be the case when you receive
  the photographs please let me know and I will take the matter up with the police again.
  Yours sincerely




  C P Dorries
  HM Coroner

  NOTES
1 Modify this as necessary according to whether the
  inquest is held with or without a jury or partly
  with and partly without a jury.
2 In the case of a death from natural causes or from
  industrial disease, want of attention at birth, chronic
  alcoholism or addiction to drugs insert the immediate
  cause of death and morbid conditions (if any) giving                     Date             19
  rise to the immediate cause of death.

3 Omit this if the cause of death is one to which
  Note 2 applies.

4 a Where the cause of death is one to which Note 2
    applies, it is suggested that one of the following
    forms be adopted:
     C.D. died from natural causes.
                                                                           Re
      C.D. died from the industrial disease o f

      C.D. died from dependence on drugs/non-dependable
      on drugs.

      C.D. died from want o f attention at birth.

      (In any o f the above cases, but in no other, it is
      suggested that the following words may, where
      appropriate, be added:
      "and the cause of death was aggravated by lack of                    Cause of death
      care/self-neglect').

   b In any other case except murder, manslaughter,
     infanticide or stillbirth, it is suggested that one
     of the following forms be adopted:

      C.D. killed himself/herself (whilst the balance of
      his/her mind was disturbed).

      C.D. died as the result o f an attempted/self­
      induced abortion.                                                    Verdict
      C.D. died as the result o f an accident/misadventure.

      C.D. was killed lawfully.

      Open verdict, namely, the evidence did not fully or
      further disclose the means whereby the cause o f death
      arose.

   c In the case of murder, manslaughter or infanticide
     it is suggested that the following form be adopted.

      C.D. was killed unlawfully.

   d In the case of a stillbirth insert 'stillbirth' and do not
     complete the remainder of the form.

        Dear Sir

        PAUL CARLILE (DECEASED) - SANDRA STRINGER - HILLSBOROUGH

        Enclosed herewith, for your information, are copies of recent correspondence
        concerning a request made on behalf of Paul Carlile’s mother for the release
        of copy statements made by persons having dealings with her son as a consequence
        of the Hillsborough disaster, together with copies of the documents I have
        released.

        Mrs Stringer's recollection   that shehas been shown statements made by
        Dr Monaghan and DetectiveConstable Pont       in which her son is referred   to
        specifically, one assumes by name, is clearly sadly incorrect in respect of
        Dr Monaghan.  However, you will see at line one of page two of Pont's statement
        of 4 July 1989) which has already been released, that the officer does make
        a reference to the deceased by name.

         I do not feel competent to     release to Mrs Stringer either a full copy                                  of the
         inquest file, or for that matter, the index she seeks.

         Yours faithfully

  Dear Sir,

  Paul Carlile (Deceased) - Sandra Stringer.

   I refer to the recent telephone conversation between my Liaison Officer,
   Ann Adlington, and your Inspector Brentnall. As discussed Mrs. Stringer is
   adamant that at the resumed inquest, Officers from West Midlands Police
   showed her statements made by _________________|and D.C. Pont wherein Paul
  jwas specifically mentioned.  In the circumstances I should be grateful if
  you would check your records in relation to the same. '

  Further, for the sake of clarity, could you please supply an index of
  Paul's inquest file. Chief Superintendent Mole can confirm that at a
  meeting held with Bichard Wells, Mrs. Stringer requested a full copy of
  Paul's file.

  1 thank you for your assistance.

  Yours faithfully,




  Councillor H. Chase.

D ear Ms Carlile

Inquest into the death of your brother Paul

Further to my recent letter I have now had an opportunity to look through those parts of the inquest
transcript that most closely relate to your brother’s death.

As I previously indicated to you, unless a statement or document is used in evidence at an inquest
it’s release remains a matter for the owner/maker of the document rather than the Coroner.
However, I understand from the South Yorkshire Police that they have obtained permission from
nearly everyone who gave a statement relevant to your brother’s death and that these statements
have n o v ^ e j^ n t to you.

The one exception was Mr Hollinghurst who, as you know, was near your brother at the time of the
crush. For whatever reason Mr Hollinghurst decided that he did not want his statem en^eleased and
I was therefore concerned to check whether his statement had been used in evidence for that would
have clearly entitled me to provide you with a cop^whatever Mr Hollinghurst’s own feelings were.

On checking the transcript I note that Mr Hollinghurst in fact gave evidence in person. I assume that
you were either present or already have had sight of a transcript of that evidence, I would be happy
to provide you with a copy of that section free of charge if this is not the case. However, I am afraid
the fact that he gave evidence in person makes it quite clear that I am not entitled to release his
statement.

I am sorry that I cannot be more helpful. If you do want a copy of that section of the transcript please
let me know.

Yours sincerely

Dear Ms Carlile

Inquest into the death of your brother Paul
Thank you for your letter of 7th February. I am sorry for the delay in replying but I believe
you will already have received an acknowledgement indicating that I was away on holiday.

It is quite correct that the Coroner must hold papers relating to an Inquest for a minimum
of 15 years. The law relating to the inspection of such documents is contained in Rule 57
of the Coroners Rules 1984. This sets out that a Coroner shall supply to any “properly
interested person” (a phrase defined elsewhere in the rules, but which would include you)
a copy of any post-mortem report or any notes of evidence or of any document put in
evidence at an Inquest. There would normally be a charge for copying such documents
although this has generally been waived where applicable to the Hillsborough relatives.
Alternatively the Coroner may permit such a person to inspect such report, notes of
evidence or documents without charge at his office.

This means that the Coroner only has power to release either a post-mortem report, a
transcript of a case, or copies of statements that are actually read out as documentary
evidence. Any other documents that the Coroner is given sight of do not come under his
control and it is up to the owner or maker of that document to authorise its release rather
tharythe Coroner. Sadly it seems to me that the majority of statements in your brother’s
ca!S^^n'within this letter category and I do not have the right to send copies of them to
you, however much I may wish to do so.

However, I am aware that you have been in correspondence with the Police and that they
have now sent you certain statements and may soon be in a position to send you others. I
understand that one witness (who in fact comes from Liverpool) has refused permission for
his statement to be released by the Police and thus I now need to review the transcript of

the Inquest in so far as it relates to your brother (obviously a very substantial task) to see
whether this statement might come within the definition of those that you are automatically
entitled to.

I would therefore be grateful for your continuing patience. I hope to be able to write to you
again within the next week or ten days. I can assure you that I am very sympathetic to
your request but I am sure you will realise that I am bound by the law and am unable to
hand out documents without regard to the legal position.

I will write to you again shortly.

Yours sincerely

       Dear Sirs,

       Re: RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990.


       If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
       of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of whom you represent,
       on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m. Details of venue will be notified in
       due course.

       I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
       evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
       coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarial but
       inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only limited objectives.

       Subject to the Coroners’ Act 1988 and the Coroners’ Rules, the Inquest is
       under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
       witnesses who wish to give evidence.  I am at present engaged in considering
       this and in determining who I wish to invite to attend.

       Without prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter, I am writing to you
       to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
       appropriate details of any witness or witnesses whom you would like me to
       consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

       May I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to my
       attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

       I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a n?me or
       names for consideration is nothing more than that, and that the decision as
       to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

       I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
                                         ;mber I will assume you have no names to

Dear Sire*
He: PAUL WXX&&K CAHLILE (BECSASED) Bo.73-
As you are aware» the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed. You may also
be aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
on the 15th of January 1990.
I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided not' to resume the
Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.
 I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
 Prosecutions has announced his decision aa to what action (if any)
 he may wish to undertake*
 I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
 or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
 matter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
 a substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
 on this matter further.
 I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
 is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
 fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

 Yours faithfully,


  S.L.Popper,
  H.M.Coroner.

Dear Sirs,

You .will be aware that I do not normally release post mortem
reports until the resumption of the Inquest, when they are
in fact put in as evidence.

However, in view of the numerous requests which I have received,
and the obvious distress which delay is causing to your clients,
I have decided that subject to certain conditions set out below,
I am prepared to release to you upon request, the post mortem .
report of your client(s).

The release of these post mortem reports are on the basis that:-

        a.     They have to be treated as provisional, and therefore
               subject to amendment or alteration until such time as
               they are given or produced in evidence at the Inquest.

        b.     They are to be used only for the purpose of bereavement
               conselling of the deceased's relatives or for proper
               legitimate purposes in connesrtion with any legal proceedings
               in which solicitors may be engaged.

        c.     Subject to tha-akS?M§, they are to be kept confidential until
               they come into the public domain at the resumed Inquests.

I have your request for the post mortem report to hand in respect
of each of the persons listed on the attached sheet, and on the
assumption that you will confirm that the report in respect of
each of your respective clients is accepted on the terms set out
above, and in order to save further delay and upset to your client,
I enclose a copy of the relevant post mortem report. If for any
reason you cannot agree to the contents of this letter, please return
the post mortem report to me, without of course making any use of it.

The cost for the copy post mortem repOrt(s) is ^5p    p6r sheet (total £ i . l O p        )
Please make your cheques payable to the City of Sheffield.

Yours faithfully,

         Dear Sirs,

         Re: Paul William Carlile.


         Thank you for your letter of the 26th of April.  I am sorry about the delay
         in replying.  The only person from whom we appear to have taken evidence is a
         Mr. M.T. Hollinghurst and if you require a copy of the transcript of his
         evidence then of course we will be pleased to let you have it, subject to
         paying the appropriate fee for the copy.

         With regard to the other persons mentioned, these were not called as
         witnesses, consequently there are no transcripts of their evidence.


         Yours faithfully,




         S.L.Popper,
         H.M.Coroner.

         Miss. D. Carlile,




         Dear Miss. Carlile,


         Thank you for your letter of the 24th of May which I have read with some
         regret.

         I am particularly sorry that you have been so unhappy over the last few
         weeks. It is clear that you have accepted that nothing can bring your brother
         back.  I hope that with the passage of time and the support of your family
         and friends the pain will ease for you.


         Yours sincerely,




         S.L.Popper,
         H.M.Coroner.

         Mrs. S. Stringer,




         Dear Mrs. Stringer,

         Thank you for your lovely letter which both moved and touched me.
         It is obvious from your letter, as well as earlier contacts which I have had
         with Donna, how much Paul meant to all of you.

         I certainly am not offended that you have written to me and I do hope that
         when I resume the Inquests on the 19th of November 1990 that the evidence
         which we will hear will prove of some help in answering your questions and
         giving you and your family a degree of peace of mind.  I assure you that I am
         spending a great deal of time, energy and thought both on my own and together
         with my officers, to try and make the Inquests as meaningful and as helpful
         as possible within the ambit of the legislation governing coronal inquiries.

         I can never give your son back to you but as I have said above, I hope that
         the way I conduct the Inquest will be of some comfort to you.


         Yours sincerely,




         S.L.Popper,
         H.M.Coroner.

I spoke to Donna on the phone and explained to her that I couldn't
let her have the blood alcohols at the moment but things were
in hand.   I re-assured her by saying that the blood alcohol
level would have premitted this younster to drive had he in fact
been wanting to do so.

 I refer to your recent conversation with Superintendent
 Sleath concerning the release of the deceased persons from
^:he Hillsborough incident to their respective next of kin,
following the adjournment of the inquest.

After consultation with Professor Usher, I have no objection
to this course of action.

               at     the    premises           all    doors       were         found     to    be    bolted       from      the    inside           and

all    the w i n d o w s        were,       in fact,            boarded.                  All   the     officers                commenced

to    bang    on       doors      and windows              to       try a nd a tt r a c t              persons'             attention,

with    no g a i n a n d          entrance         wa s       eventually                  gained       by    the       front          door.

Upon    going          into     the     premises           1 saw           stools          scattered          around             the     floor

and    tables          had     been     knocked          over        and a           number       of    pool       cues          had     been

smashed       in h a lf.             There       were     a     lot        of    people         milling           about          in    the      pub

and    shouting.               X then       called         over       th e       manager          of    the       premises             and

asked       him what           had    gone       off,      to w h i c h          he       replied       "Just          a       little

pushing       and       shoving".             I then          told         him       to    stop    serving             drinks          in the

bar    and    to       get     all    patrons           off     of    th e       premises,             which       he          eventually

started       to       do a n d      i n f o r m e d all        the        persons           in the         public             house     to

drink       up a n d      leave.           I then        left        the        premises          and       liaised             with

Sergeant          Sherratt           and    Inspector               Townend           outside          the    premises,                telling

them what          1 had        seen and what                 I had         told          the m a n a g e r .          X then          re­

entered       the       premises,           in    company with                   Sergeant          S h e rratt,             and       remained

therefore,            laid    them          on    the     floor      on       th e    bill     board and            commenced             to

the    back      of    the    S p i o n Hop,            began       to    spit        on a n d     generally            abuse        us.

We    then       commenced         to       hang     blankets            on     the    railings          around         the       two

bodies       and      it, w a s    decided           that      due       to     the    general         behaviour             of    the

             Whilst       performing            duties          on C l a y w h e e 1 s L a n e      we    spoke       to a      number          of

             Liverpool          f a ns    who       had    arrived          early,       that      is b e t w e e n      11.30am          (1130)

             and    1 2 . 3 0 pm    (1230)          who    stated       that       they    had      come      early       so    that       they

             could       catch a         bus    from       Claywheels          Lane       to    the      outskirts         of       the    city

             to    enable       them      to    have       something          to    drink.          I saw a number                  of    these

             coming       down P en is t o n e            Road North,          some       three       hours      lat e r       somewhat

             worse       the    wear      for       dri n k .      Also      whilst       performing           duties          at    the

             junction          of C l a y w h e e l s      Lane     and Penistone               Road North,              approximately

             fifty       percent         of    the       people      coming        down    the      road      had     some      form       of

             alcoholic          drink         and    were       made    to    s t o p at       that      point      to    either          abandon

             their       drink      or    drink          their     drink.          Quite       a n u m b e r of p e o p l e d e c i d e d

             to    sit    down      and       drink       it,    stating       they were            in no      r u s h as       they       h a d n ’t

             got    a ticket.             The       majority        of all         the    f an s    on    the w a y       to    the .group'd

             were    of    good      nature,             although       a    large       percentage           had     obviouly            been

             drinking.             The    vast       majority          of    fans    appeared            to   be m a k i n g        a somewhat

             late    start,        passing          us    at    2.40pm       ( 1440).

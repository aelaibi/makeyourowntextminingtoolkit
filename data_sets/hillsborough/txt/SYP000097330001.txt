At 11am on Wednesday 3 May 1989, Detective Sergeant         and
             viewed the video tapes marked tape 14, tape 13 and tape
m arked V R M 1/2/3/4.  From that the following summary is compiled :-


All references are in respect of tape 14 unless otherwise stated.

1435          The perimeter gates are seen to be open.

14 36         Vehicles can be seen moving along Leppings         Lane
               although with some restriction.

1439          There has been a dramatic increase in the number of
               fans who are now up and against the Police barriers
               and being held back by the mounted.

1440          The service road is now full of fans which have
               over-spilled into it.  Gates A, B and C are under
               pressure.

1442          Turnstiles A - G    can be seen in use.

1443          Fans are sat on the roof of Gate B.

1445          Two buses pass along Leppings Lane.

1448          Gate C opens for about 15 seconds, fans pass through
               but only a small number compared with the masses
               outside.  Gate A is under pressure.After Gate C is
               closed there is an over-spill into the service road

1450          The over-spill into the service road is forced back
               by mounted and the area regained by Police.

1452          The perimeter gates are seen closed.            Within the turnstile
               areas are huge numbers of fans severely compacted.
               The crowd is being held back at the perimeter gates
               by mounted.
               Gate C is opened, the perimeter gates remain closed
               with the crowd at the perimeter gates continuing to
               be held back by mounted officers.            Fans from the
               turnstile area of A - G are then directed through
               Gate C and into the West Stand Enclosure.            At first
               this is in an orderly fashion but numbers quickly
               accelerate and fans pour through.            Several thousand
               enter and appear to be maki^a their wa^_to the
               central tunnel area. T h e ^ o n c o u r s e area^tnen clears.

1453          Six PC's are seen running from the West Stand Enclosure
               through Gate C and into the concourse area in front
               of Turnstiles A - G .
               The perimeter gates are continuing to be held apparently
               closed by mounted section.  There is swaying and
               surging of the crowd outside these gates and Gate A
               and the area in front of Turnstiles 1 - 1 6 can be
               seen to be under pressure.
  1453
                     The perimeter gates at the riverside are then breached
                         fans run towards the Gate C and through it.

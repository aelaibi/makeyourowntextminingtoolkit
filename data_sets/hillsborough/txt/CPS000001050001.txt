         3.    It is submined that the lodging o f those papers in the Public Record Office makes
                 nonsense o f the claims to “public interest immunity” for statements and police reports.

         4.    In July 1998, the HFSG asked to see material in the hands of the Crown Prosecution
                Service. Mr Croston denied them access to it, and the material sought included this
                report. The report would have given great assistance to the HFSG in compiling its
                representations; its disclosure has however been withheld unjustifiably after it had
                already been put into the public domain, unknown to the HFSG. causing expense, time
                and trouble in obtaining it. A detailed submission upon the report is impossible within
                the time allocated to Mr Croston’s review. Nevertheless, the following matters are
                clear from a quick reading o f the report.

         The significance o f the 19XX match

         5.    At page 17 o f the report, Mr Mervyn Jones asserted that supporters in 1988 “stated”
               that access to the tunnel was cut off. He continued “If this happened it is not
               documented and was not a decision made by the senior officers present at the 1988
               game” (This is o f course similar to the South Yorkshire/Bettison approach; see File of
               24,h August 1998], “Enquiries have found just one retired officer who recalls this
               happening. He, it must be said, is vague in his recollection but the probability is that
               some officers acting on their own initiative ....... [turned spectators away]”.

        6.     This demonstrates the vice o f deliberately concealing the material evidence o f White,
               Woodcock, Lang and Crawford. In any event the retired officer, Higgins, is not
               vague. He said this in his statement o f 2'Kl June 1989:

                       ‘*1 received instructions to close the gates to the entrance and thereafter direct
                       fans to the outer pens o f the stand. I cannot recall where the instruction came
                       form. Under normal circumstances instruction came from a Serial Inspector or
                       via radio firom control. I cannot say from which the instruction came.”

        7.     The significance o f this evidence is that “control” used as a matter o f habit to give this
               instruction, as did an Inspector, no doubt in liaison with each other. This instruction
               was given in 1988 when Murray was in the Control Box. It is to be assumed that the
               DPP was given the same account in 1990 about the opening o f the gates in 1988, as
               appears in the Interim Report o f October 1989. If so, he was demonstrably misled.

        The perimeter gate

        8      The Interim Report speaks at length o f the alleged “forcing” o f the perimeter gate,
               exaggerating the significance o f the event out o f all proportion, This is an Aunt Sally,
               rightly rejected as o f no real consequence by Lord Taylor, but raised often by South
               Yorkshire officers. The purpose p f the suggestion is to imply that the lying assertion
               made repeatedly by Duckenfield that the fans had broken down the gates might have
               had some basis in fact, and been the result of some confusion. In fact, an unsuccessful
               attempt had been made to push the gate shut against the oncoming supporters, and the
               incident did not affect the inrush through Gate C, which, as the defendants themselves

                  say, was opened to relieve a formidable crush at the turnstiles.

         The appendices to the Interim Report

         9.       These appendices, which are in the process o f being copied, appear to demonstrate
                  that much time was devoted by police officers (probably both West Midlands and
                   South Yorkshire) to collecting statements from officers o f other forces to bolster what
                  Lord Taylor derided as the “conspiracy theory” that there was a plot by ticketless. late-
                  arriving and intoxicated supporters to force an admission into the ground. “Public
                  interest immunity'’ has o f course been claimed for police statements, including these.

         10.      It is submitted that, because the Interim Report o f the West Midlands police has been
                   placed into the public domain, there can be no justification o f any kind for withholding
                   the final report, or the advice o f counsel that was made on the basis o f that report.
                   The CPS is asked to produce them.

         11.      Substantial representations have been received from Murray’s lawyers today, and none
                  from Duckenfield’s. It appears from a first reading that Murray’s lawyers have waited
                  until effectively the last day o f the review, not just to reply to the material supplied
                  recently by the prosecution, but to put forward wider arguments, at a time when a
                  considered reply by the prosecutor is not possible.

         12.      The HFSG will be ready to deal with any questions the CPS may have about its
                  representations, or the material presented by the defendants, or other concerns.

       Dear Mr Croston

       Adlington v Murray: Adlinston v Duckenfield

       Supplementary Representations on behalf o f the Prosecutor

       1.      On 8th October 1998 representatives o f the Hillsborough Family Support Group
               attended the Public Record Office at Kew, to search for documents, and to test the
               various claims o f “public interest immunity”, “legal professional privilege”, and other
               confidentiality which have been made, notably by the South Yorkshire police, but also
               by the Home Office, CPS and West Midlands police. They there obtained a copy o f
               the West Midlands Police Report o f October 1989, which the Home Office had placed
               there at some time in the past for public inspection.

       2.      The visit had taken place at a late stage o f the review by the Crown Prosecution
                Service because it was considered a relatively low priority to incur the costs and time
               o f travelling to Kew, when the probability was that no relevant material would be
               found there by reason o f the “public interest immunity” claim. In addition to the
               report, there is a file o f correspondence to the Taylor Inquiry from spectators at the
               disaster, and statements from various police officers, including PC Bichard. The
               HFSG was denied access to Bichard’s statements in the course o f the “Scrutiny” .
                There is no indication at all that any o f these persons had consented to their statements
               being made public, the condition (among others) that South Yorkshire Police imposed
                for years for disclosing statements.

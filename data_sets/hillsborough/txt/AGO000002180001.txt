ATTORNEY GENERAL


HILLSBOROUGH INQUEST



Mr Roy Edey has w ritten to re q u e st you to inform th e coroner e n q u irin g into the
Hillsborough D isaster th a t his resum ption of the in q u est in o rd e r to receive
details as to the m anner and place of death of each of the deceased is an irre g u la r
proceeding. He also wishes you to issue a directiv e to all coroners th a t when an
instance has been re fe rre d to the DPP for consideration fo r p rosecution, coroners
have to await th a t decision before resum ing in q u ests and em panelling ju r ie s . Mr
E dey's view th a t th e proceedings a re irre g u la r is based on his u n d e rsta n d in g of
the C oroner's Act 1988: he believes th a t section 16 contains th e only power of a
coroner to adjourn an in te re s t.


I have spoken to Michael K ennedy in the CPS who is dealing w ith th e Hillsborough
case. The Hillsborough S teerin g Committee, who act on behalf of a num ber of
relatives of victim s, req u e ste d th e coroner to resum e the in q u est p a rtly because
it would a ssist relatives in th e ir g rieving process to know w here and how th e ir
relatives died, b u t also because it was felt th a t it would a ssist th e S teerin g Group
in negotiating w ith in su ran ce companies over compensation paym ents. The DPP's
office was consulted, and th e y took th e advice of counsel who advised th a t a
resum ption of th e in q u est in o rd e r to receive the limited details envisaged would
not be prejudicial to fu tu re criminal p ro ceed in g s.

You will see from the file th a t Mr Edey w rote on 18th A pril and received a re p ly
b y r e tu r n . He hand delivered his le tte r of 22nd A pril an d chased a response b y
telephone y e sterd a y . I spoke to him when he telephoned and g ath ered from him
th a t he is not actin g on behalf of an y of the relatives in making his re q u e s t, b u t
he informs me th a t he has been cam paigning fo r y e ars fo r reform of th e law
rela tin g to co ro n e rs, and th a t he had one article published in the Sunday Times
some y ears ago; he hopes to p ersu ad e the Sunday Times to pu blish an o th er article
th is Sunday.


He feels th a t the action which th e coroner has taken serv es no
useful p u rp o se , and clearly he is not aware of the rep re se n tatio n s which have
been made on behalf of the victim s. He inform ed me th a t if you d o n 't issue the
directive which he re q u e s ts , he will probably seek judicial review of y o u r
decision. A lthough I cannot conceive th a t he would be su ccessfu l, I tho u g h t you
should be aware of his in te re s t.


The C oroner's Rules 1984, ru les 23 - 28 se t out a num ber of instances in which a
coroner must adjourn an in q u e st. Both the te x t books on coroners a re ag reed
th a t a coroner may adjourn an in q u est a t an y time w henever he th in k s th a t such
a course is p ro p e r and th a t th ere is an adequate c au se , and it does seem clear
th a t a coroner's powers a re not limited to those set out in th e Act and the R u les.
For in stan ce, it was said in R -v - Southw ark C oroner ex p a rte Hicks 1987 th a t if
it became ap p aren t d u rin g a h earin g th a t th e re was a gap in th e evidence th e
coroner should adjourn th e in q u est to enable th e evidence to be obtained. Mr
Edey's assertio n is th a t section 16 of the 1980 Act contains all the law on the
su b ject, and th a t the 1984 Rules have no effect since th e y are inconsistent with
the Act.


I told Mr Edey th a t I tho u g h t you had no power to issue a directive and th a t you
only have a jurisdiction concerning an in q u est were it has been concluded. I
a ttach opposite a d ra ft le tte r for y o u r consideration, if you a g re e .

              way Regulation Act 1842,

              Failure of jury to agree

 Afr-12         12.—(1) This section applies where, in the case of an inquest held with a jury
             the jury fails to agree on a verdict.                                               ’
                (2) If the minority consists of not more than two, the coroner may accept the ver­
             dict of the majority, and the majority shall, in that case, certify the verdict under
             section 11(3) above.
                (3) In any other case of disagreement the coroner may discharge the jury and
             issue a warrant for summoning another jury and, in that case, the inquest shall pro­
             ceed in all respects as if the proceedings which terminated in the disagreement had
             not taken place.

             Order to hold inquest

Afr-13          13.—(1) This section applies where, on an application by or under the authority
             of the Attorney-General, the High Court is satisfied as respects a coroner (“ the cor­
             oner concerned”) either—
                    (a) that he refuses or neglects to hold an inquest which ought to be held; or
                    (b) where an inquest has been held by him, that (whether by reason of
                        fraud, rejection of evidence, irregularity of proceedings, insufficiency of
                        inquiry, the discovery of new facts or evidence or otherwise) it is necess­
                        ary or desirable in the interest of justice that another inquest should be
                        held.
               (2) The High Court may—
                    (a) order an inquest or, as the case may be, another inquest to be held into
                        the death either—
                          (i) by the coroner concerned; or
                         (ii) by the coroner for another district in the same administrative area;
                   (b) order the coroner concerned to pay such costs of and incidental to the
                        application as to the court may appear just; and
                    (c) where an inquest has been held, quash the inquisition on that-inquest.
               (3) In relation to an inquest held under subsection (2)(a)(ii) above, the coroner
             by whom it is held shall be treated for the purposes of this Act as if he were the
             coroner for the district of the coroner concerned.

             Inquest out of jurisdiction

A 6-14         14.—(1) If it appears to a coroner that, in the case of a body lying within his dis-
             ^ Ct\a
                  A in5 ^ sl 0US^lt 10 *3e held into the death but it is expedient that the inquest
          should be held by some other coroner, he may request that coroner to assume juris­
          diction to hold the inquest; and if that coroner agrees he, and not the coroner
          within whose district the body is lying, shall have jurisdiction to hold the inquest.
            (2) If the coroner who has been requested to assume jurisdiction declines to
          assume it, the coroner who has made the request may apply to the Secretary of
          State for a direction designating the coroner who is to hold the inquest.
            (3) On the making of an application under subsection (2) above, the Secretarv of
          State—                                                                            3
                   (a) shall determine by which coroner (whether one of the two mentioned in
                       that subsection or another) the inquest should in all the circumstances
                       be held; and

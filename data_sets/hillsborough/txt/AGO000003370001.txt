                                  ARGUMENT OF THE DPP



           1.    As indicated in paragraph 2 of the Skeleton Argument of the DPP already lodged in this

                 case, for the purposes of this leave application it \& accepted that the Court has
                                                                                               <5L
                 jurisdiction judicially to review a decision of the DPP not to take over private
                                                                                              S'
                 prosecution. If, contrary to the contentions of the DPP, leave were to be granted, then

                 the DPP would wish to invite the Court to consider the question whether the Court has

                 jurisdiction judicially to review such a decision. So far as the DPP is aware, no such

                  decision has been challenged. The Court has, of course, already held that it has

                jurisdiction to review a decision of the DPP not to prosecute but that this jurisdiction

                should be invoked only sparingly (R v DPP, Ex parte C [7/22]. In the event that leave

                were to be granted, the DPP would wish to raise the question whether the Court has

                jurisdiction at all to review a decision of the DPP not to take over a private

                prosecution.



           2.   Given that this is still a leave application, it is not proposed to set out the submissions

                which the DPP would wish the Court to consider in the event that leave were to be

                granted in any detail. However, the considerations which the Director would be likely

                to invite the Court to take into account will include, inter alia, the following:

                 (1)    By definition in such cases the criminal courts will already be seized of the case

                        (because the Prosecution will already have (lawfully) begun). The criminal

                        proceedings should be permitted to proceed as with all other criminal

                        proceedings and the Defendants will be able to challenge the sufficiency o f the

                        evidence and raise any questions as to abuse of process within those

                        proceedings like any other Defendants.

                 (2)    The consequences of the Court assuming jurisdiction in such cases will

                        necessarily be to delay the criminal proceedings.

                 (3)    An application for judicial review of a decision of the DPP not to take over a

                        private prosecution amounts, on analysis, to a collateral attack on the criminal

                        process.

           We w a l k ed      to the gr ou nd > R ^ a n rivs.id about 2pm
S.o£       I entered ^ k e        ground via          the Leppi ngs Lane            turnstiles.       There were        no
L--L .
           queues     or      large crowds        and     I had no     problem       in entering       the ground.           I

           went    into the gro un d w it h                   as                               had tickets        for    the

           seats.

           Once    inside       the   gro un d    I could see the           pitch and terraces           t h ro ug h a

           tunnel.      The     tunnel    had a       large sign w it h       ’S t a n d i n g ’ on it direc tl y

           above     it. This was         the     only sign I could see on display.                     I saw no

           d i r e ct i on fram Police off icers or stewards at this point.

           I w al k ed t hrough/the tunnel without any problem. As I reached the

           terXaces          I could see       that     pens three and four were               full.

           I stood      in pen four           to the      left of the       tunnel     near    to the    back.It was

           very    crowded and          the   s it u at i on grew s te ad i ly          r s e . More an d

           I could not see what               had     c&n^sed the     surge.

           It was     now very d i ff ic ul t           to brXjith, I felt sick and              I was    c oncerned

           a n d shouting.

           I had a vague          concept        of what was        ha pp en in g   on the     pitch    I was aware

           that    play had star te d a nd              people were        climbing     over    the    fences    but my

           entire     c o nc e nt r at i on was       taken up      in trying       to breath.        I w ou ld say

           that    it was a s us t ai n ed          crush for about          twe nt y minutes.

            I became aware         that     play had stopped and                there were a lot of           people      on

            the    pitch but       I cannot      describe        events    on the     pitch as       I was    involved

            in the s u stained        crush.      The s i tu at io n began to ease at a bout 3 . 2 0 p m .

            My first       r e co ll ec ti on was seeing an a mb u la n ce            dri-s^e onto     the    pitch.

            There were masses          of    people on the             pitch.    There were     p eb<D 1 e lying on

            the    pitch    I d i d n ’t know     if they w e r e . u n c o n s c i o u s   or dead.    I saw      people

            being    given the kiss         of    life and having           there     chests    pumped.       There was

            1 was    in a state       of shock a nd disbelief at what had happened.

the    pub.

S u p p o r t e r s were q u e ueing         to get       into the        premises and those who

c o u l d n ’t get    in were      buying        cans of beer             from a nearby off-licence.

However,       at no time        did         I see any violence             from these supporters.                    At

approximately 2.55pm               (1455)       wit h most          (but not all)          of the Fo r e s t

supporters          having    left for          the ground,            my serial       made    its wa y to          take

up our     'Phase 2'         p o s i t i o n and meal           break at C l a y w h e e l s L a n e .        As we

were    passing the ground entrance                        opposite        the Pen i s t o n e R o a d / H e r r i e s

R o a d j u n c t i o n we we re d i r e c t e d      to go        into    the ground.          At that stage,

I was    not aware       of the        reason for our               instructions,          but a s s u m e d      there

was disorder          inside     the     ground.

O n e n t ering H i l l s b o r o u g h w i t h my serial,                I went      d i r ectly onto        the

pitch.        The    players were w a l k i n g off the                   pitch via the         players*

tunnel,       and    I could see m a n y            police o f f i c e r s      on the     pitch at         the

L e p p i n g s Lane end of       the g r o u n d .

I made my way di rectly to that end and                                         hat    point    1 lost        contact

wi t h most     of my serial.                1 saw that          f ^ w s ^ f n the L e p pings L ane          terrace

were    pressed hard up a g a i n s t               the    perimetex^Tence             to such a degree              that

the fence was bowing              o u t wards        under       the    pressure.        Police      o f f icers

were    trying       to lift     people        over       the    fence and onto the             pitch.         I saw

that    to the       right    of the         pen whe re the fans we re standi ng there was a

corridor about 2 y ards wide an d s u p p o r t e r s were a t t e m p t i n g                         to     climb

from the       pen into this           co r r ido r to es cape the               crush.        I saw that           once

in the     c o r r i d o r , these     fans were           r e maining whe re they were,                 as    if    in a

daze.      This had the effect                 of    preventing           others      escaping      into the
                                       /'b


corridor.           Access    a n tp r t/h^ j i t c h was a v a i l a b l e        from the       corridor          via

an open g a t e w a y , a i M I |el//abouJ,'pul 1 ing                     people onto the           pitch,

Eventually          I was able       t^/g^tr^into the               corridor and by pressing my knee

b e t w e e n the    palings     of the        pen fence,           fans were able            to use     it as a

step    up to       climb over       the      fence and          into     the   corridor.         I con t i n u e d
 doing this until the crush inside the pen seamed t-o ease.             1 remember

 seeing other officers on the pitch trying to pull away the perimeter

 mesh fencing but without success at that stage.

 On leaving the corridor         1 went on the playing surface? to see if there

 was anything I could do.          Only at this point did I realise there were

 fatalities when 1 saw four or five bodies          laying near to the g o a l s .

 Ambulancemen, Red Cross personnel and Police Officers were tending to

 injured fans and for a time I was at a loss what to do,             I saw police?

 officers and suppor ters using makeshift s £.ret cnfi-'-s to carry the

 injured to the Forest end of the ground and 1 gave a hana wi i h            this.

 An increasing number o f        Liverpool fans were now on the pitch and it          =

 was obvious that the Forest Fans at the other end had no idea what was

 happening.      They chanted football slogans etc and this incensed the

 Liverpool supporters who began making sporadic charges across the

 pitch towards the Kop.          We were ordered to f a>rm a cordon across the

                    these charges and for a while     I formed part of the

 cordon.

 The charges soon stopped,         and I saw a i                             on the

 pitch throwing punches at a man .they p/i                          I went to this

 incident and saw that they were assaulting            newspaper photographer

 who had apparently been taking photographs of the corpses.              I took him   -

 by the arm and led him to the Kop end of the pitch.             I clearly

 remember asking him what the hell he thought he was doing and him

 at the other end of the ground and returned to the Leppings Lane End.

 I sa%* another photographer being assaulted and I recognised him to be

couldn* t comprehend what                  I was       seeing.     The    effect was         like a hammer

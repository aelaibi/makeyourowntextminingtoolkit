                HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY

                          GARY CHURCH


In relation to the death of their son Gary, and the subsequent investigation,
Mr and Mrs Church have a number of points which they believe to be worthy
of consideration by Lord Justice Stuart Smith.




1      BBC VIDEOS

It is the contention of Mr and Mrs Church that the complete BBC coverage of
the events have NEVER been seen by the bereaved families. The Taylor
Inquiry and the Inquests saw a police compilation video. They therefore
request that the complete BBC video evidence be made available to view.




2      EVIDENCE OF IDENTIFYING OFFICERS

The evidence of the officers Webster and Haigh is confusing to Mr and Mrs
Church. Each officer identifies themselves from video and photographic
evidence as dealing with Gary. Yet there are discrepancies :

The first statement of Denis Webster refers mainly to his dealing with a young
male aged between 18 and 20 years. This person is described as wearing a
“red football jersey” and after assistance beginning “to breathe on his own
although his breaths were laboured”. Webster subsequently identifies himself
holding Gary whom he describes as wearing a “green top”. It would appear
that Webster is referring to two different bodies if it were not for the fact that
in his second statement he goes on to say :”l handled a number of other
deceased or injured but I have not been able to recognise them on the film I
have been shown”. As his first statement refers mainly to the young male
whom he refers to as wearing a red top it is reasonable to assume that he is
referring to Gary Church. Moreover his second statement identifies Gary as
the person he “did heart massage on...”. This adds further weight to the
suggestion that he is referring to the person in the red top as in his first
statement he says that he “pressed his chest”. There is no other indication in
the evidence of Webster that he carried out heart massage on any other
person.
Roger Haigh likewise refers to finding one of the injured “whose breathing
was very laboured”, Gary Church however appears to be a different youth
whom he refers to as “ a youth of about 16 years”.

It is the contention of Mr and Mrs Church that there are discrepancies in the
evidence of these two officers.




3      EVIDENCE OF DR. BULL


Mr and Mrs Church’s’ main question relating to Dr Bull is one which other families
have also asked:

How is it possible to pronounce 20 people dead in only 25 minutes?


In his statement Dr Bull says:

“ I performed a normal examination on each body and pronounced life extinct in turn”

Given that he pronounced life extinct in 20 cases in only 25 minutes yet carried out a “
normal examination on each body”, Mr and Mrs Church ask the question :

 Is it the case that the normal procedure for pronouncing life extinct takes only
one minute?




4      THE ROLE OF SUPERINTENDENT STANLEY
       BEECHEY

Mr and Mrs Church raise serious questions relating to the role of one of the West
Midland Police officers, Superintendent Beechey:


SERIOUS CRIME SQUAD

When the serious crime squad of the West Midlands Police was disbanded several
officers were suspended from duty whilst others were transferred. Superintendent
Beechey was one of those officers transferred. He was transferred to the Hillsborough
investigation.
Mr and Mrs Church ask the question:

Was it appropriate to appoint an officer who was part of a group whose activities
were under suspicion to an investigation of this sensitive nature?


THE CASE OF GEORGE TOMKINS
(See : George Tomkins -v- Richard Glennister. Stanley Beechev. Ernest
Robinson. Terence Mills, John Keith Barker & Joseph Griffin.

It would have been known to the West Midlands Police at the time that Beechey was
implicated in the case of George Tomkins who had spent eighteen months on an armed
robbery charge from which he was subsequently acquitted. Mr Tomkins alleged that
Beechey had been a prime mover in him being set up. He (Beechey), initially set him
up using a known informer of his and then further conspired to falsify statements.
George Tomkins took out a private prosecution against Beechey who was charged
with perverting the course of Justice. The case was eventually settled out of court and
Tomkins received a considerable sum of money.

Mr and Mrs Church ask the question:

Was it appropriate that this officer( who was known to have falsified evidence in
the past )had access to evidence that was to be submitted to the major inquiries
into the Hillsborough Disaster, namely evidence to Lord Justice Taylors’
Inquiry, evidence to the D.P P. and the inquests.

 LAST YEAR, BUT IT WAS OBVIOUSLY HANDLED BETTER LAST YEAR. THERE SEEMED TO BE

 MORE DEMAND FOR TICKETS THIS YEAR

 THE AUTHORITIES SEEMED SO CONCERNED IN H O P I N G THE FANS APART & NOT PAYING

 ENOUGH ATTENTION TO OTHER AREAS„ FOR EXAMPLE, CROWD CONTROL.

 ON MY WAY INTO THE GROUND I HEARD SEVERAL PEOPLE TELLING THE POLICE STANDING

 INSIDE THE TURNSTILES THAT THE CROWDS WERE BUILDING UP OUTSIDE & THAT

 SOMETHING SHOULD BE DON E«

 THERE WAS A TOTAL LACK OF STEWARDS.

 I BELIEVE THAT THE GATE SHOULD -HAVE BEEN O P E N E D   TO RELIEVE THE CRUSH OUTSIDE

 BUT POLICE OR STEWARDS SHOULD HAVE BLOCKED OFF THE TUNNEL & DIVERTED FANS TO

 "I£   EMPTY PENS EACH SIDE.

Dear Mr Wood,


Thank you for your letter of 7 August to Mr Bolton about the
conversion of Twickenham into an all-seater stadium.

You will recall that in his letter to you of 11 June 1990, Mr
Bolton explained that a fairly wide consultation exercise would
be necessary before a decision on the application to rugby
football clubs of Taylor's recommendations 1-4 could be made.

The matter is still under consideration, and it is hoped that we
will be able to put a submission to Ministers shortly.       The
submission will, of course, take account of the views of the
Rugby Football Union.



                                                                  Yours sincerely,




                                                                  D B WEBB

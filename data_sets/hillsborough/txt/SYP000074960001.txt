very    crowded but there a p p e a r e d to be ample                       room    in the    sections

either     side.     On reaching         the securi/^y fencing                 I saw that supporters

were    not    in fact      invading       the    a i'ic h    but were a ttempting            to escape          from

during this         I saw what a pp ea r e d to be people                    dying    or dead,       lying on

the    floor     b eneath the feet          of other          people.       These    bodies were          not at

the front        of the terraces           but a few yards              back    just to the S of the

goals.     Other      fans were         trampling      on the         bodies    in order      to   reach

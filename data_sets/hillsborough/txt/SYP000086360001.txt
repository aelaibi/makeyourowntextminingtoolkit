          There was          lots of         people     outs'vcle the        ground.                               and    I now

          tried      to stay together.                  It became 'i'R^r^ssingly crowded and                                          go

          sep a r a t e d   from                 and    I,        I than got          hold, of                coat    so that we

          wqu 1d not get s e p a r a t e d .                The    crowd    continued            to b u i 1d up and we were

          getting       crushed.             I began to get f r i g h t e n e d an d                I got     sep a r a t e d     from

                     and was          now alone        in the       crowd.

          As   the    crowd outside              began to build even more                    I      saw a small        boy        being

          passed overhead,                   b a c kwards now and then the                 crowd w o u l d move,          you

          w ou ld be jammed              tight and all             of a sudden you w o u l d all                 move     in the

          crowd and         change        position.           This was       i n v o l u n t a r y you      could not           do

          an y t h i n g about         it.      At    one    point a big fella                in front        of me      stood on

          top of my foot and                   I said to him,          "Your          s t a nding    on my foot,"            but

          although          the man knew             he was       standing       on my foot          he    could do       nothing

          about      it and he           could not move             his foot,          as the       crowd was        just       so

          packed together, I could hear                            people    shouting,              "Open the      gate"

          As   the    crowd got              nearer     tothe turns t i l e s           I was by now quite

     f r i g h t e n e d as a    result     of being            in this    crowd,        so tightly        packed.        Two

     men a c t u a l l y got       hold of me and sup p o r t e d me by propping me up and

     steering me thro u g h the                turniH^ile.          I gave       up my ticket as             I entered

     through the turnstile.                    It was       soXgacke^d outside               that    if you had
                                                                                                                              .
     f ain t e d    in the heat,         you      could not have           fallen over,             due to the        crowd

     complained to him about                   the    pne^ssure of the               crowd outside         but he      just

     told me he had to be where                      he was.

     1    made my way towards my seat and                        I saw th^t a large                 gate had been

     two t u r n s t i l e s , as    I entered            thro u g h the turnstile,              this    gate was       on

     my     left    side.

     I was      concerned as         I was        sep a r a t e d from the two              lads.     1 made my way

     my seat and by now              the game        had a l r e a d y started,              it must     have    been

     about 3 or 4 minu t e s             past 3 o ’clock.                            came   to the      stand and

     After a couple             of minu t e s      I saw someone a supporter                     run onto       the    pitch

     and     speak     to one     of the       players,         I can't        remember w h i c h       player,       I saw

     people        spilling      onto    the      pitch from the L e p p i n g s            Lane    end of the

     ground.          I saw a young man oh-^he                    playing are a wit h what a p p e a r e d              to

     a nd    the    players      left    the      field.

     As     I w a tc he d from my seat             I saw someone           it\iurekd being          carr i e d on a

                    It was        like a war          scene     inside      the gym.        I lost all         track        of    time

                   that afternoon.               I simply        could not         believe what was            happening.

                   I worked with different                     people,      I don't     know names,           of any of these

                   people.         I remember a girl              from Nottingham,            w hich       I think         is a nurse,

ihe took           off her j umpe r and            I saw that          she    had a N o t t i n g h a m Forest      T

shirt       on,      I think       there              also a Doctor           for N o t t i n g h a m there.

P e o p l e were      being    put        into a m b u l a n c e s    to be taken to hospital             the most

P e o pl e were walk i n g           around       in the gym,          some    in a daze,      I remember        one

man    crying,        who    just     did not know what                to do,     having     just    learned that

his    brother was           dead.         It was      difficult        to make      injured     people

c o m f o r t a b l e while    they are           lying on the fl o o r . L a t e r        in the a f t e r n o o n     I

saw two doctors              putting         drips     into    patients

in the gym.            The    drips        had a r ri ve d from         local     hospitals.         I do not

know the           names    of these         two doctors.

I did what           I could to help the                 injured       in the gym that afternoon,                   I

have    often w on d e r e d         if    I could       have    done more to help           people,

I    left     the gym at 4 ,40             pm.      I met             outside and E i l e e n McBM.de.              I

    tid t o            "There's           about 30 dead          in there."          We had      coffee and

and    I walked        ba c i-: to    the      car.

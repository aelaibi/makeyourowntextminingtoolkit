Police Policy Directorate                                       27 January 1997


Poiice Constable Bichard gave evidence to the coroner's inquest concerning the workings of the
camera on the day in question and his evidence can be seen in volume one of the documents
provided, at item four.

Police Constable Bichard told the coroner that whilst some pictures were available from the
camera in question they were of poor quality although the camera was in fact working.

There does seem to be some confusion about the video tapes and perhaps I can clarify the
position. Evidence given by Police Constable Bichard concerns the camera filming inside the
ground although, as I have previously mentioned, it was not working properly. Whilst it was
focused on the Leppings Lane end of the ground exclusively, the recorded material on the tape
enclosed is a compilation of a number of cameras situated around the ground. Several cameras
are used by control room personnel to scan the ground and its environs but only record footage
when transferred to certain monitors in the control room. It will be seen from the enclosed video
that footage from several cameras had been recorded on the day in question. Where the
reproduction is of poor quality then that is the camera trained on the Leppings Lane end of the
ground. For your information I have also included a video schedule of these particular tapes
which form the basis of a transcript of the film which was made available to Lord Justice Taylor's
inquiry. Please see section one in volume one.

The missing tape is a separate issue entirely. In addition to the police control centre within the
ground, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club also had a video recording facility and indeed had
their own recording suite. This was entirely under the supervision of Sheffield Wednesday
Football Club and the police had no control in its operation. During the night following the
disaster two video tapes went missing from that particular room.            Sheffield Wednesday
employees say that the room was locked and the alarm set. When they returned the next
morning the room was still locked with the alarm still armed. They did, however, discover that two
video tapes were missing. One of the tapes was of no use whatsoever due to the fact that
following building works around the ground the camera was trained on a brick wall. The other
tape was from a camera at a fixed point outside the playing area and was trained on the
turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end of the ground. As such it did not give a view of the terracing
or indeed any internal part of the ground.

Following the discovery of the theft the crime was recorded and West Midlands police officers
made enquires to trace the person responsible. To date that crime remains undetected. I hope
that clarifies the position concerning the video tapes.

A further point raised is the matter concerning the coroner imposing a 3.15 pm cut off point after
which he would not take any evidence. In volume one of the enclosed documents this issue is
explained in some detail,/Doctor Popper took evidence from, among others, Professor Usher,
Doctor Slater and Doctor Gumpet concerning the injuries to the deceased and their likely time of
remaining alive after the initial crush./ That evidence, coupled with Doctor Popper's own
observations of the disaster, led him to believe that 3.15 pm was an appropriate point at which to
call a clearly defined cut off time. It would be improper of me to comment on Doctor Popper's
decision other than to say, in view of all the circumstances, it would appear to have been the
correct course of action.

                  Mrs Ba rb ara Williams will                 say as follows;-



                  I am an A ss istant Ma tr on at the N o r t h e r n General                                          H o s p i t a l ? Sheffield.

                  My q ua li fications           are RGN,     CHSM»           I qua li fi ed S3 years ago.                                I have

                  w o r k e d at the N or th er n General Hospital                           for the                   last    17 years and

                  before that         I wo rk ed at the         Infirmary Hospital,                                     I. have   held the     post

                  of Ass is tant Matron for                 14 years.



                  I am m a n a g e r i a l l y   responsible      for the nursing                             staff           on 4 medical     wards

                  and various         other departments           such as              x~-ray and medical                         physics.       I

                  work day duty,, either morning                  or evening                    shifts,                including     the weekend

                  by rota.        When on duty at the w e e ke nd the Assistant Ma tr on                                             is

                  responsible         not only for her own wards                          but also for all                        the acute

                  services.
                                                                                              PAGE
                                                                                              S'1396



I was on duty on Saturday,                  IS April    1989.    I came on duty at          12.30

noon and took a handover                report from the Assistant Matron who                 had been

on morning       duty.    I       remained in my office,        w hich    is in the acute

services area,         and        did some paper work.



At some time after 3 .10               pm I received a call        from a male sw it ch b oa r d

ope ra tor stating        there       had been a ca.'l 1 from the         police who    had said

something       to the effect          that there      had been an accident at

H i l l s b o r o u g h and the    hospital    was on "stand b y . ”        I asked the operator

whether       he had   let the A & E D epatment            know and he said he had.                I

indicated       I would go to the A & L D e pa rt me nt .immediately.                   I did not

q u estion him any further about                the message as         it seemed obvious       he had

passed the entire message                  on to me as    received from the       police.          The

message       itself   did        not mean very much.       It was       not clear at this         stage

that    the    reference          to H il ls b o r o u g h was a reference to the football

ground and       I throught we might            be receiving      casualties     from a road

traffic accident.             Also,     the word    "stand by"     indicated nothing more

than that the hospital               might    be receiving      some     casualties.



I left my office and walked quickly to the A & feT Department.                               It is

quite a long way and               it probably took me about 3-S minutes.                   On the

w ay   1 called     in at the a dmissions           office w hich        is on Level   C,    the

floor    below A & E»             I. requested an up to date           bed state so that       I

could locate        the empty beds.            I was   given a piece of        paper with

details,      ward by ward,          of the empty beds from which I gathered there

were    quite a few u n oc cu pi ed beds wi th in the hospital.                  I then went

from the admis si on s            office   to the A & E Department.            One a mbulance          had

a l r e a d y arrived with one          casualty.      An ambulance man        came    into the

D epartm ent and said something                to the effect      "this     is a major

reacted to the words              "Major    disaster" and      boln unu*rslcoo             the Major

Di sa st er Plan should be effected.                 We ag re ed    between ourselves                that       I

w o u l d go down to the s witch bo ar d to give the a ppropriate                      instructions,

and Charge Nurse B a tt y would              prepare    the A & l~ Department              to    receive

casualties.



The s w it c hb oa rd    is on C Level,         below A & E, and          1 took     the    external

stair     case for      speed.      1 recall     there were      two operators         in the

t elephone       exchange and       3 a sked one of them,          a. man,    to    check that            the

Royal Hal lamshi re Hospital               were doing.      He got an immediate                 response

w h i c h was to the effect          they were      on "stand by".           A gain that         did not
  %
m ean very much to me,             but by this      time   i was    conscious        of ambulances

coming up the        hospital       drive    from B a r n s l e y Road.      1 decided that               if

the Ha'J. lamshi re Hospital          was also     on stand by there must              be a major

disaster and        1 made a conscious           d ec is io n to put the major Disaster

P lan    into oper ation at the N or th er n General.

1 think     the switchboard          operator was w o rr ie d about who w ould take

re sp on si b il i ty for that       decision.       I do not know how many a mbulances                         I

saw but     I was    just    conscious       that a lot was        happening.         The

s wi tc hb o ar d operator        indicated he w ould       commence the           cascade      system.

He a p pe a re d to know what         he was    doing.      1 a sked him for the                list of

te lephone       numbers    for    the senior nursing        staff and       1 installed myself

at one of the telephones ami began the                     cascade    system for the nursing

staff.      The Major Disaster Plan             provides for        the senior        nurse         on duty

contacting        several    key nursing       staff   to alert them of the Plan.                         1

te le ph o ne d Matron,     Miss Dando,        but got no     reply       (I learnt     later she

was     in her    car and on her way to the            hospital).          J was     conscious

that as     it was a w e e ke nd the wards were at mini mu m staffing                        levels and

I was anxious        to alert      senior    nurses    to manage      these areas.              1

t herefore      decided to       contact    the senior    nurses    for    w ira   6C ,    *n e a*r=    s,

to m an the orthopaedic            library    (where    the    volunteers are organised),

and to man the P h y s i o t h e r a p y Depa rt me nt    (where    the    less seriously

injured would be           located),       1 did not    have    very much success           in

telephoning and          I do not think       I got to the       bottom of the        list of

staff    in the     cascade,       1 was    conscious    of staff    phoning through to the

s w it c hb oa rd operator       to say they were       on their way to the           hospital.              I

was   still     t el ep honing    people when I                  larrived,     I decided to

e st ab li sh    what    progress was       being made and       I went up to A & E

Department,        Whe n   1 a r r iv ed the D epartment was        receiving a lot of

casualties,         I learnt      they had    received a J.ot of casualties,                 I was

i nformed by another          nurse manager      that ward 60 had been             prepared.

Ward 60     is an o rthopaedic ward on the same floor as the A & E

D e pa rt me nt and     is the    receiving ward for          patients    in any major

disaster.        As senior       nurse manager       on duty my brief was          not to get

involved w ith direct            patient    care but to       co-ordinate    the nursing

response,        1 had two       bleeps with me and       J. spent a lot of time             fielding

t elephone      calls,     1 was also anxious          to ensure a ppropriate

nurse staffing          levels and     1 a rr an ge d for nurses     to   come down from

various wards         to the A & F Department.            1 also a rr an ge d for          certain

equipment       to be brought       down to the A & E Department,             such as

sp hy gm om et er s and    cardiac arrest       drug trays.        This was all           done    in a

very short space          of time as the       pharmacist arrived to deal with drugs

an d staffing      levels were more          than adequate.

I was   not based        in any    particular    spot at this time and             i do not have

any   clear     r e co llection of the timing          involved.     "Ihe Unit General

and they both went          into the       control    room which    is in the O rthopaedic

Department,        I follo we d them       in and gave Miss Dando a brief                 report        of

         MR. FRASER:       G o o d morning, sir-         The first e v i d e n c e

therefore, a p p e a r on the usual b a s i s as t h e i r agent, sir.

          THE CORONER:         Good morning, Mrs. Nicol.             I am s o r r y we
had th e i n t e r l u d e b e f o r e we c ame to you r s o n ' s Inquest but
it is o b v i o u s l y important in e v e r y o n e ' s int e r e s t s that
p o i n t s be mad e as s o o n as possible.         It doesn't affect you
d i r e c t l y in any wa y and f o r g i v e me that we dealt with it
f ir s t •
            *

           If I can just d e s c r i b e for you what we intend to do so
that, you c a n have an idea of the procedure, in a moment I am
g o i n g to r e a d to you what I then did on I think t h e 19th
April w hen I o p e n e d the Inquest.                 I will r ead that to you
and w hen I have r e a d that to you I am g o i n g to tell you what
the b l o o d alcohol levels w ere b e c a u s e a l t h o u g h Lee did not,
in fact, die on t h e day w hen most p e o p l e did, the alcohol
levels w e r e s u b s e q u e n t l y m e a s u r e d a n d we kno w what t h e y were
so I will tell y ou so that you k now and so that the Jury
know.         Then we will listen to Dr- Holt, who is the
Pathologist, who will give us her account of the p a t h o l o g y
and Dr. A p p l e y a r d is in Court.               You p r o b a b l y know Dr.
A p p l e y a r d but. we don't and Dr. A p p l e y a r d is g oing to tell us
a little bit. about th e clinical aspect of Lee.                            When he h a s
f i n ished we will h a v e the p r e s e n t i n g O f f i c e r who will
present a s u m m a r y of the rest of the e v i d e n c e and p o s s i b l y
o v e r l a p with sorne of what we hav e heard.                     Finally, I n s pector
L a y t o n will come and describe, first of all, the visual
e v i d e n c e and d e m o n s t r a t e on t hese p l a n s what he ha s been
t a l k i n g a b o u t . When you h ear I n s p e c t o r La y t o n you may think
I am a bit c o n f u s e d and I don't k n o w what is going on
b e c a u s e he is r e f e r r i n g to all t h e s e plans, n u m b e r s and so
on.       It will b e c o m e c l e a r e r as s oon as he w a l k s r o u n d to
t h e s e plans.

          Apart from Dr. Holt and Dr. Appleyard, e v e r y b o d y has
a l r e a d y t aken the Oath a n d so the y won't be r e s w o r n but you
will h ear the Oath or Affirmation, d e p e n d i n g upon t h e i r
wishes, in respect of t h o s e two people.        Is that c l e a r ?

                        Q.   G o o d morning, Dr. Holt.                  Dr. Holt, w o u l d you be goo d e n o u g h

                             q u a l i f i c a t i o n s and p o s i t i o n ? - A. My name is S h i r l e y Holt.
                             My q u a l i f i c a t i o n s are MB, C H B , M D . I am a Consu l t a n t
                             H i s t o p a t h o l o g i s t at the N o r t h e r n General Hospital.

                    E   Q. Dr. Holt, the first thing I think we nee d to deal with is
                           that you are d e a l i n g with the post m o r t e m in r e l a t i o n to a
                           y o u n g s t e r k n o w n as Lee Nicol, is that r i g h t ? - A. Yes-

                        Q.   You have h e a r d he was iden t i f i e d to you by an Officer,
                             Mr- Burnlees, is that c o r r e c t ? - A. Yes, that is correct,
                             yes.

                        Q.   In your post m o r t e m report, if yo u w o u l d deal with the                   time
                             of death first, y o u have a c t u a l l y shown it as 18-4.89?                    -
                        A.   Yes.

                        Q.   Do y o u feel that is, in fact, c o r r e c t ? - A- Yes, this is the
                             tim e that the o r g a n s were r e m o v e d for t r a n s p l a n t a t i o n . I
                             have d i s c u s s e d t h i s with Dr- Neil A p p l e y a r d who was t r e a t i n g
                             the patient at the time and we feel that a more correct date
                             of death is the 17th of the 4th 1989, 2000 hours when b rain
                             d e a t h was declared.

                        Q.   In o t h e r words, the t i m i n g of o r g a n t r a n s p l a n t a t i o n . Do you
                             need the no t e s ?            Dr. Holt ought, to have the n otes in case
                             she w a n t s to r e f e r to them.         I t h i n k the organ
                             t r a n s p l a n t a t i o n took place at. about 2 am ? - A. Yes.

                        Q.   At 2000 hours, yes.       Are yo u q u i t e satisfied, Dr- Holt, that
                             the correct t i m i n g of d eath in a s i t u a t i o n such as t h i s is a
                    g        tim e when the b r a i n stern d eath c r i t e r i a a r e s a t i s f i e d r a t h e r
                             t ha n a time when the o r g a n s are t a k e n out ? - A. Yes, that is
                             correct.

                        Q. That      is the way that the p r a c t i c e           is in England,        isn't     it? -
                        A. That      is correct, yes-

                        Q. If you will now t u r n to the post m o r t e m proper, can you giv e

                           p a r t s of the post m o r t e m f i n d i n g s to support it p l e a s e ? -
                        A- The cause of death was cerebral a n o x i a due to t r a u m a t i c
                           asphyxia, acute b r o n c h i t i s and b r o n c h o p n e u m o n i a contributed.

                        Q. That      is u n d e r 2? - A. That         is u n d e r Part    2.

                        Q.   Can you h e l p me now what it (a) m e a n s and (b) what you did
                    D        a n d why you com e to that c o n c l u s i o n ? - A. At the tim e of the
                             accid e n t t h e r e was o b v i o u s l y a c r u s h i n g effect and the
                             c o n t e n t s of the s t o m a c h w ere inhaled.          This, of course, cut
                             o f f the ox y g e n s u p p l y to th e b r a i n and p e r m a n e n t l y d a m a g e d
                             the brain at that tim e r e s u l t i n g in b rain death.                  Following
                             this, the brain, of course, does swell.                        This is the
                             cerebral anoxia, cerebral swelling.                       Also the inha l a t i o n of
                    g        the stom a c h c o n t e n t s is h i g h l y irritant and this f a c i l i t a t e d
                             the d e v e l o p m e n t of a chest infection, a cute b r o n c h i t i s and
                             bronchopneumonia.

                        Q.   I t hink you did a c t u a l l y hav e a look at the b r a i n as one
                             w ould n o r m a l l y do? - A. That is correct, yes.

                        Q.   I b e l i e v e that you took the view, h a v i n g seen it, that that
                             b rain had been d a m a g e d for q u i t e som e t i m e ? - A- I took the

                                        On a p h o t o g r a p h r e f e r e n c e d NGN 1/63 this shows the

                              sir, that doesn't q u i t e mak e sense to me that paragraph.
                              C an you just give me a m o m e n t ?

                         Q.    Yes, I think it is r e f e r r i n g to .Jenkinson? - A. 1am sure it
                              is, sir. I just want to be a b s o l u t e l y sure-  That is    right,
                    jQ         s ir ,yes. If you want me to rea d it again, sir?'

                         Q.    Yes?'  - A.P h o t o g r a p h N G N 1 / 6 3 shows the O f f i c e r on the pitch

                              and, as you say, sir, it is PC Jenkinson.

                                    P h o t o g r a p h r e f e r e n c e d PR4/24 s hows Dr. H u t s o n t r e a t i n g
                              L ee on the pitch at 1519 h o u r s and Dr. H u t s o n has c o n f i r m e d
                              t his identification.

                                      P h o t o g r a p h r e f e r e n c e d P R 4 / 2 5 s h o w s Lee being p l a c e d on
                              a s t r e t c h e r by p e r s o n s inc l u d i n g A m b u l a n c e m a n Flack and that
                              photograph, sir, is t imed at 1521.

                                        I sh o u l d p e r h a p s add this, that in a d d i t i o n to the
                              a m b u l a n c e m a n and the Po l i c e O f f i c e r there was a t hird
                              person, an u n k n o w n supporter, who a lso a s s i s t e d to c arry him
                              a c r o s s the pitch.

                                    On a p h o t o g r a p h r e f e r e n c e d N G N 1 / 8 9 Lee is s h o w n about
                              to be placed into the a m b u l a n c e and that is at the. Spion Kop
                              e nd of the pitch.

                                   I think       it is fair to say, sir, in fact, that                        Lee was
                              one   of t h o s e for w h o m there are a large n u m b e r of
                              photographs.

                                        Can I r e f e r you to a pla n which has been g iven a
                              r e f e r e n c e nu m b e r K R N 1 which is the plan by PC Mar s h ?

                         Q. That will be C176. - A. You will s e e on that plan a slight
                            amendment.        O r i g i n a l l y the Officer thought he had taken Lee
                    H       t h r o u g h Gate No. 3 whereas, in fact, it was Gate No. 2 and
                            the plan has been amended.

                                                                        10

                        Q.    That    is right and the date o f the a m endment is 15-2-90, is
                              that    r i g h t ? - A. That is correct. A f a r t h e r p l a n MWJL1 1 1 - - -

                        A. That is right, sir, yes- (m o v e s to p l a n )

                        Q. W h e n we c o m e to demonstrate, I don't think there is any
                           n e e d for you to d e m o n s t r a t e all the eight. About three I
                           think just to show us the progression?' - A- Yes.

                                  THE CORONER:   Are you content w i t h that Mrs.                                   Nicol?

                                     MR.     FRASER:         Mrs.     Nicol       has s e e n all of them-

                                  THE CORONER:   It is sufficient, ladies and gentlemen,

                        Q. The r e v i s e d one?' - A. Yes, sir, the r e v i s e d one.           T h i s is
                           Gate 2 here, this point here (i ndi cat, i n g ) - That is his
                           first contact, as it were.                 In respect of MWJL110, there are

       MR.   FRASER:         No,    thank you,           sir-

       HR.   CATCHPOLE:            No,   thank you,         sir.

                                By THE C O R O N E R :

Dr. Appleyard, I h a v e n ’t p r e - w a r n e d you of this so if you
feel you cannot a n s w e r the question...           C o u l d you just come
d ow n for one more min u t e beca u s e a thought ha s o c c u r r e d to
me w hich a p p l i e s to Lee and, of course, a p p l i e s g e n e r a l l y
a nd that is this;        you have h e a r d about the timing.         What
was the tim i n g w h e n he was m oved 15 12 and give me Dr.
H u t s o n ' s time as well-

          INSPECTOR LAYTON:             It is 1512, and c e r t a i n l y on one of
the photographs.          C e r t a i n l y on p h o t o g r a p h P R 4 / 2 4 t imed at
1519 Dr. H u t s o n is s h o w n a p p a r e n t l y in the p r o c e s s of
a t t e m p t e d resuscitation.

You have h e a r d Dr. Hu t s o n took the v iew that it was too late
but he persisted.              In fact, he was right, of course, in the
event but he did the right, t h i n g at the time.                 What I am
interested in is this; we k n o w that Lee came to the hospital
and he c l e a r l y had a lot of medical input from the n u m b e r s
of p e o p l e who were involved.         You sai d he was m a k i n g
spa s m o d i c e f f o r t s initially and, in fact, there was a slight
r e s p o n s e from his pupil at one point and, of course, I take
it you were v e n t i l a t i n g him with the a p p r o p r i a t e a m o u n t s of
oxygen one c ould p o s s i b l y give in the c i r c u m s t a n c e s and yet
he died-         What I am interested in is that her e we hav e got a
lad and in a s ense n o t h i n g mor e c o u l d be d one for him,

                             c e r t a i n l y not in the hospital so far as v e n t i l a t i o n was
                             c o n c e r n e d and yet the b r a i n was damaged-                 Can you e x p l a i n
                             why that sh o u l d be?             Why it wasn't p o s s i b l e h a v i n g got air
                             into him at the hospital hi s b r a i n didn't r e c o v e r ? - A. Once

                           t e r m i n a l l y if the d a m a g e was      don e at the initial insult?       -
                        A- I   am    a s s u m i n g  the b r a i n swelling,       a l t h o u g h we tried
                           o b v i o u s l y to r e d u c e the b r a i n s w e l l i n g I think it isn't

                        Q-   Thank you.       It is not so much the element for Lee but it                                 1s
                             an i n t e r esting point in that you h a p p e n to be here and I

                                    MR-   FRASER:         No,     thank you,      sir-

                                       THE CORONER:       firs. Nicol, that is all the e v i d e n c e we
                             a r e g o i n g to take at this stage-              Lee is a n o t h e r one of
                             t h e s e pe o p l e who die d at H i l l s b o r o u g h who ha s had a great
                             deal of          publicity, as you will know b e t t e r tha n I d o -
                             W h e t h e r that is helpful or not, t h e              only p e r s o n who can
                             judge is you and so I will say n o t h i n g about that -

                                       What I w ould like to say two things, t h r e e                    things
                             really.              First of all, it was, as I sai d to Dr- Appleyard,
                             e x t r a o r d i n a r y sh o u l d have g i v e n an i n d i c a t i o n of what he
                             wan t e d done with his or g a n s b e c a u s e 14 y e a r olds don't
                    G        al w a y s think of that at the time-                  Secondly, you felt able
                             at the time to h o n o u r hi s wis h e s and, as we have alre a d y
                             heard, several p e o p l e are no doubt very thankful to you-
                             They may not know it was you but they are thankful to the
                             pe r s o n who had the g e n e r o s i t y to a g r e e to the organ
                             t r a n s p l a n t a t i o n and, of course, a l t h o u g h it cannot b r i n g
                             y o u r lad back to yo u that must, be a deg r e e of comfort at

                s ta t i o n e d at H a m m e r t o n Rd Police Station.

               On S a t u r d a y the     13th of April        1989    (130489)       I was    posted to the Poli ce

                control    box at H i l l s b o r o u g h football        Ground.

               At about     10.00am        (1000)    the same day         I loaded two V HS recorders in the

               Control     Box w it h       f resh tapes?     for the P ol ic e CC/TV.

               At the same time             1 set the data base on the recorders,                       1did this by

               m y watch.

               The first two tapes were               running      until     (1)    just after 3 . 0 0 p m          (1500)

               and the other until            about 3.33 pm           (1333)    because       it went      into e xt e nd e d

               time    lapse,,     1 then    removed these a nd           repl ac ed them w i t h two              fresh

               tapes w hi ch       ran until     about 3.30pm          (1730)      w h e n I removed them and               I

               m a r k e d the tapes        TB1 - TB4.

               At a bout    11.30pm         (£330)   the same day 1 gave the tapes TB1,                     TBZrTBS and
                                                                                                               SSSP

              T he   reason one of the taper? went                into e xt e nd e d time    lapse     i& that      I

It was d ecided that                  the best    posit io n w o u ld be above             *8'   gate.        This

A short time             later       it was      d is co v e r e d that some of the P e n i st o ne R oa d

the      coach was        checked by one of the m o bi le serials.                       A r o u n d 2 .20pm

 (1420)      the ACC J A C K S O N was        in the       control      box when he n ot i ce d a m an on

began fooling about.                  His    behaviou r was such that                it was     beli ev ed that

he was drunk and the ACC a s k e d for s om et hi ng                        to be done a bout            him.       I

set    the       camera to m on it or        his    behaviour.         About 2 . 1 5 p m     (1413)     all      the

a l t h o u g h the L e p p in gs Lane terrace was                  filling up at a normal               rate.

Just after          this    the     personal       radio t r a n s m is s io n s    became w orse and the

c i v i l ia n    radio    repair man        came     into    the    control       box to a t te m p t a

A bout 2.30pm            (1430)    my a t t e n t i o n was    drawn to the          large    crowd outside

Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t D U C K E N F I E L D a s k e d about     the     large    crowd and        it

was said that a l t h ou gh            it was more than normal,                    it was    no more      than

was e xpected for such a football                       match.

About 2 .35pm         (1433)      the civilia n radio               repair man s tated that he                could

I remember        seeing an Of fi ce r        on the      top of the turn st il es at Leppi ng s

Lane     end and Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t D U C K E N F I E L D made e nq ui ri es as to the

S u p e r i n t e n d e n t MARSHALL,   his voice was          very distressed,           ’Y ou must       open

the gates,        open the gates. *          Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t    DUCKENK 1EL..D seemed

to pause for thought and then said                       "Right      if lives are at         risk,       then

possible       rush onto         the    pitch.       It was at this              time that we          began to

notice Liverpool              fans     climbing      up into       the West S ta nd from the terrace

area.      They w ere a s s i s t e d by people              in the stand and the same                    problem

had. occ ur re d the          previous year.           A short        time       later    fans were       seen to

climb the          perimeter      track fence.           O f f i c er s    on the track s e em ed to be

telling       the fans to get down from the fence.                               At this       point    the staff

in the     control        box and      I thought       that     the       s i tu at io n was     purely public

order.        No    i nf or ma ti on was      coining in to the              effect      that    people were

gett i ng h u r t „

A crowd ga th er ed on the                 perimeter     track and Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t

DUCKENF 1ELD o rd e r e d that they shou ld be m o v e d as q ui ck ly as                               possible

to the wing          sections        of Le pp in gs Lane        terrace where             it

could be seen that              there was        space.       Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t DUCKENF f.ELD

was a n gr y a bout O f f i c e r s stood around, the                     track near       to the K op and

the N orth Stand.             A personal         radio m es s ag e was sent to the offi ce rs

and. they were d i r e ct ed to the front                   of the N o r th Stand.               A r o u n d this

time Chief          Inspector MCR0.8BIH was             sent to the              pitch to get things

s or te d out.         One   problem was a WPC stood on perimeter                              track   just   below

the   control        box.      she did not a ppear            to be m ov in g          people     off the track

and   in fact at one            stage       o pened the     perimeter            gate to the        track then

w a l k e d off     leaving the gate open.                C hief      Inspector MC R 0 B 8 I E         took

charge     of the P o l i c e w o m a n and         b egan ushe ri ng         people      from the track.

By this       time there were              people    on the     pitch a n d        the p erimeter         track

gates were          open a l l o w i n g    people out of the              centre      pens.      Still    at this

stage no one           in the     control      box was a ware             that   the     prob le m was more

to concentrate               on o perating        the VHF     radio      rather than the           camera

system.          V ery su dd en ly        it became a p p a r en t       that there were           injuries and

at that time             I c ontacted O pe r a t i o n s R o o m for a m bu l a n c e s      to be sent to

the L eppings Lane                end of the ground.              There were        people all          over the

pitch       in front         of the goal mouth,            persons were          laid a c ro s s    the floor

with     persons giving m o ut h to mouth.                      It was       only then that we            began to

feel     that there might                be deaths.        A personal         radio m es s ag e was        sent

to control asking                 for    bolt    cutters and S e r g e an t GO D D A R D     cont ac te d

C l a yw he el s Lane asking              if they had cutters on the bri- mac

transporter.                The   reply was       negative.        He turn ed to me and             1 told him

that     I w ould       contact         the fire     service w h i c h       I did via O p e r a t i o n s Room.

1 made         it clear that we            required      cutting       e quipment     for the metal

fences.          I remember         someone       i nstr uc ti ng PC R Y A N to use the t an no y

t elling        people       to stay calm.           1 can remember seeing              bodies      being m oved

towards the tunnel                 on    the Lep p in g s Lane t er ra ce from the               centre     pens.

) believe            that    it was Police O f f i ce r s who were m oving                 the     bodies      from

the area.             L iverpool        fans who were       on the       pitch star te d to         run towards

the Kop,             Officer?, m a n a g e d to stop the            charge and split up several

groups of fans who were                    fighting.        A line of O ff ic er s were             then f or me d

a cr os s      the    pitch just         the K op side      of the       centre    line.     1 recall          the

fire service ar ri vi ng at L e p p in gs Lane and their m en running                                   onto    the

pitch.          I. then sent a message              to O p e r a t i o n s   that we did have

f atalities at              the ground a l t h o u g h w h e n     I sent      this m e ss ag e     no details

something            to the effect that we need as m an y as                      possible.        Traffic

made a request               for the senior a m b u l a n c e        o ff icer to a t te n d the         control

It was about      this time that          things    became    busy and       the disaster       began

to unfold.       There was a       Lot of noise       in the Police          box and from

outside and      )' became     busy using     the VHF       radio which       I wo ul d normally

only monitor and at the same time                  trying    to monitor what was going

on,    both on the      screens and outside         the   control     box.

t   do not   recall     Chief    Inspector MC R 0 8 8 I E    coming back       into    the control

box but      certainly about       this time our ACC Mr JA CKS ON              came    into the

box.     Mr J AC KSO N a nd Mr DUCKENF .tELD had a conversation a nd the only

points    1 can recall are to do with getting                  op eration support, and to do

with the     public order       situation with        crowds    coming onto the             pitch from

the    rear of the     cantilever stand        (North)       as there are       no fences there.

Ce r t a i n l y I heard no me nti on during this            conversation of any gates

being opened.

Som et im e after Mr JACKSON         cariie into tLie control          box,    Mr Gra ha m KELLY

from the FA and Mr MACK. RE LI..., the Club Secretary,                  came    into the box, as

I recall     it they were       in the area        by the door.        1 can't    remember

anyone    else   being with them.          Mr K E L L Y then had a conv er sat ion with

Chief Superintendent, DUCKHNr 1EL D and during-, the                   course    of that

conversation      I recall      him saying    to the effect           that a gate       had been

forced and there had been an              :i.n rush of Liverpool         supporters          .into the

ground.      I cannot    now remember any other specifics                 of their

con versation so        far as     I am    concerned when Mr DUG KENT- XEL..Dwas talking

to Mr KELLY about        this    gate being forced he was             relating        the

ci rcu.riista.nces a

When   the   concertina gate C was          opened for the first, time                for what    I

now know to be an eje ction by the Police,                   and   1 saw nothing            untoward

in him saying that.

            Chief S up er in ten de nt    D UC KL NF 1E LD S   instructions.     That did not      take

            place and fur th er mor e      it would have         been    impossible because      unknown to

            me one of the tapes          had    run out and the other would have           needed to be

            stopped,      rewound,   in order to find the           relevant    part and given the

            circumstances      this was        not   possible.     It would also have      been shown as

            an interuption on the data pack on the film.                      What   I now believe might

            have happened      is that No        1 Monitor which was         showing   scenes    of the

            Lep pings Lane     turnstile area would also                show Gate C.   This would have

            been   in black and white as the only                colour monitor was      the    central

            one,   number three.

              I qualified       in medici ne from the U n i v e r s i t y of Oxford,             and was award ed

              the degrees       of B MBC h and MA        (Physiology)           in 1975    (000075).      In 1979

              (0000/9)     I became a Fello w of the F a cul ty of Anaest he tis ts                     of the

              Raya'J College      of Surgeons.

              1 was ap p o i n t e d Consu lta nt anaes th eti st          at the N o r t h e rn General

              Hospital     in March       1985     (000085).      On the we ek - e n d      including     13 April

              1989    (150489),     1 was     the Consultant An ae sthetist                on call   for the

              N o r t h e r n fjeneral Hospital.

              At about 3 .40      pm     (1540)    on Sa tu rd ay     15 April      (150489)    I received a

              telepho ne    call at homes          "Please at te n d Cas ua lt y          immediately."     At

              about 4 pm       (160fJ)    1 a rr ive d    at the entrance           of the A & ti department.

              There   I spoke     to Mr WAR DR OP E       (Consultant           in A & E Medicine)      who asked

              me to supervise the           res uscitation areas.

              About   fifteen     patients were          in the      resusc it at io n areas at this time.
                                                                                                   S3253

All    had at   least     one    person    in att en da nc e      I began to make a quick

assessm ent     of the     patients,       starting       in the    resusciation       room,       where

two    patients had been          intubated and were             under the    care of

an aes the tis ts    (Dr E WALKER and Dr F Y LAM).

Soon after my arrival             two more an ae st het ist s arrived,            Dr C COOPER and

Dr R QUARTLEY.          They took over the managem ent                of individual          patients.

I spoke to Mr DUNC AN            (Senior Registrar             in Surgery)    and as ke d him to

assess    the   patients        to see    if any needed urgent surgery.                None did.

At about 4 .1 5      pm (1615)      Dr G CLARK          (Consultant anaes th et is t         for the

Intensive Tr eatment Unit               (HU))     ar ri ve d    in the A & E- department.             I

asked him to organise             the    ITU for the       reception of v en til at ed         patients.

At this    stage a number          of patients were             being ventilated.        Others were

showing signs of cerebral                irritation;       they were agi ta te d and          restless.

I visited ward 60 to assess                the    patients      there.     Dr J STOCK Consultant

Anaes the tis t arrive d between 4.15                  (1613)   and 4.30,(1630)        and    I asked

him to stay an Ward 60.

The transfer        of ve nti la ted      patients       from A & t! to the       ITU was      now

underway I. kept Dr CLARK,               on the    ITU,    informed of the situ at ion              in the

A & l£ department and ward 60.                   I returned      to Ward 60,     and

an ae st he ti se d and    intubated two          patients there,        and left them in the

care of junior anaesthetists.                    All    patients    from Ward 60 su bse quently

survived.

By about 5.1 5 pm (1715)           a 3 1 the      patients      from the     res usc ita tio n areas

has been tr an sfe rre d to the            I T U ’s at the No rt h e rn General        Hospital

or were awa iting         transfer       to the Royal Hal la ms hi re Hospital.                I

visited the two         intensive       treatment       units and at this        stage       each

patient    had at     least one an aes the tis t           in attendance.

I remained at the hospital                until about S p m , (2000)         when   I left for

home.

No    patient under my direct             clinical       care was among       the deceased.

             I was bleeped by sw it chb oa rd at                1355      (1555)       approx,              declaring     that a

            major       catastrophe       had taken place           (I was       in Theatre at the                   time).

             I went     to the Ana est het ic Office and                 rang Drs SHAW and COOPER,                          the

            Consult ant         and Senior Registrar           on call,          respectively,                 (Dr SHA W had

            On arrival          to A&E Resus Room,         there was          only one                   patient   there,    in the

            bed furthest          from the front entrance.                  He was a teenager                      (Lee

            NICOL)
                                                                                  S33S1




During this tame a male         patient ar r i v e d    into Resus Room,   with three to

four    doctors.     He was   put onto the bed to our          right.




                                                         I left the other Doctors         to

continue with the Resus while            I returned to Lee.




I left Lee    to be moni to re d by the sister and went            next door   to assist

with another       male   patient.




                                                                           He settled

patient with a Nurse and         came    back to Lee,

The    surgeons ar ri ve d and examined him




                               There were      no   patients   in the Resus Room.     I

found. Dr TE HA N with a female         patient     <                   in one of the

             I transferred                   after a. bed was made available.               1 handed the

             patient over       to Dr                m    CICU and went back to the A&G Dept

             An elderly female          patient arrive d          into Resus Room

             I took no part       in her     resus,       since   there were a lr ea dy four doctors

             a r ou nd her    including an Anaesthetist.

             1 am a registered general Nurse and                            registered mental      nurse.     I

             qua lified      in 1983      (000083)      at Sheffield,               and have work ed at the

             No rt h e r n General Hospital            for the         past two years.

             On Sa turday       15th April       1989      (1150489)         I was working      in the Ac cident and

             E m e rg en cy D ep ar tm en t at, the No rt h e rn General.                  I started work at, 12.

             30 hour?      (1230).       At 3pm      (1500)         1 went for a meal          break and    shortly

             afterwards        sometime around 3 . 1 0 / 3 . 13pm               (1510)/(1515).       I could hear

             sirens.       1 obvi ou sl y       wo nd e r e d what was going on I soon became aware

             that there was a paediatric                  cardiac arrest              on    route to the hospital.

             There was an a m b u l a n c e m a n      crew parked outside A S E and via them and

             their    radio     I became aware that, something was                         happening at the

             H i l l s b o r o u g h football   ground and that              they were       requesting more

             ambulances.         I d i d n ’t know exactly what was happening.

             Charge Nurse BATTY started to open the                           cupboards       for the majax
                                                                                            S 3229

equipment just        in case they were       required.

1 tele phoned the        canteen to get any       casualty staff that were there

back off their        break    in case   their assist anc e was       required.

1 returned to the         resusc it ati on    room and saw that a second            patient had

arrived.      There were al r ea dy staff dealing with the first                  patient,         a

young   boy, who had a rr iv ed         prior to me making      the telephone        call.

The second     patient was a white male,           aged a p p r o x i m a t e l y twelve    (12)       to

thi rteen    <13) years       of age.    He had mou se y    coloured hair and of

average     build.     He was w earing a red Liverpool F„C„              T-Shirt,     a pair of

jeans and training         shoes.




                                                                                  Mr WAR DROPE

the   consultant      in Ac cident and Em e r g en cy medicin e ap pr oa ch ed the

doctor whom     1 wa«. working with and enq uiried as to what                  treatement          the

patient had received.           He was    informed as to exactly what had occurred

and. a decision was made          to di s cont :inue the treatment.

The   patient whose      identific ati on     1 don't   know was      removed from the

resusc ita tio n     room by the     porter]______    1 d o n ’t know his surname,            and

the student nurse        to the     plaster   room.

At this     point    1 was approached      by charge Nurse BA'fl Y who          instructed me

to go to the        'Dirty Theatre''.      This   is a theatre      used for the           less
                                                                                           S3229

clean minor operations.

Upon arrival    at the dirty theatre            I saw a p p r o x i m a t e l y half a doyen

people whom I w ou ld describe as walki ng wounded.                   J. ac co m p a n i e d them

to an area known as       the   returns    clinic and       left them there        because we

required the    re su sc it ati on    points    in the D ir ty Theatre.

I returned to dirty theatre and saw that                 there were al rea dy two           <2)

patients on trolleys a lr ea dy there.

I made a visual     assessm ent       and ob viously dealt with the            patient that

in my opinion ap pea r ed more         distressed.       This was a white male,             aged

around fourteen     <14) years        of age.     He had    light br ow n/b lo nd h a i r . He

was wearing a red Liverpool            FC T-shirt,     a pair of jeans and a pair of

trainers.




I turned the    patient    onto his side and. left him with the                 student nurse.

I then went    to the   second       patient.     He was a white male,          a pp rox ima tel y

20 years.     lie had ginger hair.         He was wearing a pair of jeans and

only had one training shoe on.             He wasn't wearing a top.




Two other    patients   had. been brought         into the    room but there was

nursing staff a lr ea d y with them.            I as si st ed with these      patients who

were    bath conscious.

I was    joined by Dr Dorcas HGAP

                           I had dealt with         in the dirty theatre.             An

a na est het is t and an O.D.A.       (operating    department assistant)           arrived.
                                                                                                  S322.9

             They ad mi ni s t e re d




             1 had no further dealing with these                patients   or any others.




             I do not know the          names of the anaesthetist,         O.D.A.   or Student    nurses

             that assist ed me.

            I qualified       in medicine          from the U ni ve rs it y of Oxford,          and was awarded

            the degrees of BMRCh and MA                  (Physiology)         in 1973     (000073).       In 1979

            <000079)    I became a Fellow oF the Facul ty of An ae sthetists                           of the

           R o y a 3 College      o f S u rq e o ns .

            1 was appoi nt ed Consultant                anaesthetist at the No rthern General

           Hospital     in March         1985      (000083).      On the week-e nd         including      13 April

            •1989 (130489),        1 was      the Consultant Anaesthetist                on call   for     the

           Nor thern General Hospital.

           At about 3.40          pm    (1340)      on Saturday        13 April      (130489)   I received a

            telephone       call at homes           "Please attend Cas ualty            immediately."        At

           about 4 pm <1600)             1 arrived        at the entrance of the A & F department.

           There   I spoke        to Mr WA RDROPE         (Consultant        in A & E Medicine)          who asked

           me to supervise             the   resuscitation areas.

           About, fifteen         patients were          in the    resuscitation areas at this time.
All    had at   least    one    person    in attendance          I .began to make a quick

a ssessment     of the     patients,      starting       in the    resustiatioii room,           where

two    patients      had been    intubated and were under               the care of

an aes the ti st s    (Dr L WALKLR and Dr I- Y LAM).

Soon after my arrival            two more an ae sthetists arrived,              Dr C COOPER and

Dr R QUART!...EY»        They took over         the management       of individual         patients.

I spoke to Mr DUNCA N           (Senior Registrar          in Surgery)       and asked him to

assess    the   patients       to see    if any needed urgent surgery.               None did.

At about 4 .15        pm (1615)    Dr G CLARK          (Consultant ana esthetist           for the

Intensive Treatment Unit              ( 11U ) ) arrive d       in the A & fr department.            I

asked him to organise           the     ITU for the       reception of venti la ted          patients.

At this    stage a number         of patients were             being ventilated.       Others were

showing    signs      of cerebral       irritation;       they were agitated and restless.

I visited ward 60 to assess               the    patients      there.      Dr J STOCK Consultant

An aes thetist arrived between 4=15                   (1615)   and 4.30,(1630)       and    I asked

him to stay on Ward 60.

The transfer         of ventilated       patients       from A & [■' to the     ITU was      now

underway      I kept Dr CLARK,          on the    ITU,    informed of the situation               in the

A & E department and ward 60„                   1 returned to Ward 60,         and

an ae st he ti sed and    intubated two          patients there,        and. left    them in the

care of junior a n a e s t h e t i s t s .      All   patients    from Ward 60 subsequently

s ur vivsd.

By about 5.1!i> pm       (1715)   a J 1 the      patients      frorn the   re su scitation areas

has been transfe rr ed to the             ITU's at the No rthern General              Hospital

or were awaiting         transfer     to the Royal Hal .lamshi re Hospital.                  I

visited the two        intensive      treatment        units and at this       stage       each

patient, had at       least, one an ae sthetist           in attendance.

I remained at, the hospital             until about, 8 pm, (2000)           when    I left, for

home »

            S EQ UE NC E OF EVEN TS ON SAT    15TH APRII.. 1989             (150489).

            I was    bleeped by switchbo ard at        1355      (1555)      approx,    declaring   that a

            major    catastrophe      had taken place      (I was          in Theatre at the time).

            I went to the Anaesth eti c Office and               rang Drs SHAW and COOPER,            the

            Consultant and Senior Registrar            on call,        respectively,       (Dr SHAW had

            already    left)    before   proceeding    to Accident and Emerg enc y            (A&E).

            On arrival       to A&H! Resus Room,     there was       only one      patient   there,    in the

            bed furthest       from the front entrance.            He was a teenager         (Lee

            NICOL)
During   this time a male       patient, a r ri ve d   into Resus Room,   with three to

four doctors.     He was     put onto the bed to our          right.




                                                         I. left the other Doctors          to

continue with the Resus while           I returned, to Lee.




I left Lee   to be mo n i t o re d   by the sister and went       next door   to assist

with another rna.3e patient,,




                                                                          He settled

almost   immediately and      I gave him                                  left   this

patient with a Nurse and came          back    to Lee.




                             There were       no   patients   in the Resus Room.        I

found Dr TEH AIM with a female        patient                          in one of the

A&E   cubicles
                                                                                                      S3321




            1 t r an sf er re d              after a bed was made available.                I h anded the

            patient     over to Dr                 in C1CU ?nd went           back to the A&E Dept

           An e lderly female         patient, ar ri ve d      into Resus Room

            I took no part        in her     resus,    since     there were a l re a d y four doctors

           a r o u n d her    including an Anaesthetist.

           I stayed in A & E until approx                 1745    (1745),      [ was not   required to

           take    part      in a ny more    resus.

           1 left and went to General               1CU where Dr S HA W sent me off           to   rest,

           since      I was    on c:aj. 1 for the     rest of the weekend.

           1 took no subsequent,            part   in the m a n a ge m en t   of any of the     patients on

           G ICU or CICU.

              I am a registered general                 Nurse and            r eg istered mental          nurse.    I

              q u alified     in "1983     C000083)       at Sheffield?                  and have w or ke d at the

              N o r t h e r n General Hospital          for    the       past     two years.

              O n S a t u rd ay    15th April     '1989 ( 150489 ) 1 was working                      in the Accid en t and

              E m e r g e n c y D e pa rt me nt at the N or t h e r n General.                  I s t ar te d work at   12.

              3 0 hours     (1230).        At 3pm     (ISOLD         1 went for a meal              break and shortly

              a fterwards         sometime a round 3 . 1 0 / 3 . 13pm               (1510)/(1315).          1 could hear

              sirens.       1 o b v i ou sl y    w ondered what was going                       on I soon became aware

              that there was a paediatric                  cardiac arrest                  on    route to the hospital.

              There was a n a m b u l a n c e m a n     crew parked outside A & L and via them and

              their    radio       I became aware that some th in g was happening at the

              H i l l s b o r o u g h football   ground and that                they were         requesting more

              aihbuiances.          I d i d n ’t know exactly what was happening.

              C harge Nurse BATTY started to open the                             cupboards        for the majax
equipment       just    in case      they were        required.

i telephoned, the          canteen to get any             casualty staff       that were      there

back off       their    break     in case their a s s i st a nc e was        required.

'it returned, to the re su sc it at io n room and saw that, a second                       patient               had

arrived.        f'here were al re ad y staff dealing with the first                      patient,                a

young    boy., who      had ar ri ve d      prior to me m ak in g the t elephone            call.

The second       patient was a white male,                aged a p p r o x i m a t e l y twelve     (12)             to

th ir te en    (13) years       of age.        He had m o u s e y   coloured hair and of

average       build.     He was wearing a red Liver po ol               F.C.    T-Shirt,     a pair of

jeans and training            shoes.

He was    cyanosed        (blue    in colour).          He had fixed dila te d pupils.




                                                                                         Mr W A RD RO PL

the   consultant        in Accident and E m e r g e n c y m ed ic in e a p pr o a c h e d the

doctor whom       1 was w orking with and e nq ui ri ed as to what                    t reatement                the

patient    had received.            He was      informed as to e xa ctly what           bad occurred

arid a de ci si on was made to disc on ti nu e the treatment.

The   patient whose         i d e n ti fi ca ti o n   J. don't know was      removed from the

re susci ta ti on      room by the       porter               1 don't, know his surname,                and

the student       nurse to the         plaster        room.

At this       point    1 was a pproached         by charge Nurse BAT"i Y who           instructed me

to go to the          'Dirty Theatre'.           This    is a theatre used for the            less




                                                                                                  D A * “„ L r

U pon arrival        at   the dirty theatre           I saw a p p r o x i m a t e l y half a do?en

people whom         I w ou ld describe as walki ng wounded.,                i. a c c o m p a n i e d them

to an area known as                the   returns   clinic and       left them there       because we

required the         re su sc it at io n    points    in the D irty Theatre,

1 returned to dirty theatre and saw that there were a lr e ad y two                                 (2)

patients on trolleys a lr e a d y there,

1 made a visual asses sm en t and o bv io u sl y dealt with the patient that

in my opinion a p p e a r e d more distressed.                 Phis was a white male,              aged

a r ou n d   f ourte en   (14) years        of age.     He had     light   b ro wn / bl o nd hair.        He

was w earing a red Liverpool                 FC T-shirt,      a pair of jeans and a pair of

t ra ine r s .




I turned the         patient       onto his side, an d      left    him w it h the student           nurse.

I then went        to the     second       patient.     He was a white male,          a p pr o x i m a t e l y

20 years.         lie had ginger         hair.     He was wearing a pair of jeans and

only had one training               shoe on.       He w a s n ’t w ea ring a top.




Two other        patients     had. been brought         into the     room but there was

nursing staff a lr e a d y with them,                 I a s s i s te d with these    patients who

were    both     cons c i ctus .

I was joined by Dr Dorcas HGAP

                                                                                                                  PArx;       P
All    had at      least, one        person in a t t e nd a nc e      I began to make a quick

a s s es sm en t   of the         patients,    starting       in the    r es us c ia t io n   room,       where

two    patients        had been        intubated and were under              the     care of

anaesthetists            (Dr L WALKk-R and Dr I- Y LAM).

S oon after my arrival                 two more a n a e s th e ti s ts arrived,          Dr C COOPER and

Dr R QUAHTLEY.                  They took over the m an ag e me n t          of individual          patients.

1 spoke to Mr D U N C A N            (Senior R egis tr ar        in Surgery)        and asked him to

a ssess      the   patients         to see    if any need ed urgent surgery.                  None did.

At about 4.15           pm (1613)        Dr G CLARK         (Consultant a na es th e ti s t         for the

Intensive Tre at me nt Unit                 (HU))     arrived       in the A & £-' department.               I

a s ke d him to organise              the    ITU for the       rece pt io n of v e nt i l a t e d     patients.

At this stage a number                  of patients were            being ventilated.           Others were

showing       signs of cerebral              irritation;       they were a g i t a t e d and         restless.

I visited ward 60 to assess                    the    patients there.          Dr J STOCK Consultant

A na es th et is t a rr i v e d b etween 4.15              (1615)   and 4.30,(1630)           and    I asked

him to stay on War d 60.

"Ihe transfer         of v en ti l a t e d    patients       from A & U to the           ITU was      now

underway       I kept Dr CLARK,              on the    ITU,    informed of the s i t u at i on in the

A & l£ department and ward 60.                       I returned      to W ar d 60,      and

a n a e s t h e t i s e d and    intubated two        patients      there,    and    left     them i.n the

care of junior a naesthetists .                      All   patients     from Ward 60 s ub se qu e nt l y

survived.

By about 5,1.3 pin (1? 13) a) i the                   patients from the            r es u sc i ta t io n areas

or were awa it in g transfer                 to the Royal       H al la m sh i re Hospital.           I

visited the two            intensive         treatment      units and at this           stage       each

patient      had at       least one anaest he t is t           in attendance.

I remained at the hospital                    until about 8 p m ,(H D O O ) w he n I left for

home.

No patient         under my direft            clinical      care was among the deceased.

                I was     bleeped       by s w it ch bo ar d at         1355     (1*555) approx,           decl ar in g that a

                m aj or   catastrophe          had taken place             (I was        in Theatre at the time).

                I went        to the A n a e s t he ti c Office and              rang Drs SHAW and COOPER,                  the

                Co ns u lt an t      and S enior R egistr ar            on call,         respectively,           (Dr S H A W had

                On arrival           to A&E Resus Room,              there was      only one         patient, there,          in the

                bed furthest           from the front entrance.                   He was a teenager                (Lee

D ur in g   this   time a male   patient ar ri v ed   into Resus Room,   w it h three    to

continue w ith the Resus while           l returned to Lee.

patient with a Nurse and came            back to Lee.

            that there was a paediatric                   cardiac arrest          on    route to the hospital.

            There* was an a m b u l a n c e m a n     crew parked outside A & l~ and via them and

back off their            break     in case      their a s s is t an c e was   required.

!i returned, to the            r es us ci ta ti on   room and saw that a. seco nd          patient, had

arrived.          There were a l r e a d y staff          dealing with the first          patient,        a

y ou ng   boy,     who    had a r r i v e d   prior to me m aking        the telephone       call.

The second         patient was a white male,                a ge d a p p r o k ima'te 1y twelve   (18)        to

t hi r te e n    (13) years       of age.        He had m ousey     coloured hair and of

aver ag e       build.     Me was wearing a red L iverpool                F.C.   T-Shirt,    a pair of

jeans and training              shoes.

He was       cyanosed       (blue    in colour).          He had fixed dilated         pupils.       He




                                                                                         Mr W A KD RO PL

the    consultant         in Accident a nd E me r g e n c y m ed ic in e a p p r o a c h e d the

doctor whom         1 was working with and e nq ui r ie d as to what                  treatement          the

patient      had received.           He was      informed as to exactly what had occurred

and a d ecision was made               to discontinue         the treatment.

The    patient whose          identif ic at i on     1 don't     know was      removed from the

resusci ta ti on         room by the      porter              1 d o n ’t know his surname,         and

the student nurse             to the     plaster     room.

At    this   point       1 was a pproach ed by charge Nurse B ATTY who                 instructed me

to go to the         ’D irty T h e a t r e ’ .     This   is a theatre      used for the      less
clean minor        operations.

Upon arrival        at the dirty theatre             X saw a p pr o x i m a t e l y    half a do?en

people whom        I w ould describe as walking wounded.                      X a c c o m p a n i e d them

to an area known as the             returns     clinic and         left them there            because we

required the        re su sc it at io n    points    i.n the    D irty Theatre.

X returned to dirty theatre and saw that                        there were        a l re a d y two (2)

patients     on trolleys a lr ea dy there.

in my opinion a p p e a r e d more distressed.                  This was a            white male, aged

a ro un d f ourteen     (14) years of age.             He    had   light b r o wn / bl o nd hair.            He

was wearing a red Liverpool                 FC T-shirt,        a pair of jeans and a pair of

t ra i ne rs .




X turned     the    patient    onto       his side and. left him w it h the student                     nurse.

X then went        to the second          patient.     He was a white male,               a p p r o x im a te l y

20 years.        iie had ginger       hair.     He was wear in g a pair of jeans and.

only had one training            shoe on.       He w a s n ’t wearing a top.




Two other        patients   had been brought           into    the    room but there was

nursing     staff a lr e a d y with them.            I a s s i s t e d with these        patients who

were   both conscious.

I was joined by Dr Dorcas HEAP

                                     Sheffield, South Yorkshire

Electronics Engineer



Dated 27.5.89



  ROGER HOULDSWORTH, of                                                       vill state:



I am 42 years old and up to the week commencing 10th April (100489) I was employed as

Technical Director by M W (Technology) Limited of Sheffield. I had been employed in that

capacity for some 2 years until I resigned my position. I hold an HNC qualification as an

Electronics Engineer.   Prior to working with M W (Technology) Limited, I had previously

worked for more than 10 years abroad, in the electronics field.



When I returned from working abroad, in 1986 (000086), I was approached by the then

Company Secretary of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, Dick CHESTER, who asked me

to assist in relation to certain problems the Club were having with their closed-circuit

television systems (CCTV). I understand the CCTV system then installed, had been put in

place by Philips Alarms in about 1984 (000084), but that Company had subsequently gone

out of business.



I did look at the system at Mr CHESTER'S request and as then designed and installed it

was not working properly.



Shortly afterwards, I joined M W (Technology) Limited, and whilst their employee, I

completed my examination of the existing system and re-designed it to improve the system

and also the computer system related to it. I also re-designed the CCTV system which had

been installed by the Club for police use - this being a separate system from that operated

by the Club for its own purposes.
THE CLUB SYSTEM



This consisted of a number of static TV cameras situated at strategic points around the

ground. As a result of my examining the system, I arranged for some additional cameras to

be installed to enhance it, particularly when the Spion Kop part of the Ground was

re-opened in 1986 (000086).



Being a static system, the cameras are in a fixed position and focus on a particular fixed

area. They were in fact positioned at strategic points to view the turnstile entrances, and

there was also a camera covering the players' entrance. Within the CCTV room, situated in

the South Stand near the players' entrance, there is a bank of 20 monitors, plus a monitor

for the computer system.      This computer system records the number of spectators who

come through the turnstiles for each separate area of the ground.      Of the 20 monitors

within the control room, 19 display the scene as depicted in the Club's static system.

The remaining monitor is connected to the Police CCTV system.



Each of the monitors connected to the Club system is in turn connected to a VCR so that

we have the facility to tape the film shown on those monitors, on a video tape. Of the 19

static cameras however, 1 was not in commission at the time because a wall had been

constructed after the camera had been installed, which obstructed that camera's view of

the relevant turnstiles. The turnstiles in question were those numbered 9-16 which will be

referred to later in this statement.



THE POLICE SYSTEM



This consisted of 5 fully functional remote controlled cameras - ie. those cameras could

pan-tilt through 360 degrees, and zoom on a 16/160 lens.       They are controlled from a

Police control box which is fixed in position at the south west comer of the Ground,
adjacent tn thP western end of the South Stand. The cameras for the Police system are

positioned as follows:-

1 on the upper south west comer of the West Stand;

2 are positioned on the top of the South Stand;

1 at about its centre point and the other to the eastern end of the stand at the top;

1 at the top (rear) of the roof of the Spion Kop;

1 at the south west comer of the ground, mounted on high near the score-board and close

  to the Police control box.

Within the Police control box there are 7 TV monitors, 5 of them are dedicated, 1 to each of

the CCTV cameras. The other 2 are connected to special time lapse video recorders, and

you can switch from camera to camera by means of a passive switch within the control

room so that the officer in charge can record the scene being displayed on any 1 of the

5 cameras. The remaining 2 monitors are used so that the officer can check which of the

5 cameras are being recorded at any given time. PC Trevor BISHOP was the Officer who

worked the CCTV system for the Police, but it was not usual for him to be alone in the

control room - there might perhaps be 3 or 4 other officers in there with him at any given

time, for their own reasons - eg. to watch a section of the crowd from the elevated position.



Within the Police control box, there is also a telephone land line which is part of

Sheffield Wednesday FC's internal telephone system, and the Police have their own

separate telephone land lines installed also.



THE EVENTS OF SATURDAY, 15TH APRIL 1989 (150489)



Although    I   had   previously   resigned     my   position   as   Technical   Director   of

M W (Technology) Limited, I was asked by Graham MACKRELL to attend at the Ground on

that day, in case my assistance was required.        W e knew that the FA Cup Semi-Final

between Liverpool FC and Nottingham Forest FC was a sell out, all-ticket match and I

arrived at the Ground fairly early on the Saturday morning, to check that everything was in
order. I was in fact asked to rectify a fault on 1 of the Police CCTV cameras, the one at the

south west comer near the score-board. I checked it, found it was not functioning properly,

and I made the necessary adjustments to the iris controls within the camera and thereafter

checked that it was working          OK.       Late   in the   morning    I then    went to   the

CCTV Control Room where PC Harold GUEST was also in attendance, as usual.

In addition,   there    was     present       Doug     LOCK,      the    Security   Officer    for

Sheffield Wednesday FC a        n   d     ^   f      M W (Technology). PC GUEST, as a matter

of routine, would have ensured early in the morning that cassette tapes were inserted in the

19 VCRs - 1 of course would not be recording a picture because the camera was out of

action, but PC GUEST would nevertheless routinely load all 19.            The authorised crowd

capacity figures for each section of the ground was part of the data stored in the computer,

and the display monitor for the computer would show how many spectators came through

each of the turnstiles in operation as the day went on. The system was so designed that

when the turnstiles for a particular area had admitted 90 capacity to that area, the total for

that section would flash on the TV screen and if, for example, one part of the Ground was

being filled up quickly and there was capacity in another part (subject to segregation of

supporters), that would enable the Police to be aware that they should direct remaining

supporters to a different set of turnstiles. Each of the turnstiles was also fitted with an infra­

red ray sensor, so that if spectators tried to climb over the turnstiles but within the turnstiles

enclosure, that would also be recorded on the screen, under a separate heading.

I produce (Exhibit 1) a copy of the print-out from the computer monitor for the game in

question. Numbers climbing over the turnstiles within the enclosure would be shown on the

column headed 'Check Total'.        The first heading 'Gate' is the turnstile number through

which the fans entered, the 'Gate Total' shows the number who entered through each of

those turnstiles and there will be sub-totals for each section.



I was present in the CCTV Control Room from about 11.30 am (1130) that morning, when

the turnstiles were opened and spectators were entering the ground. The Spion Kop and

the South Stand had been designated for Nottingham Forest supporters, and the North
Sts»nd and West Stand (including Leppings Lane), were reserved for Liverpool supporters.

The authorised capacity for the various sections of the ground was as follows:-



Spion Kop                       21,000

South Stand covered              5,524

South Stand uncovered            3,310

West Stand                       4,465

Leppings Lane                   10,100

North Stand                      9,702



By about 2.45      pm (1445)     the   Kop and the     South    Stand   areas were full of

Nottingham Forest supporters but the North Stand and the West Stand areas were only

about 2/3 (two thirds) full at that time and it was noticeable from the static camera covering

the Leppings Lane turnstiles, that there was a build up of fans outside the turnstiles in that

area. I produce (Exhibit 2) a plan of the Ground showing the Leppings Lane entrance to

the west and the turnstiles (7 in number) which admit spectators to the terraced area of the

West Stand are designated A/G. It will be seen that to the south of those turnstiles runs a

concrete path which lead around eventually to the South Stand. That path is bounded on

the one side (the south) by the river Don and on the north side by a high brick wall.

Situated n that wall just immediately beyond the turnstiles - ie. to the east of them - was an

exit gate designated Gate C which is a double gate of the concertina metal-type which was

kept closed. One of the static cameras of the CCTV system was situated on a post just j } ^

east of that gate, the camera being positioned so as to show the area of the turnstiles A/G.



It was through the monitor showing the scene depicted by that camera that it was possible

to see the build up of supporters outside the turnstiles.      The Police had erected some

barriers across the pathway a short distance east of Gate C, so that spectators could not

walk along the pathway to get access to the South Stand.                   The build up of

Liverpool supporters outside the Leppings Lane entrance, was such that some had been
forced beyond the entrance to the turnstiles outside Gate C, and some of those supporters

were visible within the field of vision of the static camera.



The position was such that I recall commenting, at perhaps 2.50 pm (1450), "For God's

sake why don't they delay the kick-off?" and I made that comment in the presence of

Doug LOCK and PC GUEST. W e were all, as I recall, in general agreement that it would

be sensible to postpone the kick-off to enable people to get into the ground, although I do

not recall that anyone in the CCTV Control Room attempted to contact the Police by radio

or telephone to suggest that.        The Police, of course, were monitoring the situation

themselves from their own CCTV system, and in particular using the camera on the

south west comer of the West Stand roof. W e could, of course, see that that camera was

trained on Leppings Lane turnstiles because we were able to monitor the Police pictures on

one of the monitors within our control room, although we did not have the facility to record

that picture.



There came a time when Gate C appeared to be opened, and a number of spectators

rushed through into the 'reservoir1 area between the turnstiles and the rear of the

West Stand. An examination of the video recording appears to indicate that this occurred

when the Police opened the gate in an effort to eject one of the spectators that way, and a

number of the fans pressed through from the outside. It would appear that several hundred

got through before the gates were again closed.



Subsequently, the static camera picked up the fact that a number of fans climbed up over

the structure housing the turnstiles, and jumped down into the reservoir area inside.

 That is, it seems, further indication of the pressures building up outside the turnstiles,

 although a steady flow of spectators was coming through those turnstiles at all times, in the

 normal way.
I recall that after the first influx of several hundred spectators through Gate C, Doug LOCK

left the CCTV room to go outside, presumably to report the matter to the Club Secretary,

Graham MACKRELL, and/or to check the position for himself on the ground.



Some time later, I am unsure of the exact time, I heard over the Police radio (we had one in

the CCTV room), a senior police officer make a request that a gate be opened at the

Leppings Lane entrance.      Police control asked which gate he wished opened and he

repeated his request 2 or 3 times.     On about the fourth occasion he said, "Someone is

going to die here, open the gate", and the Police control replied, "If someone is going to die

open the gate, open the gate".



As appears from the video tape, recording the scene, the gate was then opened,

apparently by a uniformed PC, and a huge number of fans flooded into the area.



At that point in time, I realised from the number already displayed on the monitor as having

entered from the Leppings Lane turnstiles, that a dangerous situation was being created.

I left the room and went down the players' tunnel to the pitch and, just as I did so, the

referee stopped the match as I recall. I looked over to the West Stand area and I saw fans

climbing over the fence and my first thought at that time was that it was a pitch invasion,

and the match had been stopped for that reason. The perimeter fencing at that point is

high and not easy to climb over.     I sat down in the stand area behind the dug-out, and

watched the situation for a little time - perhaps 2 or 3 minutes - before I realised what really

was occurring.    One of the Sheffield Wednesday ground staff came down the tunnel

holding 2 stretchers and I grabbed one from him and ran across with it to help ferry the

injured people to the gymnasium area where the first aid room was situated. It was in fact

only after I had ferried 3 or 4 inured people in that way, that I then realised that there were

many people who had died as a result, and the gym was in fact designated as a temporary

mortuary.
After helping on the pitch as much as possible, at about 4.15 (1615)/4.30 pm (1630), I went

back to the CCTV room where                       and PC GUEST were present, and I had a

cup of coffee and a cigarette. Subsequently, I took print-outs of the attendance from the

computer monitor, and ejected the tapes from the VCR's, leaving them in the machines in

the ejected position, so that I could later know exactly which tape related to which

monitor/area.



I normally take 3 print-outs from the computer for the attendance figures, 2 of which go to

the Secretary, Graham MACKRELL, and the third will normally go to the ticket office staff.

However, on this occasion, since it was an FA Cup Semi-Final, all-ticket, I did at first give

the third print-out to PC GUEST, at his request, since he said his superior officers might

want it.   Later, however, Graham MACKRELL said that he wanted to keep all 3 in his

secure possession and I, therefore, retrieved it from PC GUEST.



At about 6.15 (1815)/6.30 pm (1830), Graham MACKRELL asked me to ensure the video

room was properly secured.                    tend PC GUEST had left the ground at that time.

I went to the CCTV room, locked the cupboard doors where the VCR's were and then

locked the room and activated the alarm system for the room.              I kept the key in my

possession overnight.    On locking the cupboard doors where the VCR's were, I do not

recall specifically checking that all the tapes were still in the machine, but I do recall that as

I finally left the ground at about 7.30 pm (1930) that night, with my fiancee who works as a

receptionist at the Club, I asked the Security Guard at the players' entrance, to ensure that

no one entered the CCTV room overnight. He promised to do so.



I returned to the ground at 9 am (0900), on the Sunday morning and checked the room

where it was still locked and the alarm operative. However, when I opened up the room

and checked the VCR's, I found that 2 tapes were missing. One of those was the tape

 relating to the camera which looks over Gates 9 - 16, and the other was from the VCR

which had not been activated at the time.         I have no idea who removed the tapes - I
mentioned it to the Security Officer, Doug LOCK, and he was surprised and had

knowledge of it.



I have read this statement and it is correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.
ROGER HOULDSWORTH, age 42




Dated 28.4.89



I am engaged on a contract basis with Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, dealing

principally with the installation and maintenance of the computer turnstile monitoring

system.    There are 16 fixed camera points around the ground which focus on turnstile

entrances to the ground. Each camera is linked to a video recorder which is located in a

computer room off the players' entrance.



When a football match takes place at Hillsborough, I am normally engaged in the computer

room, monitoring the accumulating crowd figure on the visual display unit.



On Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489) I was at the ground for the Semi-Final. Present in

the computer room with me were PC GUEST, Mr LOCKE (Security) ancj



PC GUEST switched the video recorders on. There is a monitor in the computer room so

that we can see each turnstile entrance. Of the 16 cameras only one was inoperative on

the day.



Due to the tragedy at the ground, I left the computer room to assist. PC GUEST remained

in the room.



I returned to the computer room some time later, I think about half past four (1630). I recall

ejecting the tapes but leaving them in the machines.
The ground in general during the afternoon was in a state of bedlam. People, supporters,

relatives were everywhere.



I locked the computer room at about 6.30 pm (1830), but had to return shortly after that as

a Police Sergeant requested a computer print out. I supplied that to him.



I returned to the ground at about 9 am (0900) on Sunday 16th April 1989 (160489). The

alarm to the room was operative and the room was locked. I checked the video recorders,

as I realised the tapes would be required. I discovered that (2) two tapes were missing. I

made a thorough search of the room but could not find the tapes. I put the remaining (14)

fourteen tapes in a bag.



On Monday 17th April 1989 (170489) I put the 14 tapes in the office safe.



I informed Mr McGEE, Chairman, and Mr MACKRELL, Secretary, that the tapes were

missing.



I checked with PC GUEST and Mr LOCKE, but they had not seen the missing tapes. I am

not aware that any person removed the tapes for any legitimate reason.



The tapes concerned are:-

i)     A b lan k tape from the camera that was not operating




ii)    The tape covering turnstiles 9-12, entrance for the West Stand (above Leppings

       Lane terraces).

Keys to computer room are held by myself, Mr LOCKE and Mr MACKRELL. I am not aware

that any unauthorised person/s entered the computer room on Saturday 15th April 1989

(150489). There was no evidence of any forced entry to the room at any time.
The video recorders are not numbered to show which turnstiles they cover.   It is strange

that the two tapes missing are adjacent to the Leppings Lane turnstiles.

              the     pitch      I saw people a tt em p t i n g to r e su sc it at e a male                  lying        on an

              advertising           board.         t arn now aware that this                  person was     called S te p he n

             HARRISON.
                                                                                                        S3123

           We went over to him and            continued to attempt              resuscitation.        He wasn" t

           b reathing and had no           pulse.



           Two amb ul an ce men       came to us with a stretcher

                                                                                               I a dvised

           them that      cardiac massage          should foe continued en route             to the    hospital

           and he was then taken to an ambulance.                       E cannot    remember    if' a Police

           Officer was with the            body,    but after        it was    taken a way   1 had no

           further    dealings.

           My dealings wj'fch dead and             injured        people were all    in an a rea on the

           corner of the       pitch,      between the B pion Hop and N orth Stand.                   After my

           dealings      art the   pitch    I was directed to the gymnasium.

           On 13th April       1989   (1‘
                                        513489),       1 was wearing          dark blue   trousers and a

           grey shirt.

                  On the      1 t hi of April,            "i9 8 9   (-1!:>0489) I was on duty with Dr.                  John

                 G LE N D E N I N G   in the C as u a l t y D epartment at the N or th er n General

                  Hos pi tal , Bhef f i e 1 d „           At a pp r o x i m a t e l y 3 -ht'7 p.m.       ( V!/£7 ) that day,      the

                  e m er ge nc y telephone             from R ot herham Amb ul an ce Head qu ar te rs                 rang and we

                 were     informed that               there was a P ae di a t r i c           cardiac arrest        coming     into

                 the Department.                 About 3 minutes             later       the ambulance arrived,            bringing

                 a young        boy,      who    looked to be about                 10   or   '1c. years    of age.      It was at,

                 that     point that we were                 told by the a mbulance                drivers who        brought him

                  in that a major               incident       had occurred at Hillsborough.                      The    boy was

                 taken      into the        resusc it at io n room arid attempts                    to     resuscitate     him were

                 made     by myself,            Dr.    G L E N D E N I N G , Dr.   WALKER,      Anaesthetist,         and one of

                  the Paed ia tr ic Doctors.

                 Mo more       than H minutes               later a second a mb ul ancearrived,                    bringing a man
                                                                                                   PAGE   2
                                                                                                   S3123A

looking to be in his            .Late 20* s.       He too was         brought     into the

resusc it at io n    room.      Some 2 minutes          after       the    receipt    of the second

patient,       we had another '& a m bu la nc es          outside         bringing    patients     in.          J.

believe     that the     time     now was a p p r o x i m a t e l y 3.33      p . m . (1535).     I find

the events       of the next 5 minutes             very difficult            toremember exactly.

1 remember       the arrival       of several       other      cyanosedyoung          patients and

the early arrival          of a number       of our       colleagues whowere             on-call       in

the    hospital.

At a round 3.43        p.m.    (1545)    1 was     told by Mr.            WARDRGPE,    the C as ua lt y

Consultant,       to go to the ground because                  there       had been a Police

request for a medical            team on site.            I helped to         load some     of the

eme rg ency supply       boxes     into the back         of an ambulance and waited for

the A n ae sthetist Dr.         QUART L E Y ,who    had also         been directed to           come    to

the     ground.      There was a slight delay of a couple of minutes                            before          he

was     able    to join us and. 1 would e st im atethat                   this a mbulance       left   the

D epartment      to go to the ground some               7 or 8 minute* after             the directive

had     been given.        There were       two A m b u l a n c e m e n   in the vehicle and two

P o l i c e m e n as well as myself and           the Anaesthetist.

The ambulance went            into one of the entrances                   off to the     bottom of

M erries Road       by the Sports Hall           at H i l l s b o r o u g h where     there was a

large Poilice prescence and a great deal                       of    commotion.        On getting           out

of the ambulance,          myself and the A n a e st he ti st             a u t o m a t ic al ly headed for

the    pitch where we         presumed the m aj o r i t y of          casualties w ould          be.        1

now know that this area of the pitch was                        the area between the Bpion

Ko p and the* North stand.              About 20 yards           into the field of          play from

that   corner     of the      pitch,    we a t t e mp te d to resuscitate a male                 patient

who was    laid on a board, wit h an a dv er ti si ng                 slogan on it.         1 have

a l r ea dy submitted a report           to the E n q u i r y       regarding     this   patient.

Neither myself         or the A na es thetist were wearing any                    identifying

clothing,      which    in the    rush to      load the amb ul an ce wit h airways and.
                                                                                                        PAGK             3
                                                                                                        S3123A

'lines, we had omitted             to pack.         Because    of this,          there was an element

of delay       in trying      to ask where any further                   seriously       ill    patients

were.        .£ think   if we had been identifiable,                     we could have          been

d ir e ct e d by the Police          to the      casualties        needing a t t e nt io n most.               At

this    point,     J. got s eparated from the Ana es th et is t who                      I did not see

for the rest of my stay down at Hillsborough.

I went a ro un d a number            of patients who were                lying on the          pitch™        It was

difficult       to tell at a glance,               the    nature    of the m aj o r i t y of          injuries

wh et he r    people were       seriously hurt or not.                   After att en di ng          perhaps

a no th er    15 or 20     individuals,!           found no one who was               in need of urgent

medical       attention.!      was    not able       to tell where the              crush had been and

at this       point,    1 went     to one of the Senior Police Officers                           on the

pitch,       and e xp laining who        i was,      asked    if he       could tell me where any

of the serious          casualties were and he directed me through to the

S po rt s Hall.

The Sports Hall was             being used as            both the m or tu ar y and a resuscitation

room,    half and half,          and as        1 went along        the    line of some          15

casualties       requiring attention,               it was    obvious        that almost, everyone                  of

them was being a t te n d e d to by a Doctor who                     had been         in the ground,

either General          P r ac ti ti on er s    or Hospital        Doctors.         Two of them         I

recognised.         The a m bu lance       crew that we had come down to the                          ground

with,    had a lr ea dy taken the m aj o r i t y of medical                    supplies        into the

Sports Hall       and by the time              ! had got     into the gymnasium,               a. number of

intravenous        lines    had been sited and a central                     pool     of drugs and

equipment       had been e st ab li sh ed         in the middle           of the floor.              I examined

a bout 6 casualties who were                   not, being a tt en d e d to.

was unresp onsive          to verbal      questioning.             His    e y e s w e r e s tar :lny s t,ra :i.g n t,

pulse was weak and            I checked his blood             pressure which was                satisfactory.

He had air       entry to both bases              of his     lungs       but on inspection of the
                                                                                                 PAGE      *
                                                                                                 S 3 1 ESA




There were a lot of           people; down at the ground who,              whilst     not    requiring

.immediate        resuscitation,      a pp ea re d quite dazed and        confused.         Seeing as

there was now a plentiful               auppjy of Doctors         having a good supply of

equipment,,       I decided that        I would be better         off back      in the C as ua lt y

Department.         Ambul an ce s    now appeared       to be going      to the H al la ms hi re

and    I a ppro ac he d one of the Senior Police Officers who a r r a n g e d a lift

back    to the Depar tm en t        for me.

I w ou ld estimate       that    I arrived back at         the C as ua lt y Department

at the N o rt he rn General          Hospital at a pp r o x i m a t e l y 4.30    p.m.     <1630).

The    resuscitation        rooms were,       at this    time,    filled to capacity.              I saw

that    each patient        had at    least two Doctors a tt ending             them and     I

reported back        to Mr.     W AR DR OP E who   d ir ected me to go back         to the main

D ep ar tm en t a nd the     cubicles     there,    where a number        of    casualties        not

requiring     immediate       resuscitation        had been sent.         T. u n de rs to od my role

here   to be to assess and            re-direct     patients as quickly as            possible          to

either ward admission,              or if I considered their           injuries     to   be minor,

to direct them to the P hy s i o t h e r a p y D epartment at the Hospital                      where        I

u nd er st oo d there   to be a number of General                P ra ct it io ne rs who were

dealing with the         less seriously         injured    patients,      who,    it was    intended,

w ou ld be discharged.           The major it y of       patients     I saw were     ones who had

been   in the ground arid who           had been crushed and had suffered a degree

of asphyxiation.            it is difficult        to   remember    individual      cases.         The

m aj o r i t y of them were      in a degree       of discomfort       on :i.ns pi rat i on „      A

           minutes after        returning          from Hillsborough.        By this time,        we had no

           more minor        injuries     left      in the Department.        A lt hough   not

           partici pa ting      in a ny further         e mergency     resuscitation of      patients after

           returning from Hi 3 Isbo r o u g h , I felt happy that                the more    senior    staff

           who had arrived         in the D epartment were             dealing with this aspect           of

           patient        care and that my time          could best      he served by trying to keep

           the   rest of the D epartment              clear,    in a nt ic i p a t i o n of any further

           casualties and of those walking wounded,                      who we all    felt sure would be

           coming      in to fill    the Department.             As   it happened,    we did not      see

           m u cm in or   trauma at all.

                 been e mployed by the             H ea l t h A u t h or it y for almost      four years.

                 On S a tu r da y    15th April      19S9    <1 ‘
                                                                5 0489) , I was working 2pm             <1400)   x 10pm

                  (SHOO)    at the hospital.            I had my       radio on and heard there was

                  problems at Hi 1 3 sborou.gh football               Ground.         Another      porter   contacted

                 our     boss,   a                      a head porter,             and he a rr anged for other

                  porters     to be drafted         into the e mergency             casualty department.         There

                 was also a large           response from off duty porters to assist also.                          I

                 helped to get all           the eme rg en cy equipment              ready for the      casualties.

                 At about quarter           past   three     <1313)        these ambul an ce s      started to arrive

                 wit h     casualties      on board.        I w al k e d    into    the   resus    room and saw three

                 young     people    being wo rk ed on,         they all        looked in a bad way,          one of

                 these     looked    like my brother,           with dark hair.             I remember      that one
                                                                                                         P AGE        2
                                                                                                         S3295

of the young               people     being worked on had mousey hair and was wearing

a red Liverpool               top.        All    these were      in the      resus    room.

Later     i       remember     taking       the young boy w ith the             red Liverpool          top into

the   plaster             room w hich was acting as a mortuary,                      a student       nurse

a ss i s t e d me to wheel            the       boy on a trol le y to the            plaster    room.        1 do

not know the               name of the student            nurse     nor     could 1 describe          the nurse,

they change            hospitals          every six weeks and              is not at my hospital             now.

1 could not            identify the nurse.                It a pp ea re d     to me    that this young          boy

was   dead,         and    1 think        there were other          dead bodies        in the    piaster       room.

A fter    this        1 returned to the a mbulance a d m i s s i o n area and together

with other            porters and helpers              I a ss i s t e d    in the    removal    of    people

from ambulances.                  Mr WARDDRAP,         a Consultant,          did a quick       ex am in at io n of

the   people and they were either                       sent    to the       plaster    room    if they were

dead,     if serious           injured but alive they were sent to the                          resy's room,

if w alking           injured they were sent               to the         physio on War d 60.

D uring       the a f t e r n o o n   1 took several           dead bodies          to the    plaster    room

and the m a jo ri ty of these                   I cannot     remember,        but    1 do    remember a girl

a ged about           1!:> yrs,     she   had dark hair,          a nd wearing        jeans.     She was       blue

from the neck up.                   I remember her being             in the     plaster       room,    but

nowhere else.

                           1 also     remember a good           looking       lad aged about 23 yrs,

slim build,            dark short hair.               He was    sun-tanned,          wit h an earring.          He

was w earing           jeans,     white     new socks.          I remember          seeing this       lad in the

plaster           room.     1 cannot        remember moving          him.      Host    of the dead were so

young,        i    c o u l d n ’t believe       it.

W hen we were winding                 down a member          of staff,        I don't       remember who,

told me that              fans were       fighting on C floor at the hospital.                        1 saw a

police        van parked outside and                  1 went    out and told the driver and the

Police all           got    out and went          to C floor.             I did not see any fighting or

distu rb an ce as           I returned to my floor which                     is above C floor.,
                                                                                                      PAGE    3
                                                                                                      S3S95

             I do not know for          certain how many dead bodies          I moved during      the

             afternoon,        but   1 saw about   twelve     in the    plaster    room.

             I continued        to help until about       10pm   (ESOO)    when    I left work.

                  1 am employed by S h e f f i e l d Health A u t h o r i t y at the N or th e r n Hospital

                 as an F Grade Charge Nurse                  in Accident & E m e r ge nc y Department,                  1 have

                  been a C harge Nurse            for 2 1/2 years and              previously       I was em pl oy ed .in

                  the Depa rt ment       for 2 1/2 years as a Staff Nurse.                         1 qualified. 6 years

                 ag o .

                 On S a tu r d a y the       15th April      1989,    1 was working          the    late shift       in the

                 D ep ar tm en t which started at             12.30 p.m.          The shift w o ul d have           ended

                  t hat day at 9.0 0          p .m «

                 At week-ends,          the    tea break      is taken at 3 .00            p.m.    but the staff        do not

                 leave the Department.                 At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 3 . 1 5 p . m . r one of the Staff

                 Nurses,     Staff Nurse A 1 i            came and said that              she had    received a call

                 from the sw it ch bo ar d that there had been trouble at Hillsborough.                                      At

                 that     stage,    we did not know           if it was        the      ground or    if it was       the area

                 of Hi .1.1sbo r o u g h .
                                                                                                    SI 39 7

A minute        or two     later,      Ambulance       crew brought a casualty              patient      in

who was      not    connected wit h Hillsborough.                    'They said that they had seen

the Police Mobile Unit                 going to H i l l s b o r o u g h and from this,           I thought

that     there had been a road traffic accident.

At that      time,      there was a 2 1/2 hour wait                  in the Depa rt me nt       for the

patients to be seen.                 1 had a good feeling              that something was          not

right and        in the d i s t a n c e , I could hear a lot of sirens.                        I therefore

took     the de cision to telephone Dr Jim Wardrope at home.                                There was         no

reply from his home               number and therefore              I requested the s witchboard

operator        to page       him.     When       he phoned,       1 spoke to him and said that we

had a 2 1/2 hour wait and                    I further       u nderstood that        there was a

serious      road traffic accident.                   As we were      busy anyway,        he said that

he w ould       come    in.      This would        have been around 3,20 p.m.

At the same time,              1 telephoned                              the Nursing Officer             on

duty and told her             that, I had         received a m es sa ge from switchboard.

S h o r t l y afterwards,         the emergency telephone               rang,       This was a l r e a d y on

Ambu la nc e     control.        She     said     "Could you be       ready to accept a child

cardiac arrest           that     will      be with you        in two minutes."          No m e n ti on of

where     the    child was        from was made.             One of the Staff Nurses           called the

on-call      P a ed i a t r i c i a n and. Anaesthetist.

I. was    still w o r r ie d      about, the        situation and I said to            Staff Nurse

             that      I. felt    something was wrong,                I then said       that   1 didn't

care     if I    was going       to look a          fool    but, J. w an te d the    rest of the Staff

(Nursing)        calling       in.     We have a list of home telephone                   numbers for

the Staff        who are      permanently           based     in Accident & Emergency,             X also

requested        the R e c e pt i on is t    to     put Medical      Records    on standby.

At the same time,             I took        the keys       to the Major C at as tr op he       cupboards

a nd opened one          of the eight, cupbaords.                  From this    cupboard       I took two

of the boxes           containing        resuscitation units.             It, was also at this            time

that     the a m bu la nc e a r r i ve d      carrying       the   child with the        cardiac arrest.

I. spoke to an a mbulance man.               I believe       that he was with the ambu la nc e

w h ic h brought      the    child, into the hospital.           He said, that there was             in

fact, trouble        inside    the ground at H i l l s b o r o u g h and that     there were a

number     of crush        injuries,.     This    c on ve rsation would have      taken      place

a r ou n d 3 .28    p.m.

                     was    in the D epartment when the          child arrived.          I

u nderstand that shortly afterwards,                  the Major Disaster Plan was

i mplemented by her.            Wit hi n a minute      or so of the Disaster Plan being

implemented,         staff were     coming       in from all    over the hospital.            Within

the next few niinut.es,          four more        patients arrived      in two a mbulances and

Mr Wardrope arri ve d at, about 3.35                p.m.

The   e mergency telephone          rang once again.           It was the A mb ulance Service

a sking    for an e mergency Doctor              team to be sent,.      Mr Wardrope

desi gn at ed one of the C as u a l t y Officers,             Miles Davidson,        and an

Ana es th et is t    to go    in the vehicle        that was    provided by S YM AB to take

the Mobile         Team to the Stadium.

By 3.45 p.m.         casualties were arriving              very quickly      in Red Cross

A mbu la nc es and also        in SYMA8 A mbulances          driven by A mb ulance Personnel

and also     by Police Officers when Am bu la nc e Personnel                  were   tending     to

patients.

Mr Wardrope         began triaging        patients and       I assisted.       It became a

matter     of dealing wit h the           casualties as they arrived.            By about, 4.05

p.m.,     all Accident & Eme rg en cy Nursing Staff were                  in the D epartment

and had reported to me.                 Those we had been unable to            contact    because

they were     not     in whe n we telephoned          had    in fact, arrived, at the

Hospital     having heard the news on TV and Radio.

F rom 3.33 p.m.        staff were arriving           from the Wards and         reporting      to me

and asking where to go.              Additionally,          General   Practiti.oners and

Medical Staff         not e mp loyed by the Hospital            came as a result         of appeals

in the media.          They also were        referred to me.          Once   the Major Disaster
                                                                                                  SI 397

P lan was     in full       swing,    the Orthop ae di c Libr ar y was            set up as Nursing

liaison and once            this    came    into being,        I directed the staff           there

where    they were a l l o c a t e d their          duties..     The Outpatient Depar tm en t

which     is situated below the Accident & Eme rg en cy D epartment was                               set up

to deal wit h the Press and                 relatives.         The   relatives were        later moved

to the Staff Dining Room once the                     signs     had been put up directing                  them

to that area.

During     the afternoon,           two Police O ff icers arrived and set                  up a base

behind the C a s u a l t y desk.            They    liaised wit h the A cc ident & E m e r g en c y

staff    regarding         the    identities       of the    patients.       For ease,      patients

are a l l o ca te d a number         on arrival       and their       identities are disc ov er ed

f o)lowing any e me rgency            treatment       they may       require.      This would

consist     of R e c e pt io n staff        going    round the       patients asking        names and

addresses,          or, wit h the     help of Police? Officers,              searching      personal

be 1ong i n g s .

"Ihe major medical           need for the          patients     on arrival was        resuscitation.

Dr Wa rdrope        decided what       treatment was n ecessary and                I then directed

the    patient       to an ava il ab le      point where        that treatment        could be given.

J. had a rr an ge d a number          of staff      to    continually       look out for,       and keep

me    updated with,        the     number    of spaces a vailable           in the Hospital           where

they    could receive            treatment.

A Police Officer            came    to see me at about 3.4S p.m.                 He said that

someone     had sent       him and a sked that            the P h y s i o t h e r a p y D epartment    be

opened.      The P hy s i o t h e r a p y Department,          under the Disaster Plan,               is

used for minor          injuries and the walking wounded.                     I had a l l o ca te d

staff to that area, already.                  However,       I gave    the Police Offi ce r           the

keys and a Porter           showed him where             the D epartment was.          I presume           that

the staff      1 had a l l o ca te d were staying w ith the                patients.

The    patients      for   r es uscitation were kept             on the Department.            Those who

did not need          immediate      r es uscitation or who           had been suc ce ss fu ll y

r es uscitated were           then sent on to Ward 60.

B od ie s were      sent to the O rt ho paedic Plaster                  room which,         under      the

Disaster Plan,            becomes a t emporary Mortuary,

C a su alties      had just about            ceased to arrive at the Hospital                    w hen    1

a s k ed the Am bu la nc e L i a is on Officer               if we    could expect anymore.                  He

said that as far as he was aware,                       there were          no more    casualties         on the

scene.        However,      a couple more            patients a r r iv ed on the R ed Cross

Ambulance.          As far as         1 am aware,       these were          the    last two to arrive              by

ambulance.          Unfortunately,            I have    no    idea as to what time              this was.

However,         1 do recall at a p p r o x i m a t e l y 20-30 minutes               later,     an

a m bu la nc e    crew from 8YMAS a rr iv ed wit h an empty ambulance and said

they had come to take                 the    bodies    back to Hillsborough.               All    bodies          had.

been taken to the Plaster                    room and from there,             had been taken to the

H ospital *s Mortuary.                1 contacted the M or tu ar y T ec hn i c i a n            on duty and

said that         he w o ul d have to         come to the department and speak                    to the

A mb u la n ce men.       However,          whilst    fie was    ori his way,        the Amb ul a nc e

L i a i s o n Of ficer     came and said that            he had now a p p r o x im at el y 6 crews

a nd that they were              detailed to take all             bodies from the Hospital                   back

to H i ll s b or o u g h w h i c h had been desi gn at ed a Public M or tu ar y by the

Coroner.

The whole         o p eration went          smoothly.        However,       at one stage,        it did

appear     that     the N or t h e r n General         Hospital       was    going to be swamped by

casualties and            1 do    recall      that at approx imate ly 4-.00 p.m.,                 Mr

War dr op e a sked one of the Nursing Offic er s                       to    request    the Ambulance

L i a is o n O fficers      to send any further               casualties          to the Royal

Ha A ia m sh i re H o s p i t a l .

Once    the      patients     had stopped arriving,               it was a matter          of    clearing up

and a s se ss in g     the situation.            The Medical          Records Staff were

identifying         the   people along with the                 two   police Officers           detai le d for

those     duties.

             The   patients    on arrival    had been given wrist   labels w ith a number on

             it,, documentation,     and a notes folder.

             I was    sent off duty at about 9.10      p.m.

                     On S a tu r d a y    15th April           19S9     (1150489)                  I was working                        on the    labour ward.,,

                      I s tarted work at a p p r o x i m a t e l y 8, 3 0 a.m                                  (0830).                  At some     time a round

                     3 pm       (1i>00)   I was           leaving    the nurses                    home,              in fact            I think      it

                     was       probably nearer 3 ,30 p.m.                     (1!530),                 when           I saw an ambulance w ith the

                     blue       light flashing & siren                 sounding                    pull           up outside               the double

                     come the wrong way and was unable                                   to        drive              any further.                There was a

                     T here were two a m bu l a n c em e n             in the                    rear of the ambulance,                             one of them

cardiac massage.                 1    asked what had happened whilst at the same time

patient had             come from the Hi 13sfoorough football                       ground but they didn't

provide me with any further                         details.

The    patient was a white male,                         and ruy a ssessment was              that he was aged

early to mid-twenties.                       He was of stocky build and                   i   think    he had dark

hair.        1 can't, remember what he was wearing.                               He was       unconscious,         he

had fixed dilated                pupils and was                cyanosed    centrally as well            as

peri pheral 3y .           He had       no    cardiac          output arid there was              no spontaneous

res pi rat ion.

Tog et her with the a.mbu3 ancernen 1 a ss i s t e d with ca r di o-pul mo nary

r es uscitation           (C.P.R.).

The Polj cpman had d is ap peared &                        1   assumed     that    he had gone to get

further assistance.                    He    returned          in a short time & I asked him if

assis ta nc e was on its way.                       He    informed me       that there wasn't and that

there was         chaos     in       the Accident & E m e r g e n c y department.                    At this

stage      1 decided        to       transfer       the patient on the trolley                     to A & E.

Together with the a m b u l a n c e m e n this was                       done.     We went straight            into

recept ion at A & F. and                    1 remember          seeing    peopJe everywhere,            it was

obvious that            something was              s er iously wrong.

Someone,        1 don't        know who,           directed       us to take the          patient along            the

corridor        into what            is called the             "recovery    room’.        Throu gh ou t      the

patient was             receiving C.P.R.             <c ar di o- pu Im on ar y     resuscitation).             Whilst

in the      recovery        room a senior                colleague who       I believe was an

a n ae st h e t i s t    introduced himself and a sk ed me the                       patients         history.

I gave him all            the        details       I could and the           patient was then moved                 into

the a djoining            room       which    is the A & E plaster                room.       I    then left this

patient w ith the anaesthetist.                           Unfortunately           I cannot        recall     this

persons       name.       At     the time          1 left, the      patient       he had. not        been

intubated but           1   recall    there    being a disc us si on to the effect            that he

w o u l d be.     In my opinion this            patient was       really alre ad y dead upon

arrival     at    the hospital         altho ug h    resus ci ta ti on attempts were made.                  I

am unable        to say with absolute            certainty whether          this   patient was

s u c c es sf ul ly    resuscitated or not as            1    did not have any further         contact

wit h    him,    after      leaving    him    in the    care of the a n a es th et is t     but due to

his     condition       I believe      that he was unresuscitable.

Ha vi ng   left this         patient    I moved through Treatment fc) room               (clean

theatre)        into the       resuscitation        room where        I became   involved    in the

attempted        resuscitation of a patient whose rnajaK no. was £1                         (body 91

S t e p he n HARRISON).

There were        people alre ad y dealing with this                   patient   but   I am unable

to provide details             of these       people.        He was    ona trolley w hi ch was

s i tuated nearest          the door     in the      r es uscitation      roam leading      into

A & E reception,            so as you walked           into the       resuscitation    room this

patient was           on the   first    trolley.

the folder with the                patient or          a ny where else.      W h e r eu po n   I went    to

the hospital              mortuary. 1 was still            unable    to locate the folder                and

s u b s eq u en tl y made my own notes on a sheet                    of A4 paper using            the majax

NO.    FI.      1 left       these with the body.

The only way              that    I am able to         identify the    patient        is by the majax

NO.    w hich    in       this    case was HI.           1 w o ul d describe    the    patient as a

white male,           aged, a p pr o x i m a t e l y   late teens,    early twenties.             He was of

Whilst       treating       this       patient    I do    remember    that Dr.        Rachael     Pi-TTINGER

             was also assisting along with other                     people.

              1 remember      seeing     the following Doctors              present during           the    course of

             the afternoon.        Ur NAIDOD,          Dr Gilbert MUIR         (care of the elderly),                 Dr

             a ss is t ed with any       patients      that    died or not.

                  1985     (000085)           at the London Hospital,

                  I have w or ked at the                        N or th er n General Hospital        for the    past eighteen

                  months.          On S at ur da y             15th Apri)    1989     (150489)     it was my working

                  w e e k en d and      I was at the N or th er n General                   Hospital.       At a pp r o x i m a t e l y

                  15,05/15, 10 (1505/1510)                           hours that afternoon,         1 received a telephone

                  call     from John DUN CA N who                      is a Senior       registrar at the North er n

                  General     Hospital and he stated that he was at home                                 watching the         T„V»

                  and that something was occurring at the H il ls b o r o u g h football                                   ground.

                  He went     on to say that                     there were a mb ul a n c e s     present and     to expect

                  patients at the hospital.

                  As a     result       of this               call   1 made my way to        casualty to see        if I could

                  o bt ai n any further                   details.       I spoke wit h Charge Nurse BATTY                but he

                  was    unable      to provide me with further                       details      I ensured     that the staff

                                                                                                   8 3 3 DO

on the general            surgical         wards and     in theatre were aware and that their

services niay he required and                    then    1   made my way back to            casualty.

Upon my return I contacted                    switch bo ar d and       informed them that we had a

m ajor    incident and a sked them to contact Mr .DUNCAN and Hr MCSHANF.

(Registrar)          I believe that this was                 done.

Eiy this      time    the first           patients were a rr iv in g        by ambulance.        The    first

patient       that    I had any dealings with was

                                                                                 tal   1               of

me d iu m build and had short dark                    brown hair.          I am unable       to recall

what     he was wearing,              1   think he had a pair of jeans               on and that his

top clothing          had a l r e a d y been      removed.        He was     in the    resuscitation

room when       1    first made           contact and to the         best of my       recollection

there was a staff nurse                    from casualty whose          name   I do not know,          with

the    patient.        The y outh was          cyanosed but there were no obvious

external       injuries.            He was    having d if fi c u l t y breathing.

He had small          pupils        but they were        reactive     to    light.     X intubated the

patient and together with the nurse we venti la te d him.                                   In a short

tiriie his     co 1 our       returne d. to narina 1 .

C r e-examined the               patient who was        still     un-conscious and could not

find any obvious major abdominal                        or chest     injuries.        The    patient

a p pe a re d stable and            in view of this and the fact that                  X was    required

to a ss is t w ith other              patients    1 left the nurse, who had been ass is ti ng

me,    to continue ventilating                 the   patient.        As far as       I am aware this

patient       lived,      1    w o u ld   certainly have       e x pe c te d him to.

The    next   person          I a ss is te d was a young         female,     I now know that this

patient was Victoria. HICKS.                     She was      brought      into the    room where       1 was

dealing with the               patient     I have des cr ib ed above.           I remember       she was

accompanied          by a young man who              1 believe was wearing a Liverpool

shirt,    he was d e f in at el y a football                 supporter and an a m b u l a n c e m a n or

                                  1 made the d ec ision to stop treatment.                   I then

m o ve d on    to other        patients          to see   if J. could    be of assistance.          1   did

not have       any further          dealings with V i c t o r i a HICKS.

I recall       that    1 m oved on to two or three other patients to see                           if I

could help but ail              of them had sufficient medical                staff with them           and

a pp e a re d to be receiving adequate                    treatment.     I cannot     describe any of

the above       patients        or their         condition.       By this time      the   place was

chaot i c .

The next       patient      that     I had specific          dealings with was a young white

male,   aged a p p r o x i m a t e l y f ou r t e e n / f i f t e e n years of age.       He was

brought       into   the    clean theatre on an am bu la nc e             stretcher.        I can't

remember who         carried the         patient        into the hospital,       M a r t i n MCSHANE,

J o h n DUNCAN and         1 a pp ro a c h e d    the   patient    1 immediately saw that          he was

not   breathing and that              he was       cyanosed.

                     but before         I had finished J o h n DUNCAN         certified the

patient dead and. instructed me not to                        proceed.

As    previously stated the              patient was a white male aged f ou rteen to
                                                                                                               PAGE
                                                                                                               S3S00

              •fifteen years.            He had short        dark hair and was of very slim build I

              cannot      recall what         clothing     he was wearing,,

              I have been shown some                photographs        by W .P.S APPLE f'ON on todays          date,

              16.10.89         (161089)     and from the         photographs         shown    I would    say that the

              photograph bearing             the    print number           e ighty-two   (Philip STEELE)       is the

              best    resemblance          to the      patient      that    I am    referring    to.

              Once    the      patient     had been certified dead by John DU NC AN                     I had no

              further         dealings w ith the         patient.

              I moved on and a s s i s t e d with several                   other    patients    including    some     in

              I.Y.U but to the best of my knowledge                          none of these       people    died.

              At the beginning             of my statement           I refer       to the first     patient that       I

              dealt wit h w hom          I believe       lived to be in the            resuscitation       room,   I

              now believe         that     this    patient was        in fact       in clean theatre.        He was

              d e f in at el y   j n the    same    room that V ic t o r i a HICKS           received her    treatment

              in .

                I am a qual ified doctor,              my qualifi ca ti on s         are MBChB.       I qualified          in

               July     1985    (000085)      at Sheffield.

               At the     present      time    I am working at           the J es s o p Hospital       for w om en in

               S h e f f i e ) d and have     been since      the    1st Sep te mb er       this year     (1989)

                (000089).

               Prior    to that       I had been working at              the N or t h e r n General     H o s p i t a 1„On

               Saturday        13th April      1989    (150489)„       I was w orking on the g ynaecology

               d e pa rt me nt at the NGH.            This   department        is situated just

               across    the     c ourtyard to the entrance                 to the     casualty   (A&E).       I

                remember       that   I was    dealing with a patient when                  I heard a lot of

               p ol i ce /a mb ul an ce   sirens      I became a ware         that    something was happening                in

                c asualty so once         I had finished wit h my patient                   1 made my way across

               to casualty I can't             be sure about the time                but   I think    it was

               a ro u n d 3.,30 (1330/4        pm (1600).
                                                                                                   page:         2.
                                                                                                   S34E5

A*    I w alked through the a mb ulance               entrance a man was              brought    in on a

t ro ll e y    1   presume     by an a m b u l a n c e m a n and the    person with the          patient

stated that           they had a t t e mp te d to         resuscitate    the man       I made an

e x a m i na t io n of the      patient and as a result              certified him dead.            The

m an had f ixed dilated             pupils,     he was       cyanosed,.        There were       no pulses

palpable and no heart sounds                   or breath sounds          on a u s c u l t a t i o n of the

chest.

The man with the             patient asked where             he should take          him and Hr Jim

W A R O R O P 6 who was standing          in the     e nt r a n c e / r e c e p t i o n area directed    that

he be taken to the orthopaedic                    plaster      room.     1    had no further

dealings with           this    patient.

1    would     describe      him as a. white male,           aged a pp r o x i m a t e l y forty to

fifty years.            He was    quite     heavily built.           1 recall        that he had an

airway        inserted     in his mouth and. I believe               he had a beard.            To the

best of my          recollection he was wearing               the following           clothing an

anorak,       a jumper,        a t shirt and a vest.               I c a n ’t describe     the    clothing

any    better than that.

1 was    then       instructed by lir WARDRQPt: to go to the                    'dirty t h e a t r e 9 to

see    if I could assist there.                Upon arrival        I saw       three or four-

patients on trolleys.                   They al) a p p e a r e d   to have someone with them,                I

went    to a patient a man who                I now know is A n t ho ny BLAND.             There was

someone with the             patient    but    I couldn't      tell you who           he was.     I made

an initial assessment, and saw that the                       patient was           unconscious    but

b reathing         spontaneously.         There was a casualty               card    relating    to the

patient,       by his side and          I saw that someone had recorded his blood

pressure and          pulse as         ’norma) . '    1    then examined him from head to foot,,

J. a sk ed the       person who was with             him exac tl y what had happened but he

was    unable to a ssist apart, from saying                   that     the    patient    had    come from

H i l l s b o r o u g h and he thought        that a stand had          collapsed.       At that, stage

there was          no m en ti on of    crush    injuries.

             ca sualty      record and     1   can produce      this    if necessary.

             1 then dealt with a number of other                   patients      from H i l l s b o r o u g h and to

            the     best of my know)edge          none of these         people    died.      1    finished       in

             On S a tu rd ay    15th April          1989    (150489)        1 was w orking at the hospital and

             sometime      in the afternoon,               I really        cannot   be sure of the time,         my

              bleep was sounded and                1 was    informed that           I was   required urgently          in

             the A ccident        and E m e r g e n c y D epartment          (A & E)    of the hospital.         My

              in fo rm a ti on was     that       there was a paediatric arrest               on the way to the

             hospital.         At the      time     I was    not aware        of any other      details.       I didn't

             know w h e r e    the    patient       was    coming    from or the        circumstances      leading to

             h i s/her   c ond i t ion.

              1 went     immediately            to the A & E. and almost at             the same    time   the

             first a m bu lance arrived.                  I know that        there was a young       boy   in this
                                                                                                             - PAGE.         2

a mb u l a n c e and      I believe      that there was a p o li ce ma n & a m b u l a n c e m a n

w it h him.         The    boy was     brought         into the        r e s u s c it a ti o n    room on a

s tretcher         by the ambulan ce m an .              I went s tr ai gh t           over to this          patient,

he was not breathing,.                 He had no pulse,                 I could not         hear a heart            beat

& he was blue             in colour all         over his          body.

To ge th er w ith other           people       present,         doctors         etc, w h o m      I will     try

i% name      later




D uring    the      course     of a dm in i s t e r i n g    the a bove          t r ea tm en t    I became aware

that    there were other              patients w it h serious                   injuries a r r i v in g at the

hos pi t a l „

Once    the       first    patient was         stable       1 became           involved w it h a y oung man

who    had a r r i v e d at the        hospital.                                                                   He

was    initially assessed, in the                    r e s u s c it a ti o n    room    a nd due        to his

c ondition being            one that         didn't, require           intensive         r e su s c i t a t i o n he was

m o v e d to another          room.      1    did not go w it h this                person.         1   w ou ld

desc ri be        this    patient as a young man a ge d a p p r o x i m a t e l y twen ty                         (HO)

years.        1    cannot    describe         this    person any further a nd do not know                               if

he did or not.              I d o n ’t think he did die & I w o u ld be s u r p ri s ed                            if

he di d ,,

The next          person that        1 had any deal in gs w i t h was a y oung man aged

a p p r o x i m a t e l y t wenty to t wenty five              (20-25)         years w i t h dark          coloured

hair.     He was          brought,    into the        r es u sc i ta t io n     room but          1 am unable           to

say by whom.             He was unconscious,                he w a s n ’t breathing,              he had no

pulses,       he had fixed di la te d            pupils and he was                 blue     in colour.

                                                                       The man was t r a n s f e r r e d

to an ot he r       room.        He was d ef in i t e l y dead w he n he left the

r es us c i t a t i o n   room.     I do not know who t r a n s f e r r e d this           patient    to

a no th er    room.

1 am unahie          to give a better d es c ri p t i o n of this                patient & to date           I

do not know his             identity.

There was a fourth                person who     1 had deal in gs with & to the                 best of

my   recoll ec ti on he was a lr ea dy            in the     r e s u s c it a ti o n   room by the time          I

had fi ni sh ed w ith the above               patient.       He was a y oung mart probably                 in

his mid twenties             ( H O ’s) w i th dark     hair.      He also was u n c on s ci o us and

blue     in colour.          1    can't    remember w he t he r       this    patient     required

cardio       r es piratory        re su sc it at i on or not?     I think he did.




                   This     patient       lived as far as       I am aware.

              The unit          received a telephone                  cai. i via the e me rg e nc y t e le ph on e stating

              that      there was a paediatric                    cardiac a rrest                      on route to the hospital.

              I was      inst ru ct ed by Charge Nurse B AT TY                             to      receive the         patient.

 i nf ormed fay a m b u l a n c e m e n at the hospital                    dealing w it h u n c on n ec t ed

ma tters      that there were first                     of ail       six   <6 ) and then twelve             (1 2 )

am bu l a n c e s       cm route     to the H i l l s b o r o u g h Foot ba ll           ground.

W i t h i n a short time             the first ambulance,                  containing          the   child cardiac

arrest,       had arrived.              The a mbulan ce           crew brought           the    patient straight

into the       r e s u s ci ta ti on      room.         I think       that    there was a p o li ce ma n also

present.            1    remember      that the         paediatri tian             (Dr HET TI NG ER )    had a r ri ve d

at this stage.                 The patient who            I now know was Lee N IC OL




                                                                       T here were        two d oc tors w or ki ng

on this       patient.           One of them was the                  paed:i at r i c ian and        I think    the

other was Miles DAVISON.

The student             nurse was       needed     somewhere           else so the P ol ic e O f fi c e r who

was    present          took over       the   cardiac m a ss a g e           under my s up er vision.             One

of the doctors was                  called away         by this        stage       the   patient       s eemed to

stabiIi se



The other doctor m oved on as she was                                required e lsewhere w i t h other-

patient s.          1 remained w ith the                patient.           After a short         time a sister

from m i dw i f e r y        came    into the      r e s u s c it a ti o n    room and took over            the

manual     v e n t i l a t i o n from myself.              Once      1 was     c onvinced that the sister

was    confident           in what      she was     doing        1   made m yself a v a i l a b l e       elsewhere.

At this         point her father was giving her m ou th to m o ut h & the other

person,         the a m b u l a n c e m a n or       policeman,    was     giving   cardiac massage.            I

d octor     present,        who     1 think was Dr CAUI..DER,                to stop treatment.

V i ct o r i a H I C KS was       then    removed from the            room & taken to the

As soon as V ic to r i a H I C K S was                 removed from the         room a n ot h e r    patient

arrived.           It was a white male w it h dark wavy hair & I think brown

sure about           the top.        He was a g ed        1 8 -HO years.

He was blue           colour      in appearance,           not    brea th in g & w i th o u t   pulse.

stop treatment.               This    patient was also             t aken to the        plaster      room.

I dealt with a further                   two     patients,       both males.        U po n arrival      they

              This was         confirmed         on the television,                     and   I phoned the N o r t h e r n

Tr af fi c was     heavy,     and    I a rr i v e d at      the N o r t h e r n General    at appro;-:

3 .30   pm (1350),        avid went     to the m a i n O p e r a t i n g Theatres.           The staff

referred rue to the C a s u a l t y Department,                  and on arrival,          I j oined a

team of Doctors who were a t t em p ti n g                  to resu sc it at e a young        boy of

about     16 years       of age.

                                    it was     d ec i de d to    cease therapy.

I am not able to offer any i de nt if yi ng                     features     regarding      the

boy,    apart     from stating that            1    think    he had short dark           hair and    had

s uf f er e d a cardiac arrest           before a d m i s s i o n     to the Hospital.

I proc ee de d to ward 60,            w hich had been           cleared for        casualties.

            I left the Hospital              at approx 9.00         p.m.    (8100).

                I am a medical             doctor and I q u a li f ie d from S h e f f i e l d U n i v e r s i t y             in

                On 1st F e b r u a r y        1989       (010E89)    I began w or k in g as a senior               house

                officer at           the Acc id en t and E m e r g e n c y      D e pa r t m e n t of    the N o r t h e r n

               General       Hospital         in Sheffield.

                On S a t u r d a y    "Pi April     1989     (130489)      1 was    off work on            a normal        day off

               and     in the a f t e r n o o n     I was visiting          friends.          In    my frie nd s         house                  in

               Sheffield,            about 3 . 3 3 p m    (1333)    the    t e l e v i s i o i n was s w i t c he d on and I

                learned that           s omething        had hap pe n ed at H i l l s b o r o u g h football             g ro un d in

               S heffield.            1 was aware         that a game was          being     played, there           between

               Liverpool          and N o t t i n g h a m Forest,.

                In the belief that doctors would                       be required,           or    may be required, I

               t ele ph on ed        the hospital where            I work    but was unable to get a reply.                                 I

               d ec id ed then that as there was no                       reply that some th in g was amiss and

so I drove at once to the N o r t he rn Gene ra l Hospital.                        I a r ri v e d about

3 . 4 5 pm (154!:}).     I went     straight    to the A cc i de n t and E m e r g e n c y

Department.        On my arrival          1 saw Mr WARDROPE,            a consultant           in the

h o s p i t a l 7 and he gave me      charge of a patient              on a trolly,           who was

u nconscious and told me to take him to t r ea tm en t                      room     "C v w h i c h    is

s i t u at ed along     the   corridor     from the m a i n      r es c us i ta t io n   room.

There were a number            of doctors and n urse*            in all     of the       rooms     leading

off the main       corridor,        all   busily trea ti ng       patients.         There were no

m embers    of the      public    in the entrance a re a on my arrival.

a c c o m p a n i e d by a nurse.     I have never seen this              lady before and I do

not    believe    she was      from this     hospital.         She     did wear a. nurses

uniform.        On arrival       in treatment        room there was         one other          patient

being treated          by a doctor,       I d o n ’t know the        name of this         lady doctor.

My    patient was a teenage white              boy,    dark brown        curly hair,           wear in g a

red    vT*~shirt,       a L iverpool      s trip shirt and blue           jeans.         He    carried no

identification.

al)   having     fits and all        unconscious,      all     received similar treatment,

given oxygen and          line drips.          All    of these    patients were young                 white

males,     the you ng es t     probably about       14 years a nd the           rest     older        but all

still    in their       teens.      All   of these    patients were admitted, to this

hospital.       I also    received visits        from senior           consultants,           Mr GET'T'S, Dr

RYAN and Mr W A R D R O P E amongst         them.

The   room sometimes          had 3 or 4 patients         in the       room to be treated.

              Other      doctors         did    come t hrough the          room to treat          [patients..

               A1J    the    patients          I a t t e n d e d to wore      blue    jeans w it h dark hair and. red

               people.        1    remember        that none of them             left trea tm en t       room     *C*

               conscious.         About 5 pm        (1700)      I left     the    department,          after    it was

               clear.       I went, into the             ph ys io th e ra p y d ep ar t me n t where         people     from

               the football             ground were being treated for minor                       injuries,        ankle

               sprains and the             like.       Around     this time a lady was             bought       into the

               I s hould e xplain              that, the normal r e s u s c i t a t i o n     room is        immediately off

               the entrance             to the     ac ci de nt and e m e r ge n cy department.,                I was not

               involved       in this          room.     Other     nearby     rooms were        being       used as

              a dditional          resuscitation          rooms and this             includes    the     room    in w h i ch          1

              ope rat ions.

               I did not examine any dead bodies                         or    pronounce      life extinct          on any

              patient.         The      piaster        room became       the mortuary,          L wasn't        in this          room.

              The body had. a l r e a d y been stripp ed of                        clothing by P olice Officers*                     1

              was aware that              the girls father was w ai t in g                 outside     the    room d emanding

              to see his daughter,                  so    1    was* w a it in g    in readiness       to wheel        the    body

               round     in order         for the        father      to    iden ti fy the body.          A s creen was

              e-rected ready for the                    i d e n ti fi c at i on but for some u nk n ow n           reason     it

              did not go a he ad at that stage.

               1 do not         recall      how long          I had been w ai t in g w i t h this         body,       all    time

              from arrival             at the hospital             escapes me.

              W hen               returned      to the M o r t u a r y together we w he el ed                the    body across

              to the Mortuary.

              We were          i nstructed to           put the      body to one side           in the M o r t u a r y      by who

              X presume was a Dr,                 he was a fairly              large g e nt le ma n and       I believe he

              rnay well         have    cortte from the City Mortuary.                     I a s su m e d he was a. Dr

              purely b e c - a u se he was w earing a w hi te                      coat.    After    leaving the

              d e c e a s e d to one       side     1    went    straight         back to the     plaster      room another

                        a gai n he had been st ri p pe d of all                      clothing.

                 I make        this sta te me nt       on the u n d e r s ta n di n g    that       I can take a

                 Shortly        before       1500 hr?     (1500)    on S a t u r d a y   15 April             -1989 (150489)               I

                 was    in the Police Control               Box at S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y Football                    Ground.

                 Also     in the      box at this        time were C hief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t               DUCKENFIELD,

                 C hief    Inspector MCR0BB1F. was               in plain      clothes          in fact he was w ea ri ng a

                 blue     blazer.        About    this time        there was an          incident where                     fans    came

                 out of the two              central    pens    in the West S t a nd terraces                       onto the track

                 I remember Chief              Inspector MCROBB IE going down onto the                                pitch to

assist WPC R I C H A R D S O N to move              these    fans off the track               t hr ou gh the

gate     into Pens           1 and 2.

It was about               this time     that    things     became    busy and the disas te r began

to unfold.               There was a lot of noise             in the Police            box and from

outside and              1 became      busy using the VHP           radio w h i ch      1 would, norm al ly

only m onitor and at the same time                        trying     to moni to r what was                going

on,    both on the screens                and     outside     the     control box.

I do not           recall     Chief     Inspector M G R O B 8 IE coming         back        into the control

box    but       certainly about          this    time our ACC Mr J AC K SO N              came    into the

box.       Mr J A C K S O N and Mr D U C K E N F I E L O had a c o n v e r s at i on and the only

points       1     can recall are to do with getting                    o pe r at i on support and to do

w it h the         public order sit ua t io n w i t h        crowds      coming onto the                pitch from

the    rear of the            c an tilever      stand   (North)      as there are           no fences          there.

C er t a i n l y       I heard no m e n t i o n during      this     c o nv e rs a ti o n of any gates

being opened.

So m et i me after Mr J A C K S O N          came    into   the    control      box,       Mr G r a h a m K ELLY

from the FA and Mr M A C K K E L L , the C l u b S ecretary,                        came    into    the box,            as

1   recall         it they were         in the area by the door.                1    can't     remember

a nyone      else being w it h them.                Mr K EL LY then had a c o n v e r s a t i o n with

C hi ef S u p e r i n t e n d e n t DUCKENF IB.L.D arid during           the    course of that

c o nv e rs a ti on       I. recall     him saying      to the effect          that a gate          had been

f or c ed ami there had been an in rush of L iverpool                                s up po r te r s     into the

ground.            1    cannot   now    remember any other           spec if ic s     of their

c on v e r s a t i o n so far as         I am c o nc er ne d w he n Mr DUG KL IMF IELD             was talking

to Mr KELLY about                this   gate      being f or ce d he was relating                  the

W h e n the        concertina, gate C was            o pe ne d for the first            time      for what        I

now know to be an ej ec ti on by the Police,                          and I saw nothing                 u nt o wa r d

in him s a y i n g t h a t .

            place and furth er mo re       it w ould have been       impossible       because    u nk no wn to

          THE CORONER:       G ood morning, Mrs- Nicol.                I a m s o r r y we
had the i n terlude b e f o r e we carne to y o u r s o n ' s Inquest but
it is o b v i o u s l y important in e v e r y o n e ' s i n t e r e s t s that
p o i n t s be m ade as soon as possible.            It doesn't affect you
d i r e c t l y in any w a y and forg i v e me that we dealt with it
f ir s t -

           If I can just d e s c r i b e for you what we intend to do so
that y o u can h ave an idea of the procedure, in a moment I am
g o i n g to rea d to you what I then did on I think the 19th
April when I o p e n e d the Inquest.                  I will read that to you
a n d whe n I hav e r ead that to you I am g o i n g to tell you what
the b lood alcohol levels w e r e b e c a u s e a l t h o u g h Lee did not,
in fact, die on the day whe n most pe o p l e did, the alcohol
l evels wer e s u b s e q u e n t l y m e a s u r e d and we k now what the y were
so I will tell you so that you k n o w and so that the Jury
know.         T hen we will listen to Dr. Holt, who is the
P a t h o logist, who will give us her account of the p a t h o l o g y
a n d Dr. A p p l e y a r d is in Court.             You p r o b a b l y know Dr.
A p p l e y a r d but. we don't and Dr. A p p l e y a r d is g oing to tell us
a little bit about th e clinical as p e c t of Lee.                         When he has
f i n i s h e d we will hav e the p r e s e n t i n g O f f i c e r who will
present a s u m m a r y of the rest, of the e v i d e n c e and p o s s i b l y
o v e r l a p with some of what we have heard.                       Finally, I n spector
L a y t o n will corne and describe, first of all, the visual
e v i d e n c e and d e m o n s t r a t e on t h e s e p l a n s what he has been
t a 1k i n g a b o u t . Whe n you h e a r Ins p e c t o r L a y t o n you may think
I am a bit c o n f u s e d and I don't kno w what is g oing on
b e c a u s e he is r e f e r r i n g to all t h e s e plans, n u m b e r s and so
on.       It will b e c o m e c l e a r e r as soo n as he walks r o u n d to
t h e s e plans.

          Apart from Dr. Holt and Dr. Appleyard, e v e r y b o d y has
a l r e a d y t a k e n the Oat h and s o the y won't be r e s w o r n but you

wishes, in respect of t hose two people.              Is that c l e a r ?

                                       I w r o t e to you - you p r o b a b l y d o n ’t r e m e m b e r - on 27th

                             the names c o r r e c t l y spelt, there were no o t h e r names.                  In
                             o t h e r words, all the d e t a i l s were right.            Y o u c o n f i r m that

                             death and that we will be h e a r i n g in a moment about that.
                             As I say, the b lood alcohol was a c t u a l l y m e a s u r e d in the
                             c ase of Lee, not by Dr. Forrest but by s o m e b o d y e lse at the
                             N o r t h e r n General (Dr. Holt will c o n f i r m this) and the result
                             was negative.

                    E   Q.   Dr. Holt, the first thing I think we need to deal with is
                             that you are d e a l i n g with the post m o r t e m in r e l a t i o n to a
                             y o u n g s t e r k n o w n as Lee Nicol, is that ri g h t ? - A- Yes.

                        Q. Y o u have h e a r d he was i d entified to you by an Officer,
                           Mr. Burnlees, is that c o r r e c t ? - A. Yes, that is correct,
                           yes.

                        Q.  In y o u r post m o r t e m report, if you w o u l d deal with the time
                            of death first, yo u have a c t u a l l y s h o w n it as 18.4.89? -
                        A . Yes.

                        Q. Do you feel that is, in fact, c o r r e c t ? - A. Yes, this is the
                           t ime that the o r g a n s were r e m o v e d for t ransplantation.           I
                           h ave d i s c u s s e d this with Dr. Neil A p p l e y a r d who wa s t r e a t i n g
                    q      the patient at the time and we feel that a more correct date
                           of death is the 17th of the 4th 1989, 2000 h ours whe n b r a i n
                           d e a t h was declared.

                        Q.   In o t h e r words, the tim i n g of organ transp l a n t a t i o n .   Do you
                             nee d the n o t e s ?          Dr. Holt ought to have the n o t e s in case
                             she w a n t s to r e f e r to them.         I t hink the organ
                             t r a n s p l a n t a t i o n took place, at about 2 am ? - A. Yes.

                         Q. At 200 0 hours, yes.         Are you q u i t e satisfied, Dr. Holt, that
                            the correct t i m i n g of d eath in a s i t u a t i o n such as this is a
                     g      t i m e when the b r a i n s t e m d eath c r i t e r i a are s a t i s f i e d r a t h e r
                            t h a n a time when the or g a n s are t a k e n out? - A. Yes, that is
                            correct.

                         A. The c ause of death was cerebral a n o x i a due to t r a u m a t i c
                            asphyxia, a c u t e b r o n c h i t i s and b r o n c h o p n e u m o n i a contributed.

                         Q. That       is u n d e r 2? - A. That         is u n d e r Part    2.

                     D          and why you come to that c o n c l u s i o n ? - A- At the t ime of the
                                accident t here was o b v i o u s l y a c r u s h i n g effect and the
                                c o n t e n t s of the s t o m a c h w ere inhaled.    This, of course, cut

                              . this, the brain, of course, does swell.                   This is the
                                cerebral anoxia, cerebral swelling.                 Also the i n h a l a t i o n of

                                bronchopneumonia.

                         Q.    I think you did a c t u a l l y hav e a look at the b rain as one
                               w ould n o r m a l l y do ? - A. That is correct, yes.

                         Q.    I b e l i e v e that you took th e view, ha v i n g seen it, that that
                               brain had been d a m a g e d for q u i t e som e t i m e ? - A- I took the
                               view that h a v i n g e x a m i n e d the b r a i n t h o r o u g h l y
                               m i c r o s c o p i c a l l y and h i s t o l o g i c a l l y that the brain had been

                               when the gastric c o n t e n t s were inhaled.

                         Q.    If that is so, d e s p i t e all efforts, n o t h i n g could h ave bee n
                               d one to r e t r i e v e the s i t u a t i o n ? - A- I am afr a i d not, no.
                     G
                         Q.    B e c a u s e it doesn't    repair,     does    it,    the b rain c e l l s ? - A-        It
                               is irreparable.

                              da m a g e was much m o r e s e v e r e than we first thought.

                        Q.        THE CORONER:          P e r h a p s I w o u l d just ask you one
                    D        question.  H a v i n g k n o w n about L e e ' s wi s h e s and m um's

                    E
                        Q.   Is it right, is it, that the o r g a n s were,                in fact,      used for

                             wa s used.  The lungs weren't used but the heart v a l v e s were
                             used.   The heart was too small to fit into any rec i p i e n t in

                             the plan has been amended.

                    E        feel you cannot a n s w e r the question...          C o u l d you just come

                             an d that is this;         you hav e h e a r d about the timing.       What
                             was the t i m i n g w h e n he was m o v e d 1512 and give me Dr-

                        Q. You have h e a r d Dr. Hut s o n took th e view that it was too late
                           but he persisted.                In fact, he w a s right, of course,, in the
                           event but he did th e right t h i n g at the time.                  What I am
                    G      interested in is this; we k now that Lee cam e to the hospital
                           and he c l e a r l y had a lot of medical input from the n u m b e r s
                           of p e o p l e who were involved.           You said he was ma k i n g
                           s p a s m o d i c e f f o r t s initially and, in fact, t h e r e was a slight
                           r e s p o n s e from his pupil at one point and, of course, I take
                           it you were v e n t i l a t i n g him with the a p p r o p r i a t e a m o u n t s of
                           o x y g e n one could p o s s i b l y give in the c i r c u m s t a n c e s an d yet
                           he died.          What I am interested in is that here we hav e got a
                H          lad and in a s e n s e n o t h i n g mor e c o u l d be d one for him,

                                        THE CORONER:      Mrs. Nicol, that is all the e v i d e n c e we
                              are g oing to take at this stage.                 Lee is a n o t h e r one of

                              deal of publicity, as you will kno w b e t t e r than I do.
                              W h e t h e r that, is helpful or not, the only pe r s o n who can
                              judge is you and so I will say n o t h i n g about that.

                    G         alw a y s think of that at the time.                    Secondly, you felt able
                              at the t ime to h o n o u r his w i s h e s and, as we h ave alre a d y

telephone.           J'. spoke      to Charge Nurse BATTY who was at that                     time Nurse
                                                                                                                      f
in Charge          of the Accident            and E m e r g e n c y Department.         He told me that

he had received a message                     from the        police    saying that      there was       some         /

form of       incident at H il ls b o r o u g h and we were                  to expect    some    casualties..

At that      time there was              no   indication that          this was a major          incident.

1 left home          immediately at            13H3    (13 S3) , a rr iving at the N or th er n

Genera 1 at        1333     i "1333) .

On my arrival             at the North er n General             Hospital       it was obvious         that

this was a serious               incident,          since    there were alre ad y three ambulances

at the a m bulance           entrance.          1    immedi at el y    ran into the       department and

con fi rm ed w it h Charge Nurse BATTY that                         he had    implemented the Hospital

Major     Incident Plan.              At that time there were                 three   patients       in the

R es u s c i t a t i o n Room undergoing             cardio    pulmonary       resuscitation and some

less ser iously            injured, in the Accident D e p a r t m e n t .

P re pa r at i on s were well          under way to           ready the department          for a Major

Incident       but    1    w ould    point out we           received, no adequate         noti fi ca ti on of

the scale of this event.

A lmost     immediately a second wave                   of a m bu la nc es arrived.         These were

carrying       large numbers           of seriously           ill   patients from the        incident at

H i l l s b o r o u g h Stadiuni.      Some were        having active          cardio    pulmonary

resuscitation,             be ing    in a state of cardiac arrest.                    Others we re deeply

unconscious.              Others were having severe                 fits.     At this    time    1

a t t e m pt e d to sort      the     patients        into    various    categories       (TRIAGE),      but      I

found myself         having         to help with the           treatment      of these     patients.

As more staff a r ri ve d             I was able        to concentrate         on the    triage and

m an ag e me n t   role and         by about        "1343 (1343)      there was adequate         staff       in

the d epartment and also                 the d o cu me nt at io n triage        point    had been set

up,   a l lo wi ng   the use of the            pre-planned Major              incident hospital

notes.     Also about         this     time    the     resus ci ta ti on area was        becoming      full

and we were still             receiving many ser io us ly               ill   patients and about             this
                                                                                                          P AGE---
                                                                                                          •S139HA

point      I took the decision to send                      patients who         had no cardiac           output

direct       to the mortuary.                 Prior to this          point    patients with no            cardiac

output who were               having active          cardio        pulmonary     resuscitation had been

sent     to the R e s u s c i t a t i o n R oom to try and. re-start the                      heart and

assist with their                breathing.

I feel       1 must       give     this     background since our d o c u m e nt at io n of the

earlier          treatment       of many of the           patients        is not s a t i s f a c t o r y , but   I

w is h to make           it a b s o l u t e l y   clear   that      the   staff were      st re tc he d    in

trying to provide urgent                     life saving           treatment     to the huge       number of

patients.

T h i r t e en    patients were           brought to the N o r t h e r n General              Hospital      on

that day and s u b s eq ue nt ly died.                    f ro m    the medical       records     in my

possession and also with the help of                               post m or t e m evidence       provided by

HM Coroner,           1 am able         to give the following                details    of the treatment

                   This young         boy was      brought         in as a cardiac arrest.

                  Resuscitation            resulted       in return of normal             cardiac     output,

                   but    he did not breath on his own.                      He was     therefore

                  tr an sferred to the General                     Intensive Care Unit and            1 believe

                  he died on the             Intensive Care Unit              three    days   later.

                  There      is no definite          docume nt ar y evidence            in the medical

                  notes that Mr HAMM ON D             received         resuscitation,         but the      post­

                  m or t e m states



                  3 would, interpret              this as     it being       probable he did enter               the

                  R e s u s c i t a t i o n Roo m of the N o r t h e r n General
Hospital,,         but a cardiac tracing         showed    no cardiac a ct iv it y

and    in view of the          large number      of patients      present at     the

time,      resus ci ta ti on a tt empts were        not taken any further.

B arry BENNETT

 There     is no docume nt ar y evidence           in the hospital      notes

to suggest          that Mr BENNETT      received      resuscitation.

Howe ve r     the    post mortem      reports shows       there was

                                                   wh ic h w ould    indicate    some

attempts          had been made at      resuscitation.

V i ct o r i a HICKS

There      is definite       hospital    and    post mortem evidence

that Miss H ICKS           received intensive         r es uscitation efforts

after     being      brought    in in a state of         cardiac arrest    but

u n f o r t u n a t e l y , these efforts were     not successful.

resus ei ta ti on efforts.

Ada m SPE AR RI TT

There     is definite       evidence     in the medical       notes    that Mr

S P E A RR IT T was    brought    into the department         in a state of

cardiac arrest and             resus ci ta ti on attempts were        initially

successful          in re-starting      his    heart and he was t ra ns fe rr ed

to the      Intensive Care Unit.              However,    shortly after    his

gentlemen? Would it be very inconvenient for you?  I would
like to do what we are planning to do today.  We will be as
quick as we can, but as I said, I want to do it properly and I
want you to know what we are talking about.  We will listen, I
think, to Mr. Wardrobe next, and then we will break for a few
minutes and then come back and do Prof. Usher and the two
Inquests.  All right? We will certainly do one of the
Inquests.

                   JAMES WARDROBE Sworn

                      By THE CORONER:

Mr. Wardrobe, can you give me your full names, position and
qualifications? - A . My name is James Wardrobe. I am
consultant in Accident & Emergency Medicine to the Sheffield
Health Authority based at the Northern General Hospital,
Sheffield.

And in fact there are two consultants in A & E at the moment?
- A . At the moment. At the time of Hillsborough I was the
only o n e .

You were the only one.  Could you give your qualifications as
well, so that we know what you have got? - A. I am a Bachelor
of Medicine and Surgery, University of Edinburgh, I hold a
Fellowship in General Surgery from the Royal College of
Surgeons of Edinburgh and a Fellowship in General Surgery from
the Royal College of Surgeons, England.  I also hold the
Fellowship in Accident & Emergency Medicine and Surgery from
the Royal College of Surgeons and Physicians of Edinburgh.

Mr. Wardrobe, the reason why I have asked you to come is
because I want you to very briefly describe the set up or at
least what happened at the Northern General so that we can
understand a little bit better the problems that you faced,
and also what happened to one or two of the cases.  Can you
perhaps outline for me, it is quite a big department.  I think
you say about 55,000 patients a year.  Is that right? - A.
Yes, sir, there are 55,000 attendances per year to the
department.

And that is 365 days a year, is not it? - A. Yes, sir.

And I worked that out at about 150 a day.      Would you agree? -
A. That is correct, on average.

Of those 150, and obviously this is just an average figure,
how many are admissions? - A. Our admission rate is about 10%
of that total.

So about 15 per day? - A. yes.

Of those 15 how many would you expect to go to the intensive
care unit or the coronary care unit? - A. There would be on
average about one seriously ill patient per day.
                                                                       J.   WARDROBE


                         3. So really, quite a small number to intensive care? - A. Who
                            are seriously ill, yes.

                         3. The others obviously need treatment and help? - A. Yes.

                              But they are not life threatening? - A. That is correct.

                              Now, the department is set up with the usual facilities,
                     B        including a resuscitation room? - A. That is corrcct.

                              And the resuscitation room has got how many beds or tables
                              within there? - A. There are two beds in the resuscitation
                              area.

                              So you are   really aiming to be able to cope with two     seriously
                              ill people   at any one time? - A. Yes.

                              On the day in question on the 15th how many doctors were
                              actually on duty, A & E doctors? - A. There were two accident
                              and emergency doctors on duty.

                              That is the average number for the hospital? - A. There are
                              always two on.
                     D   3.   Both SHOs o r .... - A. Both Senior House Officers, yes.

                         3.   You carry a bleeper.   Were you on call that day? - A. I was on
                              call that day, yes.

                         Q.   That does not mean you have got to be at the hospital? - A.
                              No.
                     E Q.     You have got to be contactable? - A. Yes.

                         Q.   In fact, you were contacted? - A. Yes.

                         Q. What time was it? About half-past-3 or so? - A. At about
                            15.23 I was contacted.

                         Q.   And you made your way to the hospital? - A. Yes.

                         Q.   Can you remember about what time you arrived? - A. 15.33.

                         Q.   At that point had any patients arrived then? - A. Yes, and
                              there were three patients in the resuscitation area and three
                              also were in other parts of the department.

                     G   Q. So at that time about six patients had arrived? - A. Yes.

                         Q. And then within the next hour how many patients approximately
                            did you receive? - A. 87 patients.

                         Q. So you got more than half-a-day's work, on average, within an
                            hour? - A. Yes.

                     H Q.     And of those patients how many went to the coronary care unit
                              - I mean intensive care or coronary care? - A. There were 17

                                                                   J.   WARDROBE


                         patients went to intensive care u n i t s .

                     Q   So a large number? - A. yes.

                    Q    In addition to that there were also patients who never made it
                         to coronary care, unfortunately, who were dead? - A. That is
                         correct.

                    BP
                         And I think you made arrangements - I don't know whether you
                         did it or whether this is part of your planning - that one of
                         the plaster rooms should act as a temporary mortuary.  Is that
                         right? - A. Yes, sir, that is part of the major incident plan
                         for the hospital.

                    Q    So that was a pre-planned arrangement? - A. Yes.

                    G>   Obviously the department was overrun with patients, I think it
                         would be fair to say? - A. We were extremely busy, especially
                         initially, yes.

                    Q    And it is probably true to say, is not, Mr. Wardrobe, that in
                         those circumstances yours and everybody e l s e 's objective was
                         to try and help those who could be helped? - A. That is
                         correct.
                    D
                    Q    Paper came a very long second? - A. I am afraid that is
                         correct.

                    Q    I am not in any sense criticising you for it.  I am just
                         trying to establish the facts so that we know.  The upshot of
                         that is that documentation for at least some of the patients
                         either does not exist or is not adequate.  Is that right? - A.
                    E    That is correct, yes.

                    Q    Now, we will come to the individuals who have died in a
                         moment, but you I think, having initially had to help with the
                         actual resuscitation of individuals, but as soon as some more
                         doctors came down from various parts of the hospital you in
                         fact cast yourself in a different role, did not you? - A. That
                         is correct, yes.

                    Q    And what was that role? - A. My role in the major incident
                         plan is to stand at the ambulance receiving door and see every
                         patient as they come through that door, and to try and
                         categorise those patients into those that require immediate
                         care to safe life, those who have obviously serious injuries
                         and require admission, those who have got minor injuries but
                         require treatment to the minor injuries area, and those who
                    G    are dead.

                    Q    And the technical word for that is "triage",      is not it? -
                         A. That is correct, yes.

                    Q . And really the objective is to sort out those patients for
                         whom the limited number of doctors/nurses have got to be aimed
                    H    at? - A. Yes.

. With the hope of doing the most good? - A. Yes.

. And people who have only got a minor injury, and that might
  mean a broken arm, would have to wait? - A. Yes.

. Painful or not. - A. Yes.

. If there is a life threatening situation? - A. Absolutely.

. I think part of the major incident planning is that people
  should get tagged with different coloured labels? - A. That is
  correct.

. And they are given Majex numbers, I think is what you call it?
  - A. That is correct.

. In fact, the different coloured labels were never used.    You
  just used white labels, I think? - A. Yes.

. And would I be right in saying that in the end everybody did
  get a Majex number? - A. Eventually, some time after the1
  event.

. They may not have got them straight away, but they did in the
  end finish up with numbers? - A. Yes.

. So it is possible to identify the people who died, and I think
  excluding Adam Spearritt and Lee Nicol, there were 11.  Is
  that right? - A. That is correct, yes.

. By their Majex numbers? - A. Yes.

. Have you got a copy of your statement? - A. Yes, I have.

. Before we come to that I just wanted to dispose of one other
  matter.  The people who dealt with the numbering once the
  system worked are medical records officers? - A. That is
  correct, y e s .

. It is their task.   They are not medics? - A. No.

. They are admin people, but it is their task to do the
  labelling and the administration so one knows who is who and
  where they are? - A. Yes.

. And of course, they had to deal with all the live ones as well
  as all the people who had died? - A. That is correct, yes.

. If we turn to your statement and in particular I think it is
  your statement of the 6th.  I want to go through one or two of
  these because I have a few problems with some of the
  information and I want to be clear in my own mind. Majex  No.
  2 is Lee Nicol? - A. Yes.

. And he is a lad who actually went up to the intensive care
  unit? - A. That is correct.

                         q. And there are notes about him, proper hospital notes and
                            records? - A. Yes.

                               So we will leave him.        Philip Hammond, who is No. 8, is that
                               right? - A. Yes.

                         <4. He was at the hospital because he had a Majex number? - A.
                             Yes .
                     B         But there is no documentary evidence as to what happened? - A.
                               That is correct.

                         (|. Except that there are some ECG electrode marks on him? - A.
                             The post mortem report did state there were three ECG
                             electrodes attached to his chest.

                     O' .     And you can attempt to help me with this by trying to explain
                              how that could have happened.      Could you tell me what your
                              best guess, shall we say, is? - A. In the initial part of the
                              incident I was sending people who came in with a cardiac
                              arrest, patients undergoing mouth to mouth resuscitation and
                              external cardiac massage, I' sent them to the resuscitation
                              ^ b o m ■initially to see whether they could have a chance of
                              being brought round'," to start the heart going.    The fact that
                     D        the only post mortem evidence were three ECG electrodes, I
                              think possibly he was sent to the resuscitation room but the
                              EGG showed no cardiac activity, and because of the great
                              pressure on the resuscitation beds at that time he would be
                              sent to the mortuary.

                         a . To the mortuary,        yes.   Then No. 9 is Barry Bennett,   I believe?
                              - A. Yes.
                     E
                         (I. And again,  it is exactly the same, there is a needle mark but
                              no record in the hospital? - A. No record in the notes, no.

                         o .Vi c t o r i a Hicks,   No. 20. - A. Yes.

                         CI . There is obviously post mortem evidence that something was
                              attempted for this young lady? - A. Yes.

                         0   . And there is in fact, I believe, quite a lot of medical
                               evidence that people tried? - A. Yes.

                         o . Are there actually any properly written up notes in respect of
                              this girl? - A. There are no properly written up notes, but I
                              know from other people that she was in the resuscitation room
                              and had intensive resuscitation attempts.
                     G
                         Q . So although the notes are defective you are satisfied from the
                             information you have been given by the doctors that attempts
                             were made.  We will find out later quite a lot of attempts
                             were made. - A. Yes.

                             . No. 21 is Stephen Harrison? - A . Yes.
                     H

                           post mortem or in the hospital records.      Is that right? - A.
                           No.

                        <J). I beg your pardon.  There is a medical record.   I misread it.
                             - A. There is no definite evidence in medical records, sir,
                             but from the post mortem report it would appear that Mr,
                             Harrison received intensive resuscitation efforts.

                    Bf     Let us just get this right, because I have confused myself.
                           There is post mortem evidence of intensive therapeutic
                           efforts? - A. Yes.

                           Is there a medical record as well? - A. And there is evidence
                           in medical records, yes.

                        4>. When you say "medical record", are you saying it is actually
                            in the notes? - A. In the notes, yes.

                        (^. So there are proper hospital notes which actually refer to
                            this person by name, so to speak, or at least by number? - A.
                            Yes.

                      <f). Adam Spearritt, No. 29, you know I think that attempts were
                           made to help this lad, and he in fact he went all the way up
                    D      to intensive care? - A. Yes.

                     <[). And unfortunately arrested there, but I have actually seen his
                          notes.  In fact, I have got them here, and I can't find
                          anything in them, and yet you seem to say that there is
                          evidence in the medical notes.  Can you just with regard to
                          that? - A. There is nothing in the medical notes but there is
                          the hospital major incident list which notes all the patients
                    E who     were admitted on that day, and that list clearly states
                          that he went to the intensive care unit.

                        0. I see.  When you are saying there is definite evidence in the
                           medical notes you are basing it on the fact somebody has made
                           a record in your register, so to speak, what happened to him?
                           - A. Yes.

                          But you could not from that register say precisely what was
                          done? - A. No.

                           What about No. 30, Gary Jones?  Is the position the same
                           there? - A. No, there is evidence in the hospital notes and
                           from the post mortem record that Mr. Jones received intensive
                           resuscitation efforts.
                    G
                        3. So he must have come into the resuscitation unit? - A. Yes.

                          No. 61, Stephen O'Neill, there is some evidence from post
                          mortem but nothing in your notes? - A. Yes.

                          Now, the one that gives me a bit of problem with is Paul
                          Brady, No. 62.   I believe there is a statement from a Dr.
                    a     Jacobs? - A. Yes.

                               unsuccessful? - A. Yes.

                        (j).   Mr. Jacobs I think is actually a consultant,      is not he? - A.
                               He has recently become a consultant, yes.

                    gG.        He is a fairly senior doctor anyway? - A. Oh, yes.

                        0.     But there is nothing in the notes? - A. No.

                        <!.     And there is nothing on the PM findings either? - A. That is
                               correct, yes.

                        <$. And I think you said you thought he was triaged as dead? - A.
                            Yes .

                        ({».    Is that in fact possible, because if Mr. Jacobs did
                               resuscitation on him, if he had been triaged as dead he would
                               have been diverted to the post mortem room, would not he? - A.
                               That is correct, yes.

                        (I.    Whereas if Mr. Jacobs worked     on   him he must have been diverted
                    D          somewhere else? - A. Yes.

                        c|».    Can you help me on that? What do you think actually happened?
                               - A. It is very hard to be sure, given the circumstances.   I
                               know that I did send at least four people to the mortuary in
                               the latter stages of the incident coming in as dead because of
                               the great pressure on the resuscitation area, and I made the
                               statement only with the evidence I had before me - that was
                    E          medical notes - and that given to me, the post mortem reports.
                               Usually if someone has had resuscitation attempts there will
                               be a needle, ECG electrodes, some indication that there has
                               been resuscitation.  I can't explain it.

                     (j>. What I am trying to find out from you is are you saying if Mr,
                          Jacobs did do resuscitation on this young man could he had
                          been triaged as dead? - A. no.

                     d). He could not have been, could he? - A. No.

                     <j). That is really all I am trying to establish.            No. 63 is David
                          Thomas.  Is that right? - A. Yes.

                     <|). And there    is no evidence at all about him,  and you conclude
                          that this must have been one of the people whom you triaged
                    G as dead? - A. Yes.
                     (j). No. 64 is John Gilhooley, and again we have got post mortem
                          evidence but nothing else.   Is that right? - A. Yes.

                      Cj). Philip Steele, No. 99, is in the same situation as Paul Brady.
                           Dr. Caulder and Dr. Davidson I think were involved with this
                    jj     man;  not for very long;  but they were involved.  Would
                           accept that that is correct? - A. If they say so, yes.

                    ^Cl        If they say so, and if they do say that would it be right to
                               say he could not have been triaged as dead? - A. Yes.

                        q. Because he would have been in a different part? - A. Yes, the
                           resuscitation unit.

                        <i. No. 119, Arthur Horrocks, I believe Dr. Nidu - do you know Dr

                        (ji.    I think had something to do with this gentleman. Again,  if
                               that is so could he have been triaged as dead or not? - A
                               No, if someone underwent a resuscitation attempt he would
                               not have been.

                        (j).    He would not have been triaged as dead.   That is not say he
                               was not in fact dead, but you would not have triaged   him as
                               such? - A. No.

                            . Now, traumatic asphyxia is not something,   fortunately, you
                              have many cases of? - A. No.

                        O,     But you had quite a lot on this day? - A. Yes.

                    Do         And I think you observed that from reconstructions of what you
                               have seen - what was your observation with regard to people
                               who came in in cardiac arrest, that is what I want to ask? -
                               A. Some people who came in in cardiac arrest we were able to
                               get the heart going, but unfortunately in the three cases we
                               did that none of these patients survived.   The longest that
                               one survived was the young boy, Lee Nic ol, who unfortunately
                               was brain dead.
                    E
                        o.     Would it be fair to say that everybody who came in in cardiac
                               arrest in fact died? - A. Yes.

                        Q.     We all know about cardiac arrest and heart massage.     Are you
                               saying then that if a person is in cardiac arrest there is not
                               any point in attempting it? - A. No.     There is a great move
                               afoot at the present to encourage people to perform cardiac
                               arrest (s i c ) because in a patient having a cardiac arrest in
                               the street, for instance, then given the ideal circumstances
                               then there is a reasonable chance of that patient being
                               resuscitated, but it does require a lot of effort and a lot of
                               infrastructure in the community to back that up.

                        0      So what you are saying, it can work in ideal situations? - A.
                    G          In ideal situations it can work, yes.

                               Is there any difference between a person who arrests, say,
                               because of myocardial infarct as opposed to somebody who
                               arrests because of traumatic asphyxia as to the chances of
                               resuscitation? - A. I would say that I have no experience
                               personally of resuscitating anyone from traumatic asphyxia who
                               has had a cardiac arrest, but it is a very rate condition.
                    H          But also I know of no case reports in the literature where
                               that has occurred.  I think perhaps the other situation where

                           'easons. In my experience I have been able to restart the
                           leart in these cases, but again if the arrest has occurred
                           jutwith hospital these patients have died from the effects on
                          Ithe brain of the hypoxia.

                     Q. In other words, what you are saying is if you have a cardiac

                         more serious situation than cardiac arrest on its own? - A.
                        |Yes

                               THE CORONER:   Mr. Fraser?

                                         Cross-Examined by MR. FRASER:

                          Just very briefly, over what period did this disaster plan
                          which the hospital put into effect last? Obviously we know
                          you arrived at the hospital shortly after 3.30.  At what time,
                          if at all, was the disaster plan stood down, as it were? - A.
                          The disaster plan was not officially stood down as far as I am
                          aw a r e .

                     ^ 1 It was an ongoing thing in terms of treatment? - A. Yes.

                     Q.| Do you know what time it was put into effect? - A. The
                         hospital disaster plan was put into effect at 15.27.

                     Q.J So within 20 minutes of the game having been stopped some
                          little distance away the hospital was in full swing? - A. Yes.

                     g.| I am sorry, I will rephrase that.  The hospital was alerted
                         that it was going to go on to full swing? - A. The hospital
                         was alerted at that time that a major incident was taking
                         place.

                     Qj And you were called in? - A. I was actually called in prior to
                        th a t .

                     B|   I appreciate that.  Once the decision is made how long does it
                          take to put the plan into effect? - A. That will depend on
                          circumstances.  In this circumstance we had to try and put
                          the plan into effect at the same time as having to treat
                          large numbers of seriously ill patients, which does
                          compound the problem.

                     qI. I appreciate that, and hence the learned Coroner's comment
                    G I about paperwork coming a poor second, and I think on behalf of
                         the families that is understandable in the circumstances.
                         What comes over clearly is that there was a disaster plan put
                         into effect within 20 minutes of the disaster, and it was one
                         which hopefully operated to the best of the resources
                         available.  Can you tell me briefly what extra staffing is
                         brought in once the disaster plan is put into effect? Can you
                         give us an idea of the numbers involved? - A. The numbers
                    H involved in the hospital plan overall are really enormous. I
                         think giving an instance, there were 25 anaesthetists involved

                              in a very short space of time in the disaster plan, and these
                              very skilled doctors were essential in treating the effects of
                              hypoxia especially in the intensive care unit, and there are
                              not many hospitals have 25 anaesthetists in total.  So we were
                              fortunate in having them, but the numbers who responded to the
                              incident ran into hundreds.

                              I am most grateful to you.   Thank you.

                              So within a very short there were an awful lot of people
                              there? - A. Yes, sir.

                        Cl.   Well, a relatively short time, anyway.         - A. Yes.

                    Co.        Can we be a bit more precise.  When did you have 25
                              anaesthetists present, approximately? - A. Approximately
                              within two hours.

                        4).    Within two hours.  So it did take a little while to get a full
                              complement? - A. Yes.  There would be an initial rush and then
                              I am not sure when the last anaesthetist arrived.

                    D              THE CORONER:   Is everything clear, members of the Jury?
                              Yes? When we are at the Medico-Legal Centre I won't have to
                              sit with my back to you.  I am very sorry about that.

                                   Ladies and gentlemen, what we are going to do is to rise
                              for a few minutes because we need a break, and then. Prof.
                              Usher, we will listen to you, if we may, and go from your
                              introduction, so to speak, straight into the Inquest.

                                   THE CORONER:   Members of the Jury, I understand you had
                              difficulty hearing me.  I apologise.  At the Medico-Legal
                              centre it will be easier for all of us, but if you can't hear
                              then - who is the Foreman - then get out and shout.  Do
                              something to attract my attention, because I want you to be
                              able to participate and to hear.

                                   Right, Prof. Usher?

                    G <|).    Good afternoon, Prof. Usher, before we begin I want to tell
                              you one thing.  You have just taken the oath, but in a few
                              minutes I am going to ask you to take another one, because
                              what I am asking you to do now is to talk in general terms,
                              and then I want you to take the oath in respect of the PMs
                              which you dealt with, just so that you know why I am doing
                              that. - A. Yes.
                    H0.       Prof. Usher, you are Alan Usher, that is right? - A. Yes, sir.

    seen to form outside the turnstiles and people began to scale the wall. Some of these
    made their way over the concertina door adjacent to the turnstiles covered by my serial,
    and others just sat it out on the roof of the turnstiles covered by my serial. By now th e
    flow of people into the ground had increased immensly and searching became very difficult.
    People who had entered the ground through the turnstiles were pleading with me to do something
    about the situation outside the ground. These people were sweating profusely and were
    obviously agitated at the crowd situation, and aore than one expressed the feeing that someone
    would die if something was not done. These people were literal^ screaming abuse at me and
    when I explained I could do nothing they went off and screamed at another officer. An Inspector
    came on the scene, who I believe to be Inspector Bennett and he climbed onto the roof
    of the turnstiles we were covering and began to get people off the roof and down into
    the ground. One such person was a youth wearing a turquoise T shirt who I had kept watch
    on because he was one of the first to climb up there and when I had asked him previously
    if he had a ticket he said he hadn't. Eventually he came down after I had seen another
    person reach up and hand him a ticket. I told him he was being thrown out and took
    him towards the doors in Serial 1^'s section. I moved towards the doors and could see
    there was a large number of people milling around the inside of the turnstiles A to Q.
I waApproximately five yards away form the doors dtiujt when I saw they had been opened and then
    a flood of people began to enter the ground. Suchwere the numbers that I let go of the youth
    I was ejecting and I sought refuge in on e of the turnstiles. As these entered the ground
     there was obviously panic as they were climbing over each other in anattempt to get to the
    terraces. I gave what assistance I could to the people who had been trampled and when
    everyone appeared to be alright I went back to my position. At this time the doors were
    still open. People were by this time handing tickets which they had obviously not used
    to people who were coming through the turnstiles, some of these I managed to recover and I
     have retained them. The problem with people climbing over the wall eased when a mounted office
    was directed to a position beside the turnstile at which point the people were gaining an acces
    point to climb over the wll. I could see this from my position inside the ground.
   Sometime a f t e r t h is two uniform ed o f fic e r s came to the doors w ith in my s e c tio n , the doors
   ad ja c e n t to t u r n s t ile 16 and one o f them took hold o f the handle as i f to open the doors.
   A steward remonstrated with him and a discussion them took place between them which I did not
   hear. A fww seconds later these doors were opend by the two officers and again I had to seek
   refuge as the crowd roared in to the ground. These officers were not from either Serial 14
   or 15. After the rush into the ground the doors were closed again by the two officers who then
   left the Section.
   It was some time later that I learned that an incident had taken place within the ground and
   I went towards the tunnel that runs beneath the West stand. As I entered the tunnel I saw
   injured coming towards me and being led out of the tunnel. I then began trying to move people
   back out of the terracing down the fcmnel still not knowing what had happened. Eventually
   people did begin to clear from the terracing and I made my way down to the pitch where I gave
   what assistance I could to the injured and the dead.
   I can only describe what happened from about 2.30pm as being mass hysteria. I would say
   that most of the people entering after this time smelled of alcohol but it was physically
   impossible to do anything about it, such was the mass of people.

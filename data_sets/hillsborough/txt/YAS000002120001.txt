       1.   I am   employed    as   the    Assistant   Chief   Ambulance    Officer

             (Training) for SYMAS.



       2.   My date of birth is 9th December 1956.



       3.   In 1978 I joined SYMAS as an ambulanceman at Maltby.                    I

            became a qualified ambulanceman in 1979 and in 1980 I moved

            to Rotherham Ambulance Station.            In 19j8o I obtained the
            National Health Service Training Authority's Ambulance Aid

            Instructors Certificate and I also did extended training to

            become a paramedic in SYMAS.         At that time there was not a
            national course for paramedics and when the national scheme

            was started in, I think,        the following year,      those people

            who had done the SYMAS paramedic course                  had to pass
            an exam rather than attend the national course.             I was the

            one   exception   to    that   and   attended   the first   national

            paramedic course effectively as a guinea pig-               From 1987
            onwards I spent roughly half of my time in training and was

            appointed    the training officer       in 1987.    In   1988   I was

            appointed to my present post.


       4.   Saturday    15th April was     officially a day off but         I was

            involved in a training exercise with a group of cadets on

            Burbadge Moor.    That exercise finished at about 1700 hours
            I could tell from the messages which I could hear over the




5*^0
radio that there was some form of incident at Hillsborough

and I radioed into control to ask if they needed any help.

I was told to report to the headquarters in Rotherham.


I arrived     at headquarters     at   about   1700   hours   where   Mr

Albert Smith briefed me.          He told me that the scene was

clear of live casualties at this stage, I saw Mr Page in the

ambulance room and he said that he and I would be going to

the ground.      We left for the ground at about 5.40 p.m.


We arrived at the ground at about 1755 hours where we saw Mr

Hopkins, Mr Eason, Mr Dale and Mr Jones.          Mr Hopkins briefed

Mr Page and I and we spoke to the senior policeman in the

gym whose name is Mr Addis.        Mr Addis explained what was to

happen about the bodies.        The bodies were being bagged at

this time for later removal.


We went back to headquarters at 1830 hours.              There was a
small press conference in Mr Page's office at 1900 hours and

I went off duty at 1930 hours



Approximately every 2 years a major exercise is planned with

the other emergency       services.     The    last one was    in the
autumn of 1988 and involved the mock up of a train crash at

Doncaster.       Thirty to forty ambulance men from SYMAS were

involved   and    there— were— three— or— force— crews— from— ether
disferiets— involved ao wol-b-r    None of the crews knows it is
      an exercise until they arrive at the scene.


9.    We review the SYMAS major               incident plan after each mock
      incident plan after each mock incident.                 This   review is

      carried out by a panel of senior officers.                A copy of the

      major incident plan is kept at each ambulance station.



10.   All recruits are given an overview of the major incident
                                    l¥\duC.tvo*V
      plan as part of their inductive training, concentrating upon

      their part in that plan.


11.   When ambulance men go          onto full time day duties we hold a

      week's course which I run and at that time they all see a

      copy of the complete major               incident plan and we discuss

      recent incidents and the way they have been handled by the

      ambulance service.


12.   We    had   been   planning     to    hold   a major   incident   seminar
      shortly, but, in view of the Hillsborough tragedy this has

      been shelved for the time being.

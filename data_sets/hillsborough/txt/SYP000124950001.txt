 THAT PER IMETER FENCE WOULD HAVE KNOWN.         I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT

 THOSE CLIMBING OUT OF THE PENS ONTO THE PITCH WERE INVOLVED IN SOME SORT OF

 FIGHT OR DISORDER,        BEHIND THE GOAL.    IT WAS ONLY WHEN THE FIRST OBVIOUS BODY

 BEING REMOVED FROM THAT AREA ONTO THE PITCH AND 'THE MOUTH TO MOUTH AND FIRST

 AID BEING ADMINISTERED Dll5\8ECOME APPARENT A TRAGEDY HAD TAKEN PLACE.              THIS

 WOULD BE ABOUT 3.10 (1310) TcNg-.iSPM (1512).         I THEN BECAME A SPECTATOR TO WHAT

 WENT ON.    I SAW A SMALL NUMBER OF NR4OLICE AND ST JOHNS AT THAT END DOING THEIR

 BE^T^t^ADVERSE CONDITIONS TO REVIV e N ^ O S E FETCHED O U T . MEANWHILE AT THIS

 JOINT IN TI^SvTHE FIRST BODY WAS PASSED BY THE N STAND BY TWO FANS.             AT THE

 SAME TIME-' A RANKEiSL OFF ICER LED IN A HUMORED CONSTABLES WHICH I AND OTHERS

   OUGHT WERE GOING TCNa SSIST\t H0SE AT THE OTHER END.           INSTEAD THEY LINED UP

 AND FACED THE N STAND SEATi$4§/.       AT TBHIS MYSELF AND OTHER MEMBERS/FANS WERE

 OUTRAGED AT THEIR LACK OF ACTION.          SPECTATORS IN THE STAND VENTED THEIR RAGE.

 THE!RE APPEARED TO 8E NO GUIDANCE” AS TO WHAT ACTION TO TAKE AND CONCERNED ONLY

 FOR PUBLIC ORDER.        WHERE LARGE NUMBERS OF FANS HAD SPILLED BY NOW FROM THE

 PENS 3 AND 4 ASSISTING THOSE INJURED.          ONCE AGAIN A LINE OF OFFICERS ACROSS

 PITCH INACTIVE AND REMAINED SO ALTHOUGH I DID SEE! INDIVIDUAL OFFICERS BREAK

 T Hfc. LINE AND HtLP •    WHAT In SAYING IS IHERE WAS NO CONTROL-/ NO PLftN Ot ACTION

 IN ANTICIPATION OF ANY INJURY TO ONE OR 90+ FANS.             NO EQUIPMENT, NO FACILITIES

 AND NO COMMUNICATIONS.         I FEEL MORE COULD HAVE BEEN DONE BY MORE OFFICERS.

 < ® I C E R S WHO DID ACT DID NOT RECEIVE ANY HELP FROM THEIR COLLEAGUES.           I BLAME

 SENIOR OFFICERS NOT THE CONSTABLES WHO ARE ONLY ACTING AS THEY ARE GUIDED OR

 INSTRUCTED.

 I^THE       TICKET ALLOCATION WAS WRONG.   LIVERPOOL SHOULD HAVE HAD MORE

 TICKETS,,     IT WAS THE SAME LAST YEAR,

 S.     THERE SEEMED TO BE NO POLICE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN OFFICERS OUTSIDE

 3.     THE DESIGN OF THE GROUND.    ALL THE TURNSTILES IN LEPPINGS LANE ARE

 ALL IN ONE SMALL SPACE.       THE FANS WERE FUNNELLED INTO ONE

 SMALL AREA.

 I ATTENDED THE MATCH LAST YEAR\ *      LfcO-SBOROUGH AND IT SEEMED THAT THERE

 WERE FAR MORE PEOPLE AI     THE TURNSTILES THIS YEAR»    AL iHOUGH 1HERE WAS A

 BIT OF A CRUSH LAST YEAR IT WAS N ’T ANYTHING LIKE THIS YEAR.      I CAN'T

 r UR-LY   MAKE ANY OTHER COMPARISONS BETWEEN 1988 (000088) AND 1989 (000089).

 WORDS CAN'T DESCRIBE IT - IT WAS A TOTAL SHAMBLE T H e \ q L I C E IN CHARGE CLEARLY

 DID NOT KNOW THAT IT WAS A TRAGEDY FOR AT LEAST 1 0 - 1 5 m^NUJTES AFTER IT HAD

 HAPPENED THEY THOUGHT IT WAS PITCH INVASION. THE EVIDENCE FOR THAT IS THAT THE

 F^^iF OR CEMENTS THAT ARRIVED UPON INSTRUCTION LINED UP ACROSS THE PITCH AND IN

 FRONT OF THE NORTH STAND INSTEAD OF SAVING LIVES WHICH IN MY VIEW THEY COULD

 HAVE. ALSO PUSHING PEOPLE BACK INTO THE PEN AND ARRESTING PEOPLE ON THE PITCH

 WELL AT LEAST TRYING TO I DONT THINK THEY ARRESTED ANYONE.

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I THINK THE JUDGE SHOULD LOOK INTO THE F.A.'S ALLOCATION OF TICKETS TO THE

 LIVERPOOL CLUB AND ALSO THE SELECTION OF A GROUND WITHOUT ADEQUATE ACCESS

 FACILITIES.

 BE ENOUGH POLICE OUTSIDE PRIOR TO THE GAME AND NOT ENOUGH SUPERVISORS INSIDE

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 GENERAL TREATMENT OF AWAY FANS AT FOOTBALL GROUND - POOR, EXCEPTIONS IN

 PLACES LIKE LIVERPOOL AND MANCHESTER BUT A LOT OF TOWNS AND CITIES YOU ARE

 JUST HERDED LIKE SHEEP WITH NO CONSIDERATION AND LITTLE ORGANISATION TO HELP

 FANS GET INTO GROUNDS EASILY.                THIS GIVES A BAD IMPRESSION OF POLICING IN

 GENERAL TO A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE.

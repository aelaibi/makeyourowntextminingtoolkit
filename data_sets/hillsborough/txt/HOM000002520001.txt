Police Constable 357

Niagara Ground, Sheffield.



At     8am Saturday 15th April 1989                  I reported for duty at Niagara Stables, Sheffield

in       preparation for           duties   at the    semi     final    football      match     at    Hillsborough

Stadium between         Nottingham Forest and Liverpool.                      I was engaged in stable duties

and grooming police horse Dragoon.

At 10.15 a.m. the same date I attended at a briefing at Niagara Police Club given

by Inspector Hand-Davis regarding the duties to be performed at the semi final.

At 11.15 a.m.         I mounted police horse Dragoon,                   leaving Niagara stable yard along

with other mounted officers from Merseyside and Nottingham Forces at 11.30 a.m.

 this date.

 I      was   told    to perforn        duties in    Halifax    Road     area with      PC     3844   Halpin   from

 Merseyside,         this        area   being   where      coaches      and    mini    buses    travelling      from

 Liverpool     would        be    parked.   During our        duties we patrolled up and down Halifax

 Road    watching      the       build up of        the   numbers    of Liverpool       supporters      that   began

 building up near the White Horse public house and the car park and grassed area

 outside      the Gateway          shopping     centre.      Large     numbers   of supporters were        walking

 down Halifax Road with tins of alcohol and also going into Gateway to buy bottles

 and cans of alcohol. The fans at this time were in a happy and joyful mood.

 Just before 2.00 p.m. a special train arrived at Wadsley Bridge Railway Station.

  The fans were escorted from the station towards Hillsborough stadium by several

     mounted policemen and foot patrols.

     After the train escort had gone to Leppings Lane I began moving the supporters

     near Gateway supermarket. At first these supporters would not move and had to be

pushed towards the stadium, they were unhelpful and reluctant to move, they were

also argumentative.

At about 2pm a mini bus ,                                     driven

                  Merseyside, was driven down Halifax Road and turned left into Kilner

Way,     people       were hanging      out     of    the window         of    this    vehicle   and     shouting    to

supporters on the car park at Gateway.                        I caused the vehicle to stop and noticed

that inside the vehicle smelled of alcohol. Foot patrols arrived and searched the

vehicle,       most    of    the    passengers       were quiet,         but two of      them became       upset    and

 argued with the foot officers. All the passengers were directed and advised to go

 straight to the ground.             Another group of 15-25 supporters were advised to go to

 the ground.

 There were       still coaches        and mini          buses full of supporters arriving in Halifax

 Road,    after       2.30   p.m.    When     these       supporters          disembarked     they     began   running

 towards the ground.

 At    about    2.45p.m.       PC    Halpin    and       myself    patrolled          down   Penistone    Road     North

 towards       Leppings      Lane,    there    were       still    a large       number of supporters running

 towards the ground.

 At 2.55 P-m - we patrolled Leppings Lane with large numbers of supporters running

  towards the ground. Coming down Leppings Lane away from the ground were groups of

  people trying to buy tickets from supporters running up Leppings Lane.

  On my arrival at the gates                  in Leppings         Lane    I saw a crowd of several thousand

  crowding around the gates blocking Leppings Lane.                             People were pushing and almost

  fighting to get into the turnstiles outside the ground. A line of police horses

  stretching          from the sweet shop to the bridge wall was keeping the majority of                             the

  supporters          from the pens outside the turnstiles. PC Halpin and myself pushed our

horses      through       this    crowd of supporters                to reinforce the line of horses. These

supporters were pushing against the horses and were shouting to be allowed to get

to    the    already       crowded         turnstiles.        I    shouted       at    the     supporters      to   give- over

pushing but they wouldn't listen to what they were being told.                                           A horse near the

bridge wall broke from the line and supporters began rushing through towards the

turnstiles.         A     large       number     of supporters           were         inthe    enclosure       leading    to

turnstiles 1 - 1 6 .             I forced        my horse through the gate into this enclosure to try

and stop people being crushed at the turnstiles but my                                        horse was forced against a

metal barrier trapping my leg.                         I considered it too dangerous in this enclosure

so    I     came    out     and       placed     my horse          across    the        gateway    to     prevent     further

supporters entering the enclosure. Supporters were climbing on top of the fencing

and climbing over the wall above the turnstiles. All these supporters outside the

turnstiles were pushing and almost fighting each other trying to get through the

turnstiles. At no time did I see any of the large blue exit gates open.

The    crowd       suddenly       thinned out          and     all   the    horses were called              to form a line

outside exit gate             'C'.         PS 399 Sorsby called myself and 5 other mounted officers

 and led us down Vere Road towards Penistone Road and exit gate â€™O'. We were told

 to standby at the top of the ramp leading down between the North Stand and the

 Spion Kop.             After a few minutes supporters and police officers arrived up this

 ramp from the pitch carrying stretchers and boards ladened with injured persons,

 these supporters obviously did not know where to go from the top of the ramp so I

 shouted       at    them        to   go    to   the        gymnasium.      We    remained        in    this    position       for

 approximately 30 minutes before we were stood down to the car park at the back of

 the North Stand.

 We were       informed that the football match had been abandoned and told to patrol

the   streets    around      the    ground,      particularly           the    traffic     island   Leppings     Lane,

Herries Road area.

At approximately 7pm we were told to stand down at Niagara Stables.

On    my   arrival    at    Leppings      Lane    turnstiles            I noticed    that     there   were    several

mounted police. The officers were shouting at the supporters to try to stop them

pushing towards the turnstiles but these supporters would not listen and shouted

back at the officers to let them enter the ground.

I have worked several semi finals at Hillsborough stadium both on foot and as a

mounted officer,           and on all these occasions most of the supporters have arrived

at the ground early and inside                   the      turnstiles       15 minutes before kick off.               At

previous semi finals large numbers of fans have arrived by special train, but on

 this      occasion    there       was    only   one          special    train    from     Liverpool,     all     other

 supporters      arriving      and       travelling       by     coach    or     private    car     causing     traffic

 congestion on all roads leading to the ground forcing fans to park their vehicles

 a long way from the ground and then having to walk.

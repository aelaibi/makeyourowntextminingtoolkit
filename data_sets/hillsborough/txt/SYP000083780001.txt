                   van,    containing                the      whole        of m y S e r i a l          and       other       Officers,           immediate!

                   from    Claywheels                Ln    to    the       Leppings             Ln    entrance           of H i l l s b o r o u g h

                   Football          Ground,           completing               the    journey             in a m a t t e r      of m i n u t e s .




                   On    arrival           at    the      Ground          we    began       to       push    our       way     through       a     dense

                   crowd       of    people          to    get       towards          the       ground       to    give as si st an ce .               As      we

                   got    to    the        ground         and    were          about       to    begin assisting,                    in w h a t     was

                   ob v i o u s l y a major               incident,             X w as      s en t     back       to m y       van a n d      told     to

                   stand       by    in     case       transport               was    needed.              I returned           to m y       van and          sat

                   in the       cab.



                   The    crowd        outside            the    Leppings             Ln    entrance             was     the    biggest          I had        ever

                   see    and       I h a ve      never         seen a football                      crowd       containing            so m a n y     obvious

                                                                                                                                  S2804

drunks.           After      a short           while     people,          who    were       obviously             distressed,

began       leaving        the     ground        and     I noticed          t ha t     people          outside          were

approaching             them      for    tickets.             From    the       condition             and    reaction             of    the

people        who    were      leaving          the    g ro un d,     it    became          obvious          to me        t ha t

something           very     serious           had    occurred        ins i d e .          As    t im e w e n t        on a       lot     of

the     crowd       became        very a ngry and              belligerent,                but       someone        had wa lk ed

down     to      the P o l i c e     Officer          who     was    outside,          1 think             it wa s      a Sergeant

and    said       that     whatever            was    said     to    us,    we    were          to    ignore        it a n d       do

nothing.            I wa s     called          "MURDERING BASTARD"                    on    several          occasions,                one

drunk       stood       in f r o n t     of m y       van and        shouted          several          times,          " I T ’S A L L

THE    8IZ2IES          FAULT."          Another         drunk       ran    up    to       the       van,    banged          on    the

side     and      shouted,         " Y O U C A N ’T B L A M E        US    THIS       TIME."           Several          wanted          to

fig ht ,      but    were      dragged          away     by o t h e r      fans.           Many       of    the m o r e

voiciferous             and a ggressive               ones     were       obviously             the    worse        for      drink        and

on a     normal         day w ou ld          have     got     themselves          arrested             for    their          conduct.




I saw       th at    other        Officers           were     working       extremely                hard    to     get      fa ns      out

of    the     road      so t h a t      th e    ambulances           could       get       through,          many       of     them

w o u l d n ’t m o v e     un til       physically            pushed       out    of       the       r oa d a n d a       patrol          car

with     PA      patrolled         up a n d      down Leppings              Ln    constantly appealing                            to    f ans

to    cl e a r    the    way      for    ambulances            with       little       success.              Th e      f ans

blocking          the    access         of     the    ambulances           were       obviously             well       the     worse

for    drink        a n d as      such       failed      to    comprehend             that       a major          tragedy          h ad

occurred,           their      main      concern         how    to    get       into       the       ground       at    any       cost..




I remained           with my         vehicle          in L e p p i n g s    Ln    until          after       6pm       (1800)          when

I was       rejoined         by    the       rest     of m y S e r i a l        and    we       returned          to    Claywheels

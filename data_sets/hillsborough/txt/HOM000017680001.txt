RESIST

Purpose and effect

The purpose of this amendment appears to be to require the court
to explain to overseas spectators any reciprocal arrangements
existing in their home country.


Speaking note

The purpose of Part II of the Bill is to prevent convicted
hooligans from travelling abroad to designated overseas fixtures
to cause trouble in other countries. The provisions are in
effect intended to restore the reputation of English fans abroad.
It may well be that when other countries see the effects they
will wish to build on our experience by introducing similar
legislation to control their own travelling hooligans.


But a reciprocal system is very much for the future. This
amendment seems to anticipate that day and seeks to require the
courts to advise offenders on overseas law. This is
unacceptable. Anyone of whatever nationality who is within the
jurisdiction of the courts in England and Wales will be subject
to this legislation and its effects will be fully explained to
them. But we cannot sensibly require our courts to pronounce on
the law of other countries. I ask the hon Members to withdraw
this amendment.

RESIST

Purpose and effect

The purpose of this amendment is to preclude the courts from
making restriction orders against any foreign nationals not
domiciled in England and Wales. It does not address the
difficulty of British Citizens domiciled outside the
jurisdiction, but does have the effect that any foreign national
staving within the jurisdiction for however prolonged a period
(but domiciled abroad) cannot be treated in like fashion to a
British Citizen.


Speaking note

Mr Lofthouse, let us remind ourselves of the purpose of the
proposed restriction order provisions of the Bill. Part I of the
Bill was devised to exclude known football hooligans from
attending future matches in England and Wales to prevent further
misbehaviour. Part II complements Part I by preventing those
who have been convicted of criminal behaviour in relation to
football matches from attending designated matches outside our
jurisdiction. I feel confident that the hon Members opposite
endorse these objectives.

The restriction order provisions should apply equally to all
within the jurisdiction. Anyone living in England or Wales,


                                i
                                                                 •
either temporarily or permanently, should be subject to these
provisions, regardless of nationality.   This would not be the
case under the terms of this amendment. The Australian working
holidaymaker who gets his kicks from following an English club
and fighting opposing supporters could not be made subject to an
order; the Italian student of English with a temporary and
violent allegiance to, say, Spurs could not be made subject to
an order. This cannot be right - for the duration of their stay
in this country they must be subject to our law and to all
provisions of it.


Restriction orders will not be applied automatically on
conviction for a football-related offence. The courts must first
of all apply the test specified in Clause 13(2), that the making
of an order would help to prevent violence or disorder at or in
connection with designated football matches. I am confident that
courts will also examine each case in terms of practicality. If
the offender lives way outside the jurisdiction and could not be
reasonably expected to report to an agency in England and Wales,
then the court would not make such an order.


I am convinced that the amendment is unacceptable in its present
form. But I do see that there may be a genuine problem with
someone who could not reasonably be expected to report to a
police station in England and Wales because he will not be living
in the country. In consultation with my hon Friend the PUSS for
the Environment I will consider this further and, if it seems
right, I would be prepared to table amendment on Report.

14 days notice and ensuring that such a person is residing at the
address given and is not away from that address for purpose of
employment, holiday or family necessity.'

RESIST

Purpose and effect

The amendment seeks to ensure that the agency gives at least 14
days notice before imposing any requirements on the offender and
that the agency also ensures that he will be available at his
given address to receive any such notice.

Speaking note

This section of Clause 17 is concerned with the offenders' duty
to report for initial registration and the requirements that may
be imposed upon him to ensure that the restriction order may have
effect. We foresee that these requirements will be of an
administrative nature. A good example would be to require the
offender to notify the agency of any change of address. I can
see no good reason why notice of at least 14 days would be
required.

Clause 18 also provides for a person subject to a restriction
order to apply to the agency for exemption from the duty to
report when special circumstances apply - we envisage that those
special circumstances will normally be by reason of employment,
holiday or family necessity.

I urge the hon Members to withdraw the amendment.

Purpose and effect

Both amendments place the responsibility for the approval of
suitable reporting agencies in the hands of local authorities.
Amendment 123 seeks to ensure suitable conditions and locations
for the agencies and is no doubt intended to ensure that there is
adequate provision in each locality so that the duty to report is
not unduly inconvenient to the offender. Amendment 124 seeks to
ensure that the agencies are non profit making, the intention
presumably to exclude the possibility that the private sector
might take on such a role.


Speaking note

Mr Lofthouse, we share the view of hon Members opposite that the
reporting agency scheme needs to operate efficiently and
effectively in all parts of England and Wales. We believe that
we have identified the best candidates to fulfil the reporting
agency functions and have tabled amendments to adapt the Bill
accordingly. i urge the hon Members to withdraw these amendments.

Speaking note

Mr Lofthouse, I was disappointed and surprised to see this
amendment on the order paper.   I had understood from various of
the hon Member's speeches that they shared the Government's
objective in trying to prevent convicted hooligans from further
damaging the reputation of this country and British football by
their unacceptable behaviour at overseas matches. This
amendment, however, shows the unacceptable face of the
Opposition.

Clause 17(7) goes to the heart of the restriction order scheme.
It is the section under which the agency requires those subject
to a restriction order to report on the occasion of a designated
match.

If this amendment were approved the restriction order scheme
could not operate. I hope that hon Members opposite will, on
reflection, adopt the responsible course and withdraw this
amendment.

Clause 12, page 11, line 20, leave out 'designated reporting
agency' and insert 'police station'.

GOVERNMENT AMENDMENT

Purpose and effect

Amendment 135 removes reference to a designated reporting agency
and replaces it by specifically referring to a police station as
the place to which those subject to a restriction order will be
required to report.

Speaking note

Since the restriction order scheme was conceived we have been
looking carefully at how best its requirements might be carried
out. Various organisations have been considered for carrying out
the role of reporting agency. From the outset the police service
was a strong candidate, in terms of their experience in dealing
with offenders and their unparalleled network of local stations.
In consultation with the Association of Chief Police Officers, we
set about developing a scheme which would be effective without
imposing an undue burden on the police service.

We have concluded that it would be right for police stations to
be the locations to which those subject to restriction orders
would register initially and thereafter report as required. The
police will, of course, have a role to play in follow-up action
should it appear that an offence under Part II has been
committed. However in order to keep to the minimum the work
falling on the local police station it is desirable to separate
these essentially local functions from the great bulk of

administration work which could be carried out most efficiently
in a central office: it appears in the Government amendments as
"the enforcing authority".I do not believe that the level of
counter work and follow-up action locally will be in any way
burdensome and I am pleased to say that the Association of Chief
Police Officers are happy with the arrangements as proposed. I
am very grateful for their co-operation in this matter.


I hope the hon Members will agree that this is a sensible way of
carrying out the requirements of the restriction order
provisions. I beg to move.

Police Act 1964 (common services organisations) as the Secretary
of State designates for the purposes of this Part of this Act by

Clause 12, page 11, line 32, leave out subsection (7).


GOVERNMENT AMENDMENT


Purpose and effect

Amendment 136 deletes the existing subsection (7) of Clause 12
and replacs it by the text of amendment 137. The effect is to
replace the reference to a designated reporting agency with the
term 1enforcing authority1 defined as a police common service
organisation.


Speaking note

I have spoken of the suitability of the local police to fulfil
certain of the requirements of the reporting agency functions and
our desire to ensure that they are not unduly burdened with
administrative tasks. All functions other than counter work and
the following up of suspected offences will be taken on by a
central police office, known in the Bill as the 'enforcing
authority'.

It will be the function of this central office to maintain the
records of those subject to restriction orders; to decide on
requirements to report and to notify the subjects of the orders
accordingly; to decide applications for temporary exemption from
the duty to report; and to deal with all other miscellaneous and
administrative tasks. In other words, only those functions which
require face to face meetings will be dealt with at local police
stations; all other functions will be removed from the local
force.


The "enforcing authority" will be established as a common police
service under the Police Act 1964.

     '(a) to report initially to the police station specified in
     the order within the period of five days beginning with the
     date of the making of the order; and
     (b) subject to any exemption, to report on the occasion of
     designated football matches when required to do so under
     section 17(7)(b) below to any police station in England and

     notice by which the requirement is imposed.'


Clause 14, page 13, line 12, leave out 'the designated reporting
agency' and insert 'any police station.'


GOVERNMENT AMENDMENT

Purpose and effect

The three amendments identify police stations in England and
Wales as the places where those subject to restriction orders
must fulfil their duty to report: reporting initially is to the
police station specified by the court in the restriction order;
reporting subsequently is to any police station in England and
Wales, but at a time specified by the enforcing authority.


Speaking note

These three amendments are necessary to Part II in order to
specify that those subject to a restriction order should report



                               /
to a police station. For initial registration this will be to
the police station specified by the court at the time of the
making of the order. The court will no doubt select the police
station nearest to the offender's given address. Thereafter,
whenever required by the enforcing agency (in writing) to report
on the occasion of a designated match, the offender may attend at
any police station, convenient for him, where he will establish
his identity and, in return, the police officers will furnish him
with proof that he has attended as required and notify the
enforcing agency accordingly.


These amendments are consequential upon the police taking on the
counter duties. I beg to move.

GOVERNMENT AMENDMENT

Purpose and effect


Clause 16 deals with the information circulated by the court when
a restriction order is made. The purpose of this group of
amendments is to ensure that the local police station to which
the hooligan is to report initially and the "enforcing authority"
receive the necessary information to carry out the requirements
of the restriction order provision.
Speaking note


This particular group of amendments ensures that the
organisations which need to know receive the information required
to operate the restriction order arrangements.


It will be helpful for the police station specified on the order
as the place where initial registration should take place to
receive a copy of that order for information. However, no
further information will be required by that local station. The
offender may thereafter report to any police station convenient
for him and all records of reporting will be maintained centrally
by the enforcing authority.


The central enforcing authority will need to be kept up to date
with all changes in circumstances. This group of amendments
serves to ensure that they receive a copy of the original order
from the court; that they receive a note of the offender's
discharge from prison if he was sentenced to immediate
imprisonment and on release was still subject to the restriction
order; and that they receive a copy from the court of any
terminating order.


These amendments provide for the effective administration of the
scheme.

responsible for imposing the requirements on the subject of the
order deemed necessary or expedient by the enforcing authority.


Speaking note

Clause 17 is concerned with the functions of those responsible
for meeting the requirements of the restriction order provision.
The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the areas of
responsibility regarding initial registration. Initial
registration will take place at the police station named by the
court on the restriction order. That police station will be
responsible for giving notice in writing to the subject of the
order of any requirements he should fulfil for the effective



                                I
running of the scheme.   On these occasions the local police
station will be acting under the instructions of the enforcing
authority who will decide centrally what those requirements might
be.  [A good example of the sort of requirement imposed would be
to notify the enforcing agency of any change of address.] This
amendment sets out these duties clearly and unambiguously.

GOVERNMENT AMENDMENT
Purpose and effect


These amendments are all consequential to earlier government
amendments and serve to make specific reference to either a
police station or the enforcing authority, as appropriate.



Speaking note


Clause 19 enables the Secretary of State to issue guidance to
what were to be known as designated reporting agencies for the
purposes of carrying out the requirements of the restriction
order provision and to make regulations about the giving of
notices by the enforcing authority when imposing reporting
requirements. This group of amendments is consequential to those
government amendments already discussed, deleting references to
agencies and introducing specific reference to police stations or
the enforcing authority, as appropriate by function.

GOVERNMENT AMENDMENT


Purpose and effect


This series of amendments is intended to establish under the new
arrangements for a central enforcing authority and reporting to
local police stations the procedure for deciding when someone
subject to a restriction order should report and advising them
accordingly. Its effect is to place the responsibility for these
functions on the enforcing authority.

Speaking notes


Subsections (7) and (8) of Clause 17 go to the heart of the
restriction order provisions. They deal with the way in which
those subject to an order should be "called up" when designated
matches are being played abroad.


The amended subsection 7(a) will require the enforcing authority
to advise every person subject to an order, by notice in writing,
of the time when he needs to report on the occasion of those
designated matches which attract an obligatory reporting
requirement. We envisage that these will include matches
involving the national team. Reporting may be done at any police
station but the time of reporting will be set so as to preclude
attendance at the designated match.


The amended subsection 7(b) will establish the procedure for
designated matches which do not attract an obligatory reporting
reguirement. The enforcing authority will require a person to
report if it is satisfied that it is necessary or expedient to do
so to reduce the likelihood of violence or disorder at the match
in question. Criteria may be established including, for example,
the offender's club allegiance and previous history. The
enforcing authority shall also have regard to any guidance on the
exercise of its functions issued by the Secretary of State under
Clause 19.


This mechanism itself is not new to the Bill.   The amendment


                             2-
, •
      places the responsibility of the enforcing authority for taking
I
      decisions about calling up those subject to restriction orders.
      It is right that such decisions should be made by the enforcing
      authority which will hold the relevant information about the
      offenders. It is also desirable that the administrative work
      should not fall on local police stations.


      I beg to move.

GOVERNMENT AMENDMENT


Purpose and effect


The purpose of this amendment is to give the responsibility for
considering and granting applications for exemption from the duty
to report to the enforcing authority (except in cases of
exceptional urgency when such applications may be handled by a
police station).

Speaking note


Clause 18 sets out the procedure for a person subject to a
restriction order to apply for exemption from the requirement to
report on the occasion of a particular designated football match,
or a series of such matches. This amendment is tabled to place
the responsibility for the consideration and granting of
exemptions on the enforcing authority. The enforcing authority
will of course need to be satisfied that special circumstances
exist and may wish to seek advice from the applicant's local
police station. But I believe it is right to take such
decisions centrally, both to relieve the burden on the police and
also to ensure a consistent approach to such applications.

The clause also provides that in urgent cases where it is not
practicable to consult the enforcing authority the local officer
is empowered to grant exemption, subject of course to him being
satisfied that the conditions of sub-clause 2(a) and (b) are met.

I beg to move.

     Mr Douglas Hogg

     Clause 20, page 18, line 42, at end insert "and a document
     in that form shall be taken to be such a certificate unless
     the contrary is proved.".

     Clause 20, page 18, line 42, at end insert -

          "( ) In proceedings against a person under this
          section, the facts stated in such a certificate shall,
          on production of the certificate and proof that that
          person is the person whose conviction is certified, be
          taken to be proved unless the contrary is proved.".



GOVERNMENT AMENDMENT

Purpose and effect


Amendment 175 provides that a document in the form prescribed is
a certificate admissible as evidence of the facts stated in it
unless the contrary is proved. Its effect places the burden of
proving the contrary on the defendant. Amendment 176 introduces
a necessary (and precedented) requirement for proof that the
defendant is the person named in the certificate.

Speaking note

Clause 20 enables the courts to impose restriction orders on
those convicted of corresponding offences outside England and
Wales. Subsection 9 provides for an Order in Council to specify
the authority in each country which will be responsible for


                                I
certifying the information required and the form of such
certification. Subsection 10, with which we are here concerned,
declares that such a certificate is admissible as evidence by the
courts in England and Wales of the facts stated in it. Amendment
175 ensures that a document in the proper form is such a
certificate unless evidential proof is provided to the contrary.
This provides the defendant with the opportunity to adduce
evidence that the document is not a proper certificate but,
unless such evidence is forthcoming, the court will accept the
document as evidence of the facts stated.


Amendment 176 provides a safeguard for the defendant by
requiring proof that the defendant is the person named in the
certificate. This will normally be satisfied by the court asking
the defendant: "Are you the person named in the certificate?"
or, if he disputes that he is this person, by reference to the
details provided in the certificate.

     Clause 21, page 19, line 6, at end insert -
          "(1A) A court may, in any particular case, make a
          declaration of relevance notwithstanding that notice to
          the defendant as required by subsection (7) above has
          not been given if he consents to waive the giving of
          full notice or the court is satisfied that the
          interests of justice do not require more notice to be
          given.".




GOVERNMENT AMENDMENT

Purpose and effect
The purpose of this amendment is to introduce a waiver to the
requirement that the prosecution give the defendant at least 5
days notice before the trial that it will seek a declaration of
relevance. Its effect will be that the requirements may be
waived if the defendant consents or if the court believes that
the interests of justice do not require more notice to be given.


Speaking note

Mr Lofthouse, the Home Office has been taking firm action to deal
with all aspects of hooliganism, whether football related or
otherwise. We have been concerned that there should be swift
justice for defendants accused of committing offences of
hooliganism. Advice on this matter was issued to the courts only



                               I
a year ago. It is right that the defendant should generally be
given notice of the fact that a declaration of evidence may be
sought in cases where he may wish to oppose it. But in cases
where there is no dispute from the defendant or where the court
believes that the circumstances are so clear that no notice is
required, the court should be able to proceed with the case as
speedily as possible.


While preserving the rights of the defendant, this amendment
takes account of society's interest in swift justice.

I beg to move.

       4. MR LOFTHOUSE, I SHOULD LIKE TO ASSURE HON MEMBERS OPPOSITE
       THAT THERE IS NOTHING SINISTER HIDDEN BEHIND THE WORDING OF
       CLAUSE 3(8). IT IS INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT IF ONE BODY REPLACES
       ANOTHER AS THE FOOTBALL MEMBERSHIP AUTHORITY THE NEW BODY WILL
      NOT HAVE TO BEGIN ITS OPERATIONS FROM SCRATCH. I TRUST HON
      MEMBERS WILL SEE THE LOGIC IN PROVIDING FOR THE TRANSFER OF
      ASSETS LIKE THE RECORDS, COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY, MACHINERY AND
      CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS, AND THAT THAT OUGHT NOT TO NEED AN
      AFFIRMATIVE RESOLUTION OF EITHER HOUSE. I HOPE THE HON MEMBER
      WILL WITHDRAW HIS AMENDMENT.

AMENDMENTS 59, 58 AND 55


SPEAKING NOTE


1.    Mr Lofthouse, these amendments would mean that the
Secretary of State could designate only a corporate body formed
by the Football Association and the Football League, in
conjunction with the Football Supporters Association and the
National Federation of Football Supporters Clubs, as the Football
Membership Authority.


2.    The Government has made it clear all along that we hope
that the football authorities will set up and run the Football
Membership Authority in consultation with the Secretary of State.
We have met the football authorities wish and given them first
refusal on becoming the FMA. It is as a result of a Government
amendment that they are specifically referred to in the Bill. The
Football League has established a working group with the Football
Association to consider how the scheme might operate. A senior
official from my Department is a member of this working group and
my Department is meeting half the cost of the preparatory work it
is undertaking.


3.     The Secretary of State will of course take an interest in
the membership of the authority but hon members will be clear
about our wish to see the football authorities from the FMA. But
I cannot go as far as these amendments would take me by ruling
out the possibility of the Secretary of State appointing another
body, not connected with the Football Association and the
Football League, to form the FMA.      If for some reason, for
example, the Football Association and the Football League were to
be unwilling to take on the task, then clearly the Secretary of
State must be free to appoint others who are.

           4.             We have also made it very clear all along how important we
           regard the position of football supporters. We certainly hope
           that, in forming the FMA, the football authorities will consider
           carefully the possibility of including people representing other
           bodies in football. We will be looking at the constitution of
       the FMA when we come to discuss a later amendment. I think that
       would be the right time to look at how best to reflect the
      interests of football supporters. I have certainly not shut the
      door on the idea.


                      I invite the hon members to withdraw their amendments.

  AMENDMENTS 45 AND 46

 SPEAKING NOTE


 1.        Mr Lofthouse, these amendments would make it a mandatory
 requirement of the scheme that women and old age pensioners
 should be allowed to attend designated matches without being
 members of the scheme.


 2.        Before looking in detail at these two categories of
spectators, let me start by making clear the Government's general
position on exemptions. Our starting premise is that we want as
many law abiding spectators as possible to join the scheme and
enjoy the benefits of membership.       It is on this fundamental
concept where I first part company with the hon members opposite.
So much of their thinking stems from an ill conceived notion that
membership must be an onerous burden, an inconvenience to be
avoided.      In truth membership, far from being a burden, can
confer real benefits on those who enjoy it. It is a means of
ensuring that everyone who goes to football matches in the future
can do so without fear of violence or threatening behaviour. We
want to see all law abiding spectators, and this certainly
includes women and retired people, derive the benefits of
membership. The only people I am interested in excluding from
membership of the scheme are the hooligans.


3.     For the first time football clubs will have a full list of
their customers and will be able to develop the relationship
between club and supporter. It will be for the clubs to seize
this opportunity, to develop and market their membership scheme
so as to attract as many members as possible. It will be in the
interests of clubs to develop the scheme. They may wish to offer
commercial benefits to members in the shape of discounts at local
shops, ticket discounts at the club for particular matches and
they will be able to provide members with information about the
 club on a regular basis.
4.     I have made clear to hon members that of course I am
prepared to listen carefully and to consider any arguments for
changes in the Bill. It is against this general background to
the matter of exemption that I have listened to the arguments of
the hon members opposite in support of these amendments.


5.     Let us look for a moment or two at what an exemption for
women would mean.     Clearly it would be impractical to have
separate entrances for women since many of those attending the
match will wish to do so with their husband or boyfriend or in
family groups. Turnstile operators would therefore have to deal
with members of the scheme entering by means of their membership card
and women, without cards, entering by other means. This could
only make things more difficult for everyone - turnstile
attendants, members and non members of the scheme alike. It is
in everyone's interest that the scheme should work efficiently.
It is essential that the flow of spectators through the
 turnstiles should move as smoothly as possible. The technology
 will provide for this provided that everyone has the same form of
 card. The more exemptions there are the more difficult the
 system becomes for people entering the grounds.


6.      It is not part of my argument that we cannot entertain the
idea of an exemption for women because we fear that hooligans
will dress up as females in order to beat the system.         The
Government has never said that we have worries about hooligans
appearing in drag. But the thought is not lost on me that, given
a dark, winter evening kick off with overcoats, hats and scarves
much in evidence, identification must not always be the
straightforward matter it appears to be.
 7.     Nor do I suggest that women pose a special threat of
 hooliganism. I entirely accept that women on the whole commit
 less crime than men. But crime among women is not unknown. It
 does seem sensible therefore to retain in the scheme the
 possibility of disqualifying any women who were found to be
 involved in hooliganism. Hon members will appreciate in this
 context that there is no exemption provision in the existing
exclusion order powers under Part IV of the Public Order Act
1986.


8.    There is one other point I would like to touch on, again
without any wish to labour it. There are many, including many
women, who would regard a blanket exemption as smacking of
sexism.
9.     As to retired people, here again if we were to exempt so
large a group, the inevitable effect would be to require an
additional checking procedure that would make life more difficult
than the smooth arrangements for entry to the ground which the
technology of the national membership scheme would allow. As I
have said, the more exemptions you have the more unnecessarily
complicated the scheme becomes.      I appreciate that many clubs
already have separate turnstiles for OAPs but I do not believe
that this in itself provides the justification for a blanket
exemption. Many retired people after all will wish to attend
matches in the company of other members of their families or
younger friends.


10.    Nor do I accept that retired people will be reluctant to
apply for their membership card. There is no evidence to suggest
that retired people will not apply for cards or passes where in
return they can secure the benefits on offer - bus and train
passes are a good example of this.
  11.    It seems to be that it would be much more sensible for the
 Football Membership Authority and the clubs to encourage retired
 people to join the scheme than to keep them out of it. Let us
 not lose sight of the fact that it will be perfectly possible
 under the scheme for the FMA and the individual clubs to make
special arrangements for retired people if they wish - perhaps by
making no charge for membership cards or by simplifying the
application process.


12.     The national membership scheme is for the benefit of all
law abiding spectators. I want to see women and retired people
benefitting from the scheme and the scheme benefitting from their
membership.    I invite the hon members to withdraw their
amendments.

RESIST

Purpose and effect


The first amendment would prevent the offence in Clause 2(1) of
entry by someone who is not an authorised spectator from applying
to a "juvenile". The amendment is technically defective as
"juvenile" would have to be defined, but the term is already
generally understood to mean someone under 17 years old.
The second amendment would confine the offence to those over 18;
the third to those over 16.

Speaking note


Mr Chairman, the Opposition are understandably showing caution
about the position of juvenile offenders and other younger
persons. But complete exclusion from the scope of this offence
would go too far and is unnecessary given the existing general
provisions in the criminal law to deal with young offenders.
Indeed the range of 3 different ages demonstrates a confusion
even amongst those opposite as to where they think the cut off
might fall.


While the term "juvenile" is understood in criminal justice
circles to mean someone under 17 years of age, that would have
to be spelt out were amendment 34 to be made to this Bill.


The membership scheme does not envisage limiting membership to
those aged 17 or above only. In fact the only reference to age
in any similar context is that Clause 5(2) defines "accompanied
children" as those under 10 years of age. So spectators aged 10
or more must be members of the scheme, and there must be adequate
powers to defer and deal with infringements. In principle I see
no distinction in that between someone who is over ten but under
17 and someone who is 17. The essential point is that for the
scheme to be effective, there must be criminal sanctions
available against all members of the scheme.

Below the age of 10 someone is below the age of criminal
responsibility and incapable in law of committing an offence.
The criminal law already establishes general limits on the
penalties that can be imposed on those under the age of 21. In
the case of the penalties available for an offence under Clause
2(1), these would be:


     Age 10 to 13   -   maximum £100 fine, with no custody.




                                  2
    Girls age 14    -       the maximum fine increases to £400 (ie
                            level 3), again with no custody
                            possible.


     Boys aged 14 to 20 and girls aged 15 to 20 - the maximum
                         would be a £600 fine and 1 month's
                            detention in a young offender
                            institution.


     For those aged 21 or over - the maximum penalty would be a
                         £400 fine and 1 month's imprisonment, as
                         stated on the face of the Bill in Clause
                            2 (2 ).


These sentences specified in the Bill are however the maximum to
be available, to cater adequately for the very worst cases.
Clearly, most will not fall into that category. It is for the
court to decide what penalty to impose according to the
circumstances of the case.

Mr Chairman, I do hope the Opposition have listened with care to
what I have said and, on reflection, now accept that this
amendment is not necessary to safeguard the position of juveniles
adequately. On that basis I invite them to withdraw their
amendment.

Lord Harris is attached.)

COMMONS COMMITTEE STAGE

NOTES ON AMENDMENT

     Mr Stuart Randall
     Kate Hoey
     Mr Stanley Orme
     Mr Keith Vaz
          Clause 2, page 2, line 44, leave out subsection (3).

RESIST

Purpose and effect

This amendment would delete Clause 2(3) which provides the
explicit power for a constable to arrest without warrant a person
he reasonably suspects of having committed an offence of unlawful
attendance under Clause 2(1).


Speaking note

Mr Lofthouse, the most constructive assistance I can give this
Committee is to explain precisely why Clause 2(3) does provide a
power of arrest - and why this is not a radical extension of
police powers.

First, let us look at the circumstances of an offence that may
typically arise under Clause 2(1). We are talking here about
situations where identity may be very much in dispute,
particularly where it is suspected that someone has used
another's card. The would-be spectator says "that is my card";
the police officer or steward says "oh no it's not, you're
someone else". If the officer is right, not only has the person
probably committed an offence, but if he gets away without
establishing his true identity it will probably be the last we
see of him. So, on reasonable suspicion of an offence, the power
of arrest by a constable is a necessary part of making the
offence work.



                                1
[The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 would already provide
a general power of arrest applicable to the Clause 2(1) offence
if certain conditions set out in Section 25 of the Act are met,
for example when the suspect's name and address are unknown or
likely to be false, or when arrest is necessary to prevent loss
or damage to property.]


I hope hon Members opposite will appreciate that Clause 2(3) is
therefore a reasonable, justified measure, and will withdraw
their amendment.

     Clause 2, page 2, line 40, at end insert -
            1(1A) It shall not be an offence under subsection (1)
            above if such an offence is unknowingly committed1.



AGREE TO CONSIDER

Purpose and effect

This amendment would exclude from the scope of the offence in
Clause 2(1) (unauthorised attendance), action by anyone who did
not knowingly commit the offence.


Speaking note

Mr Lofthouse, I think I can summarise the two parts of the case
members opposite have outlined. First, that circumstances might
arise where someone acts reasonably and with good intent, but
falls foul of the offence in Clause 2(1). Second, that as a
remedy, this specific amendment excludes from the scope of the
offence someone who unknowingly commits the offence.


Clause 2(1) provides at present for an absolute offence: that is
one where no defence is provided. The absence of criminal intent
and the presence of justification for the act committed is no
defence in law. The creation of such offences is generally to be
avoided. I can well understand, therefore, why members opposite
are seeking to provide some statutory defence. But I do think
that the amendment goes too wide: it would put into statute that
ignorance of the law was. in this case, an acceptable excuse.




                                  /
This will not do. But, Mr Lofthouse, I have listened carefully
                                                              •
to the arguments that have been advanced and I am prepared to
undertake to consider bringing forward on report an amendment
that would provide a suitable statutory defence to the offences
set out in this clause.

RESIST

Purpose and effect


The first amendment would exclude from the scope of the 2(1)
offence any overseas visitor present in the UK for a "bona fide"
holiday; the second would exclude anyone not normally domiciled



                                   i
in England and Wales.


The third amendment is consequential to the second and applies
the domicile requirement to the attempt provisions.

Speaking note


Mr Chairman, I have listened carefully to what has been aid on
these amendments. My concern is that they would result in the
unacceptable situation where a British citizen entering a ground
without a membership card would commit an offence but a British
citizen normally resident abroad (including Scotland) or a
foreign national here temporarily would not. No matter that he
might know all about the membership scheme, no offence would be
committed. This is absurd.


I accept that some foreign visitors might not be so likely to
know about the scheme and the offence of unlawful entry but that
point would be better dealt with in any defences provided for the
offence. I invite the hon Members therefore to withdraw those
amendments and to listen carefully to my response to the
amendment number 36.

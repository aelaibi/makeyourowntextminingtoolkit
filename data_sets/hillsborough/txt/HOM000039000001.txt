          EVIDENCE OF ROGER BALL
 1
 2   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:           I have, of course,       read the
 3           evidence that you gave at the inquest.              Really what I
 4          would like to know is what,          in addition,     to anything you
 5           said then you would like to tell me.              Have you seen a
 6           transcript of what you said at the inquest?
 7   A      Yes,    I have a copy of that.
 8   Q      Is this a written statement?
 9   A      This is a letter I wrote to you          on 26th    August.
10   Q      I s e e . I have read that t o o .
11   A      It should have been included          in thedocumentation sent to
12          you.     In that letter I said that our main concerns - and I
13          was speaking for my wife and myself - were,              first of all,
|4          a conflict of evidence concerning continuity in respect of
15          our son Kester.      I have a letter from the West Midlands
16          Police admitting that there is a conflict between what the
17          South Yorkshire Police Officer said and the evidence of
18          another Liverpool fan. I just want to put that on record.
19   Q      Have you had the body file in the case of Kester?
20   A      No.
21   Q      You have not.     Have we got it?
22   MR.    BONE:     We do, Sir Murray.
23   A      Is that a record of what happened to him?
24   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         The matter was dealt with as you
25          may or may not know is that the West Midlands Police
26          compiled files in relation to each of the deceased.                   What
27          they sought to do was to trace the movements of the
28          deceased from the time they left home.               The early parts
29          are rather immaterial, but they attempted to trace their
30          movements from the time they were last seen alive on the
31           terrace to the time that they were identified and the post
32         - mortem was carried o u t .     They tried to trace through the
33           sequence of events.
34                  In some   cases, of course, there was a lot of evidence
35           about it. In     some cases, sadly, there          was very little.
36           The West Midlands Police composed files which they refer
37           to as "body files" in relation to each deceased.                 What
38           they did was     to put the statements of          thevarious
39          witnesses on      the file supporting what          was said in the



                                             2
 1       summary.   The summary was given at the mini-inquest as you
 2       recall.
 3   A   I do have a copy of that summary.
 4   Q   There was then - again, as I think you probably       know - a
 5       Police Inspector Leighton who went through what was called
 6       the visual evidence.     This was an attempt by looking at
 7       video stills, photographs and so on, which were available
 8       to try to identify various stages.     First of all, where
 9       they were on the terrace when they were alive, where they
10       were found, where they were taken to on the pitch when
11       they were taken to the mortuary and so on.       Again,   in many
12       cases - although not all - there is       evidence of that.     It


il
15
         might be a good idea if we get the
         we can have a look at it.
                                               body file on Kester so
                                      That is the way it was done.
                I think you will appreciate that in the general
16       confusion that there was it is perhaps not surprising that
17       sometimes the trail is not as clear as it might be.           One
18       of the things that I am looking into is this question of
19       trying to trace any discrepancies and so on that there
20       are, but I think I have to tell you that eight and a half
21       years afterwards, or whatever it is, I am not probably
22       going to be able to resolve them.     It is no good asking
23       witnesses now what they remember because they will simply
24       say:   "I made a statement at the time.     I cannot remember
25       anything other than what is in my statement."
26              In some cases there are clear discrepancies and it is
27       perfectly obvious that one witness is wrong.        I can think
28       if one case - not Kester's case - where it is quite plain
29       that one witness is just completely wrong.       There are
30       other instances,   for example, where people have identified
31       somebody inside the ground when in fact they have also
32       been identified outside the ground at the same time or
33       earlier.      I am afraid that these kinds of problems are
34       inevitable.     I will try to resolve any conflicts that I
35       can, but I have to tell you I am not very hopeful about
36       it.
37   A   I appreciate that, sir.     I am not really asking you to
38       resolve this conflict.     I just want to put it on the
39       record.


                                      3
 1    Q     Can you just draw my attention to          what the conflict is
 2          that troubles you.     I probably should have picked this up
 3          from your letter, should I?
 4    A     I just said we have a letter from          West Midlands Police
 5          admitting that there is a conflict of evidence between the
 6          police officer who claims to have carried Kester out from
 7          the pen, and a Liverpool supporter who claims ---
 8    MR.   BONE:     This must be the police officer,       John Lawrence.   Is
 9          that the name?
10    A     I think it was Lawrence, yes.
11    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          We have not got out own file on
12          this one, have we.         We will make one.   We have not got the
13          summary at the moment, have we?
i.4   MR.   BONE:     Not unless it is on there.
15    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          It will not be on here. The summary
16          of the mini-inquest.         I do not think we have got that.
17    MR.   BONE:     No.
18    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          At all events, was Mr. Lawrence the
19          police officer concerned?
20    A     Yes,     I think it was.     We subsequently met Mr. Lawrence.
21    Q     Have you got his statement, or not?
22    A     No, I don't think so.         I don't really want to spend a lot
23          of time on this.      It is history now.       I just wanted to
24          bring it to your attention that this one thing we have
25          never been satisfied about.           According to the police
26           officer, Kester was never left alone.          His body was always
27           attended to by a member of the police force.          Yet the
28           evidence of a Liverpool fan ---
29    Q      Who was that?
30    A      I am trying to find the letter.          I think his name was Pan
31           or something like that.
32    MR.    BONE:     There is a statement from a supporter in this file.
33    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          Was it Pitt?
34    A      Pitt; that is it, yes.        Basically, what I am questioning
 35          is the contention by the police that he was always in the
 36          presence of a police officer from the moment he was
 37          carried out of the pen.        When I recovered consciousness -
 38          as you may know,     I lost consciousness - I saw a row of
 39          about seven bodies which had been placed next to the fence


                                              4
 1         by the river.         There were no police officers    around at
 2         all.    Obviously,      I looked at those bodies because I was
 3         concerned about Kester. I thought he might be one of them,
 4         but he w a s n 1t .
 5   Q     He was on the pitch?
 6   A     No, he was never taken on the pitch.
 7   Q     Where was he taken?
 8   A     He was taken out the back into the courtyard           behind the
 9         terracing, and so was I.         What went on behind the
10         terracing, unfortunately there is no record of that so far
11         as I am aware, but it was an absolute shambles.            There
12         were people milling around.           Nobody seemed to know what
           was going on or anything.         Bodies were just being laid by
il         the fence, as I say.
15   MR.   BONE:     This was in the court yard by the River Don?
16   A     Yes, that is right.        There was the court yard and then
17         there was the area behind which gave access to the main
18         stand, and then there was a fence and then there was the
19         river.
20   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          That is where some of the
21         ambulances were coming in?
22   A     That is right,        I saw the ambulances waiting and not doing
23         anything.     There was a row of ambulances had come through
24         the perimeter gates,        the outside gates, and were parked.     I
25         even saw ambulancemen standing round smoking cigarettes,
26         and this was like an hour after the disaster.
27   Q     The evidence,     I think, given at the Taylor Inquiry by a
28         doctor - I forget which one it was now,          I think there were
29         two doctors out at the back there, both Liverpool
30         supporters ---
31   A     There was a                     wasn't there?
32   Q     There was a                    knd there was a Dr. Ashton or
33          Philips,   I cannot remember which.        They were there.    There
34         were also ambulance personnel who were doing this triaging
35          and trying to distinguish between thoae who should go to
36          hospital because there was some hope for them and those
37         who unfortunately were already dead.            It is no good
38         pretending it was an ideal situation;            it certainly
39         wasn't.     I think that certainly so far as the Taylor


                                             5
    1       Inquiry was concerned,      they did go into that question,         and
    2       my recollection is that there was certainly evidence that
    3       that was going on at the back there, but it may be, as you
    4       say, that people were not being attended all the time.               I
    5       should think that is quite possible.
    6   A   My second point concerns the condition in the pen itself,
    7       pen 3.     Obviously I have read the Taylor Report several
    8       times.     I have not got a full transcript of the inquest
    9       but I am not sure that people appreciate what it was
10          really like in there.       I know quite a bit of evidence was
11          called.
12      Q   There were some pretty graphic descriptions - yours
            amongst th e m .
E       A   Yes.     What I would like to make clear is that I have been
15          supporting Liverpool for over 3 5 years, and I used to
16          stand on the kop where there was a lot of crowd movement
17          and crushing and so on.       What actually happened in pen 3
18          was that parts of the pen became absolutely solid, but
19          other parts there were gaps.         Somehow people were able to
20          move around because I had two other boys with us, two of
21          Kester's friends, and one of them was to our left - so
22          that is down in the bottom left hand corner of the pen
23          looking towards the pitch - and he was able to, a kind of
24          gap opened up behind him and he was able to duck under a
25          crossbar and go back out down the tunnel, up the tunnel in
26          fact.     My point is that it was not a uniform
27          solidification.
28                  Where I was and obviously where Kester was, we were
29          right in the heart of the worst part of it. Most of the
30          deaths occurred around u s .        I have seen the dot c h a r t , you
31          know.     It was impossible to breathe there.         But there were
32          areas in the pen where it was not like that, and it is my
33          contention that not everybody was dead by 3.15.             I think,
34          from my experience of what goes on in those kinds of
35          situations, that is impossible.
36      Q   We know that not everybody was dead by 3.15.             I do not
37          think anybody has ever suggested that they were. There is
38          a great misunderstanding about the coroner's decision
39          about this.        He did not say everybody was dead by 3.15.


                                            6
  1        He made it perfectly plain that some of them were n o t .                We
 2         know two cases in particular where they died in hospital,
 3         one I think the next day and one two or three days later.
 4         It has never been,   I think, anybody's concept that they
 5        were all dead by then.        What he did say - and I think this
 6         is uncontrovertible - is that those who died had received
 7         their injuries by 3.15.       That,     I think,   is incontestable.
 8    A   Why did he not admit any evidence after 3.15 then?
 9    Q   You would have to read his full reasoning, but basically I
10         think I can summarise it like this.           The purpose of an
11         inquest is strictly limited. It is to decide who the
12        deceased was, where, when and how he died, and how,
13        according to the law, by what means he died.              Why it took
1.4       so long to decide that question may be a dubious matter,
15        but he said that it was not part of his statutory function
16        to go into the aftermath, to have an extensive inquiry as
17        to what various people did or did not do.              That decision,
18        that reasoning, was upheld by the Divisional Court.                 You
19        probably know that there was an application to the
20        Divisional Court for judicial review.           I do not think you
21        were involved.
22    A   Yes, that was in 1993, wasn't it?
23    Q   Yes.
24    A   I was not involved in th at.
25    Q   That question was challenged in the Divisional Court,              the
26        cut off point, and the Divisional Court upheld the
27        coroner's reasoning.       Lord Taylor examined the question
28        in the delay in summoning help in alerting the emergency
29        services and so on, he criticised the police about that.
30        At the Taylor Inquiry there was, in fact, no criticism of
31        the response of the emergency services.             He went into it
32        in very considerable detail.           Did you attend the inquiry
33        at all?
34    A   The Taylor Inquiry?
35    Q   Y e s . ...... .   ........         ..
36    A   No, I wasn't invited to attend.
37    Q   He heard evidence from a number          ofwitnesses    in   the
38        emergency services, ambulance offices - senior officers in
39        the ambulance service - fire brigade officers, and so on.


                                          7
 1       He made a number of recommendations as to liaison between
 2       the police and emergency services and so on.                All that
 3       aspect of the matter was covered in the Taylor Inquiry.
 4             One   could perhaps say Taylor could have gone into it
 5       in greater detail, but      he did actually go into it in very
 6       considerable detail.       He was aware of the confusion.              I
 7       mean, you have only got to look at the television coverage
 8       which I have seen a great deal of - and I expect you have
 9       too - to see the state of affairs.
10             The     coroner said, in       fact,   "It is no part of my
11       function    to re-examine that question." Again, the
12       Divisional Court said he was right about t h a t .             Part of


tl
15
         the question which I am looking into is whether there is
         really any fresh evidence which is
         or on behalf
                                                       being put before me
                         of the families which calls that decision
                                                                                by
                                                                                    in
16       question, and that is one of the things that I am looking
17       at.
18             These issues have been considered by the Court
19       before, and it is not going to be easy.             I cannot say the
20       Court was wrong.    I am not the Court of Appeal.             I can only
21       say to the responsible authorities,            if I am satisfied that
22       there is really new evidence which undermines the
23       reasoning of the Divisional Court, that the thing should
24       be re-examined.     That is the position.          That is what I am
25       looking at.     Of course, the question of what happened
26       after 3.15, whether there should be any further inquiry
27       about it, is a matter which I am concerned about.
28   A   I was in the Coroner's Court when            he made this
29       announcement about 3.15, and my understanding was that he
30       made it on the grounds of the pathological evidence.
31   Q   To some extent he did. I think I have summarised it
32       correctly for you, but I can read you the relevant bit if
33       you like.     I think one of the problems is that people have
34       misunderstood t h i s .   They think that he did it on the
35       basis that everybody was dead by 3.15 and that is not what
36       he said.
37   A   I stand corrected then.      That was        my assumption.
38   Q   First of all he said this:




                                          8
     1         "The fact that it was national news that it was 95
    2         young people created a terrible amount of anxiety,
    3         pain and so on some ways, is unique because of the
    4         numbers, but each individual death I dealt with the
    5         families are in exactly the same situation.     I tried
    6         to think, and I still try to think, what and how
    7         would I set about it if it had been a road traffic
    8         accident or a works accident as opposed to an
    9         incident in a football stadium.     I have thought back
10            on many occasions to, say, a road traffic incident
11            where somebody might have suffered a serious head
12            injury.     That person may well have been at the
              roadside for X number of minutes while one was
S             waiting for the ambulance services to attend.       They
15            may then have been taken by an ambulance to a
16            hospital.      They may have gone into the resuscitation
17            room.     They may have been worked upon by doctors.
18            They have gone into hospital.     They may have then
19            died three days or even longer after the incident, or
20            alternatively you can have a situation ---- "
21       then he talks about a doctor being at the roadside as an
22       alternative situation.
23            "In none of those instances would I as a matter of
24            routine call evidence of what happened after the
25            incident itself was concerned, and indeed the
26            pathologist in the example which I have used would
27            have given as cause of death serious head injury,       for
28            instance, or multiple injuries with fracture of the
29            skull or something of that nature.     It seems to me
30            that the fact that a person may survive an injury for
31            a number of minutes or hours or even days is not the
32            question which I as Coroner have to consider. My task
33            is to establish who the person was - I am sorry to
34            repeat this - when he died, where he died and how he
35            died.     It is from my understanding of the
36            pathological evidence that the overwhelming
37            pathological evidence is and was that the people died
38            as a result of crushing or from asphyxia."
39       There is no doubt that that is right.


                                      9
    1           "Different words were used but the sense was always
    2           the same.     The underlying problem which these poor
    3           men and women were subjected to was inability to
    4           breathe.     That does not mean to say that some of them
    5           did not in fact expire for a period of time, or even
    6           have a heart beat thereafter, but the damage was done
    7           and indeed both Dr. Gumpert and later Professor Usher
    8           who dealt with this question in their overall point
    9           all in fact said, as I understand their evidence,
10              exactly the same."
11      Then he deals with the point about some people thinking
12      that because the certification of death was later that
        they were alive until that point.        That is obviously a bad
E       point.     Then he says this - and there is a great deal of
15      it really - that he understands the anxieties of the
16      parents and so on.        At some stage he says that he has
17      actually gone back on his own ruling because he has dealt
18      in considerable detail at the mini-inquests how these
19      things occurred. He says:
20              "Bearing in mind that I intend at this stage to deal
21              with the question of how - and I do intend to deal
22              with it comprehensively - I have to remember two
23              things.     My powers are limited.   I do not have open
24              ended authority to carry out an investigation."
25      He deals with the rules and the Act and so on, and he
26      again really says that he does not have an open ended
27      remit to carry out an investigation.         He refers to the
28      Zeebrugge case - you remember, the Herald of Free
29      Enterprise - and the Coroner in that case took a cut off
30      point which was upheld by the Court.         He says in some
31      cases there will be witnesses who he is going to call at
32      the generic inquest who will deal with some incidents of
33      what happened after 3.15.        He says that there are a number
34      of cases which he has come across where there has been
35      some corrections or alterations of what was previously
36      said.
37              Really,   in effect, what he is saying is it is not the
38      purpose of an inquest to have a wide ranging inquiry on
39      those matters.        I think at some stage he refers to Lord


                                        10
 1   Taylor's Inquiry.    I am afraid it is rather a long
 2   reasoning but I am trying to pick out the pith of it.
 3   Yes.    Thank you for clarifying that.     I had not
 4   appreciated that he allowed for certain deaths occurring
 5   after 3.15.    The point I am trying to make is that
 6   conditions in the pen were variable,      and they were
 7   varying.    They were not static.     I mean, where I was they
 8   were static.
 9   I think that comes out very clearly.      I have read a lot of
10   the evidence of people both at the Taylor Inquiry and at
11   the inquest of people in the pen, and you do not get the
12   same picture from everybody obviously because different
13   people saw different things, but I think you get this
14   picture of a very fluid situation in some parts.          There is
15   horrendous evidence of i t .
16   When the gate was opened eventually the other boy who was
17   with us was one of the first to escape through that gate,
18   and he was to our right.     He was down near the front.
19   Obviously, he was able to move, as was the other boy who
20   went back through the tunnel. Unfortunately,      Kester and I
21   were in that solid mass which turned into a pile of
22   bodies, as the police referred to.
23   This is the appalling thing.      It requires being locked for
24   a sufficient amount of time for death to occur.        I think
25   it was put at something like four to six minutes, or
26   something of that sort;     less than that for
27   unconsciousness obviously.        I am certainly well aware of
28   the situation.    I do not think anybody else has been under
29   any misapprehension about it, otherwise everybody in the
30   pen would have been dead.
31   Yes, thank you for clarifying that.       Can I turn to the
32   question of obviousness and whether the conditions in the
33   pen were clearly giving rise to danger.        I want to refer
34   to the evidence given by Mr. John Motson at the inquest,
35   who was the BBC commentator actually commentating on the
36   match that afternoon.
37          As I recall, he gave evidence that it was obvious to
38   him up on the TV gantry that there was crushing, or at
39   best there was overcrowding in pens 3 and 4.       He made a


                                  11
    1          comment,     in fact, that pens 2 and 5 seemed to be half
    2         empty and he wondered whether some of the tickets had not
    3         been sold.
    4                 Since this happened,   I have become a friend of John
    5         Motson's because he lived quite near to where we lived at
    6         the time. I have talked to him quite a bit about this.             I
    7         cannot see how it was not obvious to the police in the
    8         control box that there was a problem when it was obvious
    9         to John Motson who was over 100 yards away up in the TV
10            gantry.
11      Q     I have not actually read Motson's evidence at the
12            inquest - I will do that - but we have watched the videos
              and listened to his comments on them. Certainly, he
e             appreciated that the side pens were relatively empty.             I am
15            not sure that he appreciated that there was a dangerous
16            overcrowding in the centre p e n s .
17      MR.   BONE:       I think I can get you the actual quote on that,       Sir
18            M u rra y.
19      LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Can you.    I know I have looked at
20            this but my impression is that he did not appreciate that,
21            and indeed,      like everybody else at the outset thought that
22            there was a pitch invasion.         That is right,   is it not?
23      MR.   BONE:       That seems to be the case, yes.    Shall I go and get
24            it?
25      LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Yes.
26      A     He, in fact, was not allowed to give this evidence at the
27            inquest.       He was sent out of court when he started
28            commenting on the pens, and there was a legal discussion,
29            and I think the Coroner decided that he could not be asked
30            these questions because he was not an expert on crowd
31            safety.
32      Q     I can look at t h a t .   I think that if this was a real point
33            it would have been taken in the Divisional Court;           it
34            certainly should have been.         A point like that,   if it was
35            a valid point, ought to have been argued in the Divisional
36            Cou r t .
37      A     I don't know if it was brought up.
38      Q     No, it wasn't.




                                             12
    1   A   Can I just say as well that before I lost consciousness
    2       somebody crawled over my head.      There were people actually
    3       crawling around. I don't know if you have seen this on the
    4       tapes, where people were actually crawling around on top
    5       of the crowd where it was packed together.      Surely,    that
    6       was an obvious sign that there was a serious problem.
    7   Q   The police did realise that there was a serious problem,
    8       but they did not realise it soon enough.      That was the
    9       difficulty.
10      A   You refer to my "graphic description".    I don't know if I
11          mentioned the kind of silence that hung over pens 3 and 4.
12      Q   I think you did.
        A   Which was quite eerie and unusual.     Apart from a few
e           people groaning and one or two shouting out from the back
15          at the police to open the gate,     it was very quiet, and I
16          would have thought that would be another indication.
17      Q   It was around you but further back people were shouting.
18      A   People behind were shouting and from the seats above,       but
19          where we were - and there were police officers between us
20          and the goal.      Why on earth did they not realise there was
21          a serious problem, and how on earth could they have
22          interpreted that as pitch invasion.
23      Q   I take all these points, but they have all been canvassed
24          before at the Taylor Inquiry and at the inquest.      My
25          function is not to re-run those inquiries but merely to
26          see whether there is any further evidence.     I don't know
27          whether you know it has been suggested that there is
28          various video evidence which is of significance,     and of
29          course, that is a very important aspect.       Here you are
30          now.   When you were there in that position you have told
31          us obviously that you couldn't even speak.      You couldn't
32          hear any cries and shouts around you.
33                      "Yes, it was most eerie because I knew the match
34                 had started because of the noise of the crowd.       You
35                 could tell from the roars of the crowd that in our
36                 area, our immediate area, it was silent except for
37                 people groaning and people shouting for help for
38                 somebody to do something."
39          That is the passage that you have in mind?


                                          13
    1   A   That is right, yes.     Of course, as I understand it the
    2       inquest jury were directed on this obviousness point that
    3       it was not obvious that there was a serious problem.            My
    4       contention is that it was obvious.
    5   Q   The Coroner did not    say that. He said it was a matter for
    6       them to decide.
    7   A   OK.   When he explained the seven stages they have to go
    8       through such as recklessness and so on,        I am not a lawyer
    9       but I do know a little bit about this,       the verdict of
10          unlawful killing fell down on this obviousness point,           and
11          this is why the police are so adamant.        First of all,
12          there was a story about one of the machines had broken
            down or something,    one of the cameras wasn't working.
e       Q   This is a matter I am    looking into.
15      A   I accept that this is     probably not new evidence.       I have
16          not brought you any new evidence today.        What I wanted to
17          do is reinforce what I have said before about this, and to
18          bring to your attention my personal experience on the day.
19          I still can't believe     that my son could pay €6 for a
20          ticket for a football     match and come home dead and that
21          nobody is at fault.     I really cannot accept t h a t .
22      Q   Can I just take you    up on this point because this is a
23          point which has been made to me time and again by families
24          and so on, the question of nobody being at fault.           That is
25          not correct.
26                Lord Taylor in his report strenuously criticised the
27          police.   He said that they had lost control of the crowd
28          outside, and they ought to have anticipated the late
29          arrival of a large number of peop l e .     They ought to have
30          had a better system of filtering and so on.         So he
31          criticised them in relation to that, but more importantly
32          he criticised them for not appreciating that when they
33          opened the gate the great bulk of those people would go
34          through the tunnel into pens which were already full.               He
35          was very critical of that.         He called it a blunder of the
36          first magnitude.
37                He was also critical of the club because the
38          turnstiles and the lay out of the Leppings Lane end was
39          quite inadequate,     in my view,    for a crowd of this size and


                                          14
 1       also in his view.     He was critical of the City Council
 2       because of the dilatory way in which they had dealt with
 3       the Safety Certificate and the inadequacies of the Safety
 4       Certificate.    He was critical,     I think, of the engineers
 5       because the safety barriers and so on were not sufficient,
 6       and the one that collapsed was not up to strength.
 7       Whether it should have passed the test or not, is perhaps
 8       another matter.     So he was very critical of all those
 9       people, particularly the police.
10              The Director of Public Prosecutions then        had to
11       consider whether any prosecutions        should take   place, and
12       he did that upon the basis of not only the evidence before

r
14
         Lord Taylor but a great deal of other evidence as well
         which was put before him.       I have read the opinions of
15       counsel in relation to that, and I shall be commenting on
16       them in my report.        The Director   has to make   up his mind
17       whether or not there is more than        a 50/50 chance of
18       securing a conviction for manslaughter, which is the only
19       relevant consideration.
20              There were two possible candidates,      the police
21       officers in charge who were the only two whom it         was
22       really possible to consider.        I have got to seewhether
23       any of this fresh evidence might bear upon that decision
24       so that he would have to reconsider i t .
25              Then, of course, there were the civil proceedings.           I
26       do not know whether you made any claim in the civil
27       proceedings,   did you?
28   A   Not in court, no.
29   Q   No, but I mean did you make a claim?
30   A   Oh yes, against     South Yorkshire Police.
31   Q   Both in respect of Kester and ----
32   A   That   is right, yes, they paid up.
33   Q   And what about your own injuries?        Did   you make a claim?
34   A   Yes,   I did, and their insurance company paid up.         There
35       was an argument about quantum obviously.
36   Q   Of course.
37   A   Which dragged it on a bit.
38   Q   But there was never any dispute on liability?




                                        15
 1   A   No,   I know they admitted liability.   They did not admit
 2       responsibility though.     The police have never admitted it.
 3       They have never even apologised for what happened.
 4   Q   I think an apology is a different matter, but they have
 5       certainly admitted liability which is responsibility.          I
 6       think one can chop logic about this, but they never
 7       disputed liability.     They brought proceedings against
 8       other parties for a contribution, but they did admit
 9       responsibility.    That is what an admission or acceptance
10       of liability is.    To say that nobody has been held to
11       blame is just not correct.
12             There is a distinction, you see - I am sure you
13       understand this - between civil liability in negligence
14       and criminal liability for manslaughter where you are
15       looking at the actions of a single police officer.        In
16       civil liability the Chief Constable is vicariously liable
17       for the actions of all his police officers,     so you simply
18       look at the thing in the round.
19             It is just not true to say that nobody has been held
20       responsible.
21   A   Nobody has been found guilty ofanything      in the courts.
22   Q   No, nobody has been prosecuted.
23   A   Is what I am saying.
24   Q   That is a different point.
25   A   I am not a vindictive person.     I am not looking for
26       punishment.     I am looking for somebody to hold their hand
27       up and say "Yes, it was my fault."      I am not speaking for
28       all the families now,    I am speaking for me. You have
29       obviously got some families who feel more strongly about
30       it than oth ers.
31   Q   I do not know whether an apology is something which is in
32       order now.    I really don't know.   The police have admitted
33       liability.    That has been said twice now   in the courts.
34       McCowan LJ in the Divisional Court said that the police
35       had admitted liability and paid compensation.      In one of
36       the cases that went to the House of Lords, Alcock v The
37       Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, Lord Keith who made
38       the leading speech said that there was no issue on
39       liability;     the police admitted liability.   Whether you


                                      16
 1        call it an admission of liability, acceptance of
 2        responsibility or what, it is all the same thing.
 3    A   I accept that. I am not trying to argue on technicalities.
 4        What I am saying is that after Taylor LJ had referred to a
 5        blunder of the first magnitude which resulted in 95 deaths
 6        - 96 now - gradually as the inquest proceeded and the
 7        memories receded into the background, we ended up with a
 8        verdict that it was an accident.         That is something that I
 9        find it difficult to get my head around.
10    Q   Again, this is something that has been put to         me a number
11        of times.     The difficulty is that it arises out of the
12        very limited scope of an inquest.        You probably know that
13        an inquest jury is not allowed to deal with civil
>14       liability, and it is not allowed to deal with criminal
15        liability naming a particular person.        They can bring in a
16        sort of general verdict of unlawful killing, and that was
17        one of the two verdicts which the Coroner left to the
18        jury.     He explained to them correctly that the fact that
19        they brought in a verdict of accidental death did not mean
20        that nobody was to bla m e .   He was quite right about t h a t .
21                To give you an example,     in the great majority of road
22        accident cases where there is a death, except in very very
23        extreme cases where there is a lot of drink and quite
24        obviously gross recklessness,        the verdict is accidental
25        death even though it is perfectly plain that the motorist
26        was at fault;     he should have seen the pedestrian and he
27        did not.     It is because of the limited number of verdicts
28        which are open to a jury that you get this problem.           I
29        mean,    I do hope that you hope that you understand that.
30        You are obviously a very intelligent man. I can understand
31        some people not being able to grasp this concept.
32    A   I do understand it.      In fact,   I work for Victim Support
33        Road Traffic Service now.       I left Lloyds Bank on health
34        grounds - I had symptoms of PTSD - and the past year or so
35        I have been working for the Road Traffic Service for
36        Victim Support, and I attend inquests.        I have been to one
37        this week,    in fact.
38    Q   I expect you have had this problem with other p e o p l e .




                                         17
 1    A   I have my own views about the Coroners' Rules and the way
 2        in which these investigations are carried out, and I think
 3        this is being looked at by somebody else,       isn't it, the
 4        whole question of inquests.
 5    Q   The whole question of inquests in these circumstances is
 6        being looked at by the Home Office.f
 7    A   And I just feel it is not before time because obviously
 8        inquests have not served the purpose that they were
 9        intended to serve in a number of major cases.
10    Q   They do not serve the purpose which a lot of people think
11        they should serve.
12    A   You yourself referred to a problem with the limited number
13        of verdicts,     and the sooner that is looked at the better I
1-4       think.   No matter what you say, I understand the jury had
15        a limited choice, obviously,      in the Hillsborough case, but
16        their verdict is still perceived by the general public
17        that it was an accident no matter what you say about what
18        Taylor said and what the Coroner said.        There is a general
19        perception - or even worse, that the fans brought it on
20        themselves.    That has been suggested a number of times.
21    Q   I will obviously do my best to correct these
22        misapprehensions, but I am afraid people do not
23        understand.    You talk about the public perception.     It is a
24        little difficult to know what the public perception is,
25        but if it is as you say it is misconceived.        There is no
26        question about it.     Anyhow,    I hope that this discussion
27        has been of some help to you.
28    A   It has, thank you.     Can I just mention one other thing?
29    Q   Yes.
30    A   You mentioned very briefly about the late arrival of the
31        fans.    I don't want to go back over old ground here, but I
32        am sure that you have looked into all this, but about one
33        third of Liverpool supporters don't live in Liverpool and
34        that is reflected in the 96 deaths.       Approximately one
35        third of them are not from Liverpool.
36    Q   A lot of Liverpool fans come from all over the place.
37    A   That is right.     I still go to Liverpool.   I was born and
38        bred in Liverpool, but I now live in Buckinghamshire.           I
39        still go to Liverpool for football matches.        Quite a large


                                       18
 1        number of fans did arrive from the South, Liverpool fans,
 2        along with the Nottingham Forest fans, and the centre of
 3        Sheffield that day was in gridlock.       It took us an hour
 4        from the motor way exit to park the car and get to the
 5        stadium.       I do not know if you are aware, but the Medahall
 6        Shopping Centre opened the previous day, or was officially
 7        opened the previous day.
 8    Q   Yes,   I did hear it.
 9    A   I worked at that time for Lloyds Leasing which is a
10        subsidiary of Lloyds Bank, and we financed it.       My boss
11        went up to the official opening the previous day so there
12        was th a t .    There was a huge hole in the road between the
J_3       motorway and Hillsborough,      so traffic was diverted towards
14        the City Centre.       My personal experience is that we were
15        stationary for at least five minutes.       This is all in my
16        statement.       The point I am trying to make is that the fans
17        did not in my experience deliberately arrive late. A lot
18        of fans did arrive round about 2.30, which is the time I
19        arrived.
20    Q   I think that is right.
21    A   Have you seen the ticket which requests people to arrive
22        15 minutes before the kick off?       Take your place 15
23        minutes before.
24    Q   Precisely.       The club said that does not mean what one
25        might take it to mean, which is turn up quarter of an hour
26        beforehand, but be in your seat, or whatever it is.          I
27        mean, it was ambiguous.       It was not a very sensible thing
28        to p u t .     Clearly Lord Taylor refers to that.
29    A   One of the recommendations of Taylor LJ in the final
30        report was to have much clearer instructions on tickets
31        and clearer diagrams.
32    Q   The tickets were very unsatisfactory in many ways.         The
33        diagram on the back was misleading.        The signposting as to
34         where people were to go was misleading and unsatisfactory.
35    A   I wasn't aware that there were any other entrances on to
36         those terraces.       There were other entrances around the
37         side .

 1   Q    I think most people were the same as you.       This is why he
 2        was very critical of the club.       Thank you very much for
 3        comi ng.
 4   A    Thank you for listening to m e . I am sorry if it is all
 5        stuff you have heard before.
 6   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         No, that is what I am here for.
 7   A   If we say it often enough,       somebody might believe us one
 8        day.
 9   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I take entirely what you   say. I
10        fully understand.      I think you must realise, however,   that
11        my terms of reference are limited.
12   A   Yes,     I have read them very carefully.
     LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I cannot just re-open the whole
%
15   A
          thing.
         No,     I understand.
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I have got to look very carefully
17        to see whether what is said to be fresh evidence really is
18        fresh evidence, and if so what impact it has. It may be
19        that if I write a report it may be possible to disabuse
20        some people of misapprehensions that you say they are
21        suffering from.
22   A   I wish you w e l l .    Thank you for explaining those points
23        and for listening very patiently to m e .

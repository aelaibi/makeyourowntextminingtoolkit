             On Saturday,               15th April           W&W,        I- came       on    d u t y at 0 8 0 0          a m at     Bentley

             Police         Station and              arrived       at H i l l s b o r o u g h      ground           in t ime      for    the

             commencement               fo r    the    briefing.

                  was    responsible             to    PS Lindup          and     Inspector             Townend.

             At    the      conclusion           of    the    briefing,           my     serial         went        to C l a y w h e e l s    Lane

             to a s s i s t       in    the     de    busing       of    f ans    from       their        coaches.            I encountered

             no    problems            with     any    of    the    arriving           fans.           There        were    possibly          up   to

             20    fans       that      had     got    off    the       buses     who       appeared           to    have     not    got      a

             ticket         for    the       match and        they were           asking          f ans      from      subesequent            buses

             if    they       had any          tickets       to    sell,       but     it, w a s       d one    in a n      o r d e r l y manner,

There       were        many      fans          on the          pitch        going         berserk,               invariably                  they were

                  CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT THOMPSON                     Date:   15th MAY 1989



                SUBJECT:    INCIDENT AT HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBM. GR&JND, SHEFFIELD ON
                            SATURDAY 15th APRIL 1989.    \     J


                On Saturday 15th April 1989 I came on duty at8.00 am at Bentley Police
                Station and arrived at Hillsborough ground in time for the commencementof
                the briefing.

                I was responsible to PS Lindop and Inspector Townend.

                At the conclusion of the briefing, rny serial went to Clayvtfieels Lane to
                assist in the de busing of fans from their coaches. I encountered no
                problems with any of the arriving fans. There were possibly up to 20 fans
                that had got off the buses who appeared to have not got a ticket of the
                match and they were asking fans from subsequent buses if they had any
                tickets to sell, but it was done in an orderly manner.

                All the. buses to be parked at this location had been parked by about


                I then went along to Halifax Read with Penistone Road and there supervised
                fans, mainly Liverpool fans, coming down from parked buses left further up
                the hill. There appeared to be thousands of them, a large number obviously ,
                under the influence of alcohol, many carrying cans or bottles of alcoholin
                their hands or pockets and many drinking what they were carrying. All
                those seen with any containers of alcohol were shepherded to one side and
                they either drank what they had or left the residue at this location.

                Out of all those that came my way I saw only 5 or 6 who showed obvious
                signs of likelyhood that they could be troublesome.

                By about 3.05 pm it appeared that, apart from the possible odd straggler,
                all the Liverpool fans had passed by. As it was at this time now quiet and
                the instruction had been for us to go for a meal at Claywheels garage when
                the game started my serial made towards Claywheels Lane Garage.

                As my serial approached the junction of Claywheels Lane with Penistone
                Road, I heard over the radio conversation that said there was going to be a
                catastrophy at the gates. A few minutes later it sounded as though it had
                happened although I had not been able to make out just what, so by corrmon
                consent my serial redirected our path to gates 77-88 on Penistone Road,
                arriving about 3.15 pm.

                On entering through the gateway 77-88 I saw several ambulances with injured
                persons nearby.

                I gained access to the pitch by going between the North & West Stand and
                could see the problem was on the other side of the pitch at the Spoin Kop.
                I made my way over to the Kop side and assisted in the resuscitation of
                some injured and assisted in carrying 2 obviously dead fans, on make shift
                board stretchers, assisted by people who a few minutes earlier had been
                spectators, to the Gymnasium. Some other Officers stayed with those dead.

         There were many fans on the pitch going beserk, invariably they were under
         the influence of alcohol. I saw a lot of fights break out, seme with
         Police Officers as they vented their anger on them, blaming them for the
         occurrence. I also had to assist to restrain several fans fighting one
         another - over what I still don't know.

         After taking the two dead fans to the Gymnasium, I then assisted in crowd
         control until the ground was later cleared.

         I did not see the build up of the problem outside the gates, nor did I see
         the immediate result of what happened inside the penned area, until I
         entered the grounds about 3.15 pn to assist with the dead and injured
         inside the perimeter area.

Dear Sirs

ADLINGTON -V- DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

Thank you for your letter of 1 December, In saying that the decision will be made on
or before 18 December, whilst not wanting to play at semantics can you categorically
say that no decision will have been made by 7 December which is the day that this case
was supposed to have gone back into the Magistrates’ Court.

Yours faithfully




R ly Manning

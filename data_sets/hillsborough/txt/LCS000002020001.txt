            The Hillsborough d i s a s t e r and i t s aftermath continues to Have a profound
and traumatic e f f e c t on many peo pl e. The Immediate response o f a l l agencies
was admirable. I t cut through many o f the t r a d i t i o n a l methods o f working both
w it h in and between agencie s and enabled a s e n s i t i v e ’c r i s i s s e r v i c e ’ to bs

EMERGING PROBLEMS

             The s t a f f , p a r t i c u l a r l y in Liverpool, who have been organizing central
s e r v i c e s such as the Helpline and the Database have worked remarkably hard in
extremely d i f f i c u l t circumstances. What i s becoming c l e a r however i s that
’ e f f o r t ' w i l l not n e c e s s a r i l y t r a n s l a t e Into e f f e c t i v e s er v i c e i f the
p r i n c i p l e s , framework and t o o l s are i l l thought out or Inappropriate. Some
examples o f the problems which are emerging in the absence o f a coordinating                                    A
s t r u c t u r e are:

(D    Da ta ba s e

            Although beginning to produce some useful output from over a thousand
e n t r i e s , the programme (used in the Zeebrugge fo l l o w up) i s not ideal and w i l l
not be able to provide the appropriate information s e r v i c e .            I t has not bofcn
p o s s i b l e to implement the recommendations made in the After Hillsborough
fi.sp,prt and in the absence of a coordinated corporate approach i t 1s cl ear that
many hundred o f r e f e r r a l s and ca ses are not being forwarded to the- Database.
Moreover many voluntary agenc ies are not referri ng to the Database at a l l . *
R e f e r r a ls which are being r eceived o ften do not contain v i t a l information.
All t h i s dysfunctioning i s p e r f e c t l y pred i cta bl e and i s not the fa u l t cf
ind ividu al s t a f f . I t i s the product o f the non-implementation o f a corporate
strategy.

       This l i n e was a great succe s s during the i n i t i a l c r i s i s p^sse foll owi ng
Hillsborough. However i t s use i s dropping o f f rapidl y. I t s r o ^ reeds
ret hinking and then relaunching with a new cen tra l number. Again i t i s
u n li k e ly tha t t h i s can occur 1n the absence o f a Regional Unit.

(111) Communication and PR

            There are numerous examples o f poor cofrimunicat ion p a r t i c u l a r l y between
s t a t u t o r y and voluntary s e r v i c e s . ’Co mpeti tion’ between a g en ci es i s apparent
and evidence that some f a m i l i e s are being over v i s i to r; because
uncoordinated responses between a g en ci es 1s now e m e r g i n g .

              In r e l a t io n to PR the pr esent r e a c t i v e response, warned a g a in s t 1n A f t e r
H ills boro ugh, means that media I n t e r e s t in Hill sborough has wane:. Thus the *"
Impression begin gained i s tha t the problem 1s over. This ..is                         . t r u e ..As.-the
oviu'cuCe piuu'u^tiu gy the uaxabase ana iocai a g en ci es demonstrates.'
Unfortunately Images and Impressions i n f l u e n c e resourcing and a s n l f
f u l f i l l i n g p r o p h e c y emerges - no Regional Unit - no p ro acti ve approach t o PR -
  no media i n t e r e s t - no l a s t i n g problem - no need f o r a Regional Unit.

s t i l l no c l a r i t y of purpose about the ’second ph ase’ response and"no real
s t r uc t u r e to ensure q u a li ty and equity o f s e r v i c e . This s i t u a t i o n i s bound t o
continue without regional c oordinati on and s u f f i c i e n t s t a f f whose primary task
1s t o manage and motivate the o v e ra l l response.




      The need for regional c o ordi nati on and support via a Rec'cnal Ass is t a n c e
Unit remains.   Indeed on the evidence o f th e past montn the '            ions in
the After Hillsborough Report seem even more p e rti n en t .

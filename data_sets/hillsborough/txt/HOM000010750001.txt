            HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY : HOME OFFICE EVIDENCE



The Home Secretary and Lord Ferrers saw your submission of 9 June
and were content with the evidence for the Hillsborough Inquiry.
The Home Secretary, however, asked for a much shorter reference
to the Football Spectators Bill. You kindly provided this in
your submission of 12 June and the Home Secretary has agreed it.

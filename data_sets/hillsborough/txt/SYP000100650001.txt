A    traffic          mobile          was    doing     duty    on    Penistone             Road    opposite             the

Road       so    as       to    keep    the    stretch        of    Penistone          Road       in       front    of    the

ground          clear,          unfortunately           there       were       so    many    vehicles             that

ambulances                approaching          t he    ground       from       City    were       getting          caught

up    in       the    traffic          tail    back.

I    do    not       know       how    long    I was     waiting          in    Penistone          Road         until     all

Dog       Handlers             were    ordered        into    the    ground          but    when       I    did    go    in,

there          was    a    traffic          motorcyclist           showing          ambulances             where    to

enter          the    ground.

I    do    not       know       details       of   other      officers          at    the    location             where       I

was       other       than       PC    1443    Ellis     who       did    not       assist    me       because          there

was       no    need.           On    the    whole,     it    appeared          that       once    at       the    ground

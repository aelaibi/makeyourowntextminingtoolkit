Dear Sirs

Re:   Hillsborough

In relation to the pre-trial review at Middlesbrough Crown Court on
the 24th July, we enclose herewith two copies of our Bundles 3, 4
and   5  for  yourselves  and   Counsel.    These   Bundles contain
respectively Summonses and Orders, Transcripts and correspondence.
Bundles 1 and 2 are the pleadings in respect of Chapnan and Rinuner,
and copies will be available at Court on the 24th July.

We have provided Mr. Justice Jowitt with copies of all five Bundles,
together with a copy of the "consolidated" underlined Taylor Interim
Report and the Final Report with the Chief Constable's underlining.

Yours faithfully
HAMMOND SUDDARDS

      Dear Sirs,

      Hillsborough - Eastwood & Partners

     We thank you for your telefax of 17th July enclosing your
     proposed directions for the pre-trial review on 24th July which
     we are considering.

     We are informed by the Teeside Crown Court that the pre-trial
     review before Mr. Justice Jowitt will now take place at the
     Moot Hall, Newcastle on 24th July at 2. 00 p. m. We understand
     that you have been informed of this.

     We also acknowledge receipt of your two letters of 18th July
     enclosing your client's List of Documents and two sets of
     bundles 3, 4 and 5 for the pre-trial review.    You supplied us
     with one set of bundles 3,4 and 5 for the hearing on 24th May
     which are with Counsel.   However, these bundles with which you
     have now supplied us appear remarkably similar.     Please will
     you indicate what further documents, if any, have been added to
     bundles 1 and 2 which were not before the Court on 24th May.

    We are prepared to accept service of your client's List of
    Documents although it is considerably out of time.          Item 1 is
    described as "Documentation produced to the Inquiry headed by
    the   Right   Hon ou r a b l e Lord    Justice  Taylor".      We have
    corresponded     at      some   leng t h  already   c oncerning  this
    documentation.    Please confirm that we have now received from
    you copies of all the documents included in this item and, to
    the extent that we have not received such copies, the documents
    are dealt with in your letter of 5th July.




                                                                                                  1

    We note that you have only one copy   of the sets of photographs
    numbered 117-139.   It would assist    us in deciding w hether to
    seek copies of these photographs if   we were able to have sight
    of them.    Please confirm whether    you would be prepared to
    forward these photographs to us on    a temporary basis for this
    purpos e.

Dear Sirs,

Hillsborough

Thank you for your letter of 20th July.

We confirm our understanding that the hearing is now in Newcastle,
marked not before 2.00 p.m.

So far as documentation is concerned, you are correct in saying
that the bundles are very similar to those before the Court on
24th May.  All subsequent party and party correspondence has been
added, as have further pleadings, Summonses and Orders, with the
exception of the Club's response to the List of Issues, which was
delivered to this office late on Friday evening.

Whilst noting your comment that our List of Documents is out of
time, we must refer you to previous correspondence about the matter,
particularly in relation to the remarks of Mr. Justice Steyn at the
hearing on 6th March.  In our subsequent discussions, we made clear
that we had produced to the inquiry all documents which were of any
real relevance to the issues.

We confirm the point raised in the final paragraph on the first
page of your letter of 20th July.




                                                                                                                      /... contd

 So far as photographs are concerned, we are ourselves reviewing
 these with a view to determining what further photographs besides
 the composites already prepared might be of value to the Court.   We
 are not, therefore, willing to release them from the office for the
 time being.

 We can, of course, make the photographs available for inspection at
 this office and we would also remind you that all of the negatives
 of these photographs are in the hands of the West Midlands Police,
 who we have found to be co-operative in providing copies of items
 in their possession, subject to payment of reasonable costs.  We
 would expect you to be able to obtain a full set of prints from
 that source.


 Yours faithfully,

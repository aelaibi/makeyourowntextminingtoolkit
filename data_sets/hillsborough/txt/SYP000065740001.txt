a n d we      stayed there          for an hour or so.                 We were       given some       tea and

w ere    told to s t a n d b y our             vehicles       and keep w a r m .       It was       probably

about      1730 by then.

We a l 1 volunteered.                My    colleagu^/and             I then went       to Long ley S t a t i o n

to Long ley and             I drc vty on the           trip to N o r t h e r n General,

We were        delayed at f rthern General,                          We had    loaded        up w i t h three

b odies       but were       kept    there       because       there was a man who

was     looking       for    his    s o n ’s body.        The     staff w o u l d     not    let    him see    the

bodies        because       of the       state     that they were            in but    he gave a

description           of his       s o n ’s clothing and we                checked the       bodies w h i c h we

had and the other              bodies were             checked and          it was    esuablished       that

none     of those       bodies       were       that    of his       son.     We were       probably dela y e d

about      an hour wnilst            this       took    place.        We    then went       back    to the    ground

to the        gym.    M e a g a i n reversed in between the terraced houses and took

the     three     oodies      into       the    gym n a s i u m and    laid them down.              It was

g ett i n g    dark    by now and          it was       probably about 2000.



12.      We were       told to go to the                car    park at the       rear of the gym by an

ambulance         officer and we did this and                        parked up for a while.              We were

•13.    A little        before H 100 we were all                     told to get       into    one    vehicle     <a

             crews        to stay behind.             We all     v o l un t e e r e d    but                and   1 were      told

             that      we were       not    needed and we were              i n s t r u c t e d to   rturn to Bentley.

             W e 'left H i l l s b o r o u g h just after 2 1 0 0 and got to                                 at 2200.         We

             w er e    still       having     some    problems w ith our                radio and,    therefore,         asked

             Mi* E a s o n    to    let Control          know that we were               returning to base.          When we

             got      back    to B e n t l e y                  railed Control             on the     land line.         We   then

             had      some    tea,    cleaned up the vehicle and went                           off duty.



             14,       We    did not       have any d i f f i c u l t i e s     using      channel    4 on the      radio but

             I knew that his f r e qu e n c y w o u l d not go strai g h t into the                           incident        room

             and      it was       better     that    our    instructions           came       from the   person at

             control         who was       in charge        in the       incident        room.

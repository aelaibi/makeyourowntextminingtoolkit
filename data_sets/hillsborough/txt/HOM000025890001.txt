                                   W. JACKSON


      MR. GLASGOW:   I see. Well I won't press it. There
is a difference of understanding and it will serve no useful
purpose for me to press further, Mr. Jackson, but against
the background of that may we just look at the general
question of liaison.
      Despite what may be put to you by others, is it within
your knowledge that the liaison over the years between your
Senior Officer responsible for this ground and the Club
Officials had been extremely good? - A. Excellent.

And you know that however regretfully we have had to make
suggestions that things broke down badly on this occasion
and that the Club were not told things that perhaps they
ought to have been told.  I think you are aware of those
criticisms that have been made? - A. What criticisms were
those?
The criticisms that have been made on behalf of the Club
as to the failure to give warning about the opening of the
gates and that kind of thing? - A. Yes.

I simply wanted through you to make this plain: you may
also have been aware that I was asked to thank Chief
Superintendent Mole for the way in which he had co-operated
with the Club over the years.  I did not know then that you
were going to be called and I would also like it publicly
to be known that that expression of gratitude over the years
of co-operation went to the Force as a whole and was not
diminished by the fact that we had made criticisms of the
breakdown of what had happened on this one occasion and I
would like to make that clear through you as well as the
Senior Officer and to thank you? - A. Thank you sir.


             Cross-Examined by MR. WOODWARD:

Mr. Jackson, you have just been paid a compliment by
Mr. Glasgow. Throughout the years of your co-operation
had you at any stage indicated to the Club they should be
relieved of their obligations concerning stewarding? - A.
No sir.
Mr. Jackson, I want to ask you about the preparation of
a Plan and the preparation for a match such as this.

      We have heard evidence from Mr. Mole that intelligence
and experience are two valuable guides as to how to proceed.
You were asked this morning by Mr. Collins concerning some
intelligence from York. That was never in your possession?
- A. I don't recollect it sir.

I am not sure whether this also you would have found useful
to know about. Were you aware that Liverpool Football Club
had been playing an away match against Watford in February
1988, the 13th February 1988? - A. No, I can't recollect
that.
                                    W. JACKSON


You know nothing about tsfoat? - A. No, I don't sir.

Do you think you might have found it valuable and that the
Club;at Hillsborough might have found it valuable to know
that as a result of the experience of the Hertfordshire
Police it was observed, and I will quote from a letter
dated the 15th May 1989 written to the West Midlands Police:

      "The reports I attach are all self-explanatory
      and you may take the view there is no relevance,
      but at least you should be aware of the previous
      practice of people speculatively coming to venues
      of football matches from Liverpool which we have
      not experienced from other Clubs to such a degree
      and their expectation that one way or the other
      they will gain admittance to the ground."

A. Extremely valuable sir.

You had no inkling of that? - A. I had no knowledge of that
at all.
It would seem that according to the experience of the
Hertfordshire Constabulary on the occasion of that match
of the 13th February 1988 at Vicarage Road, Watford, in
the order of 1,500 fans  had turned up to an all ticketmatch
without tickets? - A. I did not know that.

And that on that occasion although because there was sufficient
room in fact to accommodate them to the stadium, they were
having been held in a group together allowed in. Did you
know that? - A. No, I didn't sir.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   For payment, as I recall.

      MR. WOODWARD:   For payment sir, yes.

Did you know also that previously to being allowed in for
payment they had attempted to enter the ground by forcing
the gates? - A. No, I did not know that either, sir.

Is there any system for general intelligence? - A. Yes, there
is a system at present in being.  Each Hforce has a Liaison
Officer and information is gathered. The way we do it is
we would contact the Liaison Officer for the Football Team
in question.  The information would be passed to us in
respect of the Club, the coaches and any problem areas and
we would collate that. This was done on this occasion by
Detective Sergeant Charlesworth.
There was no indication of this propensity or expectation
that this might occur? - A. No, there was nothing on the
intelligence to indicate that.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: I don't quite understand how
this comes about. The question which was put to you, was
                                           W. JACKSON


        there any central information about football teams,
        supporters, their likely behaviour and so on and I think
        you said yes and you have a Liaison Officer? - A. Yes,
        each Force ....

Q. There is a sort of bank of knowledge, previous experience,
   is that it? - A. Yes, there is.

Q. Where is that? - A. What happens is that each Force build
   up their own intelligence and of course when we contact
   that Force we get all the information back and they in
   turn will forward it to us, but at the present time we are
   looking to improve on that and produce a National Intelligence
   System.

Q. So you mean at the moment it is only on the basis of asking
   a specific Club for instant information, not going to a
   pool, central bank of information? - A. That is right, sir,
   but at the present time we are looking to improve that and
   have a national system.

Q. And in the case of a particular visiting team your Liaison
   Officer will do what, get in touch with the Police at their
   home area? - A. Yes, contact the Liaison Officer at their
   home area and they would have a bank of information which
   would be fed to us.

Q. On the other hand you would have expected, wouldn’t you,
   to take the Watford incident, that the Watford Police would
   have got in touch with the home team's Police about what
   had happened? - A. Yes.

Q. So even on that basis you might have expected to pick up
   this information? - A. Yes, we would have my Lord.

Q. But you didn't? - A. We didn't.

              LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Yes, I see.

q   .         MR. WOODWARD: Your information depends upon that
        which is gleaned from as it were the Home Police? - A. Yes,
        it does.
Q. Together with your own information and whatever else you can
   cull from other sources? - A. Yes.

Q. So in the instance of this game that would be an enquiry
   made of Merseyside, would it? - A. Yes.

Q. And of Nottinghamshire? - A. Yes.

Q. Together with whatever other useful enquiries you considered
   you might make? - A. Yes, that is correct.

Q. The 1988 experience and the policing of that event, had that
   thrown up any material which in any relevant respect caused
                                 61

                                             W. JACKSON


     you to consider the method that had been adopted as inadequate?
     - A. No sir.
Q. I think there was some modification concerning the policing
   of outlets of drink, alcohol and off licences and some
   greater attention given to that for 1989? - A. Yes, arrange­
   ments were made to see local licensees and have what they
   called a private door, in other words only customers that
   they knew as opposed to football supporters.

Q.             LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: You encouraged that? - A. No,
         what we did, my Lord, is our Police Liaison Officer went
         round all the local licensees and discouraged the sale of
         alcohol to football fans, in other words to have a private
         door for locals.
Q. Yes, that is what I mean.  So you encouraged them to have
   this private door? - A. Yes, I am sorry sir.

Q.             MR. WOODWARD: And were there deployments of men also
         to go round and check the off licences on the day? — A. That
         is correct.
Q. To keep an eye in that direction? - A. Yes.

Q. Of course the West terrace was exactly the same on the
   occasion in 1989 as it had been in 1988? — A. Yes sir.

Q. With the radial fences? - A. Yes sir.

Q. And the gates at the back? - A. Yes.

Q. Had anybody suggested to you that there was an expectation
   that there should be a Policeman at each gate at the back
   of the radial fence? - A. No sir.

Q. It has been suggested that there should be a Policeman or
   Policemen upon the terrace itself. Do you follow? - A. Yes.

Q. May we look at that a moment.  I am not sure whether it
   is being suggested there should be a Policeman there as
   a kind of thermostat to feel the pressure or the weight in
   a particular position or to keep a general view.     Is there
   a policing policy in relation to havoLftfc isolated men in
   crowds? - A. Yes, indeed.  In view of the problems on
   occasions with crowds it would be silly to put a Police
   Officer in on his own into a terrace and consequently the
   best method I would suggest of dealing with that is from
   the perimeter track or in a position where you could view
   the terrace.
Q.              LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   In the Stand? - A. In the Stand,
         sir.
 q   .         MR. WOODWARD:  In a vantage point but but not in
         amongst the crowd? - A. Not in amongst the crowd.  I think
         that would pose all sorts of difficulties.

                                      W. JACKSON


Q. You touch upon that I think in your Standing Order after
   Tab 11, Standing Instructions for the Policing of Football
   Matches, not in so many words but touch on it for example
   at page 18, paragraph 17 and page 25.

         "Advice will be given that Officers will not go
         alone into crowd disorder situations'.'"

   And on page 25 the middle of the page there there is a para­
   graph:
         "It occasionally occurs that an attempt is
         made to capture 1ends

   And that paragraph ends with:
         "Officers should never go into the crowd alone
         to deal with trouble."

   A. Yes sir.
Q. So if there were to be Officers in the terrace, I am not
   sure why it is suggested that Stewards should be in any
   particular difficulty, but if there were to be Officers in
   amongst the crowd ....
         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Well why not the same difficulty?

         MR. WOODWARD: The question must be faced, but sir
   the consequence may be that if the home stewards should not
   be amongst foreign supporters then the consequence would be
   that there would not be a single home steward at this match
   because there was no home team playing and that would seem
   to make a nonsense ....
         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: There may be a distinction
   between being, just as there is for the Police, as you
   suggest, between being in amongst a crowd and being in
   a vantage position in the Stand or outside the perimeter
   fence or in the concourse.
         MR. WOODWARD: Sir, if the suggestion is that there
   should be an alien amongst those who were may be unfriendly
   within the terrace, then sir that is to be met by these
   questions and answers.
Q. The question of policing any event, to what extend; does
   that depend upon consent and co-operation from the crowd?
   - A. A great deal.   I mean I think the object of the
   exercise of any operation, any good professional operation
   is to speak to the people concerned and get their support
   and help and everything goes well.

 Q. Is it sometimes found that the position of the steward is
    more acceptable to the crowd, to the strangers, than the
    position of a Policeman? - A. That really depends on the
                                  W. JACKSON


situation. For example where Sheffield Wednesday supporters
are known to our own Police Officers then perhaps it is
more acceptable for the Police Officer to get to know them,
to know who they are and to make sure how they behave. On
other ocasions it is more acceptable for a Steward to be
dealing with that situation.




                                /Q. The presence of the Police.

The pr es e nc e of the Pol ic e may, in p a rt ic u l a r
c i r cu ms ta nce s, produc e a n t a g o n i s m ? - A. That is right.       It
cou ld e x a c e r b a t e the situation.

It has been put to you by a s e r i e s of q u e s t i o n s that all
that is n e e d e d is, for example, a filtering.               Do you
follow?       In the past has there been any pr ac t i ce of
fi l te ri ng s u p p o r t e r s out as th e y have gone a l o n g Le pp in gs
Lane to en su r e that certa in in di vi du al s do not go in or
has that been a matter that has been left to individual
Of fi c e r s to ask, "Have you got a t i c k e t ?      Where do yo u
think you are g o i n g " ? - A. When you say " fi lt er in g out",
co m i n g to the g r o u n d or g o i n g aw a y from the g r o u n d ?

C o m i n g to the g r o u n d ? - A.   It has alw ay s been....

       LORD J U S T I C E TAYLOR: I think he means f i l t e r i n g in
and w e e d i n g out? - A. Yes, at all tic ke t ma t c h e s it has
alwa ys been a pr ac ti ce for Po l i c e Of fi c e r s to do that
wh er ev er possible.

         HR. WOODWARD:          Has that been done by way of ma k i n g
ho a r d i n g s acr os s the r o a d ? - A. No.

By m a k i n g a cordon acro ss the e n t r a n c e at L e p p i n g s L a n e ? -
A. No, c e r t a i n l y not. I think on this occasion, for
example, that wo ul d have been very, very difficult.

Where you may have b o i s t e r o u s or u n c o - o p e r a t i v e
individuals, how is that to be dealt with by individual
P o l i c e m e n ? - A. By strict and po si ti ve control over the
individ ua ls concerned.

And how is that, in terms of manpower, to be a c c o m p l i s h e d ?
- A. One of the thin gs that you have got to be careful
about in an op e r a t i o n like this - I mean, I do a p p r e c i a t e
we had just over 8 0 0 Police O f f i c e r s in and about
Hillsbo ro ug h, but you are very q u i c k l y d e n u d e d if you
start m a k i n g wh o l e s a l e a r r e s t s and, co ns eq ue nt ly , you have
got to be careful;             you have got to try an d deal with it
in other sorts of ways.

The gates that come acr os s the a p p r o a c h to the turnstile,
they form the first barri er - the first physical b ar ri er -
that the a p p r o a c h i n g s p e c t a t o r s find. Has it been the
pr ac ti ce to use those gates to e n d e a v o u r to control the
people g o i n g towar ds the t u r n s t i l e s ? - A. I am not re a l l y
familiar with it as to wh e t h e r they did or they did not,
but I s h o u l d think they w o u l d use those gates for that
purpose.

Have you seen the video c o n c e r n i n g the cro wd s o u t s i d e the
gat e? - A. Yes.

        Q.j' And are you aware that those gates were from time to time
             cl os e d ? - A. Yes, I am.       I am also aware that m o u n t e d
             P o l ic em en t r i ed to control those gates.

        Q.   And are you aware that those g at es                  were   forc ed o p en ? - A.
             Yes, I have been told that.

        Q.   Is there any way that that c o u l d have been anticipated,
             that the gates wo ul d be forced open ag ain st the Poli ce and
             that the m o u n t e d Police w o u l d be ignored? - A. No.

        Q.   And is there any way that that c o u l d be dealt with for the
             fu tur e? - A. That is an e x t r e m e l y d i f f i cu lt q u es ti on and I
             wo ul d hope that, in terms of the s t a d i u m itself and what
             has a c t ua ll y happened, we will come up with some
             answers.

        Q.   Do you find it easy to find any ans we r to that at the
             mo m e n t ?
        A.   I find it e x t r e m e l y difficult.

        Q.   This has been d e s c r i b e d as a funnel and, indeed, it is a
             funnel from the Lep pi ng s Lane approach, over the bridge
             and down Le pp i n g s Lane, but it is the pe ri me te r gate that
             forms the na r r ow e st p a rt ? - A. Yes.

        Q.   And r e a l l y after the pe r i m et er       gate there       is r e l i e f ? - A.
             Yes.

        Q.   Becau se the ar e a is wider, h a v i n g gone t h ro ug h the
             pe r i m e t er gate. They have been t h r o t t l e d down and now
             into a wider ar ea ? - A. Yes.

             In the past have people e n c o u n t e r i n g those gates and goi ng
             t h ro ug h them found any d i f f i c u l t y in o r d e r i n g t h e m se lv es
             to go to the t u r n s t i l e s ? - A. It has not been b r ou gh t to
             my attention.

             I am not sure what the ul ti m a t e r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s might be
             and one can speculate, but in the past, when O f f i c e r s were
             c h a r g e d with the task of e n s u r i n g queuing, what have they
             done?         How has that o b j e c t i v e been a c h i e v e d ? - A.
             Invari ab ly you have a number of O f f i c e r s c h e c k i n g the
             t u r n s t i l e s and m ou n t e d P o l i c e m e n e n s u r i n g that peo pl e form
             prop er queues.

        Q.   Did you have any rea so n to exp ec t that that w o ul d be
             u n l i k e l y to work on this o c c a s i o n ? - A. No re a s o n at all.

        Q.   Of course, one may say well, p l a i n l y x s h o u l d have been
             forese en and all you n e e d e d to have was an e x t r a Po l i c e m a n
             or two or a serial there, but if e v e r y b o d y c h oo se s to turn
             up at a p a r t i cu l a r time, is there any way that you can
             dev is e to cope with t h a t ? - A. In c i r c u m s t a n c e s like we

     had,   it uas,     in my view,       an u n p r e c e d e n t e d thing.

Q.             LOR D J U S T I C E TAYLOR:    Are y o u sa yi n g it was
     u n p o l i c e a b l e ? - A. I think in those c i r c u m s t a n c e s the
     Police were put into a very d i f f i c u l t position, my Lord.
     There were several o p ti on s that I m e n t i o n e d yesterday,
     once h a vi ng got into that situation, that yo u c ou ld
     con sider and all of those, I feel, were unaccep tab le, such
     as a gg re s s i v e use of the horses, c o n s i d e r a t i o n of the use
     of dogs, and we t a l k e d e ar lie r on about the p o s s i b l e use
     of cordons.              One of the thin gs in c o n s i d e r i n g that is, if
     you are t al k i n g about a m i n o r i t y of, say, 400 p e rs on s who
     are d e t e r m i n e d to get into the ground, then yo u are
     p r ob ab l y t al k i n g about a 2 to 1 ratio of Polic e Officers,
     so I wo ul d think you are t a lk i n g about a vast number of
     Police Off ic er s to control that situation.

Q.             HR. WOODWARD:         Yes, if there is a small number of
     determined, u n c o - o p e r a t i v e individuals, there is a
     br ea kd ow n be twe en order leading to di so r d er and an
     o v e r w h e l m i n g ? - A. That is correct.

Q.   Had anyon e at the Club, the FA or a n y b o d y s u g g e s t e d to you
     that the tu rn s t i l e s w ou ld not be able to cope with the
     ex p e c t e d t h r o u g h - p u t ? - A. No.

Q.   This bus in es s of 2 to 1 policing.                Are you able to assist
     the Inquiry as to how, if one is to cope with that
     foreseeability, the 400 or so unruly, u n c o - o p e r a t i v e
     individuals - how you wo ul d plan, in terms of Police
     disposition, for th at ? - A.Yes, I think you wo ul d have to
     thr ow out a tr em e n d o u s c o nt a i n m e n t ex er c i s e in terms of
     s t op pi ng and ch e c k i n g individuals.         It w o u l d be a mammo th
     task, in those circu mst anc es, to we ed out all the
     individuals concerned.

Q.   And is there any reas on why the a t t e n t i o n for that
     e v e n t u a l i t y s h o u l d on l y be focuse d on the Le p p i n g s Lane
     en tra nce or not? - A. It depend s on the inf or mat io n y ou
     have available.

Q. You beca me inv olved in the eve nt s of that day when you
   came down from the D i r e c t o r s ’ Box and you came down as a
   result of s o m e t h i n g you had s ee n? - A. Yes.

Q.   In   1988 there was a pitch           i n va si on? - A. Yes.

Q. There were individuals who c l i m b e d over the railings.
   Were you there when that h a p p e n e d ? - A. No, I was not
   there when that happened, but Hr. Hole m e n t i o n e d it to
   me.

Q.   And is it right that there was a focus upon the n e c e s s i t y
     to keep people off the p i t c h ? - A. Yes.

     Q. However, if any of your O f f i c e r s had been aware that
        s o me on e was in distress, w o u l d that Offic er have had the
        c a p a c i ty an d authority, if he w a n t e d to, to open the gate
        to deal with it? - A. Absolutely.              All of our O f f i c e rs are
        tr a i n e d to act individually.

     Q. Your p e r c e p t i o n was of what form of di so r d e r in 1989, when
        you saw what had h a p p e n e d b e h i n d the Live rp oo l g o a l ? - A.
        Well, I was not re a l l y sure.         You know, my first th ou gh ts
        were it was some sort of pitch invasion and what had
        c a u s e d it, I did not know.

     Q. You went down there to d i s c o v e r what had h a p p e n e d and
        there were other senior O f f i c e r s a b o u t ? - A. Yes.

     Q. The senior Officers, under Hr. Duckenfield, were they all
        r e s p e c t e d and senior, e x p e r i e n c e d O f f i c e r s ? - A. Th e y were
        h a n d - p i c k e d men.

     Q.   You saw them go in g about there, c o p i n g with what had
          h a p p e n e d ? - A. Yes, I spoke to Hr. G r e e n w o o d on the p itch
          and it was clear to me that all our Of fi c e r s were d o i n g as
          much as th e y p o s s i b l y c ou ld un de r the circumst an ce s.

     Q.   The s u g g e s t i o n is made that there were O f f i c e r s who held
          back and did not do a n y t h i n g when they might have been
          d o i n g something.       Do yo u f o ll ow ? - A. Yes.

     Q.   What do you say about t ha t?             - A. I think, be ca us e of the
          number of O f f i c e r s who were        at the scene and, of course,
          the n a r r o w n e s s of the gates      and the cir cu ms ta nc es , you are
          b ou nd to have some O f f i c e r s      not d o i n g anything.

     Q. Hr. Nesbi tt became involved. Hr. Greenwood, Hr. Ha rshall
        and others became involved in s o r t i n g it out? - A. Yes.

     Q.    Did those O f f i c e r s app ea r to you to be t a k i n g        cha rg e   in
          a p p r o p r i a t e a r e a s ? - A. Yes, th e y did.

          little the qu es t i o n of the b u i l d - u p at the t u r n s t i l e s ?

          both in 1988 and in 1989.       C o r r e c t ? - A. Yes.

     yes.

Q.   And that     is what had h a p p e n e d   in   1988? - A.    Yes.

Q.   And the plan in 1989 and, indeed, in 1988 w o r k e d                  on the
     a ss um p t i o n that there w o u l d be such a r e l a t i v e l y   ste ad y
     flow?       - A. Yes, and to try a nd enhanc e that, of                course,
     we had gone on the m e d i a to a d v i s e peo pl e to get            there
     early.

Q.   Yes.  Now, what h a p p e n e d this year, as I u n d e r s t a n d it,
     was that it was not an even, s t e a d y flow.      There was a
     sudden influx? - A. Yes.

Q.   Of course, that might have h a p p e n e d at any time after one
     o ’c lo c k ? - A. Yes.

Q.   In fact, it appea rs to have h a p p e n e d some time sh o r t l y
     after qu ar t e r - p a s t two and bu il t up to that press by
     h a l f -p as t two ? - A. Yes.

Q.   And once that press in the c o n c o u r s e ha d built up,              it
     never d i s p e r s e d ? - A. No, it d i d not.

Q.   And it seems that the Police, for one rea so n or another,
     lost control at that a r e a ? - A. Yes, I am not sure e x a c t l y
     what happened, but there was s u f f i c i e n t m a n p o w e r to deal
     with it.

Q. T he re sh ou l d have been s u f f i c i e n t man po we r to deal        with
   it? - A. Yes.

Q.   But, for some reason, it was not dealt with                      is that
     ri g h t ? - A. That w ou ld app ea r so.

Q.hSo it w ou ld appear, w o u l d it, that, again for wh at e v e r
   reason, the Police ou ts id e Le p p i n g s Lane e f f e c t i v e l y lost
   control of the si tu ati on once that crowd in the co n c o u r s e
   was a l l o w e d to build up and was not d i s s i p a t e d ? - A. I
   think this was becaus e of the big bu i l d - u p and the
   d e t e r m i n a t i o n of peo pl e to come through the blue gates.

Q. Yo u may be right, you may be wrong. . I do not know.                        We
   will have to hear evidence, of course, ab ou t that, but the
   fact is that, once that c r o w d ha d built up in the
   concourse, it w ou ld se e m that the si t ua ti on was lost so
   far as the Police were c o n c e r n e d ? - A. The Po li c e were
   then into a di f f i c u lt situation, which p r o b a b l y c ou ld have
   been c o n t r o l l e d with a g g r e s s i v e tactics, w hi ch w o u l d not
   r e a l l y have been a c c e p t a b l e b e c a u s e it may have
   e x a c e r b a t e d the si t u a t i o n even further.

Q.   But the plan seems not to have c o n t e m p l a t e d the
     p o s s i b i l i t y that there w o u l d be, as it were, an uneven

     that, we had so m e t h i n g like 40 Police horses on duty, a
     lot of m an po we r to deal with that situation, s h o u l d it

Q. Is this the position then, that once that build up had
   occurred someone should have appreciated what had happened and
   should have policed outside in Leppings Lane to ensure that
   people coming behind did not add to the problems? - A. Can i
   say in hindsight it may be that more Police Officers, more
   horses, should have been there, but given the situation as it
   arose in any event you had Police horses and I have said,
   looking at the video, outside the blue gates trying to
   control it.  I would hope in normal circumstances that people

    I
   would respond to situations and would not try and force the
   issue, and accept that the Police officers were there for the
   purpose of safety and control of everybody concerned.
   Consequently, they should not try and force, as I understand
   it, force the gates, go into that area and cause problems.
   That was not expected.

Q   No, but if there had been a quick appreciation by someone of
    the build up inside that concourse then steps could have been
    taken to have policed matters so that more people did not
    come and press into that until it had been cleared? - A. I
    know it is very hypothetical, but given the numbers I think
    the Police were in extreme difficulty whichever way it went.

Q. What I am getting at is this, if anyone had foreseen the
   possibility of a build up in the concourse at any stage,
   because it could have happened at any stage given enough
   people coming at once, if that had been foreseen it could have
   been catered for in the planning, could not it? - A. I think
   in terms of the actual, if you are talking about the planning,
   there were sufficient Officers there.  We had 800 Officers at
   Hillsborough.

Q. Precisely.  That is exactly the point I am making.  You had
   sufficient Officers to deal with that situation if it arose.
   Simply, no-one expected it to arise? - A. I think that is
   right.

Q. No-one anticipated the possibility there might be a build up
   in that concourse, and therefore the plan and the briefing
   included nothing to direct Officers what they should do if
   that build up occurred? - A. I think the plan itself is
   flexible if you have the resources and you anticipate there is
   a problem.

Q. If you anticipate? - A. Yes.   You can deploy the resources to
   it.

Q. Exactly, but you did not anticipate the problem.   Is that the
   key to it? - A. That will be the key.

Q. If you had anticipated that as a problem you could have
   devised a plan which could have catered for it? - A. I am not
   sure whether it would it would have catered for it given the
   circumstances, bearing in mind as I have said again, as I
   understand it looking at the video, I am sure the mounted
   Officers will tell you they had real problems there trying to
   control the crowd.

Q. I follow that, as the situation developed, but what I am
   suggesting is that it should have been nipped in the bud and
   should never have been allowed to develop to the extent that
   the Officers got themselves into that sort of difficulty, and
   it need not have been allowed to develop to that state had it
   been anticipated and had measures been taken in time? - A. I
   feel that really is hypothetical, and I am not sure whether
   that could have been done.

Q. Because it could not have been done then you can never have a
   full house at Hillsborough because unless everyone comes
   steadily you ar« always going to run this risk, are you not? -
   A. I can only say this, that the Officers have been policing
   Hillsborough for years, and we have not had a problem of that
   magnitude.

Q. Have you ever had a problem as far as you are aware of a build
   up in the concourse? - A. Not to my knowledge.

Q. The other thing you were asked about by Mr. Woodward was the
   question of the Hertfordshire incident, Watford. - A. Yes.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Before you go on:

Q.    I would like to clarify, you really have been saying what may
     be two different things, although they may be capable ofbeing
     reconciled, if I can just understand it. At various times
     during your evidence you have said in answer to me this
     morning when we looked at that photograph of the queue coming
     down the road, ”We could have controlled a large late arrival
     by a queue on the pavement of Leppings Lane and by filtering
     people through” . - A . Yes. I have given that some thought
     this afternoon because it was something you did ask, and there
     are two lips coming down there, and it would cause problems if
     they all wanted to get to the same turnstile.

Q.   You mean across the bridge as well? - A. Yes, across the
     bridge, coming in both directions.  So there would be a
     problem there in them being on the footpath and trying to get
     to the same. As they converge, which end of the queue do they
     go to? I foresee some sort of problem there.   As they come
     into the V, into the funnel there, and you get one reaching
     their turnstile and the other coming into their turnstile, do
     they go into that one or do they go to the end of the queue at
     the other footpath? I think we may have a problem there.

Q. Principally it seems people coming down leppings Lane, as I
   understand it, that we have heard about from the roundabout
   way. Still, I follow that. You said that this morning,
   qualified by what you have just now said.  Then a few minutes
   ago you said to Mr. Collins that there should have been
   sufficient manpower to deal with the situation that was
   building up.  ”We had a lot of manpower to deal with the
   uneven arrival of people” . Have I understood what you are
   saying correctly, that if the manpower had been deployed
   before the area immediately outside the turnstiles had become
S’
                                 72


                                                      W. JACKSON


          compacted, you could have coped with it, but once they had
          been allowed to fill that area it was then you reckon you
          would have needed either strong arm measures or 200 Policemen
          or whatever.  Is that right? - A. I think providing, my Lord,
          again, having taken that ground that the crowd were prepared
          to behave themselves, because they could come into the ground
          other ways. As I looked at the video, they were climbing over
          the top, etc., into the concourse.  So provided the crowd were
          behaving themselves and we could control it, yes.

     Q. I am sorry, ”Yes what? - A. We may have controlled the crowd
        at that stage, providing they were in a position they were
        behaving themselves and they were not trying to storm into the
        ground in other ways.

     Q. What stage are you saying you would have needed a two to one
        Police presence? - A. I think if you have got say 400 or 500
        people misbehaving then trying to control those is extremely
        difficult.  I think that is the only point I was trying to
        make, and to control them I think you need a lot of Police
        manpower to do that, to control all of them, because they can
        go off in all sorts of directions.

     Q.        MR. COLLINS:   Just to follow that on slightly, would you
          accept once you have a build up as we know it makes it more
          difficult for people to get in because it creates a barrier as
          well, and we have heard evidence of people taking 20 minutes
          or so to get through? - A. Yes.

     Q. That you would understand? - A. Yes.

     Q. Would you accept this, the nearer you get to kick-off time the
        more likely it is people are going to push and try to get in?
        - A. Yes, I think that is a possibility.

     Q. It is like trying to catch a train, anything like that, you
        want to be there on time? - A . Yes.

     Q.   And if you are being barred you try - it is human nature, is
          not it - try and get in if you can? - A. It possibly is, yes.

     Q. It may be rather foolish human nature but it is something
        which as a Police Officer you would anticipate at least in the
        case of some of those arriving? - A. Yes, but I would hope if
        Police Officers are trying to control it, give advice, etc.,
        people would respond accordingly.

     Q. With great respect, Mr. Jackson, you and other Officers keep
        on saying that you would hope something, but surely your
        experience as Police Officers tells you that that sort of hope
        is not always fulfilled? - A. Perhaps so.

     Q.   Is not that right? - A. Can I say on this occasion -   I know I
          keep saying it - was an unusual occasion.

     Q. I follow that, but are you really saying this was so
        exceptional, the circumstances and the behaviour of the fans
4.

                                                       W. JACKSON


          was so exceptional, so out of the ordinary, that no
          reasonable Police Officer could possibly have
          anticipated it? - A. What I would say in relation
          to that is that in hindsight we may have recognised
          there was a problem of that nature.

     Q. You c a n ’t really go so far as to say it was so exceptional and
        so unusual you could not reasonably have anticipated it, can
        you, because people arriving in fairly large numbers at the
        latter stages before kick-off and wanting to get in at kick-
        off is not something particularly unusual, is it? - A. I can
        only say we had experienced Police Officers who obviously did
        not anticipate that.

     Q. I follow that, but one gets lulled, does one not, into a false
        sense of security.  If things go right you don't anticipate
        that they will go wrong? - A. I would hope that the senior
        Police Officers I am talking about would not be lulled into a
        false sense of security.

     Q . So would I .

               LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Well, there it is.   We have been
          over this ground,

     Q.          HR. COLLINS:   Can I just deal with this Watford matter.
          M r . Woodward put this to you and he gave you details, and you
          said is really something you would liked to have known? - A.
          Yes.

     Q. I am just wondering why you didn’t because I am sure Mr.
        Woodward would accept from me the report was sent by
        Hertfordshire to Merseyside, as you would expect.  It was
        available, unless there was a breakdown of communications
        between you and Merseyside, if you had made enquiries at
        Merseyside? - A. I can only say on the intelligence package
        that we were given that information was no on it.

     Q. Did you ask or was the mind of the South Yorkshire Police
        applied to the possible problem of Liverpool supporters
        arriving without tickets? - A. We would always consider that.

     Q. You didn’t think what you had done would stop them coming?
        No doubt you hoped it. - A. Yes, we would hope that.

     Q. But did you anticipate it would have the effect, or was it
        mere hope? - A. No, I think you can always anticipate a number
        of people will come without tickets.

     Q. You told Mr. Woodward that in weeding out people coming to the
        match you always had a practice to ask people whether they had
        tickets whenever that was possible? - A. Yes.

     Q. What is the purpose of that? - A. To make sure people had
        tickets and we didn’t have people without tickets coming and
        causing congestion.

                                                 W. JACKSON


Q. Precisely.   What would you expect the Officer to say to those
   who had not got tickets? - A. Well, I would expect the Officer
   to say that they should not — it is a difficult one that,
   because if you look at the civil liberties side in terms of
   free passage, etc., the Officer is in a difficult position,
   but he would tell the person that he should not go to the
   ground.

Q. Of course, if you believe that obstruction or an offence might
   be created if they did you would have every reason to stop
   them, would not you? - A. Yes, if there was an offence of
   obstruction you would, y e s .

Q. If they got there that they would obstruct? - A. Yes.

Q. You had experience in the miners' strike of stopping people
   going to cause potential trouble, had not you? - A. Yes.

Q. And the same would apply with these people? - A. Yes.  I think
   the object of the exercise here in policing a football match
   is to try and deter people coming who have not got tickets
   than to use up your manpower to make arrests.

Q. Thank you.    I have no more questions.

        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Thank you very much.

                SUPERINTENDENT ROGER MARSHALL Called

                      Examined by MR. COLLINS:

Q. Superintendent Marshall, Roger Marshall, is that right? - A.
   That is right.

Q. Mr. Marshall, what is your precise position at the moment? -
   A. I am the Deputy Divisional Commander of F Division.

Q. I think you have 27 years’ experience as a Police Officer? -
   A. That is right.

Q. Very, very briefly, can you give us your Police history, and
   in particular your connection with Hillsborough or policing of
   other football matches and crowds generally? - A. Yes, I
   joined the West Riding Police as a Cadet in 1960, and became a
   Constable in 1962.  I was posted as Sergeant to Stocksbridge
   in 1968 and then to Barnsley in 1973.  I became the Inspector
   in charge of Police Cadet training in 1974, and then in 1977 I
   went to Hammerton Road Police station.  That was my first
   experience of policing Sheffield Wednesday’s football ground.

Q. What rank were you at that stage? - A. I was an Inspector.    I
   remained at Hammerton Road until 1980, and I then went to
   Barnsley as Chief Inspector.  Then I got used to policing
   Barnsley’s football ground for a relatively short period.
   Then I moved on to to Headquarters to the Research and
   Planning office, and from there in 1982 I went to Her
   Majesty’s Inspector of Constabulary’s office at Lincoln where
t.
                                  75
                                                     R . MARSHALL




          I served as Junior Staff Officer.  I was promoted in post in
          1983 to the rank of Superintendent, and I returned to the
          South Yorkshire Police in 1984 and was put in charge of the
          city centre sub-Division here in Sheffield.  I remained in
          that post for three years until I took up my present post in
          1987.

               During the period I was in charge of the city centre sub-
          Division I policed all the marches which occurred in the city
          centre, and I was also primarily responsible for policing
          Sheffield United’s football ground at Bramall Lane.

     Q. How does that compare as a ground with Hillsborough? - A. The
        facilities are broadly the same.   They are both very, very
        good grounds.  If anything Sheffield Wednesday probably has
        the edge because in terms of capacity it is a bigger ground.
        Sheffield United has a very nice modern new stand but it has
        relatively old terracing.  The North Stand at Sheffield
        United’s ground is a good quality stand.   The John Street
        stand is not a good quality stand.   That is the main fire risk
        in the United ground there, but Wednesday’s ground is very
        good indeed.

     Q. United, does it have perimeter fences    or did it during the
        time you were concerned? - A. Yes, it    has a perimeter fence on
        the John Street stand, and there is a    perimeter fence on the
        Kop and on the North Stand.  There is    not a perimeter fence on
        the West Stand.

     Q. Does it have similar penning to Hillsborough or not? - A. Yes,
        there are pens in John Street.  There are no pens on the Kop.
        There are no pens either on the north terrace.
     Q. Do you have access problems such as at Leppings Lane? - A. The
        access through the perimeter fence is exactly the same.

     Q. No, I am sorry, access to the ground? Are there any
        comparisons to Leppings Lane or not? - A. Yes, if anything the
        ground in terms of its segregation policy at United is built
        the wrong way round, because it is necessary to bring visiting
        fans up through the streets surrounding the ground and
        actually bring them either along Bramall Lane or in through
        John Street, and that causes difficulties because the home
        fans are usually making their way into their part of the
        ground, and there is sometimes a cross flow.

     Q. So you are used to all the problems that are or that exist at
        Hillsborough, and have been used to them with your experience
        both at Hillsborough and at Bramall Lane? - A. Yes.

     Q. In 1987 you come to F Division.  Did that include the Semi-
        Final that was held at Hillsborough in 1987 or did you come
        after that? - A. No, I came after that.

     Q.   You were concerned with the 1988 Semi-Final? - A.   I was.

     Q.   And your role in   that was, I think, the Commander in the
                       76
                                            R. MARSHALL




ground? - A. That is right.

Which was in fact the role that Mr. Greenwood fulfilled in
1989, you having swapped places with him between 1988 and
1989? - A. Yes.

                                            R. MARSHALL


Q. Can I take it very quickly and very broadly.  You deal
   with the individual Serials on the first three pages? -
   A. Yes.

Q.   And those of course will   be related to theminiaturised
     notes. Right? - A. That    is right.

Q. Then you deal on page 4 with more detail, individual
   serials, pages 4 and 5? - A. Yes, broadly what each
   Serial would be doing at the First Phase and in some
   cases the Second and Third Phases.

Q. On page 6 you deal with the segregation fans and say that
   Liverpool will be going to the Leppings Lane turnstiles?
   - A. That is right.

Q.   Then you deal with the colour coding of the     tickets? - A.
     Yes.

Q. Then on page 7 you say:

           "Get lads out minimum of delay."

     A. That is right. That simply means to take the ground as
     quickly as possible.

Q. Then you deal with what is to happen if people are arrested
   fee crime. You then deal with the escorting of the Liverpool
   trains? - A. Yes sir, at that stage it was thought that
   there would be three trains but in the event only one train
   came and that enabled me to make a better use of one of the
   Serials who was charged with remaining in the vicinity of
   Wadsley Bridge Station.

Q. Then you deal with the coaches.        You say this:

           "Don't allow anyone to get off until

           (a) They have been spoken to - searched - check tickets.

           (b) So they'll know where to get back on their bus.

           Drunks can go backi       Individuals arrested."

     That presumably means if people are drunk you arrest them?
     - A. If you have a bus full of drunken people then the best
     way of dealing with that is to escort that bus back to the
     motorway and send it back from whence it came.

Q. Then you say:
           "Look out for the sticker which will show
           coach has been searched."

     The idea was, was it, that the Officers who then searched
     the coach should put a sticker on it to indicate this coach
                                          R. MARSHALL



      has been dealt with? - A. No, that only applied to the
      search Serials at Tankersley and Oughterbridge. Clearly
      if the coach had been searched once then it was a waste
      of manpower to search it again, so we had a system of
      labels stuck on the windscreen of coaches to indicate
      those who had been searched at Tankersley and Oughterbridge.

q   . I think some fans have given evidence that coaches on which
      they arrived were not searched and that would be a break­
      down or contrary to your instructions? - A. Yes, it would
      have been but having said that if they came on a mini coach ..

Q. No, I am talking about coaches rather than mini coaches?
   - A. It would have been a break down. One can set out
   with the best intentions in the world of searching every
   coach but if the coach chooses to park in an area which
   is not a designated coach park then it won't be searched.

Q. And then with the: transit vans you express really the
   same sentiments although obviously only if possible. That
   is over on page 8? - A. That is right.

Q.     Because that      depends on them going to theright   place? -
      A. Yes.
Q.     Then you say     where the private cars should go. After the
      game coaches and transits should not move until the ground
      control say so. You then deal with buses.   Then what should
      not go into the ground.   "No banner poles, big flags,
      big inflatables, no cameras." - A. That is right.

Q. Then what to do if you did seize. You draw attention to the
   law on drink and then general points "Hfijh vis presence .
   What does that mean? - A. That simply means that I want
   Police Officers standing on the front, on the edge of the
   kerb in pairs working speaking to people; doing what they
   are supposed to be dding; looking after the local residents;
   looking after shopkeepers; seeing that the law is maintained
   and doing the job for which they are paid.

Q. "Deploy troops in pairs" i.e. Officers should not go on
   their own but should go in twos.  Is that right? ~ A. Yes.

Q.      "Be on the ground"? - A. Yes, there all the time.

    Q. You don’t mean on the football ground? - A. No, the ground
       being our sector.
    Q. This should be fairly high profile policing.  Is that the
       right idea? - A. I would not have chosen a better word.

    Q. Then you go on:

             "Problems with
             Indiscriminate parking
                                    R.MARSHALL

      Thefts from cars
      Pick pockets"

Which are obvious things for the Police to look out for.

      "Impress that officers must deal with jobs."

What is that? - A. Well from time to time when we have Officers
from other Divisions attending at Sheffield Wednesday's
Football Ground, there has been reluctance on their part to
become involved with complaints from local residents. That
is something which we strongly deprecate and we encourage
them that they are Police Officers and if someone reports
something to them they get on and deal with it rather than
say: "I am from a different Division" or make an excuse.

Then over the last page:

      "Account for your serials
      Prisoners
      Paperwork
      Firm but fair"

A. That is right.
I am grateful, Mr. Marshall.  I think that makes it *ery
clear what you were telling your, that is the Chief Inspectors
and Inspectors under your command who received that briefing.
Is that correct? - A. That is right.

And you would expect the Inspectors would pass that on in
essence to the Sergeants and the Serials under their command?
- A. Yes, the briefings are also complemented by a tour of
the area because some of the chaps working f©£ -me came from
the Doncaster Division and Headquarters 'C' Division, so
I asked them if they wanted to see the area. They did and
so we got a transit van and I took them around the sector
and indicated the sort of problems that we might reasonably
expect; where the coach parking area was; where the mini bus
parking area was to be; where the anticipated flashpoint
might be at the roundabout at Leppings Lane.

      KBDJUSTICE TAYLOR:  I noticed that. What does that
mean. That is where fans might meet, is it? - A. That would
be a point after the game, my Lord, where if there was any
likelihood of there being serious disorder that would be
the location where it would take place because that was the
point at which the Nottingham Forest fans and Liverpool fans
might meet and to that end we arranged for abteut five Serials,
that is at Phase 3, a very strong Police presence to dis­
courage that from happening.
      MR. COLLINS:     Now on the Saturday morning following
                                   R. MARSHALL


the general briefing I think you spoke to your Chief
Inspectors again? - A. Yes, I did.

That is Chief Inspector Waring and Chief Inspector Purdy
and did you - and I am taking this from your statement -
reaffirm what you considered to be the salient points of
the duty, that is searching, coach reception and general
standards of behaviour? - A. That is right.

And did you indicate your intention which to patrol on foot
throughout the sector until kick-off? - A. Yes.

And youwould end up, as I understand what you have told us,
you always intended to end up at the Leppings Lane turnstiles?
- A. Yes.
And you intended to get there at about quarter-past-2? - A.
Yes.
You were not, as I understand it apart from not being directly
responsible for the Officers on duty outside the turnstiles,
you were also not directly responsible for the mounted
Officers? - A. Yes, I had some mounted Officers working for
me. I had six at Wadsley Bridge Station; six at the turn­
stiles and four in Halifax Road.

Were they under your command? - A. They are under the command
of their own Inspector, in fact, Mr. Hands-Davis who was
nominally in charge of the mounted Officers, but to an
extent if I asked the mounted Officers to do something for
me they would do it.
Did you liaise with Inspector Hands-Davis beforehand in order
to work out with him what use you would, or to what use you
would put the mounted Officers? - A. No.

It was a case, was it, if the need arose you could contact
him? - A. Well I have worked very close with Paul Hands-Davis
over many years on football matches, crowd control, and
he would not need me to tell him what to do.in a situation.
He would know instinctively what to do.

What did you understand, what did you believe the mounted
Officers in your sector would be doing assuming you gave them
no instructions? - A. The Officers in HStlifax R&ad would have
the job of stationing themselves on the route from the
station, Wadsley Bridge Station down to the ground. The
chaps up at the Station would have the job of meeting the
train when it arrived and forming the fans into a crocodile
and then escorting the fans down to the ground. The mounted
Officers at the Leppings Lane turnstiles would have the job
of maintaining the queues and doing a generally high profile
role, the one that they are used to.

Did you anticipate that there would be mounted Officers in
Leppings Lane itself at or before the perimeter gates to
the ground?- A. Yes,they are usually there onunatch days.
                                   R. MARSHALL


Controlling the crowds coming down towards the ground? ~ A.
Yes, what we try to do is to get people that come from the
Station to queue on the right-hand side of Leppings Lane,
outside the sweet shop which I think appears on the photo­
 graphs and queue along there until they actually get into
the turnstile area.
So the idea of controlling by queueing in Leppings Lane is
one which you understood was long standing? - A. Yes, you
appreciate that some teams in the lowly reaches of the
First Division don't bring too big a crowd and so queueing
does not present a problem, but when you get the likes of
Man. Utd. ....
You knew you were getting a full house? - A. I knew there
would be a queue.

And therefore you knew that there would be a need for
arranging queueing even before, or likely to be a need
for arranging queueing even before you reached the perimeter
gates? - A. Oh yes.
You I think began your own foot patrolling about quarter-
to-11 in the morning.  Is that correct? - A. That is right.

You walked around to see that all was going well, around
your area.  I don't think we need take this in any detail,
but were you aware in the course of the morning and let's
take it now from what 10.45 up until about 1 o'clock as
the general period, that there were obviously a large number
of fans in the area. Would that be fair? - A. Yes.

What about drinking. Were you aware of drinking? - A. Yes,
there was a lot of drinking going on.  I walked down as
far as the precinct in Hillsborough because I made it in
my mind to call at the off-licence in the precinct because
there had been a robbery there committed by Liverpool fans
last year and I went and spoke to the two ladies who ran
that. Outside there was a youth drinking from a can of
strong lager with another three cans of strong lager in his
possession.  I spoke to him and told him if he drank all that
lager he might have a job getting into the ground, but that
was fairly general.  I was being approached all the time by
young fans wanting to know the location of pubs that were
open and it was very much a carnival atmosphere. Despite
the drinking the fans were reasonably well behaved at that
stage, but the drinking was continuing all over the area.

Can I put to you the summary which I think appears at page 10
of your statement and I hope I am right, it covers about
the   sort of time I have been talking about, where you
summarise thus:

i     "This time there was no trouble and despite
      what seemed to me to be far too much drinking
      going on the fans were well behaved."
                                   R.MARSHALL


Is that a fair picture up to what sort of time? - A. I did
not foresee a problem up to about half-past-2. Half-past-2,
in fact if you look at the photographs you see I think what
appears to be remnants of the train Serial; the crocodile
coming down into the ground.

Sorry, can I ask you to identify which photograph you are
referring to. Is this Composite Album 1 that we have been
talking about? - A. Yes, in fact if you look at MWL 10/13A
you see the mounted Officers.

That is at 7-minutes-past-2 the actual time? - A. Yes.

That is taken sorry where.   Is that in Leppings Lane? -
A. Yes.
YDu say that looks to you like the train? - A. It 4ooks to
me to be the end of the special train. Yes, there are people
coming along there.
You had arrived, as I understand it, in Leppings Lane itself
at about quarter-past-2? - A. Yes.

What was the state of affairs when you arrived in Leppings
Lane? - A. The area was becoming increasingly congested.
Fans were moving about in both directions.  Some were coming
to look at the area of the turnstiles but were not going
into the ground, they were moving away and the area was as
I would have expected it to be, busy with people, thronged
with people.  It was a beautiful sunny day; lots of colour;
lots of movement; lots of shouting and singing; a carnival
atmosphere.
I think you were aware when you got to the ground, when you
got to Leppings Lane outside the ground, that there were
obviously quite a lot of fans who were there without tickets?
- A. Yes, I think I have covered this already.

You said, again I am looking at the bottom of page 13 of your
statement, you say:  "It seemed that many fans had come
without tickets to get in". This is your description when
you arrived at Leppings Lane? - A. Y^s.

Did you think that steps ought to be taken to see if you
could move on some of these who were obviously causing an
obstruction? - A. Yes, some of the mounted Officers were
actually doing that.
      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I think your pagination is
slightly out.
      MR. COLLINS:  I think what has happened is I am working
from his original statement.  I think what everyone else has
is that statement that has gone through the West Midlands
computer and I apologise.
                                   R. MARSHALL


     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   We are on page 14.

      MR. COLLINS:  I am sorry. We are looking at the same
are we, Mr. Marshall? - A. We are.
      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Can you just in this pause tell
me, because you have mentioned the people coming without
tickets before and this was not a new experience to you. Did
you have the feeling on this day from the enquiries for spares
that there were more without tickets than usual or was it
just more or less as you would have expected? — A. No, it was
as I expected.
      MR. COLLINS: I think you had a discussion, did you not,
with Inspector Sykes about what you would do with the non­
ticket holders once the game started? — A. Yes, I think the
Operational Plan catered for these individuals to be taken
to an area called Coal Row which is just off Halifax Road.
It is some distance from the ground but it is not always
possible to achieve that. What happened in fact last year,
I did not sort of witness this myself, but I learnt that
last year they were placed in the area of the bridge at
Leppings Lane and someone produced a radio and of course they
were able to listen to the match on the radio and absorb some
of the atmosphere from within the ground, so they were not
a problem last year.
Did you anticipate that they would be any more of a problem
this year? - A. No sir.
At about this time, that is about quarter-past-2, any estimate
of the numbers that you were faced with in Leppings Lane and
approaching the ground and at the turnstiles? — A. It was
very congested, I would say probably between 6,000-8,000
people.
      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  Is that held up in the immediate
crush before the turnstiles or are you taking account of
your view right up Leppings Lane or what? - A. Yes, in both
directions.
All you could see? — A. Yes, up as far as Catchbar Lane,
very congested there and congested also down towards the
Leppings Lane roundabout.
      MR. COLLINS: So effectively everyone in your side who
was converging on the ground you estimated in the region
of 6,000-8,000? - A. Yes.
Did this appear to you to be more than you would have anti­
cipated at that time or about what you would have expected?
- A. No, I was not concerned in any way at that stage.

 So it was about what you would have expected at that time?
 - A. What I would have expected, yes.
                                  R. MARSHALL


At this stage did there appear to be any difficulty with
people getting into the turnstiles? - A. Not at all, no.
The turnstiles were moving quickly. People were entering
the ground, not a problem.




                              /Q. Was there a build up
                                                                  R. MARSHALL



Was there a b u i l d - u p at all, or a s i g n i f i c a n t build-up, of
people at the t ur ns ti le s themselv es, again at this st ag e ?
- A. Not at that stage.

And what about you?      Where were you p o s i t i o n i n g y o u r s e l f ?
- A. I was in the vi c i n i t y of the - not the t u r n s t i l e s
itself, but ou ts id e the p e r im et er gates, but m o s t l y in and
a r ou nd the bri dge and on the road and m o vi n g around.

At g r o u nd   level? - A. Yes.

Now, there came a time, I think, when you d e c i d e d that
Le pp in gs Lane ought to be c l os ed to tr a f f i c ? - A. Yes,
Inspector Sykes and I d i s c u s s e d the s i t ua ti on a nd I felt
that the s a f e t y of people a c t u a l l y s p i l l i n g off the
pa v e m e n ts n e c e s s i t a t e d c l o s i n g the roa d and that is
s o m e t h i n g that we do not n o r m a l l y do.           So I....

Does the use of the word "normally" sugge st that it is
s o m e t h i n g that has been done in the past or no t ? - A. I
have not done it personally.

Do you k n o w w h et he r   it has been d o n e ? - A.    I do not.

It c e r t a i n l y was not part of the op e r a t i o na l   order,   was
it? - A. It was not.

But I imagine it is alwa ys s o m e t h i n g that can be done if
c i r c u m s t a n c e s . . . . ? - A. It is a co nt ingency. It is one
which I w ou ld not enter into lightly b e cau se Le p p i n g s Lane
is one of the main t h o r o u g h f a r e s of the city and takes
people from the south part of the cit y to the north part
and, if one clos es L e p p i n gs Lane, there is quite an
ex te nsi ve detou r involved.

But this was done, as I u n d e r s t a n d what you have just told
us, be cau se you were a f r a i d that so ma n y fans w o u l d not be
able to ke e p to the pav em en t and o b v i o u s l y might get run
over or w h a t e v e r ? - A. That is right, yes.

And w oul d it have made it more ea s y to police th e m too if
there was not t r a f f i c b e ca us e p r e s u m a b l y Pol ic e Off ic er s
w oul d have been at risk from t r af fi c too? - A. T he re are
two sc ho ol s of though t there.         A m o v i n g ba rr ie r of
veh icl es is a very ef fe ct iv e means of c o n t a i n i n g peopl e on
a pavement.     I took the vi ew on that o cc as io n that, for
the s a fe ty of the individuals, it w o u l d be be t t e r to close
the road.

But if you su bs t i t u t e hor se s for vehicles, you have got a
simil ar sort of control, have not y o u ? - A. Well, yes, but
you wo uld nee d a lot of horses.

Anyway,    can you now hel p us as to what time that dec is io n

                                                                              R. MARSHALL



          was m ad e? - A. Well, I think it was at 2.25, but I
          un d e r s t a n d there is a log e n t r y which puts it ea r l i e r       than
          that.

     Q.   That is right.          We kn o w that there is an e n tr y in a l o g
          which says 2. 1 7 was when you made the r e q u e s t ? - A. My
          p e r ce p t i o n is that it was, in fact, later than that, but
          if the log has a t im ed e n t r y after that, I w o u l d have to
          say the log is pr o b a b l y correct.

     Q.   It is a manual log and it is, I think, S u p e r i n t e n d e n t
          M ur r a y who made the en tr y - I will be c o r r e c t e d if I am
          wr ong - so I suppo se he may have got it w r o n g ? - A. Well,
          in any event, the road was not c l o s e d d i r e c t l y b e c a u s e
          cars and v eh ic le s still c o n t i n u e d to come down the road
          until about ha lf -p as t two.

     Q.   We can see that from the p h o t o g r a p h s actually, I think,
          that we have, if I re me m b er correctly.            Yes, if we look at
          NWL 10, 20A, which is a c t u a l l y 2.25, I think, real time,
          we can see a bus go ing a lo ng the lane.             I think that is
          the last one we have sh ow i n g any traffic, but it does not
          mean that there was not tr aff ic go ing later than that.
          However, it took some minutes, did it, for your re qu es t to
          be c o m p l i e d wi th ? - A. Yes, I had to take some acti on
          myself on that becaus e I saw the SYT buses still m o vi ng
          and I went up to the traffi c lights at C a tc hb ar Lane and
          there was a young Co n s t a b l e the re with three dou bl e decker
          buses which he had hel d up a nd he a sk ed me what he was to
          do with the buses and I said let the buses go, but I then
          ra d i o e d g r o u n d control and a s k e d them to get th r o u g h to
          South Y o r k sh ir e T r a n sp or t and tell Bert Middleton, who is
          their Tr a f f i c Manager.

     Q.   Did you get any a c k n o w l e d g e m e n t of that r e q u e s t ? - A.   Yes.

     Q. You did?    So your initial re q u e st to close Le p p i n g s Lane
        was un ack now led ged , or was it a c k n o w l e d g e d ? - A. It was
        ack nowledged.

     Q.   It was a c k n o w l e d g e d ? - A.   Yes.

     Q.        LORD J U S T I C E TAYLOR:           The   first one wa s? - A.     The
          first request, yes.

     Q.        MR. COLLINS:      It was ac kn ow led ged , but it did not
          seem to be wo rk in g pr o p e r l y ? - A. That is right.

     Q.   Or, rather,       it did not seem to be c o m p l i e d w i t h ?    - A. That
          is right.

     Q.   I think I re co ll ec t some e v id en ce that a me ssa ge came back
          to you that you wou ld have to org an is e the end of Lep pi ng s
          Lane over the bridge becaus e the y were not able to co nta ct
                                                                    R. MARSHALL



the Of fic er there.       Do you r e m e m b e r t h a t ? - A.   I do not
re me mb er that, sir,     no.

But is that where you went, in fact? - A.                 Yes,     to a c t u a l l y
make sure the roa d was closed.

And that bus we saw in the p h ot o g r a p h        was c o m i n g from that
direction, was not it? - A. Yes.

So it may be that that is what c a u s e d you - or that was
one of the buses that had been hel d up p e r h a p s ? - A.
Possibly.

The time w ou ld be about right, if 2 . 1 7 is a c c u r a t e ? - A.
Yes, but it was my impression that it was about 2. 3 0 when
I went to the top of L ep pi ng s Lane and spoke to the
Constable.

In any event, hav in g dealt with that, your r e c o l l e c t i o n              is
that you got back to the immediate vi c i n i t y of the
tu rn s t i l e s w h e n ? - A. About 2.30.

What was the po si t i on by no w ? - A. Again there was ple nt y
of people about, as one w o ul d expect,             but I di d not
pe rc ei v e a p a r t i cu la r pr ob l e m at that stage.

Can we look ag ain at the photograph, which is p h o t o g r ap h
25A, which is a c t u a l l y e x a c t l y 2 . 3 0 ? - A. Yes, that is the
p ho to g ra ph of the queue o u t s i d e tu rn s t i l e s A to G.

W ou ld you de scr i be it as a queue, from what you recall and
from that photograph, at that t i m e ? -          A. Yes, I think if
you look at the p ho to gr ap h itself, there is a man in a red
anor ak at the front.      C l e a r l y he is wa it in g his turn to go
in.    There is a ch a p b e h i n d him with a y e l l o w ano ra k on.
Other fans are looking to war ds the t u r n st il es for some
movement.    There is a y o u n g s t e r just to the left of the
man in the middle of the pi c t u re with a smile on his
face.

By the time the next ph ot og r a p h is taken, which is ti med
on the p ho to g ra ph at 33, but we kn o w that is a minute fast
- 32 - we see a young lad c l i m b i n g up? - A.  That is
right.

And, in fact, in the next photograph,               he cl i mb s down
aga in ? - A. Yes.

Now, I think you can recall that yo un g ma n ? - A. Yes, I
can, sir.          That yo u n g s t e r c l i m b e d up on the pa ra pe t and
his pr es e nc e c a u s e d s o m e t h i n g of a lull, I think, in the
noise b ec au se people were looking in a n t i c i p a t i o n wh e th er
he wou ld make it to the top, but he got to the top an d he
e v i d e n t l y did not like what he saw on the o th er side and
                                                                     R. MARSHALL



there was an eno rm ou s cheer went up when he got to the top
and then he came back down and went into the cr owd again.

By the time that you ng lad went up and down, h o w w o u ld you
de sc ri be the state of a f f a i r s ? - A. More and more fans
were c o m i ng into the are a of the turnstiles, p a r t i c u l a r l y
A to G, at that stage and I myse lf went into the c r ow d and
people were st a r t i n g to push an d I a s k e d peo pl e not to
push.     In fact, if you have seen the video, you will have
seen me a c t u a l l y in the mid dl e of that crowd, t e ll i n g
people not to push, and some took not ic e of that adv ic e at
that stage, but not for long.

Of course, the d i f f i c u l t y was, as you have tol d us,              there
was a lot of noise g oi ng on.         Is that r i g h t ? - A.
Absolutely.

You ha d no means of incre as in g the vol um e of your voice.
You had no loudhailer or a n y t h i n g like tha t? - A. I did
not.

And, since you were in the crowd, your e f f e c t i v e n e s s must
have been limited becaus e you p r o b a b l y wo ul d on l y be he ard
by a very few peop le imm ed ia te ly a r o u n d you, wo ul d not
you? - A.    That is right, but there were m o u n t e d Of fi c e r s
also pr ese nt in the area and th ey were d oi ng their normal
job of tr yi n g to mai nt ai n qu eu e s and st op peop le shoving.

The problem, I suppose, was too that, un fo rtu nat ely , more
and more people of the 6 to 8 , 0 0 0 who were a p p r o a c h i n g
were co mi n g in be hi n d ? - A. That is right.

So one had a b u i l d - u p of peop le - a p r o g r e s s i v e b u i l d - u p
of people - in this area.         Is that r i g h t ? - A. Yes.

Were any steps be in g taken at this stage to control them
before they r e a c h e d the p e r i m e t e r gates so as to s t o p any
more people ge t t in g into the t u r n s t i l e ar ea ? - A. Yes,
some m o u n t e d O f f i c e r s were w o r k i n g on the p e r i p h e r y of
t h e ....

Did you give any        i n s t r u c t io ns ? - A.   No.

Did you feel it n e c e s s a r y for you to be in a p o s i t i o n to
give such ins tr uc ti on s? - A. The si t u a t i o n was b e i n g
c o n t r o l l e d by the mo u n t e d Of fi c e rs be c a u se that is their
job.        They were a s s i s t e d by the foot Officers, by
Inspector Sykes and S e r g e a n t Proct or and the O f f i c e r s who
were on the ex te r i o r of the p e r i m e t e r gates.           I mean,
there was a fai rl y s t r o n g Police p r e s e n c e r ig ht the
way..

It does not se e m to have been a very e f f e c t i v e Police
presence, in the light of what h a p p e n e d ? - A. Yes, I
                                                                       R. MARSHALL



agree.

Can you he l p the Inquiry as to why ;you think the Police
were not e f f e c t i v e to preven t the b u i l d - u p of the cro wd
that u n d o u b t e d l y then o c c u r r e d ? - A. There is, in »y view,
a very s tr o n g link be t w e en the drink which a lot of
individ ual s ha d consumed, the heat of the day, the u r g e n c y
which time imposed on that crowd....

Yo u mean as it got nearer kick-off, so th e y got more
a n x i o u s ? - A. Yes. An almo st b l i n d n e c e s s i t y to enter
that ground, come what may.

         LORD J U S T I C E TAYLOR:   "Blind" did you sa y ? - A. A
b li nd necessity.          Almost an u n r e a s o n i n g n e c e s s i t y to get
into the ground, come what may. an d the co mfo rt and the
welfar e of their own c ol le ag ue s and their own fans was
b ru s h e d aside.       I have never come acr os s a n y t h i n g like it
in my life, and as time went on, you were right in what
you said to Mr. Jackson, we lost our ab il i t y to manage
that situation.

          MR. COLLINS?          Are these ma t t e r s which are t o t a l l y
u n f o r e s e e a b l e in a football c r o w d t r y i n g to get in before
kick-off, do you t h i n k ? - A. No, as I m e n t i o n e d before,
the late arriva l is a common phenomenon.

Indeed? - A. But late arrival, laced by drink;                    late
arrival, I think, e n a b l i n g indi vid ual s who had not got
ti cke ts and had this a bs ol ut e d e t e r m i n a t i o n to get into
that football ground, come what may.                All those factors,                 I
felt were pr es en t that afternoon.

The large m a j o r i t y of those in that crush were tic ke t
holders, were not t he y? - A. I do not know.

C e r t a i n l y a lot of peo pl e who went in t h ro ug h the gate
when it was o p e n e d were cl e a r ly tick et ho ld er s be ca us e we
have evi de nc e of people whose ti ck et s were not c o l l e c t e d ?
- A. I guess a lot of tick et ho ld e r s went in th rou gh the
gates be cau se th ey were be ing c r u s h e d in front of the
turnstiles, but I dare say a lot of non tick et ho lde rs
also went into the g r ou nd eith er throug h the gates or went
over the parapets.

Yo u may well be right, Sup er in te nd en t, but, as a m a tt er of
evidence, you have no real reason, do you, to su ppo se that
the m a j o r i t y of those in that crush were not ticket
h ol d e r s ?  - A. I do not kn ow h ow many were non ti ck et s
ho lde rs and how many were tick et holders.

All I am p u t t i n g to you - and he l p me if you can - you
have no e vi de nc e that the ma j o r i t y were not ticket
h o l d e r s ? - A. I have no evidence, no.

    Q.    And from what you saw and heard, is not it the po si ti on
          that the likel ih oo d is that the m a j o r i t y were, indeed,
          ticke t holders, although, of course, there was a m i n o r i t y
          of non ticke t ho l d e r s ? - A. I can no t answer that question.
          I can not say how many of the peop le who were pr ese nt at
          that time were ticket ho ld e r s and how many were not.         I
          have my suspicion, if that is valid.

    Q.    You were there, you see, and your s u s p i c i o n . . . . ? - A. That
          at that stage there was a t r e m e n d o u s number of non ticket
          ho lde rs who had made it in their way to get into that
          football ground, come what may.

    Q.            LO R D J U S T I C E TAYLOR:      This is why I was as k i n g
          before wheth er your impress ion was that there were more
          than usual.           I thoug ht you sa i d no? - A. B a s e d on the
          people which I saw in the v i c i n i t y at that time, I guess
          there was an el e m en t of peop le who were non ticket
          holders, but I can not ac co un t for the ind ividuals who
          spent the sort of three or four hours in li ce ns ed pr em is es
          in a n d a r o u n d the d i s t r i c t and came to the g r o u n d very
          sh o r t l y bef or e kick-off.         I can no t a c co un t for h o w many
          non ticket ho l d e r s were p r e s e n t a m on gs t those groups.

    Q.          MR. COLLINS:           But, with respect, from what you said
          to L o r d J u s t i c e Taylor earlier, is not the p o s i t i o n that
          you are rat he r a s su mi ng that there were a lot of non
          tic ke t h o ld ers becaus e it suits your case so to a s s u m e ? -
          A. I have no wish whatsoever, Mr. Collins, to m i s l e a d this
          Inquiry.

    Ql     I am sure not? - A. B e ca us e what h a p p e n e d on that
     A     p a r t i c u l a r day is going to live with me a long, long time.
         1 My p e r c e p t i o n of that incident was that there were ve r y
         I many people who were d e t e r m i n e d to enter that football
         1 ground, ir re spective of Police Officers, ir re sp e c t i v e of
           mo u n t e d Police Officers, i r r es pe ct iv e of adv ic e given over
           the tannoy, ir re spective of the best ef f o r t s of S h e f f i e l d
           W e d n e s d a y ’s g r o u n d staff and the Police O f f i c e r s who were
           b e h i n d the turnstiles, a n d were d e t e r m i n e d to en ter the
           football ground.                I cann ot say how many of those had
           ticke ts or had not got tickets.

                                                 R. MARSHALL


Q. That I am not seeking to challenge, because it is perfectly
   plain they were all endeavouring to enter the ground.  What I
   am wondering is whether you find this is something that is
   wholly unanticipated, because is not it something which you
   expect with people apparently not being able to get in before
   kick-off that they will be anxious to get in, ana regrettably
   will push? - A. I have tried to explain this, and I will
   explain it again.  If people want to come to a ground and
   they are reasonable people, and if you go to Sheffield
   Wednesday on a Saturday in the football season you will see
   thousands of people who come to the ground at 10-to-3.   Those
   people go into the ground without difficulty at all.

Q. Is that the Leppings Lane end or the.... - A. That is all
   turnstiles which are open, but the situation on Cup Semi-Final
   day was entirely different, because the normal happy
   atmosphere which prevails at a normal league game and indeed
   at a normal Semi-Final was not there in the 10 to 15 minutes
   which preceded 3 p.m.

Q. When was it that you appreciated there was a change of
   atmosphere, because you have talked about earlier.... - A. The
   situation, I became apprehensive of the situation about 20-to-
   3. At that time I saw a BBC film camera crew, and they had
   been working from the bridge which cross the River Don.  In
   fact, the gentleman who was here this morning outside, the
   same gentleman who filmed on that occasion.  I have seen him
   previously and we acknowledged each other's presence as he
   walked past me to the back of the South Stand.  He said to me,
   "You'll get a better view of the scene from the bridge, if you
   go and stand on the parapet of the bridge". I took his advice
   and that is what I did. From that point I had an excellent
   view of the entire turnstile area.

Q. What sort of height did that get you above ground? - A. That
   may be about 4 or 5 or 5-and-a-half-feet.

Q. Can we see it on any of these photographs or not? May be we
   can't.  I don't think any of them are taken from the right
   angle.  Perhaps you can help us. What about 33A or some of
   the later ones, taken from that angle.  I don't know. I
   suspect it is those off to the left. - A. 16A. You see the
   bridge parapet to the right.

Q. Is that one of the earlier ones? - A. Yes. You see the bridge
   parapet, and there is a tree to the left.  That is about where
   I was standing.

Q. To the left of that road sign? - A. Yes.    A little bit further
   to the left.

Q.   I see, and you say about 6 feet height? - A. Yes. Not     so
     high, no. About 5-and-a-half feet.   I had to scramble    up.

Q.   What time have   we reached now, roughly? - A. About 20-to-3.

Q.   What steps did you think needed to be taken then? - A.    I knew

        I needed some reinforcements.  I knew I needed to try to get
        this crowd to ease back and to stop pushing, and I wanted some
        Tannoy announcements made, to actually have that done. So I
        radioed ground control and asked me to send me some, and I
        also asked for P.C. Buxton who is normally our Land Rover
        driver.  He drives a Land Rover which has a PA facility -
        public address facility - on the top of it.  I asked for P.C.
        Buxton to come round and to actually reinforce the Tannoy
        announcements from the back of the crowd.

     Q. In Leppings Lane? - A. In Leppings Lane.   I got no
        acknowledgement from ground control.   I realised the radio
        was dead at that stage.  I had a multi-channel set, and I
        changed my set to channel 35, which is the Hammerton Road
        ordinary sub-Divisional Police channel. I asked the
        controller at Hammerton Road to send me some reinforcements
        via match control and also to get me the Tannoy announcement
        and to get P.C. Buxton round to Leppings Lane.   I think
        before that happened, before I actually changed channels I
        heard Buxton come across on his radio which was on talk-
        through, saying, "I'm on my way".   I recognised his voice. I
        knew his voice. I knew he would be as good as his word. From
        there on I lost perception of time.   I know that that message
        was timed in Hammerton Road at 14.44.

     Q. I was just going to put that to you. We see that at 2.44, and
        that is limited to a request to Tannoy people not to push? -
        A. That is right.

     Q. And it would be so limited because you had already heard Mr.
        Buxton acknowledging he was on his way, so you did not need to
        put that through? - A. That is right.  In fact, Buxton did
        attend, because I remember looking over my shoulder later and
        seeing the Police Land Rover stuck in the middle of Leppings
        Lane.

     Q. But I don't think you could hear what he was saying? - A. I
        couldn't hear what he was saying.

     Q. And equally, did you hear any Tannoy announcement being made?
        - A. A Tannoy announcement was made but I could not hear what
        was being broadcast.

     Q. Did you go back into the crowd after or did you stay on the
        bridge? - A. No, I stayed on the bridge.

     Q. As you were standing on the bridge did the situation appear to
        you to get worse? - A. It worsened by the minute.

     Q. What was causing it to get worse as far as you could see? - A.
        The influx of people into the area.

     Q. So it was effectively more and more people coming down
        Leppings Lane, was it? - A. Well, you have seen the video
        yourself and the scenes in comparison with last year,  and you
        will see this enormous throng of people who come into the area
        from the Leppings Lane roundabout and from Catch Bar

     Lane.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Where were they all coming from?
     Have you any idea? Where had they been, because Mr.
     Duckenfield told us that his information from the traffic
     routes was that they were clear, which gave him the impression
     that everybody that was coming was, as it were, within the
     Sheffield area? - A. I don't know for definite where they were
     coming from, although I have in my mind suspicions where they
     were coming from.

Q. Public houses? - A. Public houses.

Q.       MR. COLLINS:     That may be, but Police Officers were
     patrolling public houses, were not they? - A. That is right.

Q. So they should have been aware of large numbers of people
   coming out of the public houses, surely? - A. Yes.

Q.        LORD JUSTICETAYLOR:         Or staying in them? - A . Or
     staying in them, yes.

Q.        MR. COLLINS:    What my Lord is getting at is they can't
     have just appeared from nowhere. They must have been
     somewhere within the area and potentially within the sight of
     Police? - A. My information is that public houses as far
     afield as Barnsley and Thurgoland were very, very busy indeed
     on that particular day.

Q. That may be, and I don't think anyone doubts there was a lot
   of drink consumed, but the fact is that these were people who
   were visible to Police Officers within the general sector
   which you were covering.  Is not that right? - A. That is
   right.

Q. So they were not a surprise or should not have been a
   surprise? - A. They should not have been a surprise, no.

Q. But it appears no-one thought to inform the ground that they
   were still on their way? - A. They certainly did not inform
   me.

Q. I am not suggesting they necessarily should have done, but the
   fact is they did not? - A. Yes, I agree that.

     So you were taken a bit by surprise, were you, at more and
     more people coming at this late stage? - A. Yes.

     Although you, of course, were aware of the propensity of fans
     to turn up rather on the late side? - A. Yes.

Q. Did it occur to you once you had got the build up in the
   turnstile area and it was obviously not improving that the
   first thing you should do and quickly was to try to stop any
   more people coming down and adding to that? - A. Yes.

Q. What steps were taken to achieve that or try to achieve that?

                                                R. MARSHALL


    - A. Inspector Hand-Davis threw a cordon of mounted Officers
    across the entrance to the turnstile area. At one stage the
    blue perimeter gate was closed to minimise the crush in the
    turnstile area before A-G.

Q   Did that work? - A. The gate was thrust open, forced open by
    the press of people.

Q. That was people on the Leppings Lane side, was it? - A. A
   cordon of mounted Officers, people were actually climbing
   underneath the bellies of the horses.

G. Did you see that happening? - A. I did not see that.

Q. That is what has been reported to you? - A. I know that
   Inspector Hand-Davis will tell you.

Q. Oh, yes.  I am just wondering whether you saw it from your
   vantage point. - A. I did not see it, no.

Q. Did you yourself take any steps yourself to try to organise
   that people would not come down? May be there was not
   anything you could do and if so tell us. - A. As I say, at
   that stage I guess the situation had become unmanageable from
   our point of view.

Q.} At what stage would you say the situation outside those
    turnstiles became unmanageable from a Police point of view? -
    A. It was going downhill rapidly from 2.44.  That is the
    milestone time for me, because....

Q. When you made your request? - A. Because that is at the stage
   I made my request to Hammerton Road because of the failure of
   the radio to the ground control.

Q. I imagine you were aware that the closed-circuit television
   camera which is inside the ground would show ground control
   the situation at and outside the turnstiles? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you anticipate that Mr. Duckenfield or whoever in ground
   control would take independent steps to send you
   reinforcements if he thought it necessary? - A. Yes.

Q. Had there not been a break down in radio communication would
   you have asked for reinforcements, or did you ask for
   reinforcements? - A. I asked for reinforcements in my message
   at 2.44, but for some reason another it does not appear in the
   log.  Irrespective of that I know that reinforcements were
   sent.  They were sent from the gymnasium by Inspector Sewell
   who sent the reserve Serial 20 round via the bottom gangway of
   the North Stand.

Q. And I think some mounted Officers also were sent, were they
   not? - A. Mounted Officers attended from Penistone Road.

Q.      in fact as I think you have already told us, the Officers
        who closed the perimeter gates only managed to hold the
        position for a very short time? - A. The gate was being
        shaken physically and my perception was that it is a 10 cfct.
        gate and I saw this gate wavering at the top and the mounted
        chaps were behind the gate.

Q. This is the perimeter gate for the avoidance of any doubt?
   - A. Yes. I thought "Any minute now that gate is going in.
   That gate will be thrust forward."

Q.           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: The perimeter gate? - A. The
        perimeter gate, yes?, and the horses will be injured on the
        other side. That gate in fact was thrust open and the horse
        was brushed aside and people then surged into the area in
        front of the turnstiles once again.

q   .         MR. COLLINS: I think it was at this stage that you
        relayed either your second or third request that the gates
        be opened? - A. I cannot be absolutely specific about that
        but I certainly made three requests for the gates to be
        opened.
Q. Now we know that Gate C was opened again at I think 2.52?
   - A. Yes.
Q. And this time it was opened wide and remained open and indeed
   at the time it was opened I think there were not any fans
   directly outside it and they had as it were to be shepherded
   firom the area immediately outside the turnstiles? - A. That
   is right, although at that stage I think a lot of opportunists
   saw that as a very quick and easy means of gaining access to
   the ground and started to move through there in big numbers.

Q. I am sure that is right. There was still of course a crush
   on the other side of the dividing wall, that is outside
   Turnstiles 1-16. Is that correct? - A. That is right.

Q. Could you see Gate A? - A. Yes.

Q. Were you hoping that that would be opened as well? ~ A. Yes,
   I was hoping it would be opened because it was being shaken.
   It was almost under siege.

Q. And we know in fact that it was opened but it was not
   opened until 2.58? - A. That is right because I asked for
   Gate A to be opened.

Q. Did you name Gate A? - A. Yes I did. I did not call it
   Gate A, I called it the gate to the North Stand.

Q.| That as I say was eventually opened and the result of
  I opoiing those two gates, was that to remove the problem at
  I the turnstiles? - A. It did eventually remove it but as you
  I have seen from the video there is enormous numbers of people
    still coming into the area of the tiurnstiles well up to 3 p.m.
                                        R. MARSHALL


Q. Are you able to give any idea as to the numbers you think
   went through those respective gates? - A. I can't.

Q. What about as far as Gate C is concerned. Any idea at all
   as to the sort of numbers you think went through that gate in
   total? - A. The first time it was opened just a few. I
   don't know.   I have seen the video, probably thousands.
   I don't know.   I cannot say.
Q. Gate B the one that is immediately to the left of the turn­
   stiles A-G. Did you see that opened at any stage? - A.No.

Q. I don't think there is any evidence that it was but you can
   confirm that. As far as you are aware that was not opened?
   - A. I think it was opened at some stage.

Q. But not to    let people in? - A. I cannot say for certain.

Q. Anyway, you never saw it? - A. I never saw it opened, no.

Q. Now the next you were aware, I think, was a radio message
   of trouble inside the ground and a general request for
   every available Officer to go to the ground? - A. Yes.

Q. You had to leave I think some people still at the turnstiles
   because there were people still outside? - A. Yes, I asked
   Chief Inspector Waring to get a grip of that situation and use
   what resources he could to actually stop people going in
   because clearly if there was trouble inside it did not make
   good sense allowing extra people to come in.

Q. .When you got inside the ground you went in presumably through
    Gate C, did you? - A. Yes.

Q.   When you got inside where did you go? - A. I went to the
     tunnel.

Q.   That is the central tunnel? - A. The central tunnel, yes

Q. What time would that be. Can you help? - A. Probably about
   three or four minutes after 3 p.m.

Q. Were there people in the tunnel when you arrived there?
   - A. Yes.
q   . Doing what? - A. Bringing out injured people.

Q. Any Police Officers that you were aware of at or around the
   tunnel? - A. There was a lot of Police Officers, yes.

Q. But where were they. Were they in the tunnel or not or
   the concourse side? - A. They were in and around the con­
   course and the tunnel.
 Q. Who was it then who was bringing out injured and dead? -
    A. initially it was the fans themselves who were bringing
    out comrades.
                                    R. MARSHALL


What did you do? - A. We tried to bring some order to a
scene which was absolute pandemonium, chaotic. We were
being shouted at, abused that it was all our fault. People
were being dragged out. A crowd soon built up on the con­
course. My fear was that fights would develop between fans
and Police Officers.  I was conscious of the need to try to
mobilise all the Officers who were there to try to save
lives and they did.
The scene you have depicted, was this spread all over the
concourse? - A. It started from the tunnel and then spread
over the concourse.
Presumably it did not take long to cover the concourse as
 people were brought out? - A. That is right, yes.

The only reason I ask that is that some of us have seen a
video which is the close circuit camera which shows the
inside of Gate C and this part of the concourse, and I will
be corrected if I am wrong, but on timing I think it is not
until perhaps a little after you said that there appears to
be any real movement on the concourse itself.  I cannot
give you the exact time because the video is not timed and
I have not timed it? - A. I would accept the video times
are accurate because my perception of time ceased to have,
ceased to be working.
I think it is probably nearer about quarter-past-3 that there
appears to be any real movement on the concourse? - A. It
was much before that sir.
I am simply speaking from what the camera says? - A. It was
my perception that we reacted as quickly as we possibly could
once the nature of the incident had become apparent.

I am not doubting that at all but I am wondering whether
your timing is right as to when you actually first arrived
there, whether it might not have been a bit later than you
suggest? — A. Possibly, I cannot be certain.

Because obviously the later you were starting so the later
it will be that these events developed? - A. Yes.

Was it clear to you that some people had died at that
stage? - A. No, not at that stage.
 When   were you first aware that you were dealing with deaths?
 - A.   When some people came out who were brought out who
 were   quite heavily cyanosed and at that stage I realised
 that   people had died.
 ^ere at any stage Officers directed to go into the tunnel
 and try and get people to come out? — A. Yes, Sergeant
 Morgan went in there with a lot of Police Officers.
 They were pulling people out. Officers were trying to
 give cardiac massage to resuscitate them.

Q. I think some ambulances began to arrive and were stationed
   outside Gate C? - A. We could not get them into the con­
   course because the gate is too low. We had the situation
   of casualties with distressed fans with them, some possibly
   dead; Officers doing their very best to resuscitate people
   and we had to try to organise those casualties to be moved
   down to the road and people were reluctant obviously to
   leave people. They were demanding that we do something;
   demanding that ambulances come; vilifying us.

Q. To be fair, Superintendent, it was obvious, was it not,
   that a lot of the fans took the view that the Police were
   to blame for the fact that there was overcrowding causing
   problems? - A. Yes.

Q. Causing the deaths? - A. Well none of them said that. They
   swore at us. They did not put it in so many words, but
   clearly at that stage I felt that this entire tragedy was
   my responsibility.

Q. I can well understand that and I am sure you will be glad
   to know that others don't feel that and certainly that is
   not something that this Inquiry, I don't seek to put it to
   you at all on behalf of the Inquiry that it was your
   responsibility, but no doubt that is how you felt at the
   time? - A. Yes.
Q. And I imagine that made things all the worse for you and
   makes it more difficult for you to remember precisely what
   happened at that stage? - A. Yes.

Q. That I think is wholly understandable. Did you at any stage
   go on to the pitch, Superintendent? - A. No sir.

Q. As far as you   can remember? - A. No    sir.

Q. You stayed in the concourse area? - A. I organised asbest
   I could the rescue efforts from the back of the concourse.

Q. Did anyone contact you there in your organisation at that
   point during the time that were organising it or were you
   left to yourself, as it were? - A. Well I said that we
   needed ambulances at the back of the Leppings Lane
   enclosure. At some stage I made a request for the major
   incident boxes from Hammerton Road which had all the
   impedimenta in for dealing with major incidents. As time
   went by we managed to get the casualties and the dead down
   into the road outside which leads to the back of the South
   Stand and I at some stage asked a Fire Officer for sheets
   to mask off the dead bodies.

Q. Do you know where they were taken after that? - A. The dead?

Q. Yes? - A. The dead were taken to the gymnasium.

Q. As far as the dead are concerned and indeed theinjured was

            it your impression, or perhaps you can't help about this,
            that whatever injuries they suffered had not been suffered
            in the tunnel itself but had been suffered on the terraces
            and they were being brought out through the tunnel, or
            can you not help? - A. I did not learn anything which led
            me to think that people had died in the tunnel.

                   MR. COLLINS:  I think there is no more I need ask
            you.   Thank you,Superintendent.


                           Cross-Examined by MR. HYTNER:

         Q. Mr. Marshall, I appear on behalf of the injured and bereaved
            and I hope it will be a relief to you to know that I also
            like Mr. Collins have put any questions so far, nor do I
            intend to, indicating that you were in any way to blame for
            requesting the opening of the gates. Do you follow? -
            A. Yes sir.

         Q. However, when an incident occurs more than one witness may
            carry mway different impressions of the incident.  I think
            that must be a common experience for you as a Police Officer?
            - A. Yes.

         Q. Your account of what happened outside the turnstiles on that
            day is a very vi^rid and graphic one and one which no doubt
            comes from your abiding impressions of the events of the
            afternoon? - A. Yes.

         Q. Is it unfair to put it in this way: that your abiding
             impression of that afternoon which has been carried away
            with you and is now firmly fixed in your mind, is an
           | impression of drunken ill-behaved and irresponsible fans
             struggling to get into the ground against all the efforfefe
            of efficient and well organised Policemen? - A. I would
             clarify that by saying not all those fans were of that type.
             I think the aearer that we got towards kick-off the more
             I noticed this almost stelfish brutality of people shoving
             and pushing and wanting to get access to the ground, but
          i not all fans.

            Q.     I did not s ug ge st that you sa i d all fans had b e h a v e d in
                   that way.       What I s u g g e s t e d to you is that your a b i d i n g
                   impres sio n of that a f t e r no on is of dr un ke n and
                   i rr es po nsi bl e fans, d e s p e r a t e to get into the ground, come

                   organised, e f f i c i e n t P o l i c e m e n ? - A. I think that is only
                   part of the picture.               My im pre ssi on an d my e x p e r i e n c e with
                   football c r o w d s and with any o th er crowd, for that matter,
                   is that, if the c r o w d is am e n a b l e to re a so n and if the
                  c r o w d is made up of r e a s o n a b l e peo pl e an d if the c r o w d
                   wants to be policed, then Po l ic e mea su re s and Polic e
                  e f fo rt s will be successful.                 If, on the other hand, there

                  an d not to be a m en ab le to rea so n or to sugge sti ons , then
                   it is a di f f i c u l t s c e n a r i o for a Poli ce Force to manage.
                   As has been mentioned, I think, in this Inqui ry earlier,
                   we poli ce in this c o u n t r y by co n s e n t and that implies, in
                  my view, a co ns en t by the p u b l i c to c o m p l y with r e a s o n a b l e
                   requests.       The nearer we got to three o ’c l o c k on April
                   15th, the less I p e r c e i v e d that peop le were w a n t i n g or,
                   indeed, w i l l i n g to c o m p l y with any sort of r e a s o n a b l e
                  re que st that we made.

                  in g i v i n g that answer.     It was not, after all, an answer
                  to my question.       Your a b i d i n g impres si on is s i m p l y of fans
                  of the type you have described, d o i n g their best to
                  o ve rc om e the ef for ts of well o r g a n i s e d and ef f i c i e n t
                  policing.       Is that your i mp res si on of that a f t e r n o o n ? - A.
                  I think that is a ve r y fair summary, yes.

            Q.    You see, I have, u n f o rtu na tel y, to put it to you, Mr.
                  Marshall, that it is, in fact, a very d i s t o r t e d impression
                  that you have c a r r i e d away in your mind.                     Can I, first of
                  all, deal with the a n a l o g y you gave of the happy, sober,
                  w e l l - d i s c i p l i n e d fans who turn up for S h e f f i e l d

                  S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y - I am not sure what it is.                  I am told
                  it is s o m e t h i n g in the regi on of 19,000.                  Is that abo ut

                  of the c l u b and the dis ta nc e that their fans have to
                  travel.

Q.    And, naturally, if Le pp i n g s Lane, as the rest of the
      ground, is well under half c a p a c i t y - a little over third
      c a p a c i t y - n a t u r a l l y there will not be any need for
      pus h in g or sh o v i n g or a mass d e v e l o p i n g in the tu rn st il e
      area, will t h e r e ? - A. No.

Q.    The es se nti al op er at io n on a match day is to pr eve nt the
      tur ns ti le area, as I have been c a l l i n g it - that is the
     .area be twe en the t u r n st il e and the p e r i m e t e r r a il in gs -
     (p r ev en ti ng that ar e a f i lli ng up? - A. No, that is not so.
     >0n a normal match day that alw ay s happens.

Q.    Are you s a y i n g that on a normal match day the whole of
      that ar e a will be full with peo pl e so that th ey are
      sh ou l d e r to shoulder, c h e s t to ba ck ? - A. Well, it de pend s
      on the following.

Q.    Well, yes, but, Mr. M a r s h a l l . . . . ? - A.     Pe op l e queue      in
      that ar e a to get into the ground.

Q.    Mr.   Marshall,     a mass    is not a queue,        is it? - A.      No.

Q.   A mass is the op po s i t e of a queue be cau se it means, in
     effect, that peo pl e will be p u s h e d up a g a i n s t the wall
     b e tw ee n the t u r n s t i l e s ? - A. Yes.

Q.   And there will be s i d e - t o - s i d e p r e s s u r e w hi ch will    preven t
     peo pl e g e t t i n g throu gh the t u r n s t i l e s ? - A. Yes.

Q.    A queue is, in front of a turnstile, ideally one deep, but
      that is r e a l l y unrealistic.          A queue in front of a
      t u r n s t i l e s h o u l d be, at the most, three and p r e f e r a b l y two
      deep, s t r e t c h i n g at right an gl e s back from the t u r n s t i l e s ?
      - A. Yes.

Q.    And pa ra ll el to an d not in te r m i n g l e d with the queue            next
      door, at the next door t u r n s t i l e ? - A.     Preferably.

Q.    Well, if       the ar e a is a mass of people, that is the
      neg a t i o n of the c o nc ep t of queuing, is not it? - A.                Yes.

Q. So it is esse nt ia l for e f f e c t i v e c r o w d contr ol and
   e f f e c t i v e tu r n s t i l e e n tr y that numbe rs wi t hi n the
   tu r n s t i l e area s ho u l d be l im ite d well b el ow its capacity,
   as tho ug h it were a t e r r a c e ? - A. That is in an ideal
   situation, yes.

Q.    Well, it           is not just ideal.     It is e s s en ti al if you are
      g o i n g to       have people g o i n g t h r o u g h the t u r n s t i l e s
      e f f e c t i v e l y an d if there is to be no p r e s s u r e and c r u s h i n g
      wit h i n that ve r y c o n f i n e d s p a c e ? - A. Well, as I have
      tr i e d to say before, sir, to me, the c o n c e p t of q u e u i n g
      implies that people want to queue, that pe op l e will

     ac kn o w l e d g e that s o m e b o dy else has got p r i o r i t y before
     them to en te r a stadium, and if peo pl e do not a c k n o w l e d g e
     that priority, then the c o n c e p t of q u e u i n g goes out of the
     window.

Q.   Mr. Marshall, I think it is g e n e r a l l y a c k n o w l e d g e d that
     the Po li c e have an esse nt ia l part to pl a y in c r o w d contro l
     at football matche s n o w a d a y s ? - A. That is right.

Q.   If e v e r y b o d y who went to a football match had the
     w i l l i n g n e s s to q ue ue and give p r i o r i t y to those who come
     first and had the s e l f - d i s c i p l i n e to do it, you w o u l d not
     need very many P o l i c e m e n at a football match, w o ul d you ? -
     A.      That is right.

Q.   Your c o m m e n t about p o l i c i n g by c o n s e n t is a v e r y t e l l i n g
     one b e c a u s e p r e- Wa r you c o u l d pol ic e a c r o w d of 40, 50 or
     6 0 , 0 0 0 with a hand ful of Po l i c e O f f i c e r s ? - A. That is
     right.

Q.   But you ca n n o t a n y     longer,    can yo u ? - A. No.

Q.   The mood, not just of football supporters,                     but the     mood of
     peop le g e n e r a l l y has a l t e r e d ? - A. Yes.

Q.   I hope you will not think this is flippant.                      It is not
     meant to be.          It is very serious.           It is not just football
     supporters.         You have, no doubt, re a d of scen es at ra i l w a y
     st at io ns in London, where men in bo w l e r hats and r o l l e d up
     um b re ll as a t t a c k e d train d r i v e r s with the r o l l e d up
     u m b re ll as becau se they were on a Go S l o w and the men were
     impatient to get home.              Do you recall t h a t ? - A. I do not
     recall it personally, no.

Q.   You see, that sort of th in g one did not think about
     pre-War, but the Pol ic e have to take all that into a c co un t
     nowadays, do not t h e y ? - A. Yes.

Q.   C o m i n g d i r e c t l y to the point and to the kernel of your
     evi d e n c e before I go on to the general policing, which I
     will have to do tomorrow,               you talk of the c r o w d at ab out
     2 . 2 5 b e i n g pr e t t y thick -    th a t is, de ns e - but they were
     well b e h a v e d an d h a p p y ? - A. Yes.

Q.   Betwe en 2.25,      which,     incidentally,         is not   coming    late,    is
     it? - A. No.

Q.   You do not call them late-comers.            T h e r e were 6 to 8 , 0 0 0
     people in and a r o u n d Le pp i n g s Lane, all m o v i n g to wa rd s the
     tu r n s t i l e a r e a ? - A. Yes.

                                                /Q.   And the turnstile.

                                                R, MARSHALL


Q. And the turnstile area was full? - A. Yes.

Q. Tomorrow we may have to deal with the actual rate of flow
   through the turnstiles, but it is perfectly clear that the
   rate of flow of people coming down leppings Lane was much
   higher than the flow that could possibly have got through the
   turnstiles? - A. The turnstiles are capable of handling 750
   persons per hour according to the Green Guide.  It is an
   extremely difficult perception to make, looking at a crowd
   actually on the ground, and deciding whether that crowd can go
   through a turnstile.

Q. No, Mr. Marshall, that is not the point I am making at the
   moment.  We will consider that tomorrow.  Plainly the rate at
   which people were joining the crowd was greater than the rate
   at which the crowd was dissipating through the turnstiles? -
   A. Yes.

Q. Consequently whether people were drunk or sober, whether they
   were well-disciplined or ill-disciplined, the people in and
   around the perimeter fence, both inside and outside the
   turnstiles, were getting a crush of people coming up behind? -
   A . Yes.

Q. If you are crushed from behind it is the natural tendency to
   go forward and push forward, even if you are well disciplined?
   - A. Yes, but I have seen crowds on other occasions whether
   people have actually tried to do something and have actually
   encouraged people to stop pushing.  I didn't see that on this
   occasion.

Q. That may be, but the fact remains that it is a somewhat harsh
   judgment on those in and around the turnstile area that they
   were in some way undisciplined when they were subjected to
   greater and greater pressure from people coming down
   Leppings Lane and joining the throng outside the perimeter
   gate? - A. That is true.

Q. Has it not yet occurred to you that the genesis of the problem
   that led to the crushing within the turnstile area was the
   failure of the Police to control and filter the crowd coming
   down Leppings Lane which joined the throng and added to the
   forward pressure, drunk or sober? - A. I think with the
   greatest respect, sir, that is very much an over­
   simplification.  The measures which are available to the
   Police to actually filter people in a situation such as that
   are - I would say this situation is virtually unattainable
   because you would need an enormously strong Police presence to
   do that. As I go back to my previous statement, we Police by
   consent in this country and we have to determine a Police
   resource commensurate with a sporting afternoon of
   entertainment.  This is not a public order situation where
   people are anticipated to be rioting or going on the rampage.
   It is a situation where we are trying to manage a big, happy
   crowd which is mostly made up of people who are quite happy
   to comply with the simple requests that we make.

           Q. Well, tomorrow I may have to deal with this in more detail,
              but what I have to put to you tonight as my final question is
              this, that whereas undoubtedly there were fans who were drunk
              and undoubtedly fans who were impatient, the problem at the
              Leppings Lane turnstile area was caused not by them but by
              the mass of people who had come down Leppings Lane, drunk or
              sober, well or ill-disciplined, and who were allowed to join
              the throng already massing outside the gates? Has that no
              occurred to you for a moment as a possibility? - A. I question
              the word "allowed", because that implies that we were
              completely oblivious to our responsibilities, and that is not
              the case. The Police Officers who were present outside
              Leppings Lane turnstiles and were the same sort of numbers as
              last year, were doing their very best to maintain order and to
              do the job which they have done on many, many previous
              occasions, and to do it properly. To say that we allowed these
              people to enter the area is an implication that we were
              somehow abrogating our responsibility, and that is just
              not true.

                  LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Whenever it is convenient to you.

                  MR. HYTNER:   Well, it is convenient.

                  LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     We will break off now until 10
             o'clock tomorrow.

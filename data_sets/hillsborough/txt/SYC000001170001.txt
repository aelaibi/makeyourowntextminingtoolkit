              LETTER SENT TO REGIONAL REPRESENTATIVES ON COUNCIL BY THE PRESIDENT - JULY 1985


          Sudden Infant Deaths


          I am writing about the decision taken at the last meeting of Council regarding
          improving the paediatric service available where a sudden infant death occurs.

         Our Association has been approached by Lady Limerick, Executive Vice-President of the
         Foundation for the Study of Infant Deaths, regarding some of the difficulties which
         may attend sudden infant deaths. As you know such deaths often occur in
         circumstances in which neither the family general practitioner nor a paediatrician
         has previously been involved. The general practitioner with little or no knowledge
         of the patient concerned and possibly little previous experience or special knowledge
         of sudden infant death may not feel in a position to offer the parents the advice
         they require. The parents may or may not have the opportunity to see the pathologist
         concerned but even if they do advice from a pathologist alone is unlikely to cover
         the whole range of clinical cares and anxieties which such parents experience or
         provide a continuum of support should that be necessary.

         At Council we agreed that the^ management of sudden infant death would be improved if
         there was in each District a paediatrician (the designated paediatrician) who carried
         a special advisory responsibility regarding sudden infant deaths. Essentially he
         would fulfil a role of expertise and availability. An arrangement would require to
         be made whereby the Coroner or Pathologist would inform the designated paediatrician
         of all sudden infant deaths at the earliest possible moment. The designated
         paediatrician would contact the general practitioner concerned. If another
         paediatrician was involved the designated paediatrician would presumably take no
         further action but if no paediatrician had been involved he would offer assistance to
         the general practitioner including willingness to see the parents if the general
         practitioner so wished. If the parents had no general practitioner the designated
         paediatrician might see them directly. Expert counselling would thus be available to
         all parents involved in sudden infant death. Many such parents do not receive
         adequate advice at this time and the Foundation for the Study of Infant Deaths with
         its great experience of the problems of these bereaved parents is very anxious that
         through paediatricians they should.

         On behalf of the Association I am writing to ask if you, as the Regional
         Representative for the . . . . . . . . Region, would undertake the task of discussing
         with your paediatric colleagues Council's agreement to the sudden infant death
         arrangements proposed above and o f -implementing the plan to have a designated
         paediatrician in each District in your Region.

         I hope that you and your paediatric colleagues will agree to this arrangement and
         that you will be good enough to write to me with the names of the designated
         paediatricians in the Region identified with the Districts in which they will act. I
         have undertaken to write to the Foundation for the Study of Infant Deaths telling the
         Foundation whether we can implement this arrangement.

         I am hopeful that the BPA through its members' sense of corporate responsibility can
         develop an administrative and advisory arrangement which could be of great benefit to
         the families who suffer sadly in this way. May I express to you my gratitude for
         your willingness to undertake this task.

                                    SUDDEN DEATHS IN INFANCY.

       Recently I gave an address to a conference in Leicester on a Coroners

view    on Cot       Deaths.       This    conference was         called by The          Foundation     for

the    Study    of Infant         Deaths    chaired by      the       President    Lady    Limerick and

the majority         of    the    delegates were        parents who had at           sometime     a baby

which had died suddenly and inexplicably.

       As a Coroner of some 19 years standing I have always been concerned

as    to the    effect      the sudden and          inexplicable         deaths of       infants has     on

parents, grandparents and relatives.

        The average number of reported cases in my jurisdiction of the deaths

of children und£r 2 years approximate to 23 per annum.

        Before written evidence              could be      accepted       in a Coroners         Court   the

parents had to attend an Inquest to give evidence.                              This of itself, where

there were no suspicious circumstances,                         added to the burden of distress,

sadness, anxiety and feelings of guilt and self blame to those who appeared

before me.                        My Officers before and after the Inquest did their

best to explain the inexplicable and I and my Pathologists at the hearing

tried at least to alleviate the distress with such explanations as could

be    given    but    it was      never     easy   or   even possible           to do much more         than

try to get the parents, mostly young and often with the first baby dying

in such circumstances,              to cease blaming themselves.                   I always took such

Inquests       in    the   informal        atmosphere      of    my    office     (although     the   Press

were often present) and it was apparent to me that much more was needed

to answer questions               such as:    Why me?           Is such death hereditary?               Will

another baby die            the    same way?        Was    it the milk?           I could not         breast

feed?     Baby was so happy and healthy what caused her death?                             The questions

were    unanswerable         - and mostly          still    are       - except    that    the   death    was

clearly not attributable              to the parents and that was difficult                      for them
        It    should not       be    forgotten       that       in such deaths           there   is always     a

Police       investigation          and although          it    is done    in my     area with kindness

and concern          to eliminate any possibility of foul play or injury the parents

had, before          the Inquest,suffered considerably - and                        guilt and self blame

appeared to be me to be the commonest feelings.

        Some    years     ago there      came       to         the Leicester     General         Hospital    Dr.

Peter    Swift,      a    Paediatrician         concerned with             research       into    such    deaths

and he and I discussed                 the ways          in which    such distress might at least

be alleviated.           I readily agreed that in all such cases with the consent

of the parents and their General Practitioner that he and his small staff

would visitthem in their homes and spend                            time and        show genuine concern

for them.       It was not to be a formal method of taking evidence for research

but concern for the suffering parents - out of which would no doubt come

most of the information required.

       I reverted         to    paper    Inquests"             to prevent     the    parent       from    having

to come before me to give evidence which alleviated some of the trauma.

       The     system     now operated         by   myOfficers        is    to   take      the    necessary

statements and to give the parents the Foundations leaflets and ask them

if they wished (with the agreement of their own Doctor) to let Dr. Swifts

team    talk    to     them    in    their   own home           informally.         If    they    agreed    they

signed a simple consent.                 There was immediate success - the experienced

team gradually helped build up with                            the Foundation a voluntary                team of

parents who had suffered the loss of a baby by a cot death and to explain

how    they    felt,     how    they    reacted      and how        they    have     tried       to alleviate

their grief.

       There is no doubt that it is a great relief to talk to someone who

has been through the experience for the sufferers.

       I too am grateful              to the    parents          and Dr.    Swift and his          staff who

are concerned, as I am, to relieve as much as possible human suffering.
     The   Foundation   has    proved of   great   benefit   and I hope   that   their

work can be extended everywhere.

     In recent months I have had an Inquest on a single parent girl who

killed herself there being little doubt on the evidence through the death

of her infant child some months previously and who refused all help.

     May   I commend    to my    Brother Coroners    the Foundation   and   its work

which has proved so helpful in my area.

                     Re: Philip Charles Rapier (Deceased)

      Coroners law - quashing the inquest - the proper procedure - s. 6
        Coroners A ct 1887 - s. 19 Coroners (A m endm ent) A ct 1926 - R.S.C.
        Orders 53 & 5 - fu rth e r evidence after inquest.

         At the time of his death the 19 year old deceased was undergoing punishment
      for breach of the Prison Rules in a solitary confinement punishment cell in the
      Young Offenders Wing of Swansea Prison. He was found hanged. Following the
      death of the deceased there was an investigation into solvent abuse by the
      deceased and another inmate. There was evidence that no more than three
      quarters of an hour before the deceased had been found dead a tin of dry cleaning
      fluid (trichloroethane) had been swung on a line across to his cell. The
      investigation revealed that the deceased had experienced sniffing this solvent and
      that he had expressed suicidal feelings after doing so. The results of the
      investigation were not brought to the attention of the coroner. There was no
      evidence at the inquest that the deceased had any suicidal intent and having heard
      the coroner’s directions concerning the Finding or rejecting of a verdict of suicide,
      the jury returned an open verdict. The day after the inquest a prison officer who
      was previously unaware of the solvent abuse investigation felt that the findings
      might be relevant to the deceased’s death. As a result of this matter being raised
      there was an investigation carried out on behalf of the Director of Public
      Prosecutions and eventually the file relating to the investigation was submitted to
      the coroner. Having seen the file, the coroner then made an application solely
      upon the statutory grounds under s. 6 Coroners Act 1887 and s. 19 Coroners
      (Amendment) Act 1926 to quash the inquisition in order that a new inquest could
      be held to consider the fresh evidence. In the absence of the Attorney-General the
      Solicitor-General (pursuant to his powers under the Law Officers Act 1945) gave
      his fiat and the applicant then sought the leave of the court to bring the
      application in accordance with R.S.C. O. 53.

         Held: (i) The High Court has always had an inherent jurisdiction to exercise a
      supervisory role in relation to an inquest conducted by a coroner and a power if
      necessary to quash an inquisition — s. 35 Coroners Act 1887. This is now
      exercised under R.S.C. O. 53 and there is no separate common law procedure.
         (ii) Leave to obtain an application to quash an inquisition is not required
      where the application is made solely on the statutory grounds and no application
      is made for judicial review. On the fiat of the Attorney-General being obtained
      the proper procedure is by way of originating summons under R.S.C. O. 5 r. 3.
         (iii) The likelihood or otherwise of a fresh inquest arriving at a different verdict

Re: Philip Charles   is always relevant though it is quite impossible for the reviewing court to form
Rapier (Deceased)    any sensible view upon whether the new evidence creates a probability or only a
                     possibility that a different verdict would be arrived at upon a fresh inquisition.
 Queen's Bench          (iv) Grounds for ordering a fresh inquest (per Simon Brown J.):
   Division
                        (a)   The coroner himself believed it to be necessary and himself initiated the
                              application:
                        (b)   The legislation requires there to be an inquest in all cases of death in
                              prison and it should be a full and proper inquest with all the material
      i                       matters placed before the jury:
                        (c)   There is at least a real possibility that the additional evidence could
                              produce a different verdict.

                        (v) The note to s. 6 Coroners Act 1887 in Halsbury's Statutes. 4th Edition.
                     Vol. II at p. 359 which says than an inquisition will not be quashed unless it is
                     shown that there would probably be a different verdict if a new inquest were held
                     is too stringent {Re: Davis (Deceased) [1968] I Q.B. 12 distinguished). The
                     approach of Lord Parker, C.J. in R. v. Cardiff Coroner, ex parte Thomas (1970)
      ii             134 J.P. 673: [1970] I W.L.R. 1475 was followed.
                        (vi) Per Woolf. L.J.: In practice, although in the majority of cases where there is
                     a right to relief that statutory powers apply, it is likely to be felt safer also to
                     apply under O. 53 for judicial review because the courts will then have in reserve
                     its other powers. There is no need for two separate applications which are in
                     practice joined. The granting of leave will almost inevitably be a formality if the
                     Attorney-General considers that the applicant is entitled to his fiat.

  Woolf. 1..J.          Lord Justice Woolf: This is an application by Francis d’Aubeville
                     Wilson, now retired, who at the relevant times was Her Majesty’s
                     Coroner for Swansea and Gower in the county of Glamorgan. The
      v              application is made under s. 6 of the Coroners Act 1887 and under s. 19
                     of the Coroners (Amendment) Act 1926.
                       The relevant provisions of s. 6 of the Coroners Act 1887 provide:

                        “6(1) Where Her Majesty’s High Court of Justice, upon application
                         made by or under the authority of the Attorney-General, is satisfied
                        either —
                           (b)     where an inquest has been held by a coroner that by reason of
                        fraud, rejection of evidence, irregularity of proceedings, insufficiency
                        of inquiry, or otherwise, it is necessary or desirable, in the interests of
                        justice, that another inquest should be held, the court may order an
150                  JUSTICE OK TIIF. PEACE REPORTS                                    483




      inquest to be held touching the said death, and may, if the court          Re: Philip Charles
      think it just, order the said coroner to pay such costs of and             Rapier (Deceased)
      incidental to the application as to the court may seem just, and where
                                                                                  Queen's Bench
      an inquest has been already held may quash the inquisition of that

      inquest.”
                                                                                     Woolf, L.J.
      Section 19 of the Coroners (Amendment) Act 1926 provides:

      “ For the removal of doubts it is hereby declared, without prejudice
      to the generality of the provisions of s, 6 of the Coroners Act 1887,
      that the powers of the High Court under that section extend to and
      may be exercised in any case where the court is satisfied that by
      reason of the discovery of new facts or evidence it is necessary or
      desirable in the interests of justice that an inquisition on an inquest
      previously held concerning a death should be quashed, and that
      another inquest should be held.”

     A uthority to make this application was granted by a fiat of the
  Solicitor-General, acting pursuant to his powers under the Law Officers
  Act 1945, in the absence of the Attorney-General, dated November 1,
  1985 and the application was then made in accordance with the
  procedure laid down in O. 53 for an application for judicial review. On
  Jan u ary 29, 1986, having considered the papers, Nolan, J. gave the
  applicant leave, “if this was required”, to proceed with the application.
                                                                                         ill
     The application is not opposed but, in addition to the helpful
  arguments of Mr. Peregrin Simon on behalf of the applicant, the court
  has had the benefit of the argument of Mr. Guy Sankey, who appeared
  as amicus curiae.

  The Pro p er Procedure
     Mr. Sankey indicated in the course of his argument that it would
  assist the Crown Office if the court could clarify the question whether or             iv
  not it is necessary to have leave of the court to proceed with an
  application where an applicant has already obtained the fiat of the
  Attorney-General pursuant to the provisions of the Coroners Act 1887.
  The answer to that question appears to me to depend upon the nature of
  the application which is made. Quite apart from the statutory
  application to quash under the provisions to which I have made
  reference, the court has always had an inherent jurisdiction to exercise a
  supervisory role in relation to an inquest conducted by a coroner and a
  power if necessary to quash an inquisition. (Section 35 of the Coroners
  Act 1887 provides that “N othing in this Act shall . . . in any manner
  prejudice or affect the jurisdiction of the High C ourt of Justice or of any
  Judge thereof in relation to or over a coroner or his duties.”) This
  com m on law is independent of the statutory power and is now exercised
  on an application for judicial review under O. 53 of the Rules of the
  Supreme C ourt (e.g. R. v. Surrey Coroner, ex parte Cam pbell [1982]
  Q.B. 661 and R. v. Greater M anchester Coroner, e x parte Tal and
  A nother[\9S S] Q.B. 67). On such an application leave must be obtained
  in the ordinary way.
     W here an application is made under the statutory power it may be

Re: Philip Charles   desirable, because the powers of the court are not identical, to also make
Rapier (Deceased)    an application under the com m on law power of the court by way of an
                     application for judicial review. Where this is the position it is not
 Queen's Bench       necessary for two separate applications to be made. The applications
   Division
                     can be and are in practice joined but they then have to be made by way
                     of an application for judicial review and so, although the fiat of the
    Woolf, L.J.
                     Attorney-General must already have been obtained so as to make the
                     application under the statutory powers, it is still necessary to obtain the
                     leave of the court because of the inclusion of an application for judicial
                     review. In practice, the granting of leave will almost inevitably be a
                     formality since, if the Attorney-General considers that the applicant is
                     entitled to his fiat, it is most unlikely that a court would ever refuse
                     leave.
                        If, however, as in the present case, the applicant is relying solely upon
                     the statutory grounds, it is not necessary to make the application by way
                     of an application for judicial review. The position is similar to that
                     which exists where there is a statutory right to apply to quash a decision
                     of a Minister or government department, as, for example, under the
                     Town and Country Planning Act 1971; on such an application there is
                     no need to obtain leave and, equally, there is no need to obtain leave for
                     an application to quash an inquisition which is solely made on the
                     statutory grounds and not by way of an application for judicial review.
                     However, in the case of an application under the Coroners Act 1887, it
                     is not possible to apply by notice of motion under O. 94 because the
                     jurisdiction under that Order is confined to the actions of a Minister or
                     government department. Instead, the appropriate procedure is to apply
                     under O. 5 r. 3 by originating summons. A short report in The Times of
                     May 15, 1982 includes a passage from a judgm ent of Comyn, J., which
                     states;

                        “There was a suggestion in textbooks that under the Coroners Act
                         1887, where the fiat of the Attorney-General had been given, there
                        was no need to seek the leave of the court. His Lordship found that
                        the fiat did not dispense of seeking the leave of the court.”

                        However, that was a case where there were applications under both
                     the com m on law and statutory powers and so in that case leave was
                     required. The report is also misleading insofar as it suggests there is a
                     distinction between the position at com m on law and on judicial review,
                     and, therefore, there are three procedures for reviewing inquests.
                     Historically, the procedure was by an application for the writ of
                     certiorari (see e.g. R. v. Directors o f Great Western Railway (1888) 20
                     Q.B.D. 410 and R. v. Clerk o f the O xford Circuit [\897] 1 Q.B. 370) and
                     that is why the com m on law power is now exercised on an application
                     for judicial review. There is no separate common law procedure. As in
                     the majority of cases, if there is a right to relief the statutory powers will
                     apply, if an application for judicial review is made the court will require
                     an explanation as to why, if this is the case, no application for the fiat of
                     the Attorney-General has been made.
                       Although proceeding by originating summons would be technically
                     correct and leave would not then be required, even where it is
150                  J i s r u K OK I ' UK I’ KACK R K P O R I S                           485




  anticipated that there is no need to rely on the court’s powers under             Re: Philip Charles

  must be fulfilled.                                                                     Woolf, L.J.
     Having dealt with the procedural problem, I turn to the grounds of
  the present application. These are that, since the inquest on May 30,
   1985 was held into the death of Philip Charles Rapier, new evidence has                   i
  come to light which means that it is necessary or desirable in the
  interests of justice that the inquisition of that inquest be quashed and
  that another inquest be held at which the jury is able to consider the
  additional evidence.

  The Facts
     At the time of his death Philip Charles Rapier was 19 years of age and
  was in solitary confinement in a punishment cell in the Young Offenders
  Wing of Swansea Prison. He was undergoing punishment for breach
  of Prison Rules, namely abusing a prison officer, and he was found dead
  in his cell at about 9.00 p.m., hanging by the neck trom a sheet which
  was tied to a bar in the cell window.
     At the inquest, which was held on May 30, 1985 at Gowerton, near
  Swansea, the jury, after hearing the sworn evidence and listening to the
  directions given by the applicant concerning the finding or rejecting of a
  verdict of suicide, returned an open verdict.
     The evidence before the jury consisted of medical evidence which
  indicated that the deceased had no relevant medical history, evidence of
  the pathologist that he was satisfied that no third party had any hand in
  the deceased’s death and the cause of death was hanging, and evidence
  from a number of prison officers who had seen the deceased during the
  course of the day of his death. Their evidence was to the effect that the
  deceased was behaving perfectly normally, he had no suicidal tendencies
  but he had declined exercise on that particular day. In particular, his
  personal officer indicated that he had seen the deceased after dinner on
  the day in question who had told him that he would be out of
  punishm ent next day and that he would be out of the prison in six
  weeks. The officer says he told the deceased, “ Keep your nose clean now
  and you will be out in six weeks’ time” and he said, “ I’ll try, sir”.
     Mr. Bamber, the deputy governor of the prison, attended at the
  inquest but, ap art from asking a question, he apparently played no part
  in the proceedings and did not give evidence.
     Apparently, the deceased’s inquest was the third inquest which had
  taken place in respect of death at Swansea Prison where an open verdict
  had been returned and this was a matter which troubled certain prison
  officers.
     On the day after the inquest, two of the officers were discussing this
  matter, and during discussion it was mentioned by one of the officers
  that there had been an investigation between the date of the deceased’s
  death and the inquest into possible solvent sniffing by the deceased and
  another inmate. The other officer, who previously was unaware of this
  investigation, because he felt the report of the investigation might be

                        The result of the m atter being very properly raised in this way was
                     that there was an investigation carried out on behalf of the Director of
    Woolf, I..J.     Public Prosecutions. O n September 12, 1985 the Principal Assistant
                     D irector of Public Prosecutions wrote to the Chief Constable of the
                     S outh Wales Constabulary, stating:
       i
                       “ Although 1 am of the opinion that Bamber (that is the deputy
                       governor who was then acting governor). Cook (the assistant governor)
                       and Lewis (the governor) made a grave error of judgm ent in not
                       disclosing the possibility of solvent abuse by Philip Charles Rapier 1
                       do not consider that any criminal offence is disclosed against the
                       three men.
                          1 agree that the file of evidence should be submitted to Her
       ii              Majesty’s Coroner for the City of Swansea.”

                       It is right that 1 should interpose here that Mr. Bamber had in fact
                     been responsible for reporting the m atter to higher authority after the
                     inquest when the question of the report was raised.
                       Having seen the file of evidence which was submitted to him, the
                     applicant, the coroner, says in his affidavit:

       iii              “7. Whilst much of the evidence discovered by the police is
                        conflicting and some of it may well be untrue, it is my belief that if
                        the jury had had this evidence before them at the inquest they might
                        have agreed upon a different verdict from that expressed by them at
                        the conclusion of the inquest.
                           8. Furtherm ore, if the jury had had this evidence before it, it might
                        have felt able to have made comments on the conditions giving rise
                        to the cause of death, for example, that the deceased was depressed
       iv               or out of control due to drug taking.
                          9. 1 respectfully submit that it is desirable that a jury have a full
                        view of the evidence, particularly in a case like the present where
                        there are grounds for believing that measures could be taken which
                        would help to prevent or render less likely the recurrence of such
                        deaths. In such cases juries sometimes exercise their rights through
                        the coroner to make recommendations.”

       v                It is preferable that 1 do not go into the evidence which was submitted
                     after the inquest of the coroner in any more detail than is absolutely
                     necessary. However, in order to understand the decision of the court, it
                     is necessary to say a little more about this evidence.
                        The evidence indicated that trichloroethane, which is a colourless
                     volatile liquid which is marketed as Genclean and is widely used as a
                     dry-cleaning and correcting fluid and as a degreasing agent, was
                     available to inmates at the prison who worked in a particular workshop
                     for getting marks off clothing. The fluid was kept locked but, according
                     to certain of the witnesses, a prisoner called Butcher, who was friends
                     with the deceased, did keep some in a tobacco tin, and what Butcher

  says is that, on the night in question, by the use of a line he swung the      Re: Philip Charles
  tin containing the fluid from his cell to the cell of the deceased, and when   Rapier (Deceased)
  the tin was returned it had been emptied. This happened approxim ately
                                                                                  Queer’s Bench
  half an hour to just under three-quarters of an hour before the deceased
                                                                                    Division
  was found dead. There was also evidence that inmates, including
  Butcher and the deceased, used to sniff this solvent. Butcher indicated            Woolf, L J.
  that he would have terrible headaches after inhaling and once or twice
  felt so depressed that he thought about committing suicide, and he said
  the deceased had also mentioned after inhaling that he felt like
  committing suicide.
     A Senior Scientific Officer of the Home Office Forensic Science
  Laboratory indicates that the solvent is rapidly absorbed from the lungs
  and that the toxic effects of the com pound include depression of the
  central nervous system resulting, in high concentrations, in anaesthesia
  and death from respiratory depression. The pathologist gave evidence at
  the inquest that the symptoms of inhalation usually develop In a
  progressing sequence:

      “After an initial feeling of euphoria, excitation or pleasant
      exhilaration, there is enjoyment of the drowsiness and dreamlike state
      which follows. Visual and auditory hallucinations can occur and
      these may be pleasant or terrifying. A few deep breaths produces an
      effect which gradually dissipates over 30 to 45 minutes.”

     While he also indicates that sudden death can occur, 1 would
  emphasize that there is no question here of the solvent directly causing
  death.
     1 have said enough with regard to this evidence to indicate that, if it
  had been available to the coroner prior to the inquest, it would
  inevitably have been called before the jury at the inquest. In support of
  his contentions that there should now be a fresh inquest at which this
  evidence should be before the jury, Mr. Simon submits that the evidence
  could have a material effect on the verdict of the jury. Mr. Sankey,
  however, submits it would be wrong to have a further inquest because
  the additional evidence could not affect the verdict since it makes it
  more likely, not less likely, that a jury would bring in the same open
  verdict. Mr. Simon and Mr. Sankey also differ in their submissions as to
  whether there would be any purpose in a fresh inquest considering the
  further evidence apart from the possibility of a different verdict.


  The Law
    In order to evaluate these submissions, it is necessary to consider
  further the statutory provisions relating to inquests.
    Section 3(1) of the 1887 Act requires a coroner to hold an inquest
  where

      “ there is reasonable cause to suspect that such person has died either
      a violent or an unnatural death, or has died a sudden death of which
      the cause is unknow n, or that such person has died in prison, or in
      such place or under such circumstances as to require an in q u e s t. .

Re: Philip Charles
                        It is to be noted that solely in the case of deaths in prison there is a
Rapier (Deceased)
                     m andatory requirement to hold an inquest irrespective of the
 Queen's Bench       circumstances of the death. This appears to be a statutory recognition
   Division          that, because of the nature of prison institutions, there is a special need
                     for an independent investigation into deaths which occur within their
   Woolf, L.J.       walls. The same policy can be identified in the 1926 Act. Section 13(1)
                     gives the coroner a discretion to dispense with a jury but s. 13(2)(b)
                     requires that, where the death occurred in prison or in such a place or in
       i             such circumstances as require an inquest under any Act other than the
                     Coroners Act 1887, the coroner is required to summon a jury.                        j
                        Section 4(1) of the 1887 Act requires the coroner to examine on oath             j
                     all persons who tender their evidence and “all persons having knowledge
                     of the facts who he thinks it expedient to examine”, so to a large extent
                     what witnesses are called is a matter for the coroner’s discretion.
                        Section 4(3) provides that, after hearing the evidence, the jury shall
                     give their verdict and certify it by an inquisition in writing setting forth,
       ii            so far as such particulars have been proved to them, who the deceased
                     was and how and where and when the deceased came to his death.
                        The Coroners’ Rules require that every inquest shall be held in public
                     (r. 17).
                        Rule 36 provides:

                        “(1) The proceedings and evidence at an inquest shall be directed
                        solely to ascertain the following matters, namely —
       iii              (a) who the deceased was;
                        (b) how, when and where the deceased came by his death;
                        (c) the particulars for the time being required by the Registratioh
                             Acts to be registered concerning the death.
                         (2) Neither the coroner nor the jury shall express any opinion on
                             any other matters.”

                        Rule 42 makes it clear that verdicts of a jury should not appear to
       iv            determine any question of criminal liability of a named person or civil
                     liability.                                                                          |
                        Rules 36 and 42 are therefore designed to limit the scope of the                 j
                     inquest and to prevent the previous practice of juries adding far-                  j
                     reaching riders. The coroner does, however, retain the right to make a              j
                     report and this is dealt with in r. 43, which provides:                             !
                                                                                                         j
                        “ A coroner who believes that action should be taken to prevent the              j
       v                recurrence of fatalities similar to that in respect of which the inquest             i
                        is being held may announce at the inquest that he is reporting the

                     there were to be a new inquest, the jury’s and the coroner’s inquiries
                     would be confined to ascertaining whether the deceased killed himselt,
                     whether he died as a result of an accident or misadventure or whether,
                     again, there should be an open verdict. An open verdict would only be

     The question of what verdicts are open to the jury is important

  because Mr. Simon rightly drew the court’s attention to a note to s. 6 of
                                                                                       Division
  the 1887 Act which appears in Halsbury's Statutes, 4th edition, Vol. 11,
  at p. 359. The note reads:                                                           Woolf, L.J.

      “ An inquisition will not be quashed unless it is shown that there
      would probably be a different verdict if a new inquest were held.”                     i

     In support of the note there is a reference to Re: Davis (deceased)
   [1968] 1 Q.B. 72 and R. v. C ardiff Coroner, ex parte Thomas (1970) 134
  J.P. 673; f 19701 1 W.L.R. 1475.
     If this is a correct statement of general principle, then that could be
  crucial to the outcome of this application because Mr. Simon cannot go
  so far as to submit that the new evidence which is now available makes it
  probable that a different verdict would be reached.                                       ii
     I am bound to say that, before considering the authorities, my initial
  reaction was one of surprise in reading the note since it would seem to
  involve a much more restrictive approach than that which is contained
  in s. 6 of the 1887 Act and s. 19 of the 1926 Act, both of which set out
 the critical statutory requirement as being that it should be necessary or
 desirable in the interests of justice that another inquest should be held.
     Indeed, until pressed by the court, Mr. Sankey was not inclined to put
 the test as high as this. He opened his submissions by saying the test is                 iii
 whether the new facts and evidence would support a different verdict.
 On that basis, it would be sufficient if it was possible there could be a
 different verdict. This appears to be a much more satisfactory approach
 because, in many cases, and I would include this case as an example, it
 will be quite impossible to say what will be the effect of the new
 evidence. The effect which it will have will only be known after the
 witnesses have given their evidence and have been questioned. They may
                                                                                            iv
 be believed or they may not be believed. However, whatever the
 outcome, it still may be in the interests of justice that their evidence
 should be explored in public before a jury.
     With regard to the general approach to this jurisdiction, considerable
  help is provided by the judgment of the court by Talbot, J., in R. v.
 Divine, ex parte Walton (1930) 94 J.P. 129; [1930] 2 K.B. 29. In his
 judgment, Talbot, J., having referred to the fact that the desire of the
 coroner that there should be a new inquest, had weighed with the court,
                                                                                             v
 went on to refer to s. 6( 1) and then said:

      “These are very wide words, and their generality is declared and
      guarded by the Coroners (Amendment) Act 1926, s. 19. Moreover
      the fact that the powers conferred by the section can be exercised
      only upon an application authorized by the Attorney-General
      indicates that they are powers beyond those which the court already
      had. The same appears from s. 35 of the Act. The words ‘necessary or
      desirable in the interests of justice’ are the critical words. The court is
      not to attend to mere informalities, nor to criticize minutely the
      summing-up, or the nature of the evidence or of the procedure. But if
Re: Philip Charles      the inquest has been so conducted, or the circumstances attending it
Rapier (Deceased)       are such that there is real risk that justice has not been done, a real
                        impairment of the security which right procedure provides that
 Queen's Bench
   Division             justice is done and is seen to be done, the court ought not to allow the
                        inquisition to stand.”
    Woolf, L.J.
                       Turning next to the case Re: Davis, it is clear that the headnote
                     supports the note in Vol. 11 of Halsbury. It is also clear that the
      i              headnote reflects the judgm ents of Sellers, L.J. and Russell, L.J. in that
                     case. However, the case was one where there had already been a verdict
                     of suicide and the court was being asked to quash the verdict on the
                     basis of evidence from another doctor in addition to the doctors who
                     had already given evidence in the case. As Sellers, L.J. said at p. 82:

                        “The only argument ultimately relied on was that the state of the
                        deceased’s mental health was insufficiently investigated and that it
       ii               should at least have been supplemented by the evidence of Dr
                        Raeside, who had attended Mrs. Davis generally since 1961 and hay
                        seen her in hospital on several occasions after the birth of the child,
                        and as recently as July 21.”

                       Having said that. Sellers, L.J. went on to say:

                       “The only ground on which the court could interfere in he
      iii              circumstances of this case would be if it was of opinion that the
                       verdict of suicide would probably be replaced by a different verdict
                       if a new inquest were to be held.”

                       This he considered on the evidence would not be the case. Russell,
                     L.J. took the same view. In adopting that approach, the court was
                     acting on the submissions of distinguished counsel appearing r ;i &?half
                     of the coroner but, as far as one can tell from the report, the precise
      iv             standard to be adopted was not in dispute. Furthermore, in that case
                     unlike the present case, there was no difficulty involved in assessing the
                     quality of the evidence. This is significant because, in the later case of Ex
                     parte Thom as referred to in the note in Halsbury, the court appears to
                     have taken a different view from that in Re: Davis.
                        E x parte Thom as also concerned an inquest where there had been a
                     verdict of suicide. The application to quash the inquisition was opposed
                     on behalf of the coroner, who sought to contend that, even if the
      v              evidence before the inquest did not justify a verdict of suicide, the fresh
                     evidence which would mean that if there was a further inquest the
                     verdict would still be one of suicide. Lord Parker, C.J., giving a
                     judgment with which the other members of the court agreed, said:

                        “ 1 cannot accept that that is the right approach -n ths matter. ir<
                        D avis’s case there is no doubt that the court said th. thus conn

      in th a t case said was: if we accept all that the doctor says in his          Re: Philip Charles
      statement on affidavit, that would not enable the coroner to come to           Rapier (Deceased)

      adduce is evidence not to be adduced by the applicant but, as it were,          Queen’s Bench
                                                                                        Division
      to be called by the coroner in rebuttal of the widow’s statements. No
      one can tell whether the witnesses will give the same evidence as                  Woolf, LJ .
      appears on their affidavits. They may not go so far, they may go
      further. Those affidavits take the form largely of evidence from
      members of the deceased’s family to the effect that he was in pain,                     i
      that he was depressed, that he was having difficulties at home and
      that he was extremely worried and depressed at the fact that his wife
      went out to work and was, as he thought, neglecting the children.
            This c o u rt has been asked to rule th a t such evidence w ould
       n o t affect th e m a tte r at all. It is said th a t th a t w ould only be
       evidence of a background o f b a d health and o f dom estic diffi­
       cu lty , and w o u ld n o t be sufficient to evince any suicidal a t­
       te m p t. T h a t may well be so, b u t un til the witnesses have given               ii
       their evidence, and it is seen h o w far they go in th a t evidence, it
       seems to me quite impossible for this co u rt to rule in th a t
       m a tte r at all. I t follows, in m y ju d g m en t, th a t an order of
       certiorari should go on to quash this inquest, and th a t there
       m u st be an order for a fresh inquest w hich, to save the coroner
       em barrassm ent, h ad b etter be heard by a d ifferent co ro n e r.”
     In relation to a case such as the one at present under consideration,                   iii
  this appears to me to be the correct approach. I would also adopt the
  approach which Lord Parker, C.J. adopted with regard to the Davis
  case. This means that the note in H alsbury sets out a general test for a
  new inquest which is too stringent.
      Here, as a result of the report which has been sent to the coroner, a
  whole new area for inquiry, which was never investigated at the inquest,
  has been disclosed. It is not possible to say with any degree of
  confidence what will be the result of the new evidence being examined                      iv
  before a coroner and a jury but, contrary to Mr. Sankey’s submission, I
  consider that it would be possible for the jury to bring in a verdict of
  suicide as a result of the additional evidence. It is true, as Mr. Sankey
  contends, that the jury might take the view that the new evidence makes
  the position even more uncertain. On the other hand, the jury could take
  the view, if they are satisfied that the deceased was under the influence
  of the solvent that this caused him to become suicidal when he would
   not otherwise have reacted in this way. Certainly it could provide an                       v
  explanation as to why he should commit suicide notwithstanding the
   fact that the punishment was coming to an end and he was shortly to be
   released from prison.
      This case is very different from the Davis case. Here, it certainly would
    not appear that justice has been done if there were not a new inquest.
   The coroner responsible for the previous inquest is of this view and it
    must be remembered the inquest was dealing with a death in prison
   which has to be the subject m atter of an inquest even if there is nothing
    untoward in the circumstances of the death. While agreeing with Mr.
    Sankey that the fact that new evidence of matters of public interest is
    discovered is not in itself sufficient to justify a new inquest, looking at

    Woolf, L J.
  Simon Brown, J.
                        Mr. Justice Simon Brown: I agree. As my Lord has pointed out, when
                     considering whether or not to quash an inquisition and order a fresh
       i             inquest in the light of some complaint as to the conduct of the inquest or
                     the discovery of new evidence, the legislation requires in every instance
                     that the court should ask itself: Are we satisfied that such a course is
                     “necessary or desirable in the interests of justice”? That is the language
                     both of s. 6(1) of the Coroners Act 1887 and of s. 19 of the Coroners
                     (Amendment) Act 1926.
                        The important point of general application raised on this motion
                     concerns the extent to which the Court of Appeal’s decision in Re: Davis
       ii            ('De«’<K«0[1968] 1 Q.B. 72 governs the court’s approach to the exercise
                     of this statutory power. The footnote to s. 6 contained in the 4th edn. of
                     H alsbury’s Statutes asserts baldly:

                        “ An inquisition will not be quashed unless it is shown that there
                        would probably be a different verdict if a new inquest were held.”

                        Reference is made to Re: Davis and R. v. C ardiff Coroner, ex parte
       ili           T hom as( 1970) 134 J.P. 673; [1970] 1 W.L.R. 1475. t o what extent is that
                     an accurate statement of the law?
                        In my judgment, it is quite impossible to suppose that the Court of
                     Appeal in Re: Davis were intending to lay down any such general
                     principle, whether in all s. 6 cases or only in “new facts or evidence”
                     cases expressly provided for by s. 19. Such principle would clearly
                     impose a significant restriction upon the apparent width of the
                     discretion conferred by the governing provision, a restriction which I
       iv            would regard as impermissible. Moreover, it postulates that the only
                     purpose ever served by holding an inquest is that the correct verdict is
                     arrived at, a premise which I cannot accept. True, the scope of what a
                     coroner’s inquisition may achieve by way of a formal result has
                     gradually been whittled down over the years. Initially, it lost its
                     importance in the administration of the criminal law; then the 1953 Rules
                     provided that “no verdict shall be framed such a way as to determine
                     any question of (a) criminal liability on the part of a named person, or
                     (b) civil liability”; most recently the coroner’s and jury's right to make
                     recommendations was removed by r. 36 of the 1984 Rules. Indeed, all
                     that remains, bar the verdict, is the coroner’s limited power under r. 43.
                     But, as my Lord has pointed out, there are nevertheless certain cases —
                     of which the most pertinent is that the deceased died in prison — which
                     by s. 3(1) of the 1887 Act require that an inquest be held (and indeed by
                     s. 13(2)(b) of the 1926 Act require that it be held before a jury) even
                     though the cause of death may be clear beyond a peradventure and
                     where the verdict could not conceivably be in doubt. In continuing to
                     require coroners to summon a jury to hold a formal inquest in public in
                     such circumstances, Parliament must be thought to attach some real

   value to the inquest proceedings. If then it is found that such                   Re: Philip Charles
    proceedings were wholly deficient, whether by reason of irregularity or          Rapier (Deceased)
    because of the subsequent discovery of im portant evidence, it seems to
    me quite wrong to suppose that the courts are precluded by the decision           Queen's Bench

   in Re: Davis fromrequiring a new inquest to be held in the interests of
   justice.                                                                           Simon Brown, J.
        Although, at first blush, the judgm ents in Re: Davis may beth o u gh t to
    suggest that the probability of a fresh inquest producing a different
                                                                                               i
    verdict is a pre-condition to any successful s. 6 application, or at least to
    any which are brought on the ground of insufficient inquiry of fresh
    evidence — and certainly the language of probability is to be found
    repeatedly in the judgm ents which in turn mirror the clear submission of
    counsel then instructed for the coroner — I have concluded that the case
    is not to be regarded as authority for any such general principle.
       In the first place, it is noteworthy that, in the leading judgm ent of the
    Court of Appeal, Sellers, L.J. expressly arrived at his conclusion “in the
                                                                                              ii
    circumstances of this case” and does not seek to place the judgm ent on
    any more general basis. Secondly, it must be appreciated that the
   circumstances o f that case were indeed somewhat singular, not least in
    that the Court of Appeal then had before it all the relevant evidence, i.e.
    all that had been available at the original inquest and all that the
    applicant desired to adduce at a further inquest. This evidence, coming
    as all of it did from professional medical witnesses, was clear and
    detailed and could not be thought liable to change. In the result, the                   iii
   C ourt o f Appeal were themselves as well able as the coroner (who in
   that case was not sitting with a jury) to evaluate this evidence and arrive
   at a conclusion upon it.
       I am confirmed in that understanding of the decision in Davis by
   reference to the subsequent decision of this court in ex parte Thomas. In
   that case Lord Parker, C.J. commented on Davis as follows:
       “ In the case of Re: Davis (deed), to which I have already referred,
       there is no dou b t that the court said that this court would only quash              iv
       the inquisition and order a fresh inquest if it were probable that there
       would be a different verdict at the new inquest. In Re: Davis (deed),
       the applicant sought to adduce the evidence of a doctor, and what
       the court said was: ‘If we accept all that the doctor says in his
       affidavit, that would not enable the coroner to come to any different
       conclusion’.”
     The use of the phrase “not enable” strongly suggests that the proposed                    v
   new evidence would have failed the test not merely of probably
   producing a different verdict but also of possibly producing a change.
   Lord Parker then pointed out that in Thomas, in contrast to Davis:

       “No one can tell whether the witnesses will give the same evidence as
       appears on their affidavits. They may not go so far, they may go
       further . . . This court has been asked to rule that such evidence
       would not affect the m atter at a l l . . . T hat may well be so, but until
       the witnesses have given their evidence( and it is seen how far they go
       in that evidence, it seems to me quite impossible for this court to rule
       in the matter at all.”

Re: Philip Charles      In ex parte Thomas, of course, the verdict of suicide was in any event
Rapier (Deceased)    open to challenge on the ground that the coroner had wrongly
                     approached the matter; there the new evidence was being invoked by the
 Queen’s Bench
                     coroner in an attem pt to have that verdict and eliminate the need for a
   Division
                     fresh inquest. The decision nevertheless seems to me to indicate clearly,
Simon Brown, J.      and to my mind with manifest good sense, that, in many cases, it will be
                     quite impossible for the reviewing court, unlike the Court of Appeal in
                     Davis, to form any sensible view upon whether the new evidence creates
      i              a probability or only a possibility that a different verdict would be
                     arrived at upon a fresh inquisition. T h at would generally depend upon
                     the precise evidence eventually given and the credibility of the witnesses
                     w ho give it, not matters generally capable of final evaluation at the
                     stage of the s. 6 application. T o my mind, that is the position on the
                     instant application. This is not to say, however, that it will not generally
                     be of the first importance to consider so far as possible the likelihood or
                     otherwise of a fresh inquest arriving at a different verdict. T hat will
      ii             always be relevant, often critical and sometimes wholly decisive, not
                     least in “new facts o r evidence” cases.
                        So far as this case is concerned, it seems to me that there are
                     compelling grounds for ordering a fresh inquest. In the first place, the
                     coroner himself believes it to be necessary and has indeed initiated the
                     application. Secondly, the legislation requires there to be an inquest in
                     all cases of death in prison, and surely it should be a full and proper
                     inquest with all material matters placed before the jury. Thirdly, in my
      iii            judgm ent, it may very well be that the additional evidence here could
                     produce a different verdict; there is, to my mind, at least a real
                     possibility of this. M ore than that one cannot say on the basis of the
                     material before this court. T hat seems to me a sufficient basis, not least
                     when coupled with the other two considerations, for allowing this
                     application.

I think,        t h a t t h i s is p r o b a b l y w h a t     has happened.           Thus,     said

       We have heard s ub missions upon the coroner's decision

to record as the v er d i c t m e r e l y the w ords                   "unlawful killing".

I can u n d e r s t a n d his a n x i e t y to r e c o r d a v e r d i c t w h i c h did

n o t o f f e n d a g a i n s t R u l e 42.        Coroners quite often,                for very

good reason,            have to r e f r a i n f ro m p u t t i n g u po n the i n q u i s i t i o n

all the foreman says whe n a n n o u n c i n g the                    jury's conclusion.

B y r u l e h e is p r e v e n t e d f r o m d o i n g t h a t .         He has to e l i m i ­

n a t e i r r e l e v a n t m a t t e r a nd o n l y r e c o r d w h a t his g o o d s en s e

and e x p e r i e n c e leads him to c o n c l u d e             is t h e f o r m a l v e r d i c t ,

b e i n g o n e w h i c h t h e j u r y is e n t i t l e d in l a w t o f i n d .

        Here,     however,          I r e g r e t to say that the c o r o n e r ' s          judg­

m e n t w as at f ault.              W h i c h e v e r v e r s i o n of w h a t the f o r e m a n

s ai d be right,             it is c l e a r f r o m a l l o f t h e m t h a t t h e j u r y

f ou nd n e g l e c t at no time b e f o r e M i k k e l s o n         was overpowered.

By that time,            t h e f i g h t i n v o l v i n g t he u se of t h e t r u n c h e o n

during arrest was over and the arrest effective.                                       It is

e qu a l l y c lear that the             jury wer e a t t r i b u t i n g unlawful k il ling

to no o t h e r c a u s e than n e g l e c t .            It is t h e j u r y ' s f u n c t i o n

r esponsibility or civil                  liability upon anyone.                   Here,     the

cause found,            as    I have previously indicated,                   included the

a dditional wor ds spoken by the foreman,                           which were,          in m y

opinion,       a n e s s e n t i a l p a r t of a c l e a r l y e x p r e s s e d v e r d i c t a n d

ought to have been r e c or de d on the inquisition.                                 The i mpli­

cation placed upon them by the coroner,                             a s e x p r e s s e d in h i s

a f f i d a v i t is,     I think, misguided.

r              Mr. Alun Jones submitted strenuously that the verdict as recorded

         offended against Rule 42 for it was framed, he says, so as to place civil

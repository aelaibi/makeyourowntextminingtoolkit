#I INITIALLY WENT TO THE WRONG TURNSTILES (TERRACE) BUT EVENTUALLY WENT THROUGH
IN QUEUES INTO THE WEST STAND TERRACING WHERE POLICE WERE STANDING IN BETWEEN
   •4
THE TURNSTILES.

I WENT Uf? THE STAIRCASE TO THE RIGHT OF THE TUNNEL INTO WEST STAND.

I WENT TO THE TOILET AND LOOKED OUT OF WINDOW TO THE TURNSTILE AREA WHERE I

SAW FANS RUNNING THROUGH THE CONCOURSE INTO THE TUNNEL BELOW ME.

THE FANS WERE OBVIOUSLY ANXIOUS TO GET INTO THE GROUND.          THE TIME WAS ABOUT

2..50 PM (1450 HRS).

I WENT BACK DOWN THE STAIRCASE TO LOOK FOR MY FRIEND AND STOOD ON THE TERRACE

TURNSTILES TO LOOK FOR HIM.

THERE WAS NO POLICE PRESENCE OUTSIDE THE TURNSTILES, THEY WERE ON THE INSIDE.

I ^ O O K E D ACROSS AND SAW ONE MOUNTED OFFICER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CRUSH.

I SAW ONE POLICEMAN (FLAT CAP) WITH A PERSONAL RADIO STANDING ON THE

TURNS’! TLFS .                                                          ^

I SAW THE RIGHT HAND CONCERTINA GAT£/QPEN£D BY A POLICE O F F I C E R E D STEWARDS
            ----------------------------
AND THEN ABOUT 5 MINUTES LATER t y PM )     (1500 HRS) SAW LEFT HAND GATE OPENED.

IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU tflSH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

•1. I THINK THE FA SHOULff HAVE ALLOCATED THE OTHER END OF THE GROUND TO

L ^ R P O O L FANS (GRE^AT^R SUPPORT)

2. SHOULD HAVE HAD MORE POLICE PRESENCE OUTSIDE TURNSTILES TO FORM QUEUES,

POLICE INSIDE TURNSTILES WERE DOING NOTHING.

3. NO ANNOUNCEMENTS       [0 IHE CROWD OUiSlDt   iHE. GROUND TO DELAY   THE MATCH.

4. THE TURNSTILES ARE INADEQUATE TO COPE WITH THE LARGE CROWD EXPECTED.

5. THE POLICE APPEARED JO BE DOING NOTHING AFTER THE TRAGEDY.               IT WAS THE

FANS WHO WERE ORGAN INsLPNG THE RESCUE.     TOTAL LACK OF ORGAN I.SAT IQw WITHIN THE

POLICE.

6. LAST YEAR THERE WAS A FILTERING SYSTEM BEFORE THE TURNSTILE AREA,

 THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE - ALSO THE ENTRANCE TO THE TUNNEL SHOULD HAVE BEEN

 MANNED BY POLICE OR STEWARDS.

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 THERE WAS A LACK OF COMMUNICATION ADVISING THE FANS WHAT WAS GOING ON.             WHEN

 DALGLIESH SPOKE 'TT^FANS RESPONDED MORE THAN TO ANYONE ELSE AND I FEEL THAT

 THE FORREST SUPPORTERS W^ULD HAVE RESPONDED TO BRIAN CLOUGH.

 WE^T TO SAME MATCH LAST VEAly- feUT THAT WAS WELL ORGANISED - POLICE WERE

 MAKING SURE LAST YEAR THAT ONLY THE TICKET HOLDERS GOT TO THE GROUND - IF YOU

 COULDN'T PRODUCE A TICKET, YOU WERE SENT AWAY.

 I SUGGEST THAT WHERE CLUBS HAVE A LARGE FOLLOWING THEY SHOULD ALWAYS BE

 ALLOCATED THE LARGEST AREA.     IF THAT HAD BEEN DONE ON THIS OCCASION THE

 DISASiER WOULD NOT HAVE OCCURRED.

IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

NOT ENOUGH    lICKETb WERE ALLOCATED TO THE LIVERPOOL FANS,      IN FAC i , NOT EVEN A

THE SEASON TICKET HOLDERS WERE ALLOCATED A TICKET.         IT WASN’T UNTIL THE FRID

BEFORE    iHE GAME THAT IT WAS ANNOUNCED   THAT IF YOU DID HAVE A SEASON     TICKET Y

COULD GET A GROUND TICKET,    IT WAS TOO   LATE
                                           f    BY THEN BECAUSE FOR MOST     PEOPLE I

TAKES A FEW DAYS TO ARRANGE TRANSPORT      TO THE GROUND.

I FEEL THAT THE YORKSHIRE PEOPLE WERE      TOO HARSH IN THERE TREATMENT OF THE

FANS,    IT SEEMS THAT IN GENERAL THEY HAVE A BAD ATTITUDE TOWARDS SUPPORTERS.

iJftxi THE CROWDS WERE BUILDING UP SO LATE BEFORE THE KICK-OFF THE POLICE

OUTSIDE SHOULD HAVE CONTACTED THE GROUND AND MADE ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE KICK

OFF TO BE DELAYED,

IF THE FENCES DIVIDING THE PENS ON THE TERRACES HADN'T BEEN THERE THE FANS

WOULD HAVE SEEN ABLE TO SPREAD ALONG THE TERRACES.

I FEEL THAT    IHE GROUND WAS A POOR CHOICE OF VENUE,     I I HAD iO BE UNEQUAL IN

THE NUMBER OF TICKETS ALLOCATED, WHEREAS IF IT WAS HELD AT MANCHESTER THE

TICKET ALLOCATION WOULD HAVE BEEN EQUAL.

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?                                                   C O H N j

 THERE NAS A SLOW RESPONSE BY THE POLICE,                  BUT THEY SEEMED     TO BE UNAWARE ABOUT

 EXACTLY WHAT WAS HAPPENING.    I THINK THEY EXPECTED SOME SORT                   OF TROUBLE

 BECAUSE FANS WERE CLIMBING OVER THE F E N C E S .

 THERE WAS A LOT OF POLICE ACROSS THE CENTRE OF THE PITCH                      WHICH WAS A WASTE

 BECAUSE THEY COULD HAVE BEEN HELPING THE INJURED FANS.

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBERVATJONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED ?

AFTER THE HATCH WAS STOPPED'

THERE WAS A -SLOW RESPONSE
                         ^ 9* THE POLICE, BUT THEY SEEMED        TO BE UNAWARE ABOUT

EXACTLY WHAT WAS HAPPENING.      I THINK THEY EXPECTED SOME SORT   OF TROUBLE

BECAUSE FANS WERE CLIMBING OVER THE FENCrES.

THERE WAS A LOT OF POLICE ACROSS THE/CENTRE OF THE PITCH WHICH        WAS A WASTE

BECAUSE THEY COULD HAVE BEEN HELPING THE INJURED FANS.

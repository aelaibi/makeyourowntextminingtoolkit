R -V- DPP ex parte BERNARD MURRAY
CASE NO: C04/0934/99
JUDGEMENT: 31 MARCH 1999

I write following my telephone conversation with you earlier today. I understand that following the
outcome of the hearing on 31 March 1999 the Court made an Order as to judgement and costs.
However, upon searching our files, we have been unable to locate this Order, nor recall any Order
being actually sent to us.

I write therefore to enquire whether an Order was made by the Court in respect to costs payable by
Bernard D Murray and request whether if an Order was made, that a copy be forwarded to us.

Yo.urs sincerely

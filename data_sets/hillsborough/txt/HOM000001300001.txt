           My name      is Mark          Ian H U G H E S    and    I am a single man                  living w ith my

           parents      at    the above         address.

           I am a Liv e r p o o l         sup p o r t e r   and about 2 weeks               ago       I p u rchased a ticket

           from a fr i e n d and            paid £ 3 0 * 0 0 for         it.      This     was    for the                    standing                 are a

           in L e p pings       Lane.         I do have       the    ticket         stub but f o llowing                               all       the

           in my     car an Au s t i n Rover,                            ,     with    d   other i a d s ,a



           and a third          chap w h o s e       name    I don't         know,    his    nickname                      is _____

           didn't        have a ticket             for the match.              He felt       he would easily get                                      a

were a few Forest                     s upporters           aro u n d but the y were             fine.        We    got    to

were      to keep a way from the                       entrance.            At the t u rnstiles             officers            were

t rouble              finding my entry             point.          I ’d        split up         from the          other         three

outside               the     turnstiles,        they were           going       to     have a look around for                   a

ticket.                There were a lot               of     people       outside       by the m a i n gates,             w hich

were      all          open,     s h o uting     for any          spare tickets          or swops.             Police were

t elling              them to move          on     if they        didnt have a ticket.                 1      q u e q u e d up at

see any other gates                      open.         The mai n gates                that were open are             the

 qates        that          separate     the       ground from the               street.        I didn't          see any

 other       gates            being    opened whe n            I was      inside       the ground,         from

 c o n v e r s a t i o n w i t h a chap               inside      the ground,           he told me that              he'd

 played               up at    the    turnsti les           pret e n d i n g    his    ticket    had been stolen or

  lost and they                 let him       in.       I didn't          know who        he was.          A young       couple

  boy an d girl                said they had tickets                    for the Forest End,                 but    because

  they didn't want                    to be      in >*Jith the wrong              supporters           came up to the

  Whe n     I got            inside    I didnt         see any directions                 to any of the            pens,         I

  first           saw the tunnel,             which         I headed            down it was     a st e a d y walk          down,

in this          tunnel.          The       crowd going          t h r o u g h was     orderly,        there was            no

trouble.            Just       outside        the    tunnel        I s tood at the            back of        pen 3,         I was

At about           2.30        pm it was       three       quarters        full      in our         pen,    to the      left of

me,    the       side     stands        seemed        pretty empty,             I thought           it was       kept   empty

mavbe     for        segregation.              When       it got to about 2 . 5 0                pm it was         getting          a

bit    busy a n d         I thought           I'd     like      to gat across           to there           but    I d i d n ’t

have    the        faintest        how to get             across.         It was       really filling              up just

h»for s      3    ,0 Q   pm and        1 thought          I ’d never       see the         game      because       by then          I

couldnt          even see         the       pitch.        I hoped t h e y ’d shut             the     gates       and we rent

pi'sh, and           I just       went       down the        steps      with     the m o m e n t u m of everyone

pushing.             By about 2.55             pm I was           halfway down the steps                    from      the

front     to the           back*       E v e r y 5 seconds             I was    going      down another

step,        I thought           I wouldnt          be able        to get       out.       The      odd one seemed to

be getting               out    onto    the     pitch*           I was about         a y ard from the                 pitch and         I

 relax,          and take what               comes.        I'm only 5 ’7" and suffer                   from asthma               and        I

he   reached down to                pick me          up and he          put me across           his    shoulder       and

carried me               through    the     tunnel*             I was    still     conscious          although       very

dazed       and         I was    aware    of       lots    of    people       lying     in the       tunnel    and

st a nding at             the sides*           I     must have passed out a g a i n as                 he     carried       me

through            he    put me    down by           some open gates           at the side of the

turnstiles*                These    had been          closed as          I wa l k e d    into    the g r o u n d but

they were               open now to        let a m b u l a n c e s      in.     There were           some Police

barriers            up as well-           The O f f i c e r        leaned me up against                there a n d - t o l d

rnp to       put my head betw e e n my                    legs     and breathe.           I told him to go and

help others               as    I was OK*           Pe o p l e were      shouting at         the Police         to hurry

up and get there.                       A lot of       people were            being     r e s u scitated      cut    here*

saw one young                  lad about        16 years,          being      carried out and s o m e b o d y was

banging            on his       chest.         He was       bright yellow,            he didn't        have a top on,

just       jeans,         it was a y e l l o w         top that         I think his         dad was         holding     that

must       have         been his,         He wa s n ' t      breathing.          He     looked dead          to me.      He

 had ginger              hair,     he    looked       p l asticky        really*        I didn't       know him,         I

 began to walk ar o u n d the                       perimeter       of the grounds           behind the         stands.

 Thats       when        I discovered           how yo u         could get       into    pens       1 and 2,    there

    out side       the ground down some                 side      roads,      I even found myself                by a

    little        river.        Eventually        I e nded up in L a p p i n g s Lane.                  People     were

    t.haro must        have      been     about       20 odd fans           in this     house.        She was      real iv

    kind to us,         she      looked        after     us.      I rang ud my mom.             I was      hysterical          b:

    a bruise         on my face.           The man          and   lady of the          house were

    brilliant        to me.         The man spoke              to my mom,        he was    crying

    made    their way back              to my     car waiting           for me.         It was       3 hours      and they

    were won d e r i n g        if I was O.K.               The man brought            them back wit h him and

    they took         the    car    home.        I st a y e d at this man and w o m a n ’s house                       till

not b o t h e r e d to go.             I d o n ’t think alcohol                   played a factor           in the

trag e d y     I felt        that    there was         a lack of         i n f o r m a t i o n they       could have

sold the          tickets well          in advance           and a d v e r t i s e d      to    people     not    to

come without            a ticket.            And a g a i n      the a l l o c a t i o n of tickets              was

bad*        The y were        only three         quarters         full      while we were              packed*         There

was    lack       of s u p e r v i s i o n    inside      the    ground*           E v e ryone    just     made       for    the

tunnel        really*         I wish         there    had been        like        television,          pre-match

e n t ertainment,            better      pitch markings,              bigger        ground       for     this    kind of

match.          I didn't, qc to the                 semi-finals        last year,              but s p e aking        to

people who            did,    there were            barriers      some       100 yards          from the        ground to

filter        peoole        out who      h a d n ’t got tickets*                 I know at A n f i e l d        the Police

touts.          People were          travelling           down b e lieving            that      they w o u l d get

tickets*             On the motorway,               the   traffic was slow-moving,                       people were

h^nqing         out    of the windows               asking      for   tickets and              people walk i n g           along

 •=.ide of      cars asking           people        for any tickets*                 Outside       the    ground       people

were        shouting        for     tickets     it was        incre d i b l e      really.        The P o l i c e m a n who

 pulled me           out,     I would        like     to thank        but    I d i d n ’t know his          name or

 number,        I d o n ’t think         I ’d recognise            him again.             I ’ve got       the address          o

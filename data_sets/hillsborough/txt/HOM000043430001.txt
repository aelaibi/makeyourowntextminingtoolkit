Dear Lord MacKay

Mr         &        Mrs                G h u r c               h



I write to you further to my letter of 20 September
and your reply via your Private Secretary Alastair
Clegg of 25 September.

The position regarding my constituents after four
years of representation following the death of their
son in the Hillsborough Disaster is now intolerable.
I still await the list of names of the Steering Group
Members without which my constituents are unable to
proceed with their legal action.

Furthermore/ having been granted Legal Aid/ they are
unable   to obtain  the  legal  representation  they
require.

I am disturbed by so many aspects of this case I feel
obliged to request a meeting with you/ myself and Mr
& Mrs Church.   If you are unable to accommodate such
a meeting, would you arrange for one of your senior
Ministers to attend?

I trust you                    will           give          this           matter             your             urgent
attention.

Ypiirs sincerely


Joe Benton JP MP

THE ESCAPE GATE IN THE FENCE, THEY WERE JUST SHOUTING PUSH BACK, PUSH BACK,
WHICH WAS IMPOSSIBLE. ONE OF THE FANS FOUND A WAY TO OPEN THE GATE, AND THE
POLICE RAN OVER AND SHUT IT AGAIN. I GOT OUT OF IT QUITE QUICKLY WITH JUST
BRUISING AND SCAPING WHERE I CLIMBED OVER THE FENCE. I STAYED ON THE PITCH
THEN, LOOKING FOR MY FRIENDS, AND IT WAS ABSOLUTE CHAOS. I DON'T THINK THE
POLICE DID A GOOD JOB - THEY WERE JUST STANDING THERE ON THE HALFWAY LINE. I
THINK AT FIRST THE POLICE PANICKED AS MUCH AS THE FANS. THEY COULD SEE THE
C^piH HAPPENING AND SEE PEOPLE BEING CRUSHED, BUT THEY STILL DID NOTHING.

I WAS WITH:
                                        AINTREE.
                                    I AINTREE.
                              1 ARE OF LIVERPOOL.

GET ANY FURTHER BECAUSE OF THE RAILINGS. WHERE I WAS THERE WAS PLENTY OF

INFO      »  I WAS AT THE SAME MATCH LAST YEAR AND I COMPLAINED TO THE POLICE
             OUTSIDE THE GROUND BECAUSE I DIDN'T GET INTO THE GROUND UNTIL
             3.20, AND I THOUGHT THE FA WOULD HAVE CHANGED THE VENUE TO OLD
             TRAFFORD THIS YEAR BECAUSE IT'S GOT BETTER FACILITIES ETC.

I WENT TO THE MATCH WITH 5 OTHERS:
1. I                                                ], CUMBRIA
   AND HIS BROTHER, DON'T KNOW HIS NAME
                       FATHER DIED THIS WEEKEND SO YOU MAY NOT WANT TO
CONTACT THEM AT THIS TIME.

2. ONE WHO WORKS WITH ME :
3.       AND          I'LL BE ABLE TO FIND OUT EVERYONE'S DETAILS BEFORE I
GIVE A STATEMENT.
THIS YEAR WE GOT INTO THE GROUND AT 1.00 PM - WE WENT UNDER THE TUNNEL
T * R D S THE TERRACES, AND BECAUSE THE PENS BEHIND THE GOAL WERE SO PACKED
LAST YEAR WE WENT TO THE LEFT HAND SIDE WING, THE 'SHELF' AS YOU CAN SEE
BETTER THERE. THE SHELF WAS FULL, BUT NOT DANGEROUSLY FULL.
AT 2.00 PM I SAW THAT THE 2 PENS BEHIND THE GOAL POSTS LOOKED FULL, BUT THE
TWO ON EITHER SIDE WERE EMPTIER. AT 2.10 A MAN AND HIS SON STOOD NEXT TO US
AND SAID IT WAS FULL BEHIND THE GOAL, AND THEY COULDN'T GET IN, SO IT WAS
FULL VERY EARLY.
AT 2.30 THE 2 MIDDLE PENS WERE CHOC-A-BLOCK AND THERE WAS SPACE IN THE PENS
ON EITHER SIDE, BUT THE POLICE WOULDN'T LET PEOPLE WALK INTO THE PITCH TO GET
TO THE OUTER PENS. I SAW PEOPLE CLIMBING OVER THE FENCE FROM THE MIDDLE INTO
THE WINGS.
THIS CONTINUED FOR 20 - 30 MINS, THEN AT KICK-OFF, THE WINGS WEREN'T FULL, I
WAS RIGHT ABOVE THE TWO MIDDLE PENS, THEY WERE ROCKING WITH THE PRESSURE OF
MORE PEOPLE TRYING TO GET IN, AND I THOUGHT SOMETHING WAS UP THEN.
BY 3.00 - 3.05 I COULD SEE IT WAS A DISASTER, I KNEW THOSE TWO MIDDLE PENS
WOULDN'T HOLD THE VOLUME OF PEOPLE COMING INTO THE GROUND.
AFTER THE GAME WAS ABANDONED IT MUST HAVE TAKEN THE POLICE 1 5 - 2 0 MINUTES
FOR THE POLICE TO PULL THE FENCE DOWN, THERE WERE TOO MANY PEOPLE TRYING TO
GET THROUGH THE SMALL GATE ONTO THE PITCH.
THERE WERE PEOPLE BEING CRUSHED IN THE TUNNEL BECAUSE I COULD SEE THE BODIES
BEING PASSED DOWN FROM THE TUNNEL OVER THE TERRACES AND ONTO THE PITCH.
WE KNEW THERE'D BEEN SOME CRUSHING IN THE ENTRANCE AND THE BACK OF THE
PADDQCK WHERE THE TUNNEL FED INTO THE TERRACES.
I THINK THAT THE FANS WAITING TO GET IN SHOULD HAVE BEEN FILTERED, CHECKED TO
SEE IF THEY HAD TICKETS.
I DON'T THINK ALL SEATER STADIUMS ARE THE ANSWER , IT WILL CAUSE MORE PROBLEMS
OUTSIDE WITH MORE SUPPORTERS TRYING TO GET IN.

CONT, THE TUNNEL I FOUND MYSELF CRUSHED IN THE BACK OF THE PEN TO THE RIGHT
OF THE TUNNEL IT MUST HAVE BEEN ABOUT 15:00 .MY ARMS & LEGS WERE BRUIZED
AS IWAS CRUSHED AGAINST THE BARRIER AT THE BACK. PEOPLE IN FRONT OF US WERE
SHOUTING PUSH BACK BUT WE COULDN'T MOVE. WE MANAGED TO PASS SOME CHILDREN UP
INTO THE STAND ABOVE US, IT WAS A RELIEF WHEN THE POLICEMAN RAN ONTO THE
PITCH & STOPPED THE MATCH MORE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE DIED IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR
HIM. AFTER ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES THE CROWD EASED ENOUGH FOR ME TO GET BACK
INTO THE TUNNEL,INSIDE THERE THERE MUST HAVE BEEN AT LEAST 12 BODIES WHICH I
HEtfED THE POLICE TAKE TO THE AMBULANCES. I WAS ALARMED WHEN 30-40 POLICE
F(SrED A LINE IN the CENTRE OF THE PITCH INSTEAD OF HELPING THE DYING PEOPLE
AT THE FRONT OF THE TERRACES. I SAW NO DRUNKENESS FROM THE LIVERPOOL FANS IN
FACT THEY SAVED MANY LIVES BY THERE ACTIONS.
ATTENDED WITH ONE OTHER DETAILS NOT KNOWN.

WHEN I ENTERED PEN 3 I WENT AND STOOD BEHIND THE FIRST SAFETY BARRIER WHICH
WAS ABOUT 10FEET FROM THE PERIMITER FENCING.THE PEN AT THIS TIME I WOULD SAY
WAS A THIRD FULL.AT ABOUT 2.50PM I WOULD SAY THAT PEN 3 WAS COMPLETELY FULL
AND PEOPLE WERE PUSHING AND SHOVING.I WAS PINNED AGAINST THE SAFETY BARRIER
AND STARTED TO HAVE DIFFICULTY IN BREATHING.I ALSO SUSTAINED BRIUSING TO MY
PELVIC AREA. A MAN TO MY RIGHT I THINK FAINTED AND FELL DOWN BUT THERE WERE
SO MANY PEOPLE IN THE AREA THAT PEOPLE WERE JUST WALKING OVER HIM. PEOPLE
WERE SCREAMING FOR HELP. I DID SEE A POLICEMAN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE
PERIMITER FENCE NEAR TO THE PITCH.PEOPLE WERE SHOUTING AT HIM TO OPEN THE
SMALL GATE WHICH LED ONTO THE PITCH. IT WAS OPENED FOR A FEW SECONDS AND A
CQ K L E OF FANS GOT OUT, BUT HE THEN SHUT IT AGAIN.. I JUST COULDNT BREATHE AND
I W O T REMEMBER MUCH OF WHAT HAPPENED NEXT UNTILL I FOUND MYSELF AT THE BACK
OF THE TERRACE AREA AND I MANAGED TO THEN GET OUT

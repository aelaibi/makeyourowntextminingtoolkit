     Dear David,

                                                                  New Stadia

     Arising out of the Hillsborough tragedy, there will toe two areas
     w h i c h no doubt wiii com e u n d e r d i s c u s s i o n r e g a r d i n g future
     s tadia.

     One wiii be tax c o n c e s s i o n s to footbaii clubs for capital
     development.  As you know, this is depreciated over a long period
     of time, whereas items like transfer fees ’are written off in the
     year they occur.   I believe clubs should be encouraged to spend
     on new stadia and similar measures but currently there is a tax
     disincentive to do so.

     Secondly we are one of the only countries in the, world that I
     k n o w of where clubs are e x p e c t e d t o Y f u n d d e v e l o p m e n t of new
     stadia.          This was done by either Government or local authorities.
     The magnificent stadia in Italy and Germany are owned by local
     a u t h o r i t i e s as a m a t t e r of pr i d e and then l eased to their
     football clubs.

      I cannot envisage, without substantial commercial development,
      any club being able to afford to fund tfre development of a new
      stadium ,

      Yours sincerely,

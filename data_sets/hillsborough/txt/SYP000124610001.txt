 WHEN WE ENDED UP ON THE TERRACES AT THE CORNER OF THE WEST STAND AND THE

 NORTH STAND        (PEN 7)   I LOOKED ACROSS TO THE TERRACES BEHIND THE LIVERPOOL GOAL

 AND I COULD SEE PEOPLE TRYING TO CLIMB OVER THE PERIMETER FENCE ONTO THE

 PITCH. THIS WAS ABOUT 2 MINUTES BEFORE THE GAME WAS STOPPED.              AS THE PEOPLE

 WERE TRYING TO CLIMB OVER THE FENCE ONTO THE PITCH,             THE POLICE WERE PUSHING

YES.    ONLY OUTSIDE WHILST WAITING TO GET IN THROUGH THE NORTH STAND TURNSTILES

IN LEPPINGS LANE. FROM THE TIME I ARRIVED AT THE ENTRANCE AT ABOUT       1 MINUTE TO
                                                                                    PAGE      i

 3 (14-59) AND WHEN THE GATE WAS OPENED AT ABOUT 3.05PM           (1505) EVERYONE OUTSIDE

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER,

 A STEWARD,     A LOUD SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 WE LEFT AFTER A LOUDSPEAKER A N N O U N C E M E N T .

 Q32

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO.

 Q53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE

 INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,         AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 ONE THING I D I D N ’T LIKE WAS THE POLICE FORMED A LINE ACROSS THE PITCH B Y THE

 H^-WAY      LINE.   THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE ON THE PITCH WHO WERE LOOKING AROUND

 FOR OTHER PEOPLE, THE POLICE WERE MOVING FORWARD AND SENDING THEM BACK TOWARDS

 LEPPINGS LANE. THEY WERE MORE INTERESTED IN KEEPING PEOPLE OFF THE PITCH THAN

 HELPING THOSE PEOPLE WHO WERE INJURED.


G19

 Q34

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD             WHICH YOU FEEL IS

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 THE MAIN POINT IS THE POLICE D I D N ’T DO         THEIR     JOB OUTSIDE THE GROUND   BY

 C ^ T R O L L I N G THE CROWDS,   ALSO THEY D I D N ’T DO WHAT THEY HAD   TO DO AFTER THE

 THING HAD HAPPENED INSIDE THE GROUND.

 ONE OTHER THING I WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST IS THAT ZIG-ZAG TYPE BARRIERS ON THE

 APPROACH TO THE TURNSTILES SIMILAR TO THOSE USED AT ALTON TOWERS WOULD BE

 HELPFUL IN CONTROL OF CROWDS AND ASSIST IN ORGANISATION ON ENTRY TO THE

 TURNSTILES.

 HE D I D N ’T KNOW AND THAT I SHOULD FIND A STEWARD.   IT WAS AFTER HE HAD LOOKED

 AT MY TICKETS.    I WAS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT MY S O N ’S SAFETY BECAUSE THERE

 WERE SO MANY PEOPLE THERE.


Q7
 G19

 WHAT STEWARDS DIRECTIONS DID YOU WITNESS AT THE TURNSTILES?

 NONE.

 <320

 DID YOU EXPERIENCE ANY DIFFICULTY IN FINDING YOUR ENTRY POINT?

 YES BECAUSE OF THE LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE I D I D N ’T KNOW WHICH TURNSTILES TO

 GO THROUGH.    I FOUND IT MORE BY LUCK THAN ANYTHING BECAUSE I HAPPENED TO

 STAND BETWEEN TWO POLICE HORSES THAT HAPPENED TO BE OUTSIDE THE ENTRANCE TO

 THE WEST STAND TURNSTILES AND WHEN A GAP OPENED UP I WAS CARRIED FORWARDS.

 021
 DID YOU HAVE DIFFICULTY ENTERING THE GROUND.       IF YES, GIVE BRIEF REASON.

 YES.    I REMEMBER BEING AT THE RIGHT HAND TURNSTILE FOR THE WEST STAND

 SEATING IN THE CRUSH AND TWO LADS HELPED ME TO PUSH AGAINST THE BRICK WALL

 TO CREATE SOME SPACE FOR MY SON SO THAT HE W O U L D N ’T GET HURT.   AT A COUPLE

OF MINUTES TO 3PM    <1500) A POLICEMAN STOOD ON THE WALL BY THE TURNSTILES AND

 Sl£> TO ME THAT IT WOULD BE ALL RIGHT IN A MINUTE BECAUSE THEY WERE GOING TO

 OPEN A GATE BY THE TERRACES TURNSTILES.      I TOLD HIM THAT I COULDN'T GO THAT

WAY BECAUSE I HAD TO GO TO THE WEST STAND.


G8
G22

 SO GREAT THAT IT WAS UNCOMFORTABLE AND IT WAS TAKING ALL OF MY STRENGTH TO

KEEP AN AREA FREE FOR MY SON.         THERE WAS NO WAY THAT    I WOULD HAVE BEEN

ABLE TO TURN AROUND.

Q29

DID YOU HAVE ANY DIFFICULTY AT ALL IN FINDING YOUR MATCH VIEWING POINT?

NO BUT AS I REACHED THE STEPS ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE UP TO THE Z SECTION

OF THE WEST STAND A NUMBER OF PEOPLE PUSHED ME FROM BEHIND.           I REMEMBER

TURNING AND SAYING SOMETHING TO THEM AND SEEING THAT THE COURTYARD WAS

DID YOU ASSIST A N YONE WHO WAS DEAD OR IN/ UR E D , IF SO, BRIEFLY EXPLAIN,

I FOUND A TEENAGE LAD WITH AN INJUREQ/LEFT LEG AND BACK IN THE COURTYARD BUT

HE WOULDN'T LET ME.       I WENT TO THE POLICE NEARBY AND TOLD THEM.     I WENT OUT

THROUGH THE GATE BY THE TURNSTILE I' CAME IN AND I FOUND THE SAME LAD AGAIN

OUTSIDE.     I HELPED HIM INTO LEPPINGS LANE TO A POLICE CONSTABLE WHO ASKED

IF THE LAD HAD REFUSED MEDICAL ATTENTION.       I SAID THAT HE HAD SAID THAT HE

WANTED TO BE LEFT ALONE AND HE SAID THAT HE COULDN'T HELP.        I LEFT HIM WITH
                                                                                  PAGE      9

Q17

 Q49

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR         IN THE

 DEATHS,    OR THE INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

 THERE WERE TOO MANY PEOPLE TRYING     TO GET INTO THE GROUND.     EVERYTHING    WAS

 GOOD MATURED BUT THAT DAY COST ME     £40.00 FOR MY SON AND I AND I WAS DAMNED

  IF I WAS GOING TO MISS THE MATCH.       SO I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT EVERYONE WHO

 HAD PAID FOR TICKETS WANTED TO GET IN.        A POLICE OFFICER OUTSIDE TOLD ME

 THAT IT WAS A 3.15    (1515) KICK-OFF WHICH HELPED TO CALM EVERYONE DOWN.



 WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

 ROUGHLY 1/E (HALF) PAST 3PM    (1500).

Q "18

 052

 d   A ^ YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO.

 QS3

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THERE WAS A POLICE OFFICER SHOUTING FOR PEOPLE TO GET BACK AND STOP

 PUSHING AND HE PUSHED SOMEONE WHO HAD CLIMBED OVER THE FENCE BACK        INTO

 THE PEN THROUGH THE GATE AT THE FRONT.

 THE POLICEMAN WITH A FLAT HAT ON STARTED TAKING THE NET AT THE GOAL DOWN

 AND THE SCOUSERS WERE HELPING HIM.       THE NOTTS FOREST FANS STARTED CHANTING
                                                                                PAGE    10
                                                                                Q S L2330

THAT THE LIVERPOOL FANS WERE HOOLIGANS,     I SUPPOSE YOU C A N ’T BLAME THEM AS

THEY PROBABLY D I D N ’T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON, AND THE POLICE THEN PUT A

CORDON 2 DEEP RIGHT ACROSS THE PITCH.     I DipW-VT THINK   IT WAS NECESSARY AND

IT ANNOYED A LOT OF PEOPLE.    THERE WERE / FEW OFFICERS DOING l^EIR UTMOST

T O HELP THE PEOPLE WHO WERE GETTING tjj^RT AND THEN THERE        HUNDREDS OF        AJ#**

POLICE STANDING AROUND ACROSS THE BITCH WHO NOT ONLY WERE DOING NOTHING Bui®

SEEMED   THAT THEY D I D N ’TWANT TO ISO ANYTHING AND COULDN'T BE BOTHERED TO

HELP.    I KNOW THAT THEY MUST HAVE HAD THEIR ORDERS BUT A LARGER NUMBER        OF

PEOPLE WOULD HAVE CERTAINi^^HELPED TO GET THE FENCE DOWN AND GET PEOPLE

OUT QUICKER.

I^4AS    JUST BEFORE THAT THAT A REPORT CAME OVER RADIO SHEFFIELD ON A

TRANSISTOR RADIO THAT ALAD HAD NEXT TO ME THAT      THERE WAS A RIOT AT

HILLSBOROUGH.   AT THAT TIME IT ANNOYED ME BECAUSE IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THERE

WAS NO RIOT AND THAT IT WAS A DISASTER.

I REMEMBER THAT AFTER THE MATCH A FEW PEOPLE WERE OVERCOME WITH EMOTION

AND THEY WERE BEING ABUSIVE TO THE POLICE SAYING THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE

MORE BUT THE OTHER LIVERPOOL FANS WERE PULLING THEM AWAY.

QS4

IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

OUR COACH DRIVER GOT LOST AND WE WERE VERY LATE ARRIVING AT THE GROUND.

HE APPROACHED FROM THE WRONG DIRECTION AND STOPPED OUTSIDE THE GROUND.

5 PEOPLE GOT OFF BUT THE POLICE STOPPED THEM AND SENT THE COACH TO THE

PARKING SPOT.   I REMEMBER BEING WORRIED THAT WE WOULD MISS THE MATCH BUT

WHEN WE RETURNED LATER   I SAW THAT 5 OTHER COACHES HAD ARRIVED AFTER US AND

PARKED BEHIND US.

TO MY MIND THE LEPPINGS LANE END IS NOT DESIGNED TO COPE WITH THE LARGE

NUMBER OF SUPPORTERS THAT WERE THERE THAT DAY.      ALSO THE ONLY ENTRANCE I

SAW TO THE TERRACES WAS THE TUNNEL.     IN FACT EVEN THOUGH I WENT UP THE STAIRS

ON THE RIGHT TO THE WEST STAND I DIDN'T REALISE THAT THAT WAS A WAY OF
                                                                           PAGE    11
                                                                           G S L2330

 GETTING TO THE TERRACES.

 THERE WAS INSUFFICIENT POLICING OUTSIDE THE GROUND BEFORE THE MATCH.

 AT ANFIELD DOZENS OF OFFICERS CHECK YOU BEFORE YOU REACH THE GROUND.

 TO ME THE LIVERPOOL FANS DID MORE TO ASSIST THAN THE POLICE DID.

 ALSO ON THE COACH BACK SEVERAL PEOPLE STILL HAD THEIR FULL TICKETS.

 I REMEMBER THAT THERE WERE A FEW PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE GROUND ASKING IF

 ANYONE HAD SPARE TICKETS BUT IT WAS NOT THAT MANY PEOPLE,   I HAVE SEEN MORE

 AT OTHER MATCHES.

 I ALSO FEEL THAT IF THE FA COULD NOT SUPPLY LIVERPOOL WITH AT LEAST THEIR

 AVERAGE GATE OF 39,000 TICKETS THEN THE VENUE SHOULD HAVE BEEN CHANGED.

 r^pSE IF IT HAD BEEN TELEVISED LIVE THEN FEWER PEOPLE WOULD HAVE GONE TO

 THE MATCH.

 S ITUATION EARLIER ESPECIALLY FROM THEIf/ P O R T I O N AND        CLOSENESS TO THE        PENS.

SLOWLY, THE POLICE APPEARED UNAWARE OF THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE SITUATION FOR 10

YES.            IN MY OPINION THE DISASTER WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS.

1.      TRAFFIC CONGESTION WHICH LED TO LATE ARRIVAL OF LIVERPOOL FANS.

2.      POOR POLICE CROWD CONTROL IN IMMEDIATE VICINITY OF GROUND AND IN

PARTICULAR OUTSIDE TURNSTILES AND PERIMETER GATES.

3.      LACK OF DIRECTION SIGNS INSIDE GROUND AND LACK OF POLICING AND OR

SIEWARDING IN DIRECTING FANS             iO LESS CROWDED AREAS OF            TERRACING.

 Q52

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO

 Q53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 I THOUGHT T H E .POLICE AT THE LEPPINGS LANE END ONCE THEY REALISED THE SEVERITY

 OF THE SITUATION DID A GOOD JOB, BUT HAVING S A L 0 T H A T           I THOUGHT IT TOOK THEM

 TOO LONG TO REALISE WHAT WAS GOING ON.       AT pIRST THEY WERE PUSHING PEOPLE BACK

 INTO THE TERRACES WHO WERE TRYING TO ESCAPE THE CRUSH BY CLIMBING OVER THE

       IMETER F E N C E .

 AFTER     I HAD GOT OUT ONTO T /IE PITCH I SAW A LOT OF POLICE UP THE KOP END OF THE

 GROUND WHO D I D N ’T APPEAR TO KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON,            I THINK THERE WAS A VERY

 SEVERE LACK OF COMMUNICATION.

 Q34

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I CONSIDER THAT THE POLICE DID THE CORRECT/THING BY OPENING THE GATE OUTSIDE;

 BUT THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER ORGANISATION INSIDE THE GROUND TO DIRECT

 PEOPLE AROUND TO THE SIDE OF THE F E R R I E S   INSTEAD OF EVERYONE GOING INTO THE

 M
 mW   DLE.     ALSO THEY COULD HAVE DELAYED THE KICK OFF AND ANNOUNCED THIS TO THE

 PEOPLE OUTSIDE WHICH WOULD HAVE EASED THE SITUATION OUTSIDE THE TURNSTILES.

 i^.L.

 3) THE PENS 3-4 WERE VIRTUALLY FULL TO CAPACITY.             AT 1.50 <1350) THE TUNNEL

EN ROUTE TO GROUND LACK OF POLICING OF FANS.

FROM AT LEAST 30 MILES AWAY FROM SHEFFIELD WE QUEUED IN OUR COACH.                NOT ONE

POLICEMAN WAS OBSERVED UNTIL ONE OR TWO MILES FROM THE GROUND WHERE WE WERE

STOPPED AND ASKED IF WE ALL HAD TICKETS,       EVERYONE SAID YES AND AT NO TIME WERE

WE ASKED TO PRODUCE THEM.   AT ABOUT 2.15 PM (1415) WE PASSED THE TURNSTILES

ON THE COACH AND THEY WERE ALREADY PACKED OUT, NOT AN ORDERLY SITUATION.                   WE

THE TURNSTILES,   TWO YOUNG POLICEMEN WERE TRYING UNSUCCESSFULLY TO TRY AND KEEP

THE CROWDS BACK AND KEEP A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF ORDER.            THE OFFICER ON MY

 THE FIELD AND ONLY A COUPLE OF MINUTES FROM KICK OFF.                         ONLY A MINUTE OR SO

 WERE TRYING TO DO SO, THEY WERE BEING PUSHED BACK IN BY THE POLICE.                                    THE FIRST

 I KNEW THERE WAS SOMETHING SERIOUSLY WRONG WAS WHEN SOME FANS WENT ONTO THE

 PrrCH TO TRY AND ATTRACT THE ATTENTION OF LIVERPOOL PLAYERS.                               THE GAME WAS

 STOPPED SOON AFTER THIS WHEN A POLICE OFFICER ASKED THE REFEREE TO STOP THE

 GAME.        AT DIFFERENT TIMES,              IT IS DIFFICULT TO RECALL IN WHICH ORDER THEY

 OCCURRED,       I SAW AN OFFICER              OPEN THE SMALL EXIT GATE AND PUT FANS BACK                INTO THE

 GROUND WHO HAD ALREADY CLIMBED OUT.                     POLICEMEN PHYSICALLY ASSAULT MEN WHO

 TRIED TO PULL THE MESH OFF THE FENCE TO TRY AND SAVE FANS WHO WERE OBVIOUSLY

 IN DIFFICULTY.          CERTAIN POLICEMEN STANDING ROUND WHILST DESPERATE FANS TRIED

 TO REVIVE OTHERS AND PULL THEM FROM THE CAGE.

            STATEMENT IS TOTALLY TRUTHFUL AND I AM WILLING TO SWEAR THIS IN ANY COURT

 OF LAW OR IN ANY ENQUIRY.                     I HOPE THIS WILL BE OF SOME USE TO YOU IN

 ESTABLISHING THE FULL FACTS OF SATURDAYS TRAGEDY AND BRINGING THOSE

 RESPONSIBLE TO JUSTICE.

 FRUSTRATION IN WITNESSING THOSE TRAGIC SCENES ON SATURDAY,                             THANK YOU FOR

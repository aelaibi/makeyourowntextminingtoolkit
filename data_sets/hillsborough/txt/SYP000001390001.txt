We parked about a ten minute walk away from the L.epping§ 1...n end of

the ground.         I don't know exactly where we parked? only that it was

by a s choo i.»

From us walking from the van to the ground 1 did not see any police

officers giving direction:;, they did not escort any fans that I

saw.       They were all stood around, all along the roads.

I have           n o t g o t a c 1u e w h a t / time        1 left      the       ground as     I say      I

passed out.               When    I did      come      round      I was    tota l l y      confused,,          I left

the ground              in a total        state      of    confusion.             I just wanted       to       get

out.            I was    frigh t e n e d about all what                I seen.

1 didn't           see a n y thing        that      I consider         some    one    to be doing w h i c h

wa s c r j.m i n a i.,,

All      I can say         is that        the      police      there    see m e d to be very slow                to

react,           they d i d n ’t seem to            realise what was              happening.         Officers

the      pen,

All      I can say to the                  enqu i r y    is that       the    turns t i l e s were             in a bad

position .             You    ha d    to w a 1k d o w n a s l o p e          to    them.          It    caused

congestion             and    with     the     amount      of    people       involved            it    just    seemed

that      my f’eet were              off    the ground.              3. was at an angle                 facing

All      I remember           was arms and hands                 coming           over me         pushing me

down.         I c o u l d n ’t stop myself               but     I went           down and         passed out.,            1

All      I know        is that        I woke       up at    the       other       ersd   q   f the ground wit h

someone         pushing my            chest     telling me            to breath           in and out.             When

I did       come       round     I saw       people all a r o u n d who                  looked dead,           were

covered         over.         I just wa n t e d          to get away,             I was       very

f r i ghtened.            I just       then w a 1ked of f back                    towards where             1 had

come      from         in a confused           state.       I doctor              spoke      to me and said an

am b u l a n c e   was       on the way.            I just w a l k e d            off.

I eventually              ended       up    back    by    the    sta nd ,     sat        s till    confusea,

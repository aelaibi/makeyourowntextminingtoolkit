Dear Sir,

    I      would wish the enclosed letters to be placed before the inquiry into
the disaster that occurred in the FA Cup semi final between Nottingham
Forest and Liverpool on 15th April 1989.

    The letters were written to:

            The Secretary of the Football Association

            The Minister of Sport

to express my very serious concern at the disgraceful overcrowding that was
allowed to take place in the Leppings Lane Terrace area in the 1988 semi
final on 9th April. No acknowledgement or reply was received from either
party. In the case of the Minister of Sport, for some inexplicable reason
my secretary has not addressed it to the Department of the Enviornment but
to a Liverpool address. Regrettably, I did not spot this mistake at the
time.

    In the light of the above correspondence you will understand my anger
when I had to witness (from the Leppings Lane end of the South Stand) the
appalling scenes on the 15th April, 1989.

    If I can be of any further assistance, please do not hesitate to
contact me.

                               Yours faithfully,
                                                      Royston

Dear Mr Croker

FA Cup Seal-Final - Liverpool v Nottingham Forest

I attended the above football match on Saturday April 9th 1988, and write
to protest in the strongest terms at the disgraceful overcrowding that was
allowed to occur (in an all ticket match) in the Leppings Lane Terrace area
(ticket counterfoil No.135 attached).

The whole area was packed solid to the point where it was impossible to
move and    where I, and others around me, felt considerable concern for
personal safety (as a result of the crush an umbrella I was holding in my
hand was    snapped in half against the crush barrier in front of me).    I
would emphasise that the concern over   safety related to the sheer numbers
admitted, and not to crowd behaviour which was good.

My concern over safety was such (at times it? was impossible to breathe),
that at half time when there was movement for toilets, refreshments etc. I
managed to extricate myself from the terrace, having taken the view that my
personal safety was more important than watching the second half.

This unfortunate overcrowding spoiled for a great many people what would
and should have been a pleasant and enjoyable footballing occasion.

It would    therefore be helfpul if you could please let me know how such
overcrowding, with a direct impact on crowd safety, was allowed to happen.

I would advise you that I have written in similar terms to the Minister of
Sport.

Yours sincerely

Dear Sir,

    I would wish the enclosed letters to be placed before the inquiry into
the disaster that occurred in the FA Cup semi final between Nottingham
Forest and Liverpool on 15th April 1989.

    The letters were written to:

            The Secretary of the Football Association

            The Minister of Sport

to express my very serious concern at the disgraceful overcrowding that was
allowed to take place in the Leppings Lane Terrace area in the 1988 semi
final on 9th April. No acknowledgement or reply was received from either
party. In the case of the Minister of Sport, for some inexplicable reason
my secretary has not addressed it to the Department of the Enviornment but
to a Liverpool address. Regrettably, I did not spot this mistake at the
time.

    In the light of the above correspondence you will understand my anger
when I had to witness (from the Leppings Lane end of the South Stand) the
appalling scenes on the 15th April, 1989.

    If I can be of any further assistance, please do not hesitate to
contact me.

                               Yours faithfully.

Dear Mr Croker

FA Cup Seal-Final - Liverpool v Nottingham Forest

I attended the above football match on Saturday April 9th 1988, and write
to protest in the strongest terms at the disgraceful overcrowding that was
allowed to occur (in an all ticket match) in the Leppings Lane Terrace area
(ticket counterfoil No .135 attached).

The whole area was packed solid to the point where it was impossible to
move and where I, and others around me, felt considerable concern for
personal safety (as a result of the crush an umbrella I was holding in my
hand was snapped in half against the crush barrier in front of me).     I
would emphasise that the concern over safety related to the sheer numbers
admitted, and not to crowd behaviour which was good.

My concern over safety was such (at times ip was impossible to breathe),
that at half time when there was movement for toilets, refreshments etc. I
managed to extricate myself from the terrace, having taken the view that my
personal safety was more important than watching the second half.

This unfortunate overcrowding spoiled for a great many people what would
and should have been a pleasant and enjoyable footballing occasion.

It would therefore be helfpul if you could please let me know how such
overcrowding, with a direct impact on crowd safety, was allowed to happen.

I would advise you that I have written in similar terms to the Minister of
Sport.

Yours sincerely________________

This unfortunate overcrowding spoiled for a great many people what               would
and should have been a pleasant and enjoyable footballing occasion.

With current    concerns over crowd safety and behaviour it would be helpful
to know how     such an event could occur at an all ticket major sporting
occas ion.

I have written      in   similar    terms   to   the   secretary   of   the   Football
Association.

Dear Minister

FA Cup Se»<-Final - Liverpool v Nottingham Forest

I attended the above football match on Saturday April 9th 1988, and write
to protest in the strongest terms at the disgraceful overcrowding that was
allowed to occur (in an all ticket match) in the Leppings Lane Terrace area
(ticket counterfoil No.135 attached).

The whole area was packed solid to the point where it was impossible to
move and where I, and others around me, felt considerable concern for
personal safety (as a result of the crush an umbrella I was holding in my
hand was snapped    in half against the crush barrier in front of me).   I
would emphasise that the concern over safety related to the sheer numbers
admitted, and not to crowd behaviour which was good.

My concern over safety was such (at times it was impossible to breathe),
that at half time when there was movement for toilets, refreshments etc. I
managed to extricate myself from the terrace, having taken the view that my
personal safety was more important than watching the second half.

This unfortunate overcrowding spoiled for a great many people what would
and should have been a pleasant and enjoyable footballing occasion.

With current concerns over crowd safety and behaviour it would be helpful
to know how such    an event could occur at an all ticket major sporting
occas ion.

I   have     written   in similar   terms   to   the   secretary of    the   Football
Association.

This unfortunate overcrowding spoiled for a great many people what would

It would therefore be helfpul if you could please let me know how such
overcrowding, with a direct impact on crowd safety, was allowed to happen.

I would advise you that I have written in similar terms to the Minister of
Sport.

area      was     littered             with        hundreds             of    b e er      and        lager      cans       and also          on

At S . 3 0 p m       I returned               to       the       frontage         of      the        Railway Station                  , there

the G r o u n d ,         some        had     obviously               been      drinking              and about            six    youths

were      warned          as     to    their           conduct          (shouting               and      chanting).              Numerous

that      these       were          not      from       the       public        house.               I looked         up H a l i f a x       Road

and would            say       there         were       about         500     fans        s t il l       coming       towards          the

Sergeant,           PC    Shipman           and        myself,        were       transported            there       by a n         unknown

to    g et    in but          about      50       people          j ust    stood       around.          I was       instructed               by

Inspector           Ellis        to    keep        pedestrians              on     the      pavement.            At 3 . 2 5 p m         I

assisted           with       t raff i c d u t i e s          in L e p p i n g s       Lane      for    the      arrival           of

ambulances              and    fire      engines.

At    4 . 1 5pm     I spoke           to PC        Lawrence           of    Ro th erham Division                  who       was     stood

bodies        behind          this     area,           he w a s     obviously            shocked.           I then          walked

towards           Leppings          Lane      and       several           fans     shouted          "It's      your     fault” ,

obviously           directed           at     the       Police        but     they       did     not    say what            th e    reason

was.         As    I was       stood        in L e p p i n g s        Lane       the     fans who          had    been       evacuated

from     the       Ground        appeared              very       shocked        and     angry       and    were       also        angry

about        the    press        taking           photographs              and     together          w i t h PC     shipman             X had

to    escort        one       photographer               well       away      from       the G r o u n d .        He    was        wearing

an    official           Press        vest.            Numerous           fans     had minor           Injureis, cuts,

limping           and    grazes        and were              asking        about       their       friends        who       were        in

the    Stand with              them .         I    advised           them     to     s t a n d on    the       pavement

opposite           the G r o u n d      and        see       if    they      could       see t h e m as        they     came            out.

sad    but        there       was     no a n g e r       or    bad        behaviour.

At    5 . 4 5 pm    I returned              to     Claywheels              Lane      a w a i t i n g the       arrival         of the

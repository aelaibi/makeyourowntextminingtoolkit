As far as       I am aware,          the s u pporters           trave l l i n g along      this    route were

N otts Forrest        fans only and there was                     no trouble with any of them,

that we had to deal              with.

At about 2 pm         (1400),        we were        called      to the        shopping area       just    past

the    roundabout      wit h M o o n s h i n e Ln and Shi reel iffe Ln where we saw

numerous      suppo r t e r s    entering          the beer-off        and      purchasing     packs      of beer

and bottles        of wine.          G e n e r a l l y the    fans were        of good     behaviour and we

had no cause        to speak         to any of them about                their     conduct.

At approx £=45         pm     (1445),       we made        our way back         to the ground,

collecting       the other members                 of our     serial     en     route.     We a r r i v e d at

the    ground at appro:-: 3 .00             pm     (1500).        We made      our way towards           the area

w here    the horses        congregate           and,    after     a few minutes,          were    informed

t h a t t h e st a n d a t L eppi ng s L n had             col 1a p s e d .

We all made        our way       into the ground and,                 on entering         the m a i n area,        I

saw    initially what           looked      like a s p i llage         of fans      on the     pitch at the

L e p p i n g s Ln end.       I w o u l d say approx            1000 fans at this            time were

ga t l~ia r e d on t h e pit c h .      I did not          know at this         time     exac t l y what    had

happened.

We were a p p r o a c h e d     by an     Insp then who            told us      to spread out        in front

of the Notts Forr e s t           end     in case there was any                 trouble.       I duly did

this     and was    near      to the goal           post     on the P e n i s t o n e    Rd end.

After about        10 mins,       I saw bodies being brought over on s t r e t c h e r s

from     the L e p pings Ln       end and          literally d r o p p e d on the f l o o r at            the

side     of where     I was     s t a n d i n g.     The     first    few bodies         appeared    to be

breathing and fans              from Liverpool             were    running all          over and,    then,       as

more     bodies a r r i v e d at      the    side       of me,     I saw that       some    of them were

not    breathing and,           by the      colour       of them,      a p p e a r e d dead.

I was     so shocked at         first,       I just        couldn't      take     in what was       happening,,

By now more        fans were a r r i v i n g         from the        other     end and were        now    ripping

off    the   boards    from the side of the                   ground and using            them as
                                                                                                                    PAGE
                                                                                                                    S2682

stretchers           to     carry the          injured.

The     fans    that were           a r r iving wit h the           i n j u r e d / d e a d were      sca t t e r e d all

over    our end of the                pitch and there was                  l i terally mass           hysteria.           The

were     screaming and shouting at us to help,                                   crying,       and some were             even

being abus i v e            to   police and other              fans.

I decided        that         I could no           longer    stay and w a t c h what was                 happening,            s

I left my serial                 and went          over    to the area where                 bodies were       arriving

to try and ass i s t .

I tried to render                  f i r st aid      to several           male    fans       that had arrived;

one,    who was           vomiting          and    groaning     as we tried to give                   kiss    of    life

and heart massage,                  and      it was       obvious     that,       after       a short while,             he

I then tried to assist                       wit h heart mass a g e          on several          other       fans whils

waiting        for    the arrival             of medical        assist a n c e .         Eventually          fire

of f icers wit h ox y g e n tanks                   and breathing a p p a r a t u s also attended,                        as

did St Johns              Amb u l a n c e    and the a m b u l a n c e      service          itself.

I saw that           by now,        and      I c a n ’t remember what                 time    it was,     but some            of

the Liverpool              fans were          calling       out and goading              the Notts F o r r e s t

fans.      There          was    not m uch else            I could do at              this    time.     Other

o f f icers     had a r r i v e d and our end of the                       pitch was          just as     busy with

bodies as        the L e p p i n g s Ln end.                I made my way              back towards          the    centre

of the     pitch where              there had been a cordon                      of    officers       formed and          I

e v e n t u a l l y found my serial.                  The Notts           Forrest       fans were       told over             th

loud speaker,              after what             seemed a very           long time,          that    there    had       been

an    incident        at     the L e p p i n g s     Ln end and that              the    game was going             to    be

postponed.

By this        time,       from what          I remember,          everyone,           including       police

officers,        a pp e a r e d     to      be walk i n g    ar o u n d    in a daze.           Some    o f f icers       had

lost    parts of their                uniforms,           others    were     crying,          others    just       talked

wit h   colleagues.

              Eventaully,           and a g a i n    I c a n ’t remember       the   exact     time,     perhaps about

              5 pm     (1700),       we all     made    our way back         towards      the gym area and waited

              for    further        instructions.

              Together       with a S e r geant         and 9 other        officers       from    the match,        and they

              were n ' t    from my serial,            we then went        out    on mobile       patrol      - trying          to

              assist       outside      the   ground.         U n f ortunately,      there was        so m u c h traffic:

              that aII we cou1d do was tour up and down the side st reets and di d n *t

              actually        respond to anyth ing.              We e s c o r t e d a. Det e c t i v e S e r g e a n t    who

              We made       our way back            towards    the ground and then walked                 to C l a y w h e e l s

              Ln where       we were       eventually         stood down at about 7 pm                (1900).

     Dear Sir,
                             re: Deployment of Police Reserves at
                                   Football matches.

              We have recently had correspondence with the Greater
     Manchester Police, the result of which we are now to be charged
     with additional cost for supplying a Reserve of Police Officers,
     who are there, in case there is a safety problem.

              We feel that this is completely unncessary. To think
     that there are possibly 45 games being played on a Match Day and
     that approximately ten Police Officers may be kept in Reserve, at
     each one, means that 400 Police Officers are being taken from Public
     Duties, in case something "might happen".

              In all honesty, in the event of a major catastrophe, at Old
     Trafford, the small additional number of Police Officers would not be
     of much use. We believe that we already have sufficient Police inside
     the ground, to cope with any situation, and already have a well considered
     Emergency plan in operation, and it is fairly certain that a major
     disaster would only occur in one section of the ground, if at all, and
     Police can be brought into that area from other parts of the ground.

               We hope that you will be able to give Clubs, such as ours,
      relief from the recommendations, in respect of the above.


                                              Yours faithfu]

Thank you for your letter of 24 January, which reached us after
Lord Justice Taylor had finished his Report.  I am, however,
copying it to the Police Department of the Home Office so that
they can be aware of the points you have raised about police
reserves at football matches.

SECRETARY OF STATE'S MEETING WITH THE CHAIRMAN OF THE FOOTBALL
ASSOCIATION  AND   THE  PRESIDENT  OF   THE  FOOTBALL  LEAGUE:
14    NOVEMBER

This is a good brief which reflects our experience as members
of the Shadow Football Membership Authority Committee, our
separate discussions with the Football Association and the
Football League and the Minister's discussions yesterday with
the Consultants (Ernst & Young) and the Football League
(Mr Phillips, Commercial Director). That said, I think it is
essential that we should have a briefing meeting' with the
Secretary of State and the Minister before the meeting with
the Football Authorities.

SECRETARY OF STATE’S MEETING WITH THE CHAIRMAN OF THE FOOTBALL
ASSOCIATION AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE FOOTBALL LEAGUE, 14 NOVEMBER


ISSUES FOR DISCUSSION


A.    Responsibility for the Football Membership Authority

1.   The Football Spectators Bill is to receive Royal Assent on
Thursday 16 November and the main purpose of this meeting is to
invite the President of the Football League and the Chairman of
the Football Association to confirm that they still wish to form
the Football Membership Authority. Mr Moynihan wrote (copy at A)
to the Chairman and the President on 16 February, agreeing that
they would have "first refusal" for appointment as the Football
Membership Authority. His letter made clear that the Secretary of
State would wish to:

      - approve the composition of the authority;
      - be confident that the body appointed was willing and able
        to produce a scheme which he could approve and which
        satisfied the requirements of the legislation;

      - be satisfied that their timetable   for implementation of
        the scheme was acceptable.


2.    The Bill provides (in Clause 3) for the Secretary of State
to appoint as the Football Membership Authority "any body
corporate formed for the purpose by the Football Association and
the Football League or any body corporate formed by any other
persons or, for the purpose, on his behalf". This provision is
subject to a commencement order (a negative resolution SI) which
will be debated following Lord Justice Taylor's final report - in
late January or early February. The FMA will not therefore be
appointed until February but, if the football authorities still
wish to form the company that will be appointed, it is time now
 that they began to take a more positive approach. The attached
 speaking notes deal with this issue and with the other points
 discussed below.


 B.    Membership of the Authority

 3.   The Bill provides for: a chairman independent of football
 and six members; the chairman and four of the members to be
 approved by the Secretary of State; the remaining two members to
 be appointed by him. The Bill says nothing about who should put
 forward the names of the Chairman and the four members whom the
 Secretary of State is to approve, rather than appoint.

 4.   Chairmanship - a list of possible candidates is at annex B.
 It seems appropriate to look for a businessman to chair the FMA,
 given the commercial focus of the authority (and someone with a
 legal background to run the Football Licensing Authority). Since
the chairman is to be approved, rather than appointed by the
Secretary of State,    it would be preferable to agree the
appointment with the football authorities, assuming that they
form the FMA, but we hope that a suitable candidate could be
agreed without much difficulty. The Secretary of State might like
to invite the Chairman and the President to offer some names.

5.   Membership - The expectation of the football authorities is
that four of the places on the FMA are for them to nominate,
subject to the Secretary of State's approval. This expectation
derives partly from the emphasis which Ministers placed on the
role of the football authorities in the FMA during the Bill's
passage through Parliament and partly from our discussions with
them when it was our understanding that Ministers expected them
to nominate four of the six members.

c.    Mr Moynihan is concerned, however, about giving the football
  ithorities a majority on the authority - 4 out of 7. Our
understanding is that, he would prefer the six members to be made
up as follows: two, or at most three,          from the football
authorities;   one representative of football supporters;       an
ex-policeman; an expert in technology; and, if the football
authorities' numbers can be kept to two, a lawyer. The football
authorities , will   be unhappy    about  this  new   approach  to
membership. They could be:


     a)   told that this is now the Government's position in the
           light of arguments put forward in Parliament; or

     b)   offered consultation on all six members; or

     c)   told that they can nominate four members but that one
           must    be either  a   technology   expert and/or  a
           representative of football supporters.


Ministers may wish to discuss tactics before Tuesday's meeting.
The speaking notes assume the firmest option (a).


C.   Financing the scheme

7.   The Government's position has always been that it would be
for football to meet the costs of the scheme. In order to achieve
progress on preparations before Royal Assent, we agreed to meet
half the costs of the consultants employed by the football
authorities (Ernst and Young) up to Royal Assent - a total
Government contribution of £130,000. After Royal Assent, we have
recognised no commitment.

8.   The consultants' initial estimates of the costs of the
scheme range upwards from £30m over five years. On instructions
from the League and the FA, the consultants have given the
companies/consortia bidding for the contract for the scheme the
objective that they should take full responsibility for these
costs - and recover them by selling membership cards and
marketing. We have asked for the Invitation to Tender to make
clear that this is an objective rather than an essential
requirement. Six potential suppliers are still in the competition

SPEAKING NOTES

A.        Introduction - responsibility for FMA

Bill now completed its passage tnrougn t'diiidmeuw                   V
become law on Thursday. Government objective to                    make   rapia
progress with implementation of Parts I and II
membership scheme and restriction orders.
Philip Carter (then League President) and Bert Millichip told PM
in July 1988 that they would co-operate if Government were to
legislate. Hope that that is still position and that we can make
progress together.
Lord Justice Taylor expected toproduce final report at the t
of the year. Government will consider his views; plan is to                   g
forward commencement order to allow appointment of
Parliamentary debate in January or February.
 Football authorities asked for and were given "first refusal                on
 forming the FMA.
    Terms were that Secretary of State would

           - approve the composition of the authority;
           - be confident that the body appointed was willing and able
             to produce a scheme which he could approve and which
             satisfied the requirements of the legislation;
           - be satisfied that their timetable            for implementation of
             the scheme was acceptable.

    Do you still want to form the company that will be appointed the
    FMA? If so, will you now begin to take a positive rather    an
    negative approach? How?
     [What follows assumes that they say that they want to form the
     FMA. ]

     B.     Membership of the authority
     Chairman to be an independent appointee, agreed between Secretary
     of State and football authorities; ?a successful businessman? any
     suggestions?
     We have reviewed the position on the six members in the light of
     Parliamentary debates and representations. We now have in m m d :
     two [or three] representatives from football; a representative o
     football supporters; an ex-policeman; a technology expert; [and a
     lawyer].

the working party. The advice he will be able to offer will 1 am
sure prove invaluable.    I hope that this letter provides the
confirmation that you are seeking.

I note your undertaking that you will submit the scheme for
approval by 31 August.  I would be grateful to know whether you
wish to take up my offer to share the costs, between now and
enactment of the legislation, associated with drawing up the
scheme for submission to the Secretary of State. If you wist . to
do so, our officials will need to discuss how best to make the
necessary arrangements.

I am writing in similar terms to Jack Dunnett.

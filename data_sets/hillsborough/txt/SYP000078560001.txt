 ’w a t c h i n g . ’       These       men     turned        out     to be       c lub     stewards          who        had     taken

 off      t h eir     identity          badges         because        of    threats        of       violence         made        towards

 them      by L i v e r p o o l        fans.         Many     peo p l e     came      forward,            stating         they were

medical           students,            nurses,         f i rst     aid,     etc,      offering            t heir     help and        they

were       directed          toward           the    injured.

Doctors           came      forward also and were                        utilised accordingly.                        I s t il l    at

this       point      ha d    no       idea of w h a t           had happened m a n y                constables            were

walking          aimlessly about                    having       been sep arated from                     colleagues           and were

in m y      opinion          lost as          to w h a t      to    do.

Radio       transmissions                at     this       time     were     few and         sti l l      the      full     tragedy

was     not      known.          I, at        no t ime        handled any             bod i e s ,     other        than directing

where       to      place     persons           for     treatment.              All    the    bodies          I d i r e c t e d as

such,       had      po lice       officers           or    civilians           with     them.

Once      I entered           the a r e a A / G            I went     towards          the    t unnel,          many fans          were

t h ere     crying,          upset,       angered.               X attempted           to m o v e      the      fans      to w h a t

n o w wa s       becoming a sterile                    area.         (Area       1-16).          Many m o v e d on and were

appreciative              of w h a t      e v e r y o n e wa s       trying        to do,        many       refused         to m o v e

and    showed         their       anger        towards         me a n d     other        police        present,             I was

unable        to    clear        the    tunnel         of fan s.           The a r e a A / G a p a r t f r o m              the

tunnel        a r e a was a l m o s t          c l eared .          Then     I d i r e c t e d five          constables            up

the    stairs         to the       seating           area      of    the W e s t       Stan d ,      where         i n the

passageways             behind,         people w ere              stood,        awaiting         the      g a m©    to    restart.At

this      t ime     I was        not    aware         of w h e t h e r     the m a t c h h a d b e e n a b a n d o n e d

instructed            the    constables              to q u i e t l y ask w h o w a s               present         to ge t t h e i r     ^

             which       I decided      to m a k e m y w a y    back     to C l a y w h e e l s Lane,      where     I was

whatsoever.              It was         decided          that       my    s eri a l      would          tag     along       the    rear        of

the    fans      to    ensure          their      entrance           to     the     ground.              By     this    time       fans

were     still        walking          away     from      the       direction            of       the    grou nd,       looking           for

most     of     the    fans       b ack      towards       the       ground         but       despite           our    assurance

that     no     pubs     were      open,        fa ns     still          went     in s e a r c h         of     drinks.

The    fans      from       the    special          train were              escorted              by o t h e r    serials          and

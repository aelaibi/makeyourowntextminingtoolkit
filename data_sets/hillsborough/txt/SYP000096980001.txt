    THE SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE: HISTORY, GEOGRAPHICAL
             AREA, HANNING AND ORGANISATION


The South Yorkshire Police was formed in April 1974 by amalgamation
of the Sheffield and Rotherham Constabulary and part of the West
Yorkshire Constabulary.

The force was originally coterminous with the boundaries of the
former South Yorkshire Metropolitan County Council.  In 1985 the
council was abolished and the South Yorkshire Police now serves the
four local authorities of Sheffield, Doncaster, Barnsley and
Rot herham.

The South Yorkshire Police has a police establishment of 2978
officers and, on 15th April 1989, an actual strength of 2929.  This
equates to a population ratio per officer of 440, and a ratio of
one officer per 53 hectares.

The Chief Constable of the Force is Mr. Peter Wright and he has
held the post since 1st January 1983. To assist in the overall
management of the Force there is a Deputy Chief Constable and three
Assistant Chief.Constables, each of whom has been allocated
specific responsibilities by the Chief Constable.

The Deputy Chief Constable Mr. Peter Hayes, QPM LLB MA deputises in
the Chief Constable's absence from the Force.   He hears minor
charges laid against any member of the Force under the Police
(Discipline) Regulations 1985 and he also has a responsibility for
Communications and Computer Development within the Force.  He has
held this post since 1st March 1985 and prior to this held the post
of Assistant Chief Constable from 1st May 1978.

The Assistant Chief Constable (Operations) Mr. Walter William
Wilson Jackson, is responsible for all police operational matters,
including the policing arrangements for any major event occurring
within the county. He has held this post since 1st May 1985.

The two remaining Assistant Chief Constables are Terence Watson,
BA, who has a responsibility for Management and Financial Services,
and Kenneth Stuart Anderson, who is responsible for the Staff
Services function of recruiting, training, personnel, career
development and welfare..  Mr. Anderson has also undertaken
temporary responsibility for complaints and discipline matters. Mr.
Watson was appointed Assistant Chief Constable on 25th March 1984
and Mr. Anderson on 3rd April 1985.

The Force has six divisions, 'A1, 'B' and 'C' Divisions are
coterminous with the local authority boundaries of Doncaster,      APPENDIX
Barnsley and Rotherham respectively.  The city, and local authority
district, of Sheffield is served by three police divisions.   'D'
Division incorporates the city centre and the east of the city, 'E'
Division is to the South, and 'F' Division describes the North and
West areas of Sheffield.
'F * Division has two sub-divisions. FI is known locally as
Hillsborough Sub-Division and Sub-Divisional Headquarters are
located at the Hammerton Road Police Station.  F2 is referred to as
Ecclesfield Sub-Division and is based upon Ecclesfield Police
Stat ion.

On 15th April 1989 the 'F' Divisional Headquarters were sited at
Hammerton Road.  However, on Monday 24th April 1989 the Divisional
Headquarters were transferred, along with F2 Sub-Divisional
Headquarters, to a new buiding, purpose built for the     South
Yorkshire Police at   The Common, Ecclesfield.

Hillsborough football stadium is situated within the 'F' Division
of the Force.   It is approximately one mile north of Hammerton Road
Police Station.

There are 5 football league clubs within South Yorkshire, 4 play
football in the lower divisions, these are situated at Rotherham,
Barnsley, Doncaster   and Bramall Lane, Sheffield. The fifth club
Sheffield Wednesday   play in the first division of   the   football
league at Hillsborough Stadium.   F.A. Cup semi-final matches have
regularly been staged at Hillsborough.

In addition, large crowds are attracted to horse racing at
Doncaster where the St. Leger Classic is run, and to the venues for
rugby league, speedway, the world snooker championship at the
Crucible Theatre, and many more.  Furthermore, the R.A.F.
Finningley Air Display is attended each year by in excess of
140,000 spectators.  The Sheffield Marathon, and the National Milk
Cycle Race are also significant annual events requiring police
supervision.

The South Yorkshire Police has a broad experience of controlling
situations in which crowds, sometimes hostile towards the police or
a third party, gather together in a confined area.

At the beginning of 1980 this Force became the focus of a 13 week
national steel strike.  On 14th February of that year massed
demonstrating occurred at Vulcan Road, Sheffield and, at the height
of the demonstration approximately 1500 demonstrators confronted
the police.  Despite this concentrated crowd, the workforce of
Hadfield's steel company were enabled safe passage into the
factory.  During the whole 13 weeks there was no notable injury or
damage caused during the demonstrations.  Normal police methods
were used and the strike ended with goodwill towards the South
Yorkshire Police for the way these confrontations had been handled.

Similarly, during the extended industrial dispute between the
National Union of Mineworkers and their employers over a 12 month period
1984/85, the South Yorkshire Police experienced some of the most
intense, and violent, crowd demonstrations in the country.  The Force
responded to these demonstrations in a thoroughly professional manner.
Despite the size and, on occasions, ferocity of the crowds, no fatal
injuries were sustained in South Yorkshire as a result of the
demonstrations throughout the twelve months of the dispute.

Each South Yorkshire Police Division is commanded by a Chief
Superintendent.  Chief Superintendent David Godfrey Duckenfield was
promoted to his present rank on 27th March 1989, to take over the
command of 'F' Division.

Mr. Duckenfield has over 25 years police service and was a
Superintendent for 5^s years before his latest promotion.  A curriculum
vitae for Mr. Duckenfield, and other officers in his management team,
is appended.                                                    APPENDIX 2

Each Divisional Commander is supported by a deputy divisional commander
who carries the rank of Superintendent.  The 'F' Division deputy is
Superintendent Roger Marshall who has held the post for l^s years.
During his time at 'F' Division, Superintendent Marshall has been
involved in the policing of the 1988 F.A. cup semi-final match and many
first division football league matches involving Sheffield Wednesday at
Hillsborough.

FI Sub-Division is commanded by a Superintendent who is responsible to
Superintendent Marshall and Chief Superintendent Duckenfield.  The
present sub-divisional commander is Superintendent Bernard Murray who
took up the post on 14th March 1988.  Like Mr. Marshall he has had
experience of one previous F.A. Cup semi-final event at Hillsborough,
in April 1988, but has regularly been involved in the policing
arrangements at Sheffield Wednesday's first division home games.

'F' Division is normally policed by 299 officers, 131 stationed at FI
Sub-Division.   The policing problems of the sub-division include those
arising in the area of Broomhall which has a particular problem of
prostitution and drug dealing.   There are a number of satellite
shopping precincts at Broomhill, Hillsborough, Crookes, Walkley and
Ecclesall which each create demands upon police resources.   The
Ovlerton Stadium, close to the Hillsborough Stadium, hosts motor cycle
speedway racing, greyhound racing and first division rugby league
ganes.   'FI' Sub-Division also encompasses a wide ranging complex of
University buildings, halls of residence and other 'bed-sit'
accommodation.   In addition to these particular features of the sub­
division FI also shares, with other sub-divisions in the Force, the
continuing objectives to reduce the incidence of burglaries at dwelling
houses, to reduce the incidence of theft of and from motor vehicles and
to eliminate or reduce public concern over public disorder and alcohol
related offences.
In addition to the territorial divisions of the Force there are
also police departments such as Operations and Traffic which have
functional responsibility.  Operations Division controls the
deployment of officers in Dog Section, Mounted Section, and other
operational support staff.  The Division is commanded by Chief
Superintendent John Arthur Nesbit QPM, who is responsible to ACC,
Mr. Jackson.

Whilst Operations Division has a Forcewide responsibility for the
provision of operational support services, the policing
arrangements for major sporting events is usually retained under
the control of the Division hosting the event.  This was the case
in respect of the F.A. Challenge Cup semi-final match at
hillsborough on 15th April 1989.

sited    in the      South Stand perimeter                  adjacent       to

turnstiles       20/1,     28,     29 and 32/3.             These    gates

are used by authorized personnel and in cases of

emergency.       They      are   also opened           at    the    end of

play to facilitate ease of egress by supporters

into the      service      road at the rear of the South

Stand,    and,       subsequently,            into    Penistone          Road

SPION KOP

The    Spion      Kop     is    covered        and    has       a    standing        19

facility only.



Access       to   this       large     area    may     be       either       via

turnstiles           37-42     situate        in     the    South         Stand

service       road       (Penistone          Road     North          end)     or

turnstiles 43-76 in Penistone Road North.



To     facilitate         ease        of     access        to       the     rear

terraces      of the Spion Kop two                   sets   of concrete

stairs/ramps          have     been        installed,       the      foot     to

each    being     in the       general        area    at    the      rear of

turnstiles 43-55.



Access to the Spion Kop at ground floor level is

either via an entry point at the North and South

ends    of    this     area    or     the     previously            mentioned

stairways and then descending internal aisles.



Toilet    and     refreshment          facilities          are      sited    at

ground       floor    level      in    the    general       area      at the

rear of the Penistone Road turnstiles                            (43-76).

Additionally two large wooden doors are sited in

the South Stand perimeter adjacent to turnstiles

37     and    42    and       three    large      folding metal            doors

adjacent           to    turnstiles         48/9,        54/5     and      72/3.

These gates are used by authorized personnel and

in cases of emergency.                     They are also opened at

the end of play to facilitate ease of egress by

supporters          in    the       Penistone       Road    North       end   of

the South Stand service road and Penistone Road

North itself.



Segregation between this area and the North and

South Stands have already been covered.



WEST STAND

This    stand is          seating only and is accessed via                            20

turnstiles          9-16 and A-G in Leppings Lane.                          Once

through these turnstiles, supporters are in one

of two enclosures, the boundary between which is                                      21
maintained          by    a    brick       wall    with     a    connecting

gate.         The       fact    as    to    whether        this      gate     is

closed       or    not    is    dependant         upon     the    number of

away     supporters              attending          and        the      ticket

allocation afforded them by the club.



Each     of       these       two     enclosures         has     a   covered       22 & 23

stairway          with    gates       which       give    access      to    the
                                                                            Photograph

West Stand and ticket holders are vetted further

at   these        locations        by     club     employees       before

entering the stand proper via six gangways.



Toilet and refreshment                  facilities      are available

in an upper level concourse at the rear of this

stand.



LEPPINGS LANE TERRACES

These terraces are accessed via turnstiles 9-16

and A-G in Leppings Lane.                  As with those wishing            Appendix 4

to   use        the    West       Stand,      once    through       these

turnstiles,            supporters             utilize        the      two

enclosures.            Their access to the West               Stand is

prevented         by        the    club       employees .          These

supporters h a v e , in general terms, three access

routes to the terraces and these are via:-



          (i)           The rear of the north wing at the                      24

                        base of the West Stand

          (ii )         A    central      tunnel     under   the West          25

                        Stand

          (iii)         The rear of the south wing at the

                        base of the West Stand



It   is    a    fact    that       on   the    majority      of    'match

days'     only    route       (ii ) is used.          The    other    two
routes are only used in addition to (ii) if the                              Bptogcqsh
                                                                            Huber
volume of away supporters so dictates.



On    games    with     exceptionally        large    attendances,

in particular Semi Finals, this process does not

come    into play and access to all parts                        of the

terracing,        via      the     connecting             gates,       is

available at the outset.



Toilet    facilities       are available           in each of the

two    enclosures        and   refreshments          in    the     South

enclosure only.



The    terraces       themselves      are    divided       into     five

sections.         The    capacities         for    these        sections

have    been    obtained       from    the    club        and    are   as

follows:



         North West Terrace

         (elevated)                         3700

       the North Pen        is by crush barriers and a raised

       concrete      area where         the elevation of      the North

       West Pen commences.



       Division      between      the    North   Pen   and   Centre    Pen   27

       North    is   by   a double         set   of metal    rails    with

       room for access between the two.



       Centre     Pen     North      and    Centre     Pen   South     are   28 & 29

       divided by a single metal rail.



       Access   between      all the pens         is afforded         by a

       metal gate in each set of rails at a point where

       the rails      join the foundation wall to the West

       Stand.



       The development of these pens is historical.




2.26   The division of the Leppings Lane terraces into

       separate      pens      was      proposed,      by    the     South

       Yorkshire Police,          in 1981 following an F.A. Cup

       semi-final match,          held at Hillsborough,            between

       Wolverhampton Wanderers and Tottenham Hotspur on
                                                                             BuUogtqli

Saturday       11th April         1981.      The minutes         of the

de-briefing meeting which followed the game are

attached.                                                                    fflENDK 6



For     this      match    the    Leppings        Lane    end    of    the

ground which was, at that time, not divided into

pens,    was      given    over    to     Tottenham       supporters.

There were problems with packing the terraces on

that day, supporters being reluctant to fill the

centre of the terraced enclosure.                        This problem

was     exacerbated        by    the      late    arrival       of    many

spectators who were still making their way into

the ground when Tottenham scored a goal in the

third minute.             There was a surge          forward which

caused crushing and injuries at the front of the

terracing.          The emergency exit gates which give

access       to    the    perimeter        track     were       used    to

release spectators from the front of the terrace

and     to     redistribute         them     elsewhere          in     the

ground.



The police felt that the Leppings Lane terraces

required       divided     enclosures        so    that    spectators

were    not    packed      in such a solid mass.                 It was

suggested,        in a letter from the Chief Constable
                                                                                  B u tpgjcaEh

to Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, dated 5th

June     1981,         that     the    Safety       at   Sports       Grounds

Committee of the South Yorkshire County Council

should visit             the Leppings Lane terraces with a

view     to       recommending             measures        to     prevent     a

repeat of the problems encountered on 11th April

1981.



[It     is    worthy          of    note    that this       letter        also

expressed               the view      that      the      accepted        crowd

capacity          of     10,100       at    Leppings        Lane      terrace

offered       no       safety       margin.         Such     concerns       had

previously             been passed to Mr. England,                 the    Club

secretary,               in a      telephone     conversation             with

Chief       Superintendent            Herold who         suggested        that

"... our          (the South Yorkshire Police)                     consensus

view    is    that       the       10,100 crowd figure specified

in    the     safety      certificate          is     too       high."      The

report       of    Chief           Superintendent           Herold,      dated

30th April 1981,                is appended.]                                     AETENDIX   8



The    South Yorkshire County Council                           reported     in

September          1981       (correspondence            appended)       with     AFE0CK     9

proposals for the erection of radial barriers on

the West Terrace.                  These were erected later that
                                                                               BEtogccjii
year,    and    created       the divided pens which exist                     Huber
today.



These pens have also assisted in segregation of

opposing       supporters.          The Leppings Lane end of

the     stadium       has     traditionally been               used      for

accommodating           'away'     supporters.           In the past,

however,    the seating enclosure and terracing was

shared      with         season       ticket        holding           'home'

supporters.          There has grown,              over time, a need

at     football       grounds       for   total segregation               of

'home'    and       'away'    supporters           and   the    vertical

railings have ensured that segregation has been

achieved       by     creating        separate pens            for each

element.          This      need    for      the    segregated         pens

disappeared         in the       'close season'          of    1987 when

the newly appointed Club secretary of Sheffield

Wednesday Football Club PLC, Graham McKrell,                              at

the     request       of     the    police,        re-allocated the

season     ticket       holders       from    the    West       Stand     to

other parts of the ground.                    Since that time the

West    Stand     and      terraces    have been reserved for

the use of away supporters only.



As a consequence of the difficulties experienced
                                                                                       Photograph
                                                                                       Number
at     the    Leppings         Lane       terraces          during      the     Semi

Final        game        of    1981,           and    in     the        light     of

structural          changes         at    this       part    of the       ground,

the     then    Chief         Superintendent                Herold      called     a   APPENDIX 10
meeting        of    all      stewards          employed          by    Sheffield

Wednesday       Football            Club       on    the    22 August          1981.

At      Mr      Herold1s            request           Inspector           Calvert      STATEMENT 9
addressed the stewards meeting which was held at

the    Hillsborough            Stadium          gymnasium.              Inspector

Calvert        pointed        out        to    the    stewards          that     the

admission of spectators and the packing of these

spectators, at the bigger games, on the terracing

is primarily their function and not a police one.

This policy has continued to date.

Also     in     a        statement            from    Inspector          Calvert,

reference           is    made      to        the    development          of     the

Leppings        Lane          turnstiles.                   The        historical

background to these changes is as follows:

During the early 1980's                       both the West Stand and

terraces        were          exclusively             utilized          by      away

supporters.

In     1984         Sheffield            Wednesday           Football           Club

returned to first division football and increased

attendances          made      it    necessary             for    the    club     to

make provision for home                       supporters          to share the

West Stand and terrace area facilities.
It was       drawn     to the        clubs    attention         that mixed

use       would        cause        problems       with         regard        to

segregating          opposing        fans    as    they        entered       the

Stadium.             Inspector         Clive       Calvert           was     the

Football Liaison Officer at that time and brought

this potential problem to attention.

At    that        time       theentrances         to    the     West       Stand

consisted of a crescent shaped bank of turnstiles

occupying basically the same position as they do

now but were numbered 1 to 18.                          Five turnstiles

numbered          19 to 23occupied             the same position as

the current turnstiles 'A' to 'G'.

As    a   result       of    the    representation            made     by    the

police,      the       bank    of     turnstiles         1     to    18     were

reduced         to      their current             numbers       1     to     16.

Turnstiles        19    to     23    were    increased         by    two     and

renamed 'A' to 'G'.

At    the    same      time        current    gate       'B'    was        moved

outwards       from     a line       extending         between       the     old

turnstiles 18 and 19.

To    assist      with       segregation,         the    metal        fencing

extending • from            turnstile        16    to    Leppings           Lane

perimeter gates was re-positioned and clad to its

present      state.          Additionally,         the       interior wall
     dividing       the    West      Stand      enclosures          between      the

     two     banks         of       turnstiles          was        constructed.

     Previously          segregation       at     that       point      had     been

     achieved       by    moveable        crash        barriers      manned       by

     police officers.

     These       alterations         facilitated        total       segregation

     at    the    turnstiles,         enclosures        and       in the      Stand

     and terraces.

     Correspondence            in    respect      of    these       changes       is

     appended hereto.




PERIMETER TRACK

There is a low boundary wall between the North

Stand and the perimeter track but these increase

to    head       height    directly       in    front        of   the    area

designated for use by disabled persons.

A    small       gate     is    sited     in    the     boundary         wall

directly in front of the aisle giving access to

gangway      'A'     in the         North Stand         (lower level -

West end).

There is a low boundary wall between the South

Stand and the perimeter track.                         This       is broken

in    the    centre       providing       access        to    and    egress

from the         players        tunnel.        Additionally,            a low
                                                                                            Photograph
                                                                                            Humber

metal     gate       is    sited          at     a    point         where      the     South

Stand meets          the       Spion           Kop,    giving          access        to   the

South Stand (lower level - East end).



The     boundary           between              the       Spion          Kop    and       the

perimeter           track           is     maintained               by       high      metal

fencing.        This       fencing             has    6       access/egress            gates

which     are       served          by     a    hinged         and     spring         loaded

bar.



Leppinqs Lane Terraces

The     boundary          between          the       Leppings          Lane         terraces

and    the    perimeter             track        is maintained                 by    a high

metal    fencing.              This        fencing has              7 access/egress

gates    which        are       secured          by       a    hinged        and      spring

loaded       bar.    Six       of        the    gates         are    situate         in the

section       of    fencing              parallel’ to            the     terracing         to

the    west     of       the    ground           and       the      seventh          in   the

fencing giving access                      to the North West                     elevated

section       but        in     fencing              adjacent          to      the     North

Stand.



Whilst these gates open outwards onto the track at

ground level,             there is a difference in level at a

point     where          the        terracing             meets        the     perimeter

track    fencing               on         the    supporters                  side.        The

difference          in              level             varies         from       North      to
                                                                                 Photograph
                                                                                 Number

South     sides          of the terraces and is greater at

the North end.                 The perimeter track gates will

open 90° due to support stantions on the track

side     preventing            them        opening       further.              The

location        of gates            and dimensions         are       shown      in

the attached Appendices.                                                              Appendix 11

POLICING OF SPORTING EVENTS; THE STATUTORY AND COMMON LAW BACKGROUND

                           OF POLICE INVOLVEMENT

     IOTKODtCTION

1.   The involvement of the police at sporting events, and in particular

     at football matches, has developed incrementally throughout the

     20th Century.   Policies have been adapted to cater for increased

     attendances, but more particularly as a consequence of specific

     incidents involving disorder, injury and death amongst spectators.

     Such incidents have prompted changes in the management, adminis­

     tration and legislation of the game, with the result that policing

     philosophy has been amended accordingly.



2.   Despite a general increase in the level of police involvement

     throughout this century, the role of the police can, in general,

     be attributed more readily to historical precedence rather than any

     formal administrative or statutory obligation, and this certainly

     remained the case until the mid 1970's.



3.   Prompted, however, by public disquiet at what was seen as obvious

     failings in the ability of the football authorities to maintain

     safety and public order within their own grounds, pressure

     increased for the introduction of legislation to make clubs more

     accountable; and as a consequence, the role of the police became
       more critical as the country went through a period of recurring

       disorder at football matches.



3.4.   In 1975 the Safety of Sports Grounds Act was introduced, which was

       to be the forerunner of further legislative measures which proved

       to be necessary throughout the following decade.



3.5.   As far as the latter is concerned, whilst statutory law has had an

       important influence on the role of the police at football matches,

       of equal importance has been changes in social behaviour and

       attitudes which have, over the years, 'moulded' the police response

       to such events.



3.6.   It is therefore appropriate that the following section of this

       report should be concerned with a summarised analysis of the main

       events which have occurred this century and which have had a

       bearing on the present policing philosophy at football matches.



       HISTORICAL EVENTS 1923 - 1989



       1922: Ihe Shortt Report (Caimand 2088)                                APPENDIX
                                                                                   12
3.7.   On the 28 April 1923, a large scale disorder took place at Wembley

       Stadium during the first Cup Final, as a result of which, the Right

       Honourable Edward Shortt, KC, was asked to form a Conmittee of

       Enquiry to examine arrangements to deal with abnormally large

       attendances which were becoming part of such occasions.



3.8.   Despite the passage of time since the enquiry, one of the general

       principles identified by Shortt has been generally upheld by subse­
         quent enquiries and committees over the years.    This relates to the

         'demarcation of responsibility' between police and football clubs,

         on which the committee reported that:

              "As regards the general question of the apportion­

              ment of responsibility inside the ground as bet­

              ween the police and the ground authority, the

              principle to be followed should, in our judge­

             ment, be that the police should be responsible

             for all matters appertaining to the preservation

             of law and order, and that for arrangements for

             the convenience of the public, the ground

             authority should be responsible."



3.9.    On the subject of stewards, the report stated:

             "We consider it desirable, in the interests of

             safety, that for the purposes of handling a

             crowd, stewards should be employed in any case

             where the crowd is likely to approach the capacity

             of the ground."



        Heme Office Letter 44694/11

3.10.   Following publication of the Shortt Report, on the 6 November 1924       APPENDIX
                                                                                       13
        the Secretary of State for the Heme Department, forwarded a letter

        to Chief Constables, which in effect created non—statutory guide­

        lines, vis a vis, the role of the police at sporting events, and

        which contained (amongst others), the following recommendation:

             "Chief Constables are not likely to overlook the

             importance of ensuring that on all occasions when

            a large crowd is expected to assemble in a res­
            tricted area, there should be the closest
      liaison between the police, the ground authori­

     ties and the traffic undertakings...the remarks

     contained in these paragraphs which relate

     specially to the duties of the police in and

     around sports grounds are, in the Secretary of

     State's opinion, deserving of careful study, and

     will, he thinks, be found useful as a general

     statement of the responsibilities of the police

     on the one hand and of the management of the

     sports grounds on the other."



A copy of this letter was received at Sheffield and was circulated

as a policy document on 10 November 1924.



1946: The Molewyn Hughes Report (Command 6846)                        APPENDIX 14

On the 9 March 1946, 33 people were killed at Bolton Wanderers

football ground, after more spectators had been admitted than had

been anticipated.   The subsequent report into the disaster made a

number of recommendations, primarily concerned with ground safety,

and for the first time it was recommended by an 'official body'

that sports grounds should be licensed, and that the Local Author­

ity was the appropriate body to undertake such a task, with the

issue of a licence depending upon satisfactory compliance with an

agreed criteria.



Police Act 1964 Section 15(1)                                         APPENDIX 15

This Act covers a range of issues affecting police, but is particu­

larly relevant to this submission, through the inclusion of

Section 15(1), which allows Chief Constables the statutory pro­
vision of providing police services for payment:

     "The Chief Officer of Police of any Police Force
    may provide, at the request of any person

     special police Services at any premises or at

     any locality in the police area for which the

     Force is maintained, subject to the payment to

     the Police Authority of charges on such scales

     as may be determined by that Authority."



Operationally, this section has enabled Chief Constables to pro­

vide a police presence at sporting occasions (including football

matches) and to recover payment from the club on behalf of the

Police Authority.



1966: The Chester Report                                                APPENDIX 16

The 1960's saw a disturbing increase in football violence, as a

result of which, an enquiry was commissioned to enquire into the

state of Association Football at all levels.    The enquiry had wide

terms of reference, and confirmed fears about the increasing level

of violence at football matches, and welcomed the initiative of a

Birmingham Research Group, under Doctor J. A. Harrington, who were

already conducting a more in-depth study of these problems.



1968: A Preliminary Report on Soccer Hooliganism -                     APPENDIX 17

Birmingham Research Group

The report by the Birmingham Research Group, led by Doctor J. A.

Harrington, was perhaps the first definitive analysis on soccer

violence, and examined the problems in seme depth.    Harrington

found that violence had become a serious problem at football

matches, with many of the sample interviews identifying hooliganism

as the main reason for them not visiting football matches.
Harrington examined existing conditions in football grounds, the

role of the media and various other associated factors.   The report

reinforces the role of the police as a possible deterrent to the

hooligan, and Harrington commented that:

     "We think that the lot of a policeman at a foot­

     ball ground is 1not a happy one1. At times,

     the mere sight of police officers in strength

     seems to antagonise and inflame the crowd, and

     whilst the reverse can apply, policemen do not

     seem to get much support from the crowd in

     trying to carry out their duties."

Harrington reccmmended a number of measures to ccmbat the problems

of hooliganism, including the separation of rival fan groups in

different pens, the proper use of appeals over the public address

system, the prohibition of banners and weapons, restrictions on

the sale of alcohol, and measures to make it more difficult for

fans to invade the pitch.   In respect of the responsibility of

the police, it was considered that:

     "'Division of responsibility' should be more

     clearly defined, and senior police officers

     should be able to decide the number of police

     required, and also able to insist on this num­

     ber being employed.    A payment of special duty

     rates might impose a burden on seme small clubs,

     but we feel that crowd control should be given

     priority without giving consideration to the

     finances and other virtues of the club..."
1969: The Lang Report                                                   APPENDIX 18

The Lang Report was instituted as a result of the findings revealed

by Harrington, and was constituted primarily of members of the

Football League, Football Association and the Sports Council.      In

respect of division of responsibility between police and football

clubs, this report reinforced (generally) the previous findings of

Shortt(see para. 3.7. above); responsibility for controlling crowd

behaviour being divided between the police and the club operating

the ground.   The report suggested that the broad line of division

should distinguish the police responsibility for the movement of

spectators in public thoroughfares, and the responsibility of the

club for the control of spectators once 'in' or 'on' club

premises.



The report also recommended 'all ticket' games where matches were

likely to produce a 'full house', and made a number of other

recommendations.



1972: The Wheatley Report (Command 4952)                                APPENDIX 19

Following the disaster at Ibrox Park where 66 spectators died, The

Right Honourable Lord Wheatley was appointed to undertake an

enquiry into crowd safety at sports grounds.



The enquiry was critical of the slow rate of progress of football

clubs, who, by 'self regulation1, had not reached a reasonable

level of acceptability in respect of either ground conditions or

the general safety of spectators.   The committee reiterated the

overall responsibility of football clubs and stated that:
                  "The public pay for admission to a football

                  ground, therefore there is a duty on the club

                  to see that the ground is safe for those who

                  pay for admission.   In other fields of enter­

                  tainment, similar considerations have led to a

                  system of licensing by Local Authority, there is

                  accordingly no good reason why football grounds

                  should not be similarly dealt with.   It would

                  simply mean extending a well established system

                 to football grounds.11



    3.23.   As a consequence, the committee recommended that a system be

            adopted of statutory licensing, concluding that:

                 "There is nothing new in this proposal, it has

                 been mooted for almost 50 years, it can ccme as

                 no surprise to the football world, and in the

                 light of happenings over the years, the demand

                 for an independent appraisal and determination

                 of the safety of grounds becomes almost irres-

                 istable, I certainly cannot resist it."



    3.24.   The appendices to Lord Wheatley1s report contained technical

            information on the proposals in respect of ground safety, which has

            become known as the 'Green Guide1, and will be referred to in

            subsequent sections of this report.



            Ihe Safety of Sports Grounds Act of 1975

    3.25.   Following what was perceived as a general deterioration in stan-

            dards over the years, and consequent to Lord Wheatley's report,

*           in 1975 the Safety of Sports Grounds Act was introduced, the main
purpose of which was to place a statutory requirement for any

sports stadium which, in the opinion of the Secretary of State,

had accommodation for more than 10,000 spectators, to be licensed.



As far as the police were concerned, in addition to the basic

requirement for statutory licensing, the Act also contained two

sections which were of relevance to the policing of (in particular

football matches)

(a)    Section 10(1) of the Act provides that if a

       court is satisfied on the application of the

       Local Authority that the risk to spectators at

       sports grounds is so great that until steps have

       been taken to reduce it to a reasonable level,

       their admission ought to be prohibited or res­

       tricted, the court may, by order, prohibit or

       restrict...the admission of spectators in any

       part of the ground until such steps have   been

       taken as...are necessary to reduce the risk to

       a reasonable level.



 (b)   Section 11 provides a power of entry and inspec­

       tion to such grounds by a person authorised by

       (amongst others) a Chief Officer of Police, who

       may, on production, if so required, of his

       authority, enter a sports ground at any

       reasonable time and make such inspection of it

       and such enquiries relating to it as he con­

       siders necessary for the purposes of this Act,

       and in particular may examine records of atten-
     dances at the ground and records relating to the

     maintenance of safety of the ground and take

     copies of such records.

This Act, therefore, provides the police with a statutory

authority to make representations to the local Authority where it

is considered that danger exists to spectators at a sporting event;

and for the police to enter certain sports grounds for the purpose

of ensuring compliance with the Act.



1976: The McELhone Report                                            APPENDIX   21

Having experienced similar problems as English clubs, in October

1976, the Secretary of State for Scotland appointed a working group

to examine football crowd behaviour.



The group concluded that part of the problem was exacerbated by

the age and conditions which existed at football grounds, but also

identified a number of other factors, including the behaviour of

spectators and shortcomings amongst certain football clubs.



The enquiry reinforced the necessity to separate rival supporters

and of the need to erect physical barriers to prevent pitch

invasion.   In addition, McElhone also recommended that the police

should have statutory powers of search in respect of persons

entering football grounds.




Ccnmittee of Enquiry into Crowi Safety and Control at                 APPENDIX 22

Sports Grounds - Interim and Final Reports 1985/6 (Command 9710)

May 1985 was perhaps one of the worst months in soccer history,
with the fire at Bradford and events at Birmingham on the 11 May,

closely followed by the riots at Heysel Stadium in'Brussels on the

29 May, all resulting in heavy casualities amongst spectators who

had attended at the various grounds.



Following these events, the committee was asked to recanmend what

(if any) further steps should be taken, including any that may be

necessary (using additional powers) to improve crowd safety and

crowd control at sports grounds.



The committee considered that the Safety of Sports Grounds Act

1975, had been successful in securing improvements in safety to

those grounds which had been designated for certification.   The

enquiry felt, however, that the scope of the act was too limited,

and noted that the only premises which had been designated were

mainly football stadia belonging to Divisions 1 and 2, which had

accommodation for over 10,000 spectators.   It was recommended

therefore, that the Act should be extended to cover other sports

grounds, and that, in addition, any premises having a capacity in

excess of 500, should be designated under the Fire Precautions Act

1971, as premises requiring a Fire Certificate.



Of particular relevance to the police is the examination by the

Conmittee of Enquiry of 'The Green Guide' (see para. 3.24. above),

which formed a framework for the management and control of crowds

at sporting events.   The guide provides advice on a number of

issues, including the construction of football grounds, inspec­

tions, ingress and egress, perimeter fencing, fire precautions,

communications, crowd behaviour and respective management responsi-
bilities.



In respect of crcwd behaviour, the ccnmittee reccnmended that

whilst segregation should not be encouraged in other sports;

     "the concensus was that clear differentiation

     of opposing fans (for ancillary facilities)

     remain the only viable and prudent course so

     long as crowd violence remained at current

     levels; and the best way to achieve such differ­

     entiation was by spatial separation and physical

     containment of opposing groups."



On the question of the relevant responsibilities of police and

stewards, the group felt that the guide ought to make it plain

that it was a club's responsibility to control and manage spec­

tators in normal circumstances, and that the police presence (if

there was one) was to deal with the law and order problems and

provide support and leadership in emergencies.



Furthermore, in subsequent sections of his report, Mr.Justice

Popplewell specifies quite clearly what he considersto be the

role and responsibilities of the police at sporting events;

     "I made it clear in my interim report that the

     state of the premises and the conduct of the

     event therein, is not the responsibility of the

     police, a club is a commercial organisation

    which is run for profit, and its legal status is

    little different from that of a person who

    organises a pop concert, a garden party or many
      other private events.    Because, as a matter of

     practice, police officers have regularly atten­

     ded in large numbers at football grounds, it

     has somehow been assumed by the clubs that the

     responsibility for control of what goes on inside

     the ground has passed from them to the police.

     A police presence is there to assist in enforce­

     ment of law and order.     Those responsible for

     organising a private function, however, have the

     primary and continuing obligation and responsi­

     bility to ensure reasonable safety for those who

     are invited onto their premises.     This responsi­

     bility, which is a legal responsibility, con­

     tinues throughout the time that those vtfio they

     have invited onto their ground remain there.

     It does not, for instance, cease when an emer­

     gency arises.     The police responsibility is to

     preserve law and order.    When an emergency

     arises they are likely to be the only body there

     who are capable of dealing with it.    They have

     the facilities.    They have the training.   They

     have the authority.    As I have said in my interim

     report, the police have to take the de facto

     responsibility of organising the crowd with all

    that entails."



In respect of evacuation procedures, Mr. Justice Popplewell defined
the police responsibility as follows:

     "It is agreed generally that evacuation pro­

     cedures, at major grounds at any rate, should

     be the subject of pre-planning, involving the

     club and its stewards, the local fire service

     (whose experience in evacuation is second to

     none) and the police....thus whilst it is

     important that the police should treat evacua­

     tion procedure as a matter for training and

     briefing, they do that in order more readily to

     assist the owners of a private club to carry

     out their responsibility, as they should any

     other private organisation in an emergency, and

     not as a result of a legal responsibility

     resting upon the police.   It cannot be too

     strongly emphasised that it is upon the club or

     the occupier of a ground who is putting on the

     function, that the primary and continuing

     obligation rests."



The final report of the Committee of Enquiry made a large number of

recommendations which subsequently led to further legislation

to cover many of the points raised.



Heme Office Circular No. 54/1985                                    APPENDIX 23

Following publication of the interim report by Mr. Justice

Popplewell, the Heme Office published Circular No. 54/1985 on the

29 July 1985, which was sent to Chief Executives and Chief Officers

of Police, and which sought to inform the recipients

of the recommendations of the enquiry, and to urge a quick and
        constructive response to the matters contained therein.




3.41.   In respect of the police, Chief Officers of Police were asked to,

        (a)   Consider how evacuation procedures at individual

              grounds can be best incorporated into police

              training to form part of a pre-event briefing.

        (b)   Continued provision for police representation

              within Local Authority teams, for issuing

              safety certificates.

        (c)   Control the management of sports grounds where

              police presence is required at an event for

              crcwd control within the ground, about the

              training of stewards and how best to assist the

              police in evacuation.

        (d)   Consider in colaboration with Local Authority

              and sports ground management, how to assist in

              manning exit gates.



        Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol, etc.) Act 1985                 APPENDIX 24

3.42.   The Act was introduced in response to Mr. Justice Popplewell's

        interim report, and restricted the sale/possession of alcohol

        as follows:

        (a)   On public service vehicles or railway passenger

              vehicles primarily used for the carriage of

              passengers for the whole or part of a journey

              to or from a designated sporting event.

        (b)   Any person in or entering or trying to enter a

              designated sporting event.
(c) At licensed premises or registered club premises

     situated within the area of a designated sports

     ground, two hours preceding the event and one

     hour afterwards.



The Sports Grounds and Sporting Events (Designation) Order 1985     APPENDIX 25

This Order came into effect on the 9 August 1985, and provided

for an an extension of 'designated' sports grounds.    The

Order provided that all heme grounds of football clubs who are

members of the Football Association and any other ground used

occasionally or temporarily by such club should be 'designated'.



Heme Office Circular 5/1986                                         APPENDIX 26

In respect of Mr. Justice Popplewell's final recommendations, the

Home Office issued to County and Metropolitan Councils, Fire and

Civil Defence authorities, and Chief Officers of Police, Heme

Office Circular 5/1986 dealing solely with the safety aspects

of the conmittee's final recommendations. The circular refers

to the 'Green Guide', stating that in accordance with the

enquiry recommendations, this was being revised accordingly.


                                                                    APPENDIX 27
Public Order Act 1986

On the 1 August 1987, relevant sections of this Act were brought

into force as a consequence of the Popplewell Enquiry, which

provided for courts to make Exclusion Orders upon conviction

of offenders for certain types of offences set out in the Act.

These offences include any offence involving the use or threat of

violence, or disorderly conduct by individuals at prescribed

football matches, or travelling thereto, as well as offences

committed against the provisions of the Sports Events (Control of
Alcohol) Act 1985.



As far as the police are concerned, this Act places an obligation

upon the police to photograph relevant offenders and to provide

the necessary administrative support in respect of the photographs,

the retention and disemination of Exclusion Orders within their own

force, and to other interested forces.



Fixe Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987                    APPENDIX 28

This Act received Royal assent on the 15 May 1987 and contained

five separate parts.



It was introduced in the main to amend the Safety of Sports Grounds

Act 1975, in line with the government's proposals contained in the

consultative document published in June 1986, in response to the

safety reconmendations of the Popplewe11 Inquiry.



The Act covered the inspection of sports grounds and the issuing

of safety certificates for stands with covered accommodation for

500 or more spectators.



'The Green Guide1'and Heme Office Circular 75/1986                   APPENDIX 29

The revised ’Green Guide1 was published in response to Mr.

Justice Popplewell's recarmendations, and contains the various

amendments recoirmended by the Carmittee of Enquiry.



The guide is divided into 17 sections, and in respect of crowd

control (Section 14) defines the role of the police as follows:

     "As in other areas of safety, management is
 responsible for crowd control arrangements and

 ground conditions. They should ensure that

 spectators are safe, bearing in mind that a game

 can lead to a build up of tension or excitement.

 The safety measures described elsewhere in this

 guide will hope to achieve reasonable spectator

 safety, but for management to discharge its

 responsibility properly, a special police

 presence inside the ground may be necesary to

 deal with any problem of disorder which may

 arise, as well as to provide support and leader­

 ship in an emergency.   The number and dispo­

 sition of the police must be determined by the

Chief Constables, who have the sole responsi­

bility for the direction of police operations.

To aid the police in their duties, a police

control room should be provided within the
ground.

Proper advanced planning with the police is

essential to counter potential crowd disorder.

There must be an effective liaison between club

and police for this purpose, to include not just

the arrangements inside the ground, but also the

escort of visiting supporters, their likely

numbers, their separate entry to the ground,

and their departure at the end of the match.

There should be de-briefing meetings as necessary

to evaluate existing arrangements and provide

the flexibility necessary to deal with different
             circumstances."



        Heme Office Circular 75/1986                                        APPENDIX 30

3.52.   This circular sumnarised the changes which had been made to

        the 'Green Guide' and reiterated the greater emphasis placed

        on management responsibility (Chapter 2) and the additional

        advice on the role of stewards (Chapter 23).



3.53.   On the subject of management responsibility, the 'Green Guide'

        reiterates the previous comments of Mr. Justice Popplewell, i.e.

             "The safety of the public inside the ground is

             the responsibility of those who stage the event

             and administer the ground in which it is held,

             i.e. the management.   This responsibility

             applies in both normal and emergency situations.

             Local Authority Safety Officers, Fire and Police

             Officers will help management to discharge this

             responsibility and in certain circumstances may

             require measures to be taken in order to achieve

             reasonable safety standards, but the management

             is not thereby absolved of its responsibility

             for the safety of its customers."

3.54.   The new section on stewarding has a bearing on police involvement

        inside the ground, and the duties of the stewards are defined as

        follows:

             "Manning levels and steward requirements will

             vary depending upon the size and configuration

             of the ground, the nature of the event, and

             crowd levels, but there are five basic duties
               which stewards are called upon to carry out.

               These are:-

               (a)   Controlling or directing members of the

                     public who are entering or leaving the

                     ground, to help achieve an even flow of

                     people to the viewing areas, and safe dis­

                     posal of spectators on the terraces or

                     viewing slopes.

               (b) Controlling the ground to deal with any

                     emergency, e,g, raising alarms or extingui­

                     shing fires.

              (c) Manning entrances, exits and other strategic

                     points, especially exit doors and gates

                     which are not continuously open whilst the

                     ground is in use.

              (d)    Assisting police as appropriate or as

                     requested, with crowd control; and

              (e)    Undertaking specific duties in an emergency."

        Statutory Instruments.

3.55.   These circulars amended parts of the Safety of Sports Grounds

        Act of 1975, in line with the recoirmendations of the Popplewell

        Enquiry, the main changes being as follows:

        (a)   The distinction between a sports 'ground1 and

              sports 'stadium' was removed, allowing both

              categories to be dealt with in a similar manner.

        (b)   Empowers the Secretary of State to vary the desig­

              nated threshold of 10,000 under Section 1 of the
(c)   Precludes conditions in safety certificates

      relating to police presence, unless the extent

      of the presence is reserved for the Chief Officer

      of Police.

(d)   Directs appeals under Section 5 of the 1975 Act

      to the courts.

(e)   Replaces the emergency procedure under Section

      10 (see para. 3.26. above), by introducing prohibition

      notices in the case of the serious risk to

      spectators and provision to appeal against them.

(f)   Replaces a duty on Local Authorities to enforce

      the 1975 Act and to arrange for annual inspec­

      tions of designated sports grounds, in accor­

      dance with guidance frcm the Secretary of State.



Hctne Office Circulars No.'s 96 and 97/1988 and Associated          APPENDIX 32

Statutory Instruments

Heme Office Circular 96/88 provides a system of safety

certification for stands determined by the Local Authority

as being able to hold 500 or more spectators under cover.    Certifi­

cation remains a matter for the Local Authority, who would normally

seek advice from the police, the fire service and other agencies.



Heme Office Circular 97/88 provides statutory guidance

to Local Authorities in discharging their function in

connection with their legislation.   This is primarily of a tech­

nical nature and as such is not immediately relevant to the police.
Summary of Police Involvement in Sporting Events 1923-1989

The involvement of the police in sporting events during the early

part of this century was initially carried out on an ad hoc basis

until the publication of the Heme Office Letter on the 6 November

1924, which provided Chief Constables with formal (albeit fairly

basic) guidelines for the provision of policing arrangements at

such events.



However, as spectator attendances at football matches increased,

problems connected with safety and public order became more prev­

alent, and these led to a plethora of ccranittees and enquiries

which made various recoimiendations for varying degrees of extra

supervision, these being summarised in the preceding sections of

this submission.



The 1970's saw a turning point in that for the first time, legis­

lation was enacted to provide a statutory system of licensing at

designated football stadia, which also gave the police certain

rights of entry.



The last decade has been a period of turmoil for football in

general, with a number of serious occurrences leading to the

Popplewell Enquiry in 1985.   Arising frcm that enquiry, further

legislation has been enacted which has now provided the police and

other bodies involved specific powers which were previously not

available.



One further matter of direct relevance to this submission covers

a decision taken by the South Yorkshire Police during the early
            1980's to make a substantial increase in police charges to the

            clubs concerned, in view of the increased police commitment to

            football in the county.     Perhaps not unnaturally, this was

            received with some resentment and in one particular case one of

            the clubs involved, Sheffield United, accrued debts in excess of

            £50,000, and refused to pay the outstanding charges.



    3.63.   Negotiations failed to resolve the dispute, and on Monday 3

            February 1986, a hearing commenced at Sheffield Crown Court

            before the Honourable Mr. Justice Boreham, at which (the then)

            South Yorkshire County Council sought legal sanctions to redeem

            the debt.



    3-64.   The case was concerned not only with charges levied by the

            police, but also at the status and responsibilities of the

            police in the discharge of their responsibilities at sporting

            events.     After receiving submissions from both sides, judgement   APPENDIX 33

            was delivered on the 26 March 1986, in which the Judge made the

            following observations:

            (a)   The Chief Constable has a duty to preserve the

                  peace by preventing crime and arresting those

                  who break the law.   He also has a duty to

                  prevent any individual action which may result

                  in a breach of the peace, but it is not his

                  public duty to protect against the mere

                  preservation of possible crime.

            (b)   Special services are those beyond the call of

                  public duty, within the powers of the police




#
as able to be performed without prejudice to

that public duty.

Similarity between tasks performed on special

services and tasks performed in pursuance of

public duty does not preclude those services

from being special police services.

The football club invites large     numbers of

people on to their premises, on payment and

for their own purposes, in circumstances

where those people might become very excited.

The club, therefore, creates for themselves

a special risk of trouble and breaches of

the peace, thus a special need for protection.

The service offered to the club was one which

the oridinary citizen would not expect and to

which he was clearly not entitled.

In addition to their public law and order role,

officers on this special service were expected

to take part in crowd management, crowd safety,

enforcement of the club's regulations, and to

assist in the event of any emergency.

The numbers of officers necessary to carry out

the service could only be provided by calling

on officers who at the material times would

otherwise have been off duty.   Otherwise, the

public might be deprived of the police protec­

tion to which they were entitled.

The services provided to the club were there­

fore special police services within the meaning
                of Section 15 of the Police Act 1964 and their

                provision was on condition that they were paid

                for.




 3.65.    In addition to the above points, Mr Justice Boreham also made

          reference to the arrangements made between the police and the

          five football clubs and continued:

                  In July and August of each year, the senior

                 police officer responsible for the policing

                 operations meet the Chairman and Secretaries

                 of each of the five clubs, together they

                 review the policing arrangements made during

                 the previous season, discuss problems which

                 have arisden and consider the policing require­

                 ments for the forthcoming season.   When the

                 season begins, the Divisional Commander in

                whose area a particular ground is situated,

                discusses with the club the number of uni­

                formed officers required for each home game.

                Those numbers depend, in part, on the expec­

                ted size of the crowd and in part on the

                number and reputation of the visitors

                supporters ..... "



3-66.    Following this judgement and the subsequent appeal (ALLER 838      APPENDIX   34

         87 ) the policy in respect of police attendance at football

         matches in South Yorkshire was changed and on the 26 June 1987 a

         meeting took place between representatives of the five football

         clubs and members of the South Yorkshire Police Authority.
At that meeting, the Authority proposed the introduction of         APPENDIX 35

written contracts between the police, the football club and the

South Yorkshire Police Authority, and the clubs were invited to

comment upon a draft contract based on a similar document used

by the Metropolitan Police which had previously been circulated.



The clubs did not object in principle to the introduction of

contracts and further discussions   took place which were con­

cerned with matters of detail rather than substance.



Contracts have subsequently been introduced to all five clubs,

and are signed prior to the commencement of each football

season. It is stipulated within that police manning levels are

the responsibility of the Superintendent of Police, with the

Chief Constable retaining absolute operational control.     A

specimen copy of the agreement is included with the appendices.     APPENDIX 36



In November 1987 a revised Force Standing Order was published       APPENDIX 37

concerning the method of raising required manpower for football

events.   The Order tasked 'football liaison officers' in each of

the five territorial divisions with the responsibility of

maintaining close■contact with their respective clubs.



In addition, divisional commanders, in consultation with the

'football liaison officer', are required, at the beginning of

each season, to provisionally categorise all football matches,

as follows:
                 (A)      -   Such matches as FA Cup Semi Finals and

                               International Fixtures, where known.

                               The Superintendent (Operations Division)

                               will be involved in the planning of these

                              matches

                 (B)      -   Any match at which public order problems

                              can seriously be anticipated.

                 (C)      -   Any match which is non-cont entious, when

                              the minimum police commitment will be at

                              the discretion of the Divisional Comman­

                              der, bearing in mind the guidance in

                              Standing Instructions for the Policing

                              of Football Matches.

      3-72.     At the same time, other factors are taken into consideration,

                e.g.numbers of visiting supporters, anticipated behaviour, etc.

                after which the number of officers to be deployed is decided.

                The amount to be paid by the club is estimated on a 'sliding

                scale     of charges based upon the number of spectators in atten­

                dance.



(|^   3 -73 -   It should be noted, however, that certain types of association

                football matches are not covered by this agreement, including

                F.A. Cup Matches not involving the club where the match is being

                played.



      3.74.     Consequently, the Semi Final on the 15 April I989 was not

                subject to contracted agreement.     Before the match took place,

                the Football Association published written guidelines for 'Semi      APPENDIX 38

                Final Arrangements', which contained basic information for clubs
        which were either competing in or staging the event.

        In respect of the police, the guide advised that clubs should:

              "Arrange for an adequate number.to be provided

              to control the crowds, both inside and outside

              the ground, according to your normal practice."



3-75.   Coincidentally, the same teams had also reached the semi final

        in 1988, which was held at the same venue.   On that occasion

        meetings took place between police and club officials to esti­

        mate manning requirements.   The Operational Order proved to be    APPENDIX 39

        entirely satisfactory, and as a result the same arrangements

        were repeated in 1989-



3-76.   In conclusion, therefore, it is felt that the judgement

        delivered by Mr. Justice Boreham, whilst primarily concerned

        with payment for special police services under Section 15 of the

        Police Act 1964, is relevant to this submission, as it also

        embodies the main principles, vis the responsibility of the

        police in the discharging of their functions at sporting events

        to which this proof of evidence is particularly directed.

Hillsborough has            been the           setting of major sporting

events        for   many    years        and    has    staged        Semi    Finals

during that time.                 During the past            15 years        it has

been the        venue      for    Semi    Finals       on eight occasions,

the events being as follows:

The    gaps     between       1976     and     1980,     and    1981    and    1987

were     as     a    result       of   the      location        of     the    Clubs

scheduled to play the Semi Finals.                        In particular the

clubs were not based in close proximity to Sheffield

and, consequently,               the   Semi     Finals     were       located    in

more convenient’areas of the country.                               So far as the

second gap is concerned, additional problems involved

complaints          from   local       residents       who     had     previously

suffered       the    brunt       of     the    effects        of    large    scale

football        matches,          which        clearly     disturbed          their

tranquility of life.
       PLANNING - GENERAL

4.3    As with all major events being policed in the South

       Yorkshire area the responsibility for planning falls

       to the Divisional Commander under whose                          jurisdiction

       the event takes place.                 The Assistant Chief Constable

       (Operations)           has      an     overall        responsibility           and

       oversees the planning of these events.                         So far as the

       Semi Finals are concerned, these have all been staged

       at Hillsborough in the Sheffield North Division,                               the

       'F' Division of the Force under the direction of the

       Divisional Commander.

 .4    In the     planning        of   such events           reference       has   to be

       made    to the       'Standing Instructions              for the Policing            Appendix 4 q

       of     Football        Matches'        issued     as     a     Force        Policy

       document, previous events staged at the same location

       and    intelligence          concerning     the        forthcoming          event.

       All matters       contained in the              "ACPO Sub Committee on

       Hooliganism       at      Sporting     Events     - Guide        to    Policing

       Football"       were       considered     and     where       relevant        were

       incorporated in the plan.                A copy of this document is

       included in the Appendices.                                                          Appendix 41

       discussed       at     Senior        Officers    meetings         during       the

       season    and        at      the       end of the        season,       when any

PLANNING 1988 SEMI FINAL

As can be seen above the              1988    Semi Final         staged at

Hillsborough        involved      Liverpool           and        Nottingham
Forest.            Coincidentally,                the    1989    scheduled          Semi

Final     involved the                same clubs.           In view of this it

was     possible              to    draw     on    the    experiences          of    the

previous year and to make particular reference to the

Operational Order prepared for the event in 1988 and                                        Appendix 42
the Intelligence Report prepared for that year.                                             Appendix 43



The    1988        Intelligence              stated      that    when      Liverpool

played at Tottenham                   2000 Liverpool fans were locked

out    and ran           riot       outside       the ground,        stealing from

shops and causing public annoyance.                             To this end, the

formulation              of        Serials       included       officers        giving

special attention to shopping areas, to counter such

eventualities.                 This contingency was repeated in the

1989 Order.



The planning of the                   1988       Semi Final      had been under

the direction of the then Divisional Commander, Chief                                      Statement 2

Superintendent                Mole.        The    officer had also been              in

command       of    the       Division       the previous            year when the

1987 match involving Coventry and Leeds City was held

at Hillsborough and he too had arranged the planning

for    that    event.               The    continuity       of command was           of

benefit in planning both the events in question and

in particular the Deputy at 'F' Division in 1988 was

Superintendent Marshall, who was still the Deputy in

'F' Division in 1989.                       Both officers took an active

part    in         the        1988        Semi     Final,       in     that     Chief

Superintendent            Mole        was    in    overall      command        of   the

operation      and        Superintendent            Marshall         was   a   Sector      Statement 4
 Commander responsible for policing the ground sector

 of the operation. it should be pointed out that in the

 last    3 years       the operation has been divided                into     3

 sectors under the command of a Superintendent,                         that

being     (i) the      Ground Sector,         (ii) the Leppings Lane

side of the Stadium and (iii) the Penistone road side

of the Stadium.



In planning terms it is important to liaise with all

interested          parties,          including        the       Football

Association,       The     Club,     Fire and Ambulance         Services,

The Transport Representatives and Traffic Management.

In addition        there      is   continuous      liaison    with     other

Divisions    of     the    Force who will          be affected by the

operation,       and    the    support   services     in the     form of

catering and administration.



It   is a fact that on              9 August 1988,     Superintendent

Murray,    'FI' Sub Divisional Commander, had a meeting                            Statement 5
with the Deputy Chief Ambulance Officer, Mr Hopkins,

Assistant    Chief        Ambulance      Officer      (Operations)       Mr

Jones,    of the South Yorkshire Ambulance                   Service and

Assistant    Divisional            Officer,   Mr    Rowlands,    of     the

South    Yorkshire        Fire     Service.     The   purpose     of    the

meeting    was    to    re-establish      further     liaison     in the

event of a major disaster occurring at the Sheffield

Wednesday Football            Club Ground.         The report of this

meeting is included in the attached Appendices.                                   Appendix 44
Because       of     the        manner     in    which        Semi     Finals are

determined,         there is often little time to plan these

operations.                 The          usual        .time     period         being

approximately          3 - 4          weeks.         In view of this           it is

essential that early action is taken to determine the

manpower       level       required        to    police       the     Stadium and

this is one of the first priorities in planning.



Following       consultation             with    all     interested parties,

the    examination          of        available       intelligence       and     the

drawing       together          of     experience        of    policing        other

similar     events         the manpower          levelfor policing               the

1988    Semi       Final    inside        and    outside       the     ground was

determined and set at 928 officers.



The event took place with little or no difficulty and

was    generally       described          as     a    successful       operation.

In    the   course         of    a     de-brief       certain       aspects     were

identified which may have a bearing on future events

and    these       were         noted.          The     de-brief       notes     are

included       in the       Appendices.               In particular,          though

not recorded in the de-brief, it was highlighted that

some resources were under employed in and around the

ground,     particularly              in peripheral           areas.      Much    of

this was as a result of the general change in policy

for    policing       Semi        Finals        in    that    during          normal

matches        officers          are used for more than                  one role

and     are        moved        to different           locations       during    the

various phases         of the match.                  In the         case of Semi

Finals it was decided all officers would be allocated

a    specific       task        and    would     remain       with     that     task
 throughout         the     operation,         the     intention             being      to

 ensure that the police had the control of all aspects

 both    inside      and     outside      the     ground          throughout           the

 operation         in an effort          to thwart          those       individuals

 intent on causing disorder or attempting to enter the

 ground without tickets.                  This policy was found to be

 sound in that it prevented anticipated roaming gangs

of    disappointed          supporters         causing       disorder          during

the     match.            However,       as     stated,          the     levels        of

officers       available           was        found    to        be      excessive,

particularly         at     the     Liverpool         end    of        the    Stadium

where       this     type     of     activity         was        expected         as    a

consequence          of     their     reputation            and        considerable

following of supporters.                  Additionally, the number of

CID     officers     outside        the    ground      was        found      to   have

been excessive.             The other areas             raised in the de­

brief were attended to and are dicussed at paragraphs

4.53, 4.84 to         4.88.

SEGREGATION - STRATEGY AND REASONS

It should be pointed out at this stage that due to

the geographical layout of the ground, Liverpool were

allocated less tickets that Nottingham and therefore

the     fear        of-    greater        numbers           of        disappointed

spectators          was     anticipated           with           the     Liverpool

supporters.


To amplify,         the main        arterial      roads          (A61 and A616)

and the exits from the Ml motorway (junctions 36, 35A

and   35)    for    traffic        travelling         from the          north,       all

feed the north            side of the          ground.           Similarly,          the

main arterial roads (A616 and A57) and the motorway
exits (29, 30, 31 and 34) for traffic travelling from

the     south,    all     feed       the   south    side     of    the       ground.

The     natural    arrival          routes   of     supporters          therefore

lend themselves to a Middlewood Road and Halifax Road

approach to the ground from Livepool and Herries Road

or Penistone Road approach from Nottingham.


The     area     within        the     ground       having        the        largest

capacities        are    the       Spion   Kop     (21000)       and    the     West

Stand and Terraces              (14565).         The former is accessed

via Penistone           Road North turnstiles and South Stand

car park turnstiles and the latter via Leppings Lane

turnstiles .


With natural approach routes in mind,                         the Spion Kop

lends    itself to Nottingham Forest                   supporters whilst

the     West      Stand        and     Terraces      to      the        Liverpool

supporters.


Giving     priority           to     segregation,          the     fact        that

Nottingham Forest supporters will utilize South Stand

car park turnstiles,                 it logically follows that they

should also occupy the South Stand as turnstiles to

that area are also in that location.


The   North      Stand    is accessed via turnstiles                     both in

Leppings Lane and Penistone Road North, therefore by

closing       those     in     Penistone      Road    North,           the    stand

could    be    used      by    Liverpool      supporters          and    optimum

segregation maintained.
This division of the ground resulted in the combined

capacities for the two segregated areas being:

LIVERPOOL

West Stand                                                 4465

Leppings Lane Terraces                                  10100

North Stand                                                9705



                                                        24270



NOTTINGHAM

Spion Kop                                               21000

South Stand                                                8834



                                                        29834



Additionally         this    decision      is    in   accord      with   the

recommendations of the PopplewellReport, Appendix                        'E'   Appendix

- 'Working group on the Green Guide1, recommendation

57.     Here comment         is made of the need for opposing

fans    to   have     a   clear   differentiation          with     spatial

separation      and       physical      containment        of      opposing

groups.



These   areas    were       therefore      allocated on this          basis

and    any alteration would           have      resulted    in opposing

fans    crossing      each    other     therefore      increasing        the

likelihood      of    disorder       and    in    addition        excessive
disruption to the residents of Sheffield and traffic

chaos     both        before    and      after        the       event.          The

segregation plan attracted                some criticism from both

Liverpool supporters and Liverpool Football Club,                                in

that,    of     necessity,      it meant           that    Liverpool       had    a

smaller allocation of the tickets.                         Nevertheless, as

stated earlier, the event went off without difficulty,

it was considered a successful operation.

PLANNING 1989 SEMI FINAL

On    20 March       1989,     the    South        Yorkshire      Police       were

again approached with a view to the Semi Final being

staged at the Hillsborough Ground on 15 April                              1989,

coincidentally         with     the    same        teams    being     involved.

Bearing in mind the previous years experience, Chief

Superintendent Mole,            'F' Divisional Commander, agreed

that the event could be staged on the same basis as

the   previous        year.      The    same        segregation        plan    was

intended and this brought a protest, via the Football

Association, from Liverpool               Football Club.               The same

arguments       as    the     previous        year    pertained          and   the

Football Association were "advised that the game could

be    staged,    but     on    the     same    terms       as   the    previous

year.     After consideration the Football Association

decided       that      they     would         stage        the       event      at

Hillsborough under these conditions.

It should be emphasized here that the final decision

to    stage     the     Semi    Final         at     Sheffield        Wednesday

Football Club rests with the Football Association.
Following         notification             of    the     game, police          planning

commenced         and       an    initial        meeting       of all        interested

parties      took place             at Hammerton Road Police Station

on Wednesday 22 March 1989.                         The meeting was chaired

by Chief Superintendent                     Mole but he was accompanied

by the then Superintendent Duckenfield, who was to be

promoted on Monday 27 March 1989 and assume command

of     'F'   Division.              Also    present        at    the meeting             was

Superintendent                   Marshall,         Superintendent                 Murray,

Superintendent Chapman and Superintendent Greenwood,

who were identified as the Sector Commanders for the

match on the            15 April          1989.        The      Sector Commanders

were     selected           by    Chief     Superintendent              Mole       due    to

their experience in policing football matches and in

particular             their        previous            involvement            at        the

Hillsborough Stadium.                     All the officers concerned had

been    involved         in       the     1988    Semi     Final.        In general

they were given the same command positions with the

exception              of          Superintendent                Marshall                and

Superintendent Greenwood,                       whose roles were reversed.

In 1988 Superintendent Marshall had been                                  the Ground

Commander         and    Superintendent                Greenwood        had       been    in

command      of     the       Leppings          Lane     end     of    the     Stadium.

Mr     Greenwood            had     a     wide     ranging            experience          of

policing       at        Hillsborough              having         been        a     Chief

Inspector         at    that        Sub    Division.            However,          he     had

since    taken up            command       at     Woodseats       Police          Station

and    his   knowledge             of the        Leppings       Lane     end       of    the
ground and recent experiences was less than that of

Superintendent            Marshall.                    In        view            of        this

Superintendent Marshall undertook to take command of

the     Liverpool    Sector           and      Mr      Greenwood            the        ground

because of his continued knowledge of that aspect of

the Stadium.        In addition to the Sector Commanders

each Superintendent was allocated 2 Chief Inspectors

as Sub Sector Commanders.                      Again these officers were

specially       selected        for       their      knowledge              of    policing

football      and   in    particular             their       knowledge                of    the

Hillsborough        Stadium.              At     the    meeting             discussions

once    again     took    place       concerning             the       allocation            of

areas    to     supporters          but    for the          reasons          previously

explained       it was agreed that the allocations should

be as the previous year.                    In dealing with this aspect

consideration       had        to    be     given       to       the    intelligence

then available as to the current attitude of the fans

from    Liverpool        and    Nottingham.                 In    both           cases      the

behaviour during the season had been relatively good

in respect of both sets of supporters with the

exception of the tendency for pitch invasions in the

case of the Nottingham supporters.



There     was     also     a        pitch        invasion              by        Liverpool

supporters at the end of the 1988 Semi Final and to

this    end     contingencies             were      written        into          the       1989

serial    instructions to increase                      the manpower                  on the

perimeter track at 'full time1.
    4.27   A particular area of concern at the meeting was the

           method       of travel           adopted      by visiting supporters                    and

           experience              indicated       that       the     use       of    trains       and

           particularly special trains was diminishing.                                      It was

           felt     in    this        connection         that        supporters        knew       that

           when travelling by special                         trains they would be met

           by police resources, escorted to the Stadium and made

           to enter straight away.                      It is clear that this is the

           greatest form of control on those spectators and to a

           large extent prevents hooliganism.                               In past years the

           use     of    trains       has      been     more    predominant.                This    is

           somewhat       important            particularly           with      regard       to    the

           Liverpool          supporters           to        whom    the     Wadsley         Bridge

           Railway       Station          on the       north    side        of the ground           is

           made available.                The number of supporters using this

           facility,          the    number       of    trains       and     times     of    trains

           were     not       known       at     this     planning          stage      and    would

           therefore          be    the     subject      of     later       deliberation           and

           introduced into the police strategy.

    4.28   Arrangements were                made       for    planning       to      proceed       and

           further meetings to be held under the chairmanship of

           the      new        Divisional              Commander          who        would        have

           responsibility             for      policing        the    event.          Subsequent

           planning       meetings             under    the     chairmanship            of    Chief

           Superintendent Duckenfield took place on the 29 March

           1989 and 10 April 1989.                      The actual planning team who

           prepared       the       Operational          Order        were      Superintendent

           Murray,       Chief       Inspector          Beal        and     Inspector        Sewell      Statements 3,
                                                                                                         5, 7, 10
           under        the        supervision           of         Chief       Superintendent

MANPOWER

In   view    of   the    need       to    urgently    identify     manpower

requirements      the     task was         embarked upon taking          into

account the following areas

       i)         The need for a level of manpower

                  capable of policing the match and

                  maintaining public order


       ii)        The experience of the previous

                  year and any lessons learned


       iii)       The responsibility of ensuring

                  effective and efficient policing


       iv)        The financial restraints as a

                  consequence of cuts in the police

                  football overtime budget


In     the    light       of        all     these     aspects      manpower

requirements       were         identified          and the       necessary

manpower      level     was    determined       to    be   812    officers.

This   figure represents a cut of some 128                       (13.6%)    on

the previous year.

THE CUTS

So far as the Ground Sector,                 Leppings Lane        Terraces,

West     Stand     and          turnstiles          areconcerned,        the

reduction      amounted        to    only    one     Sergeant.      In     the

Leppings           Lane         outer        section, from         Parkside
 Road     to    the         roundabout       on     Penistone           Road,   the

 reduction       amounted           to    two       Sergeants           and     six

 Constables, these being on static points.



So far as uniformed officers generally are concerned,

the cuts were made              in the reduction in the size of

some operational Serials in that some Serials of one

Sergeant       and     ten     Constables         were     reduced        to    one

Sergeant and eight Constables and likewise Serials of

one Sergeant and six Constables on mobile patrol were

reduced to one Sergeant and five Constables.                               In the

main    the    reductions          were   on      static    Serials        tasked

with policing the roads around the Stadium and not on

those tasked with specific public order duties.                                  In

addition, it was the peripheral areas well away from

the    Stadium which          bore    the greater reductions.                    In

the ground the main reduction was in the form of the

loss of one reserve Serial, ie one Sergeant and ten

Constables.          This reserve Serial had been placed on

standby       duty     in    the     South     Stand       car    park        area,

Penistone       Road    North,        (Nottingham          Forest       end)     in

1988.     The deployment of uniformed officers in 1988

and 1989 in pictorial terms is appended hereto.



In the case of the Criminal Investigation Department

the officers inside the ground remained much as the

previous       year    whereas        those       outside        were     almost
halved.
The total deployment of officers of all ranks in

various roles for 1988 and 1989 were as follows:

The    determination          of manpower               levels    in    connection

with    any   operational           event       has      of    necessity     to    be

based    on   information           available,            experience      and     the

results of the consultative processes embarked upon.

Unfortunately           it        is         not         possible       to      form

contingencies            for            unprecedented              changes         in

behavioural attitudes. However, the intention of any

plan made in this connection is to ensure flexibility

in the deployment of resources and in this case the

same flexibility used in the 1988 plan was reflected

in the 1989 plan.




An      example         would           be         in         considering         the

deployment of manpower to the entrance to the tunnel

giving    access    from          the    rear       of    the    West    Stand     to

both the North and South Centre enclosures.




Whilst   no   Serial         is   deputed to this                specific    duty,

the    Operational       Order          has    inbuilt          flexibility       and

perceived     problems         which      result          in the    request       for

redeployment       of    manpower             can        be    facilitated        via
Ground          Control,           dependant            upon      the       developing

situation.                To       this     end     there        were       7     Serials

consisting           of   7    Sergeants          and    72     Constables        in   the

immediate vicinity of the Leppings Lane turnstiles and

West        Stand.        In       addition,       there        were    two       reserve

Serials of 2 Sergeants and 20 Constables available for

deployment.



OTHER RESOURCES

The manpower referred to in this report involves that

utilized in policing the actual events at Hillsborough

under the command of the Divisional Officer.                                     However,

total       manpower       must      take     account          of other         available

resources,        and in this              regard reference must be made

to    officers        deployed        to     Traffic          Control       duties     and

those deployed in the city centre under the control of

the     'D 1    Division           Divisional           Commander.           Following

previous         experience           the         Divisional        Commander           at

Hillsborough can be more effective if he does not have

to     be      concerned           with     the    logistics           of    directing

traffic        and escorting it to the ground.                              In view of

this the Chief 'Superintendent,                         Operations and Traffic

Division,        took         on    the     task        and    prepared         his    own

Operational           Order.              These    duties        were       undertaken
in     this     way    in     1988      and    1989     and    the        respective

manpower involved was as follows:-

                1988         106                1989          154

In addition, the staging of the event at Hillsborough

of necessity affects the city centre and once again

the     role     of    the     Hillsborough           Commander           cannot      be

diverted        to     take    control         of     this     aspect.           As    a

consequence, a separate Operational Order is prepared

for dealing with city centre problems associated with

the Semi Final,             and this action was embarked upon in

both     1988    and    in     1989.          The manpower          dedicated         to

these roles was as follows:-

                1988        127                 1989          167



Taking     into account the three aspects of policing the

total     manpower          available          for     deployment              was    as

follows:-

                1988        1161                    1989       1122



The    three areas of command maintain contact                                 through

radio and land           line communications and through this

method     flexibility            for   re-deployment              is    adequately

catered for.



An    example     of    the       flexibility         of     the    plan       can    be

drawn from the          fact       that      in the     'D1 Division Order

officers       are     allocated        to     escort      duties         of    public

transport        vehicles,         travelling           from        the        Midland

Station to the Hillsborough ground, and a contingency

is    incorporated          for    those       arriving        at       2.45    pm    to

remain at the Hillsborough Stadium in the Gymnasium
as     a    standby           reserve         for        deployment             as     and     when

required.           This contingency was adopted in 1988 and on

completion          of    the match            the           officers      are       again     used

for escort duties back to the railway station in the

city centre.             The same contingency was incorporated in

the 1989 plan.



The method of raising manpower for events such as the

Semi       Final    and       all    other          operational             matters         within

the     South      Yorkshire           Police            area       is    based      on      policy

which reflects that the Division upon which the event

is to take place should identify the manpower it can

raise       and     then       inform         Operations             Division          at     Force

Headquarters                  of that         additional manpower                    which       is

required.          The additional manpower is then raised from

across       the    Force        area         from           duty   and     off      duty     time

officers          and         is notified               to    the host           Division for

allocation of duties.

In    view    of        the     fact      that          Hillsborough             hosts       First

Division Football Matches on a regular basis, the vast

majority of officers in the Force have at some time or

another       been        involved            in        policing          at     the      Ground.

Every       effort            is made         to        ensure that               officers are

deployed to those                areas with which they are familiar

or     if    they        have       not       been           regularly          involved       are

deployed       on       duties      where          they may              take    up a static

point       and     carry       out       a    specific role. The                     actual

deployment          of        officers             is        normally       undertaken          by
       Superintendent                Murray       and his             Deputy Chief            Inspector

       Beal,     assisted             by        the    Support             Inspector,         Inspector

       Sewell.        These officers have experience of deployment

       of     manpower           at    Hillsborough                   Stadium       and       recognise

       those individuals with particular knowledge.                                                Because

       of the general nature of the age and experience of the

       Force     the      manpower               provided         to        police       such       events

       reflects       that           age    and       experience             and     deployment           is

       based     upon     Serials               under       the       command       of    a Sergeant

       with    5,    6,      8    or       10    officers             at    his    disposal.             The

       experience         amongst           these          officers          ranges       across         the

       board     from        none          to    a     vast       experience             of   policing

       similar       events.               Because          of    natural          changes         in    the

       Force through retirement                            and other         normal wastage               it

       is    possible        that          for       some    of       the     officers        involved

       this would be the first major event they had attended.

       SEGREGATION - ADDITIONAL FACTORS
4*45   In the planning terms the findings of the Popplewell                                                    Appendices
                                                                                                               22 & 29
       Report and the advice contained in the Guide to Safety

       and     Sports            Grounds              is     regularly                   taken          into

       consideration.                  Responses             have          been    made       to    those

       documents        in       a     continual            effort          to     improve         safety

       factors      at the Stadium and in particular to maintain

       segregation so far as opposing fans are concerned.



4.46   In    connection           with          segregation            much       effort       was      put

       into    the     total          segregation                of    fans       working          on   the
North/South divide.                   In the first place, as indicated,

the command structure was based upon this segregation.

In addition as in 1988 through                           liaison with the             F A

and the Club,             it was agreed that Sectors of the North

Stand adjacent to the Kop and the South Stand adjacent

to the     Leppings            Lane    Terraces      would        be    reserved      for

neutral        supporters         in    the       form    of     F A     Members      and

their club representatives.                        This was intended to act

as a buffer between opposing fans who were likely to

come      into            conflict          at     those         two      locations.

Furthermore, to prevent throwing between opposing fans

a fine net was erected on the end of the North Stand

adjacent        to    the      Kop     through       consultation             with    the

club.



The    number        of    turnstiles        giving access             to the    North

Stand was reduced as a consequence of the closure of

the    12 turnstiles            in Penistone             Road North.           For the

purpose of segregation these were not utilized in an

effort    to     prevent         clashes         between        rival    supporters.

Entrance to the North Stand was therefore via Leppings

Lane, turnstiles 1-10.                  Normally, Leppings Lane access

to the North Stand                is via turnstiles               1-8.        It was a

club    decision          in hosting the            Semi       Final     to   allocate

two    extra     turnstiles            to   compensate           for    the    loss   of

twelve    turnstiles            in     Penistone         Road    North.        Further

means     of    segregation                 was    the     introduction          of    a

sterile    area           in   the     service      road        behind    the    South
Stand extending from the Leppings Lane terraces to the

Police Control Box.



This has been utilized in 1988 and had been found to

be     an    effective          measure         in    ensuring        that Liverpool

supporters             did     not       have    the        ability     to    confront

Nottingham supporters in the South Stand area.



A further point which had been identified in 1987 at

the    match          between        Coventry        and     Leeds    concerned       the

housing          of     lost       property          offices.          In    1987     the

property         had        beentaken       to       the     gymnasium       from     all

areas       of    the       ground,      consequently          resulting       in    some

difficulty            and     confrontation            between        opposing       fans

when     they         went    to     collect         their    property       after    the

match.           In 1988, and again              in 1989, arrangements were

made with the               club for property storesto be utilized

at     both      ends of           the    Stadium.             For     the Liverpool

supporters a portacabin was erected in the West Stand

enclosure         whilst           Nottingham         Forest       supporters        were

allocated the               souvenir      shop situate             behind the       Spion

Kop.        With the agreement of the club the gymnasium was

identified             as      being       the        logistical         centre       for

operations in that the allocation of radios and other

equipment         would         be     dealt         with     at     that    location.

Additionally,            the gymnasium was identified as a venue

for    lost      children          or other messages which had to be

responded to from visitors to the Stadium.
In     continuing           the    theme        of     segregation,             particular

emphasis        was         placed           upon     the         accommodation           of

vehicular       traffic           for    both       sets     of     supporters.           As

indicated some              supporters          travel        by     rail,       some     by

coach, mini        bus and their own modes of transport.                                  In

view     of     this    arrangements                 were    made         for     'special

trains ' carrying Liverpool supporters to be brought to

Wadsley Bridge          Station,             a station which is only used

for football          supporters and for Nottingham supporters

the     train     were scheduled               to     go     into        the     Midland

Station       in the centre of Sheffield.                           Whilst this was

generally       the     case       there       are     service        trains          coming

into the Midland Station which would carry Liverpool

supporters         and contingency                   plans         were        made       to

transport them by public transport buses direct                                        from

the    station to           the Leppings Lane end of the                          ground,

thereby       avoiding        confrontation                with     the        Nottingham

supporters.            So    far        as    coaches        are    concerned,          the

coaches from Liverpool were to be accommodated at the

North    of the        Stadium          in Claywheels             Lane     and Halifax

Road and the coaches from Nottingham in Herries Road.

Mini buses and private cars were likewise accommodated

in the North/South divide.



These plans were identical to those for the 1988 Semi

Final    and would have the added advantage of ensuring

that    supporters          who     had       attended       the     previous          year

would be familiar with the arrangements.
Developing       this     theme,       given       that   the    Liverpool       -v-

Nottingham        Forest        Semi        Final     1988       was     held     at

Hillsborough Stadium, coupled with the fact that their

last     league game at the Stadium was 14 January 1989,

it follows that the same supporters, particularly the

'unruly        element'       would        be     equally       familiar        with

policing        methods.             In        particular,       the     practice

regarding public houses referred to at paragraph 4.74

would be well known.



TICKETS

 Previous        experience          regarding        the       allocation       of

tickets had indicated                some difficulties,            both in the

identification          of     the        areas     where    ticket       holders

should attend and in respect of forgery.                           Efforts were

made    to combat       both these problems.                    In relation to

forgeries,       special material was                used    for printing so

that    they    could quickly             be    identified.        The    tickets

were colour coded and over printed with Liverpool                                or

Nottingham dependant upon the area to which they were

allocated.        This procedure had been embarked upon in

1988,    however,       at the de-brief             concerning that match

it was felt that the colour coding was not prominent

enough and was not linked to a colour code system at

the    turnstiles.           In 1989 , the          club arranged        for the

colour    code    to     be    made       much     bolder    and       respective

colours    were     shown       at        the     turnstiles      where     those
tickets        should    be    surrendered.                 It was       through       this

method that        it was        anticipated that                 spectators          would

be allowed more ready access to the ground without the

problem of seeking directions and causing delays.



Additionally,           the     tickets          for        the      Spion      Kop     and

Leppings        Lane    Terraces      were        also overprinted               showing

'Nottingham            Forest        area'         and         'Liverpool             area'

respectively.                 This        was     done         to       overcome        the

difficulties           experienced         in the        1988 Semi          Final when

Liverpool        supporters          purchased           Spion          Kop     tickets,

gained     access,       claiming          ignorance           of    the      fact    that

they     had    purchased        tickets         for     the        'wrong     end'    and

created        segregation       problems.             In    fact       this    did    not

work and Liverpool              supporters         still          gained      access    to

the Spion Kop in 1989.



On the Spion Kop near to the North Stand there                                        is a

small    area with        limited         access which can be used to

isolate        Liverpool       supporters          from      Nottingham           Forest

supporters.            This     contingency            was        put    into    effect

utilizing        police        officers           to        ensure         segregation

between the two.



A similar contingency                for the Leppings Lane                     Terraces

in   respect      of     Nottingham             Forest       supporters          is    not

viable    because        there       is    no     natural           small      area    for

segregation.
It    will    be    noted        that       the    rear        of    each    Semi    Final

ticket       requests          that       supporters          take     up position      15

minutes before kick off.                         In fact publicity circulated

both locally and to the Liverpool and Nottingham areas

asks     supporters             to     time       their         journey       to    arrive

between 10.30 am and 2.00 pm.



NON TICKET HOLDERS

Whilst       the    colour           coding        of        tickets     described      at

paragraph       4.53       was        intended          to    expedite       fast    entry

into the Stadium,                there       is always the possibility as

in     previous         years        of     spectators           attending         without

tickets.           To    this        end,    a contingency              existed      where

such    persons         loitering           in    the        immediate      vicinity    of

the     ground,          after        kick        off,        would     be     collected

together      and,        in     the       case    of        Liverpool       supporters,

taken to Coal Road, an area adjacent to Wadsley Bridge

Station for dispersal or to await for transport after

the match.          Nottingham supporters were to be taken to

Hillsborough            Park      where          the     same        procedure       would

apply.



In 1988,whilst there are a number who attended without

tickets t the           number       was    not     excessive          and    they   were

simply dispersed from the area.                                It must be stressed

that this plan was intended to deal with the nuisance

problem caused by non ticket holders loitering in the
area whilst        the    game was       in progress.              It was        never

intended to deal with non ticket holders prior to kick

off.       The      logistics           of     such     a     plan        would     be

impractical       due     to    the    manpower       requirements           and    of

course     the    practical          difficulty        of     identifying          and

removing such people from within the mass of fans.



All tickets games have been discussed in the past at

the pre-season meeting held each year between Senior                                     Appendix   5-

Officers     of     the        South     Yorkshire          Police        and     club

officials        (usually       the      Secretary          and    Chairman         or

Representative Director).



At one of their meetings held on the 24 July 1987, the

question    was     asked       by     the    clubs whether          or    not     the

police would permit entry to non ticket holders rather

than have        them milling          about    the    streets          around     the

ground.         They     were     told       that     entry       would     not     be

allowed as the long term affect would be to encourage

non    ticket     holders       to     travel    safe       in    the     knowledge

that they would be admitted.



PUBLICITY

During     planning        stages        it     was     agreed           that      the

information concerning the arrangements                           for the match

would be promulgated to supporters                      through the media

and    through     their       club     programmes.              This     task     was   Appendix 51

undertaken       by the     Football         Intelligence Office                under
       the directions of the Chief Superintendent (Operations

       and Traffic Division).                   Emphasis was made on the need

       for     supporters           to       attend         in       good        time     and,        to

       accommodate this, arrangements were made with the club

       for     turnstiles         to     be    opened           at    12    noon,       that     is    3

       hours         before         kick            off,         which           under         normal

       circumstances             would      give      adequate         time       for    entry        to

       the     ground.           Detective           Superintendent               McKay       made     a   Statement 1
       broadcast on Radio Merseyside on Friday 14 April 1989,

       stressing          that    as    this        was    an all ticket match,                   non

       ticket holders should not attend.



       COMMUNICATIONS

4.63   In    terms        of     communication              the       ground       has     a     base

       station       which       can     operate           on    UHF       for    all     officers

       employed on duty in connection with that event in each

       of    the    3     Sectors.            The    Control          Room was          under     the

       command       of    Superintendent                 Murray,          assisted      by    staff

       who    regularly          police       the     Police          Control       Box.         This

       staff       consists       of    a     Sergeant          and    2 Constables.                  In

       addition to the UHF facility, the VHF traffic channels

       are monitored at that                   location.              The police officers

       in the       Control       Box       also     have       landline         facilities           to

       the club,          Hammerton         Road Police Station and a direct

       outside line.             The club have their own personal radio

       system for use by stewards.                          The Police Control staff

       link into this by way of one of the clubs radio sets.

       The   Police        Control       Room has           a    facility         to    over-ride
the grounds public address system.



In     order      that     communications          can    be maintained              each

Supervisory Officer of the rank of Sergeant and above

was     allocated         with     a    personal       radio.          Radio       checks

were made prior to the commencement of the operation.




Due    to    experiences           at   the    Semi      Final    held       in    1987,

when     difficulty          was        encountered         by     officers           not

hearing radio messages, arrangements were made for all

Serials       in and around the ground to be equipped with

personal ear pieces to ensure that crowd noise did not

deter       the    ability        to    direct    and     control           personnel.

These    were       in    fact    available       at     the    match       scheduled

for 15 April 1989.                 So far as back up facitilites are

concerned,           a    battery        operated         radio        system        was

available         in the Control          Room should the main system

malfunction.



EMERGENCY EVACUATION

At all sporting'events emergency evacuation procedures

are essential, and at Hillsborough, these are tested on

a regular         basis.          The   procedures        have     in       fact    been

tested       twice       during    this       season,     on     the    1 February

1989    at    the    Symod       Cup Match       and     on the        18    February

1989    when Sheffield Wednesday played Southampton.                                 The

procedures were found to be effective.                            In accordance

with the guidance contained in the Guide to Safety at
Sports Grounds the management of the club are required                                     Appendix 29
to     consult        with     the      Fire      Authority        regarding        the

suitability of the evacuation procedures.                                 Details of

the      evacuation           procedures           are         included     in      the

Operation          Order     and     are    issued        to     all    Supervisory       Appendix 53
Officers of the rank of Sergeant and above.



In brief,          the plan requiresfon a pre-arranged signal,

officers       being deployed to gates,                    gangways       and doors

in readiness          for evacuation and specific officers are

briefed prior to the event on their function.                                    Should

it      be     necessary           to      implement            evacuation         then

instructions,peculiar to the problem in hand, are given

to     officers       through        the       Police      Control        Box.       In

essence,       the plan caters for egress into identifiable

safe     areas       of      the   ground        such     as     the    pitch       and

enclosures behind each of the respective stands. These

plans        are    arranged       in    consultation            with     the     Fire

Service,           Ambulance         Service,           Club      Officials         and

Stewards       and    in accordance              with    the     findings       in the

Popplewell          Report    at paragraph          4.23,        a copy of which

is appended.                                                                              Appendix 22



The ground public              address      system is brought              into use

to advise the crowd or sections of the crowd to leave

the    Stadium once           contingencies             have    been formulated.

It    should       be mentioned         that      regular       testing     of this

system,        using         the   police        over-ride         facility        has

revealed           that      one   of      the     speakers        (adjacent        to
turnstile 73) to be defective.           It has taken repeated

requests to the club to have this repaired, this being

achieved a matter of weeks before the Semi Final was

scheduled to take place.



By way of comparison the need has been identified in

the past for a system of speakers actually outside the

turnstiles     in Leppings      Lane to enable       the spectators

awaiting entry to be addressed should the need arise.

The club implemented this change without undue delay.



INTELLIGENCE

Whilst   the      majority   of    planning    can     be   taken    in

advance of the event, changes do occur and the role of

the   Football      Intelligence     Officer    cannot      be   under

estimated.        His   liaison with   the    clubs    involved     and

assessment of background information concerning their

behaviour    is    considered     in depth    and    it can   dictate

the need for change to plans right up to kick off.                   To    Appendix 54

this end the plan is a broad brush stroke with built

in flexibility for change should unforeseen situations

arise.



Additional     reference was made to the            'match summary'

completed and submitted following the 1988 Semi Final

and this is included in the Appendices.                                   Appendix 55


In terms of Intelligence, Liverpool had in fact played
at    Hillsborough         against        Sheffield Wednesday               Football

Club    on    Saturday        14 January 1989.                On that       occasion

the Liverpool          supporters         totalled 6,100              and the home

supporters          25,424.         The      total           at the    ground      was

therefore 31,524.              The attitude of all supporters can

best be described as good                  and in fact there were                 only

4 arrests,          all involving the visiting supporters                         from

Liverpool,          2 being     inside      the ground and two outside

the ground.          In addition, there were 29 ejections from

the ground under the Ground Regulations,                               25 being in

connection with home               supporters          and    4 being visitors

from Liverpool.



In terms       of transportation,             it was          noted     that   there

were    no    special         trains      from    Liverpool           and    on   the

service trains approximately 900 attended and on buses

and coaches         1,100.         Therefore,      some       4,100     travelled

in    their    own     transport.           The   manpower            committed    to

policing       that        event     totalled          313     officers.           An

Operational Order was produced and took the format as

at    all    league    matches       staged       at    Sheffield Wednesday

Football Ground.



ALCOHOL

The    role    of    the    Divisional       Intelligence              Officer    has

also been enlarged to include                     liaison with licensees

in the area of the ground with a view to encouraging

closure       or    the     operation       of     'selective           doors'     to
prevent          clashes           of     rival           supporters              inside     the

premises.            This is done as a matter of course for each

match day and was also done pre-Semi Final day.



It   is     a    fact       that        alcohol           is    not     on    sale    to     the

general         public       inside           the        Stadium.            This    is    as    a

direct result of application by South Yorkshire Police

to   the    Licensing             Bench        of    the       Sheffield Magistates1

Court.          The effect          of this              is that those wishing to

drink have to do so at licensed premises                                          outside the

ground.          The       police       seek        to    control       this,       utilizing

the procedures outlined in paragraph 4.



Consideration              was     in    fact        given       to     applying      to     the

Magistrates1               Court        for     a        Restriction          Order        under

Section         67    of    the    Licensing              Act    1964        as   amended       by

Section 3 of the Licensing Act 1988.                                    However, as any

Restriction           Order        can        only       specify        closure       between

2.30 pm and 5.30 pm and, given that 'drinking up time1

of   20         minutes           would        mean            public        houses        would

effectively close                 10 minutes              before kick off,                it was

considered to b'e of no effect.



BRIEFING

Following the arrangements                           for planning             of any major

event      it    is    essential              that       plans,       and     the    policies

determined,           are     explained             to     all    officers          involved,

achieve this, briefings are arranged and, because of
the wide spread                 of people involved in the operation,

it     was       decided    that     briefings      would     be    held    at   the

Stadium on the day prior to the event' for                          officers of

Inspector           and above        to    allow them        to      familiarize

themselves          with the ground and surrounding locations.

Prior        to     the briefing,            each Inspector           is    issued
             *


relevant details of the Order and specific details of                                    Appendix 5
the Serials under his command.                       This course of action

was followed in both 1988 and 1989.



A full briefing took place at Hillsborough at 10.00 am

on Friday 14 April 1989 and full details                            of the plan

were discussed.                 The briefing was undertaken by Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield,                  followed by Superintendent                Statements
                                                                                       & 5
Murray.          Sector Commanders briefed all the Inspectors.

Following          that    briefing,       arrangements       were     made      for

officers to report for duty at the Stadium at 9.45 am

on the day of the event.



At 10.00 am on 15 April 1989, all officers involved in

the    operation          were     briefed    by     Chief    Superintendent            Statements
Duckenfield, Superintendent Murray, Detective Sergeant                                  3, 5, 12 &
                                                                                        10
Charlesworth and Inspector Sewell.                        Sector Commanders

then    briefed           all    personnel        under    their     individual

command      and     Inspectors       in   charge     of     Serials       further

briefed      their        officers    as     to    specific       requirements.

In addition, Sergeants are issued with briefing sheets                                 Appendix 58

as to their particular                responsibilities            and they are
advised        to    brief       their     officers          following      the   main

briefing.           This being in accordance with the findings

of the Popplewell                Report at paragraph                 4.22, which is

appended.           This policy is used at all matches with the’                             Appendix   22
exception           of    the     previous       days        briefing,      which      is

unique     to        Semi       Finals     and other           large      operational

events.        Included in the briefing notes for Sergeants                                  Appendix   58
are      the         requirements           for     emergency             evacuation

procedures               and    these      are    related            to   individual

officers who are allocated points to man in the event

of emergency.



STEWARDS

In    accordance           with     the     Guide       to    Safety       at   Sports       Appendix 29

Grounds,       management          of the     club and the police agree

that the stewards at the Stadium have a responsibility

for   packing            and    control     of    supporters          entering      the

ground.        The        police    have    a responsibility               to advise

and assistand on each match                       day stewards are briefed

by supervisory officers.                    On the occasion of the Semi

Final    on 15 April 1989 , stewards were briefed by the

Inspectors responsible for the four main areas of the

ground    and       this       briefing     took    place        after      the   main

police    briefing.              Incorporated       in the           briefing     is   a

reminder            regarding             emergency            and        evacuation

procedures.              The    responsibility          for this task at the

Leppings Lane end fell on Inspector White.                                                  Statement 13
It is of particular                importance that,           over the years,

the    clubs    attention          has    been drawn to the            fact that

stewards were not performing their duties to the full,

the most relevant feature being:-

               (i)           Continual manning of gates (both

                              access/egress and internal)

               (ii)          Packing of enclosures

These    failings       have       been brought to the attention of

club officials during actual games, at ad hoc meetings

on other than match days and at the annual briefing of

stewards       held     at   the        club    and   to    which     the   police

attended.        Two such meetings were held on the 15 and

23    August     1988     and      at    those    meetings         stewards    were

reminded of their duties.                      A copy of 'Instructions for            Appendix 59
Match Day Staff'             and    'Instruction to Stewards'                 which   Appendix 60
are issued by the club are included in the Appendices.



In    practice,       however,          the    police      still    perform    some

stewarding duties,              rather than leave them to chance.

In particular,          Inspectors and above are issued with a

key to the padlocks which either lock or fasten back

spectator        gates,       all       padlocks      being        identical    and

requiring the use of one 'common key'.                             Whilst this is

a working practice it does not absolve the clubs from

their overall responsibility.



SEMI FINALS 1988 and 1989 - CHANGES

In essence the plan for 1989 followed very closely the
plan     for           1988     with      the     exception        of        the     changes

already outlined.                  In addition there were five further

changes       worthy          of   comment ,           the    first     concerned          the

use     of    the        Force     spotter        plane,       which     was        used    to

monitor traffic build up in 1988.                              However, because of

a change of policy in procedures regarding searches of

coaches           at    motorway         intersections          which        had     created

some build up it was not felt necessary to utilize the

plane and in addition there had been some difficulties

with     communication                 links      between       the     aircraft           and

ground.            The    difficulties           experienced          far outweighed

the benefits and it was decided not to use the plane

on this occasion.



The     second          concerns         the     introduction           of    hand        held

video        camera       and      evidence          gathering        team     who        were

utilized           to     supplement           the     static     cameras           already

installed at the ground.



A further aspect concerned licensed premises.                                        With a

change        of        licensing         laws       concerning         the        all     day

opening       of        premises,         it     was    noted     that        particular

attention should be given to these on the build up to

the match and this fact was included in the briefing

notes    for           Serials     around       the     ground.         It was           their

brief        to        advise      the     Police        Control        Post        of     any

problems          in particular            areas.        This     policy           had    been

used    in 1988 .             However,         it was        noted that year              that
considerable           sales        from    off      licence          premises       had

occurred and in 1989 it was decided that an additional

responsibility           should       be     included        in       the     briefing

notes       to   pay     particular          attention          to     off     licence

premises as well as on licence premises.



The     fourth       change         yet     again         effects       the        under

employment of officers experienced in 1988.                                  Following

the    first     phase       of the match           that    is up to          3.00 pm

kick off time officers who had been on coach reception

duties and peripheral patrols were under employed and

it    was    decided         that    they    could    be     used       as    a    ready

reserve      for    assistance        at either           end    of    the     ground,

and    to    this      end    coaches       were     in    Leppings          Lane    and

Penistone        Road    North       and     five    Serials          comprising       5

Sergeants and 40 Constables were briefed to make their

way to the coach for standby duties at Leppings Lane

and    5    Sergeants         and     41     Constables          were        similarly

briefed to attend at Penistone Road North.



The fifth change concerned route signing.                               In 1988 the

police were responsible for this aspect including car

parking      indicators.              In     1989     the       club     agreed       to

provide      the    finance         for AA route          signs.        The       police

providing           additional             signs,         particularly              with

reference to car parking.
OTHER MATTERS

Sunday Match

In   considering         the    possibility     of    staging   the

Final on a Sunday, the following applied:

        (i)          The Football Association express

                     a wish for both Semi Finals to be

                     played on the same day with the

                     caveat that they would consider

                     changing to a Sunday if live

                     television cover was offered. No

                     such offer was made.



     (ii)            As this was an all ticket game, the

                     day on which it was staged would

                  make no difference to the capacity.



     (iii)        Licensed premises were open until

                  kick off on both dates.



TUNNEL        GATES

It should be noted that                 there   are two gates at the           Appendix 3
                                                                               (photograph
entrance        to     the     central     tunnel     leading      to    the   25)
Leppings        Lane     terraces       which   can    be    closed      and

locked.          The    gates    open    into   the    tunnel      and   are

fastened back.           It is a fact that should these gates

be closed in an effort to stop the flow of supporters

entering       the     tunnel    and     accessing     the   two    centre

pens,     then    in an emergency resulting in the                  tunnel
becoming crowded, it would be impossible to open these

gates as they would of necessity open against the flow

of pedestrians coming out of the ground.




TURNSTILE COUNTING SYSTEM



The    club has       control   facilities whereby they monitor

through CCTV all the turnstiles at the stadium.                             This

monitoring is linked to a computerized counting system

and    this    has      a    warning     facility       when    levels        of

supporters       in    the    various     sections      of     the    Stadium

reach a 15% shortage of the agreed capacity figure.




From    a   police     point    of     view,   a     Liaison    Officer       is

accommodated          in     that    room      in     order      that        any

difficulties      at       turnstiles    may   be     relayed    to       Police

Control.      He is. equipped with a police personal radio

and has access to the clubs landline system.                         The club

are    totally        responsible       for    the    running        of     this
facility birt, by the presence of our Liaison Officer, we

are in a position to know when ground capacities are

being reached. Where such an occasion arises, then the

Liaison          Officer          can    advise           Control         of        that

development.



On the occasion of this event,                       there is no record of

any     such     information        having      been      received        at   Police

Control;             however,    the    Liaison Officer            does    indicate

that he attempted to contact Control due to the fact

that the Kop had reached a point whereby capacity was

almost achieved.           He could not get through due to over

loading         of    the communications           which        was then       taking

place.           Despite        this,   the        fact   that      the    Kop      was

reaching capacity had no bearing on the events.



CLUB LIAISON

It    is   perhaps       important       to    point      out      that    over     the

years liaison with club officials has been maintained

through         good    will     and    in    an    effort       to achieve         our

common      practice' of          accommodating           the    public        at   the

Stadium in safety.                Whilst this         liaison has          resulted

in some         overlap concerning           activities          at the    ground,

there      has       been no    reduction      as     such       in the    defined

areas      of    responsibility          of    either        the    club       or   the
police.     The presence of liaison officers as mentioned

above     has   been   intended   to   improve   the   flow   of

information      rather   than    usurp   the    authority    or

responsibility of club employees and officials.

                    EVENTS AT HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL STADIUM -

                              SATURDAY 15 APRIL 1989




5. 1    (a)   Weather

5.1.1         The weather on Saturday 15 April 1989 was extremely

              good.     Indeed, it was probably one of the first

              'Spring days' of 1989, with a total of 11 hours sun­

              shine out of a maximum of 13-14 hours available.       The

              air was dry, humidity was low and the maximum temper­

              ature recorded at the Leeds Weather Centre was 13°C

              (55°F).




5.2     (b)   Stadium

5.2.1         (i)     Ground - External

                      Geographically, spectators arriving from Mersey-

1                     side arrive in Sheffield via the A616 from the

                      North, which is the primary reason for the spec­

                      tators being located in the Northern and Western

                      areas of the ground, these areas being accessible

                      through the Leppings Lane entrance, which is

                      adjacent to this main arterial road.




5.2.2                 The North Stand is normally accessed by turn-
stiles numbers 77-88 on Penistone Road and turn­

stiles 1-8 on Leppings Lane but, on this

occasion, to ensure segregation of opposing fans,

the turnstiles on Penistone Road were closed and

the turnstiles on Leppings Lane were increased by

two, turnstiles 1-10 now accommodated all Liver­

pool spectators entering the North Stand.




The West Stand is accessed via the same bank of

turnstiles in Leppings Lane at turnstiles 9-16,

but the actions of the club in increasing the

North Stand allocation by two, effectively re­

duced the West Stand number to 6 , with only turn­

stiles 11-16 admitting fans into the West Stand

seating area.   The 7 turnstiles giving admittance

to spectators for the West Stand, Leppings Lane

terraces are also situated in Leppings Lane, they

are lettered A-G and this is the normal turnstile

allocation for the terrace area.   (Photographs

 and a plan of the turnstile arrangements are

 appended).                                          APPENDIX
                                                     61


A further aspect in relation to the turnstiles

was the club's decision to use a colour code to

coincide with the colour of ticket, to enable        APPENDIX
                                                     50
fans to see which turnstile gave admittance to

the three Liverpool designated areas.   These

were as follows:-
Brown      - Turnstiles 1-10    - North Stand

Red        - Turnstiles 11-16   - West Stand

Purple     - Turnstiles A-G     - West Stand

                                 Terracing




The Leppings Lane turnstiles are situated to the

rear of the West Stand.    They form part of the

ground perimeter.   When looking from Leppings

Lane towards the turnstile, on the extreme left

is a large, metal, concertina type gate, this is

referred to as Gate A.    There then follows an

arced row of turnstiles numbering 1-16, there is

a second metal concertina type gate (Gate B ) ,

this is set at an angle and is positioned between

turnstiles 1 and 16, and a second row of turn­

stiles lettered A-G.     A third metal, concertina

type gate (GateC) runs from turnstiles A-G to the

high brick wall which forms part of the service

road.    The service road leads to other areas of

the ground, and this follows the line of the

River Don.




There is an outer perimeter fence which consists

of a row of six double wrought iron gates, abutt­

ing on to Leppings Lane. These are normally

locked to prevent entry on to the concourse area

in front of the turnstiles, but on match days

they are opened inwards to allow unrestricted
    entry to the t u r n s t i l e s .



    There are two barriers running back from the

    turnstile towards Leppings Lane. The first is a

    seven foot high, solid metal, fence which extends

    from turnstile 16 all the way back to the outer

    perimeter wrought iron gates.           The other barrier

    is a single, low bar structure, which runs from

    turnstile G back towards Leppings Lane.




(ii) Ground -Internal

    Preceding sections of this report (Part 2) have

     detailed at some length the design and configur­

     ation of the stadium.           It is appropriate in this

     part of the report, however, that the basic lay­

     out of the ground be reiterated.          The stadium is

     divided into 4 specific areas, i.e. the North,

     South and West Stands and the Spion Kop.           The

     North and South stands are 'all seating', whilst

     the Spion Kop consists solely of terracing for

     standing spectators.           The West Stand has a raised

     seating enclosure and terraces where spectators

     stand.     The respective crowd capacities of each

     stand are as follows:-

           North Stand - 9,705

            South Stand - 8,834

            Spion Kop (East) - 21,000

            West Stand - seating 4,465; teraces 10,100
                 The West Stand terraces (which will be the main

                 focus of attention as far as this section of the

                 report is concerned), is further divided into 4

                  'pens', which are commonly identified as North,

                  Centre North, Centre South and South.    Addition­

                  ally, there is an area of terracing, (known as

                  North West Terrace), which is located between the

                  North and West Stands.



                  These areas have standing crowd capacities as

                  follows:-

                       North          -    1,600

                       Centre North   -    1,000

                       Centre South   -    1,200

                       South          -    2,600

                       North West

                       Terrace        -    3,700




5.3     (c)   Policy of Segregation

5 2 1         Arising from numerous previous incidents nationally,

              and acting upon the recommendations of a number of

              formal reports arising from various Committees of

              Enquiry (which have been documented under Section 3),

              the policy adopted by the South Yorkshire Police on

              the occasion of semi-finals at Hillsborough Football

              Stadium has been one of total segregation, in the

              interests of public order and tranquility.    On the 15
              April 1989, Liverpool supporters were located pri­

              marily in the North and West Stands.   A very small

              number were *housed* on the North West corner of the

              Spion Kop to cater for those who had obtained tickets

              through Nottingham sources.   This was a recognised

              possibility,   (which has been catered for in previous

              matches), with the result that there was a policing

              provision to ensure that the opposing spectators re­

              mained apart.




5.4     (d)   Terraces
                                                                        APPENDIX
5.4.1         The ’pens’, into which the terraces in front of the
                                                                        3
                                                                        (photographs)
              West Stand are divided, are each served by connecting
                                                                         27-29
              gates, which are located at the rear of the dividing

               barriers, in order that spectator flow may be directed

               between 'pens'.




5.4.2          Before the semi-final commenced Inspector H. White

                                                                        STATEMENT
               (the officer in charge of Serials 14 and 15), was
                                                                        13
               aware that a capacity crowd was expected and, as a

               consequence, and as part of his overall duties, he

               ensured that 5 terrace 'pen' gates were padlocked in

               the 'open' position.    One of the means of access to

               the terraces from the Leppings Lane entrance is via a

               central tunnel, which is located beneath the West

               Stand, and which has 2 doors (which open inwards)

               situated at the Leppings Lane 'mouth' of the tunnel.

               These gates remain in the open position, as to close
             them would present an impenetrable barrier in the

             event of ground evacuation becoming necessary.




    5.4.3    The area between the West Stand terraces of the

             playing area is delineated by a small concrete wall,

             reinforced by high wired fencing - a development which

             has occurred elsewhere in the country, in view of

             ground public order disturbances, and as a conse­

             quence of subsequent recommendations by the various

             bodies who were charged with the task of investigating

             and reporting upon previous events, the most recent

             being the Popplewell Enquiry.   As the area of terra­

             cing reaches the perimeter wall, the last step is

             deeper than the remainder, with the effect that there

             exists a 'well' on the spectator side of the perimeter   APPENDIX
                                                                      11
             wall.                                                    (photographs)




    5.4.4    Emergency access to the playing area from the West

             Stand terraces is facilitated by the provision of 7

             perimeter gates, the mechanisms of which are spring

             loaded to allow police or ground officials to open

             the gates (from the playing area) in the event of any    APPENDIX
                                                                      11
             emergency.                                               (photographs)




    5 .4.5   It should be noted, however, that 2 factors which were

              to have a subsequent bearing on the manner in which

              the evacuation proceeded were:-




#
                     (a)   The relatively narrow width of the gates

                           (lm).
                     (b)   The differential in levels between the

                           gate opening and the 'floor' of the

                           terracing; for whilst the dimensions

                           differ between respective gates the

                           presence of one or two concrete steps,

                           'leading up to' the gates from within,

                           was to subsequently prove a serious

                           hurdle in the rescue of trapped persons,

                           whose body weight rested beneath the

                           level of the perimeter gate, with the

                           result that they had to be 'hauled' out

                           of what was effectively a 'well' in

                           which they were trapped.




5.5       (e )   The Provision of Turnstile Monitoring Facilities

5 .5 .I          The statement of PC 1421 Guest explains in some detail    STATEMENT
                                                                           14
                 the location of the Video Room, which is situated near

                 to the players' entrance on the South Stand of the

                 ground, and in which 20 closed circuit television

                 monitors are situated, which are strategically placed

                 to enable continuous visual monitoring of all 97 turn­

                 stiles.   Additionally, a television monitor is able

                 to show the situation in any part of the ground.     PC

                 Guest, when performing this duty, acts as a liaison

                 officer, and as such has a responsibility to monitor

                 movement and possible congestion through turnstiles.
A computer facility is also installed which enables

continuous monitoring of the number of persons passing

through each turnstile.    The computer is equipped with

a warning device which indicates when a particular

part of the stadium is within 15% of full crowd capac­

ity.   Under normal circumstances, therefore (and sub­

ject to access being gained by the normal manner

through turnstiles), there should be sufficient indi­

cation to police and ground officials to monitor the

admission of spectators.




Police Deployent

The overall policing operation was commanded by Chief

Superintendent D. Duckenfield, from the Police Control

Room adjacent to the South stand, in the South West

corner of the ground.     An officer with 26 years ser­

vice, Mr. Duckenfield has a wide experience in both

Uniform and the Criminal Investigation Department, and

previously served at 'F' Division in the rank of Chief

 Inspector, between September 1978 and June 1980.

 Since this time, he has served primarily at the

 adjacent   'D' Division (Sheffield Central), where he

 has had extensive experience of policing at Bramall

 Lane Football Ground, the home of Sheffield United

 Football Club.
Assisting Chief Superintendent Duckenfield in Ground

Sector Control was Superintendent B. D. Murray, an

officer with 23 years service, who has regularly

carried out football policing duties, including the

previous semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham

Forest in 1988.




(i)   External

      In overall charge of the Leppings Lane sector of

      the ground was Superintendent Marshall.   Mr.

      Marshall is 45 years of age and he has 26 years

      service in the Police Force.   He was promoted to

      the rank of Superintendent in 1983, and during

      a secondment at Her Majesty's Inspector of

      Constabulary's Office, was Temporary Chief Super­

      intendent.   He was posted to D1 Sub-Division

      (Sheffield Central), and he gained substantial

      knowledge of the policing of football matches at

      the Sheffield United Football Club, Bramall Lane.

      In October 1987 he was posted to the Hammerton

      Road Division as Deputy Divisional Commander, and

      he has obtained considerable experience in the

      policing of football matches at the Hillsborough

      Football Stadium.



       The officers deployed to work the Leppings Lane

       turnstiles were:-
Chief Inspector Creaser

Inspector Sykes

Inspector Purdy

Serial 1 6 - 1   Sergeant,   10 Constables -

             Turnstiles A-G

Serial 1 7 - 1   Sergeant,   10 Constables -

             Turnstiles 1-8

Serial 1 8 - 1   Sergeant,   10 Constables -

             Turnstiles 9-16

Serial 1 9 - 1   Sergeant,   10 Constables -

             Leppings Lane area crowd control

5 Mounted officers




The Football Order at Part A1 shows Sector 1 at

Ground Control to be the responsibility of Super-

intendent Green.     The above serials would there­

fore be his responsibility.       However, it is a

working practice that the Outer Sector Commander

 has assumed responsibility for the outer turn­

 stile areas at Leppings Lane.




 They were instructed to ensure that persons

 entering the ground did not possess any items

 prohibited by the rules (banners, weapons,

 missiles or alcohol).       This is in accordance with

 the Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol, etc.)

 Act 1985.   They were to maintain orderly queues

 of fans forming at the turnstiles.
5.6.7       A number of serials were deployed in the areas

            adjacent to Leppings Lane and at the coach,

            transit and car parks.   A detail of officers

            under the command of Inspector Ellis, Serials 36

            and 37, were deployed to Wadsley Bridge Railway

            Station to await the arrival of the Liverpool

            supporters' train.   A deployment of six mounted

            officers were also attached to this detail, this

            was later increased by 2 Mounted officers.

            Serials 36 and 37 were to escort the Liverpool

            fans to the Leppings Lane entrance where they

            were to remain and assist in general crowd

            control.

            details of the above deployments and numbers of

            officers engaged in those duties.   This Order was

            strictly adhered to with no deviations or amend­

            ments made.




5.6.9   (ii) Internal

             In overall command of policing arrangements

            within the ground was Superintendent R. L.

             Greenwood, an officer with 25 years service, who

             also has extensive experience at policing foot­

             ball matches, including semi-finals.
                  Superintendent Greenwood, assisted by 2 Chief
5.6.10

                  Inspectors, had under his command a total of 21

                  Serials, divided into 9 sub-sectors, each of

                  which were supervised by an Inspector.    The

 5.7.1         Stewards

               On the 8 June 1988, a memorandum was forwarded from    APPENDIX
                                                                      60
               the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, to the South

               Yorkshire Police, which enclosed instructions for

               match day staff (gatemen, turnstile operators and

               Stewards) for the forthcoming season.
On the 15 April 1989, a total of 376 stewards were on

duty at the ground in connection with the semi-final,

and these were briefed by Inspectors having responsi­

bility for various parts of the ground before the

commencement of the match.




In the case of the West Stand, at 11.25am, Inspector       STATEMENT

White called all the relevant stewards to the stand        13

and they were briefed in respect of the entry of spec­

tators, evacuation procedures and general conduct.




Stewards were identified by yellow tabards worn over

their outer clothing.   Generally, the duties of

stewards are concerned with the ingress and egress of

spectators and their deployment within the ground.

These duties are clearly stated in the ’Green Guide.'      APPENDIX

Ambulance/Fire Service Personnel

 On the 9 August 1988, a meeting was held at Hammerton     APPENDIX
                                                           44
 Road Police station between representatives of the

 police, ambulance and fire services, in order to

 reinforce liaison guidelines for emergency evacuation

 procedures in the event of a major disaster at the

 Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground.   It was agreed at

 this meeting that an ambulance officer would be in

 attendance to provide a liaison facility, and that the

 Fire Service would not attend as a matter of course,

 but would provide immediate assistance by the quickest
possible routes should their assistance be required.

Enquiries with the Ambulance Service reveal that prior

to the commencement of the match, on the 15 April

1989, the following ambulance personnel were

identified to the police controllers and were

available for immediate deployment:-

     (a)   2 Ambulance Service personnel - to perform

           the duties of liaison officers within the

           ground.

     (b)   1 ambulance and crew at the stadium on

           stand-by.

     (c)   1 ambulance and crew at the Middlewood

           Ambulance Station (a distance of approxi­

           mately half a mile), who would remain on

           stand-by for the duration of the event.




St. John's Ambulance Personnel

The St. John's Ambulance Service provided a total of

 36 personnel for first aid duties at the ground.     It

 is believed that, in accordance with normal practice,

 the St. John’s Ambulance Service had in attendance at

 the ground one of their own ambulances, located

 adjacent to the First Aid Room in the Northern area of

 the ground.
Police First Aid Training

It should also be borne in mind that all police

officers, following their initial training, are

required to qualify for the St. John's Ambulance First

Aid Police Certificate, and that officers with less

than 15 years service are required to re-qualify at 3

yearly intervals.




Events to 2.30pm

At 10.00am on 15 April 1989 police officers attended

at the Hillsborough Ground, where the pre-match

briefing was conducted by Chief Superintendent            STATEMENT

briefings were then conducted, firstly by Superinten­     STATEMENT

dent Murray, who spoke to the assembled officers on

matters appertaining to communications and emergency

evacuation procedures.   The Divisional Intelligence

Officer, Sergeant Charlesworth, informed officers of      STATEMENT
                                                          12
the latest intelligence regarding Liverpool and

Nottingham Forest Supporters, Inspector Sewell went on    STATEMENT
                                                          10
to give details relating to the issue of radios,

meals, transport arrangements and other logistical

matters.



The three Sector Superintendents (Greenwood, Marshall     STATEMENT
                                                          6 , 4,   15
 and Chapman) went to separate parts of the ground with

 officers under their command, in order to brief them

 on matters appertaining to their particular serials.
At 11.00am officers engaged in the Leppings Lane

detail were briefed by Inspectors Sykes and Purdy, and    STATEMENTS
                                                          16, 17
they took up duties on the concourse area outside the

turnstiles.   At around 12 mid-day the Sheffield

Wednesday Football Ground turnstiles were opened by

the stewards, and Liverpool supporters were allowed to

enter the ground.   By 12.30pm queues were forming out­

side the ground.    They were orderly and well behaved.




Initially there was only a steady trickle of fans

entering the ground, the majority of whom had already

been searched prior to entry.    Second searches took

place as spectators went through the turnstiles, but

there is no evidence of any antipathy or antagonism at

                                                          STATEMENT
this stage.   Indeed, one of the officers on duty, PC
                                                          18
1675 Rich, considers that the second search built up a

rapport with many of the spectators.    He comments!

     "It was noticeable that all the people

     entering the ground at this time were

     honest, decent people, well dressed and

     well behaved."




 Other officers confirm that there were no problems in­

 side the ground during the early stages and, indeed,

 Superintendent Greenwood refers in his statement to a     STATEMENT

                                                           6
 "carnival atmosphere in the Central pens" and speaks

 of "a lightweight beach ball being flicked about in
             the crowd."



    5 .8.6   However, it is apparent that, even at this

             early stage, there is evidence that a large number

             of fans, particularly in their teens and early

             twenties, had attended at the ground without tickets.

             Liverpool spectators were constantly asking police

             officers for spare or returned tickets.   One officer,
                                                                          STATEMENT
             PC Burnless, states that there were hundreds of fans         19

             who did not have tickets.   Officers engaged on the

             serials deployed outside of the turnstiles on Leppings

             Lane were constantly being asked the same question,

             "Are there any tickets available?"




    5 .8.7   There were many reports from officers deployed at

             the turnstiles who witnessed fans without tickets

             making determined attempts to gain unlawful entry

             into the ground.   Many were ejected from the ground by

             the police.




    5 .8.8   PC Titterton was deployed at turnstiles 1-16,                STATEMENT

                                                                          20
              stationed near turnstile 3 when, shortly after 1.00pm,

              he overheard a conversation between the operators at

              turnstile 3 and the operator at the adjoining turn­

              stile. Conversation was to the effect that only 74

              fans had entered his turnstile in the first hour.     The

              man had worked out the rate that fans could enter that



•
              turnstile and he considered there would have to be a
continuous movement over the next 2 hours to reach his

turnstile quota.     This must be the first clear indi­

cation of the likely late arrival of the crowd.




He further states that during the course of the after­

noon he arrested a ticket tout with over £700 in his

possession and also a number of what appeared to be

forged tickets.    This was a further problem associated

with the through flow of spectators at the turnstiles.

Inspector Bennett saw a number of ticket touts outside       STATEMENT

                                                             21
in Leppings Lane and supporters, having purchased what

appeared to be surplus tickets, had been queueing from

Leppings Lane right up to the turnstiles, only to be

turned away when they presented forged tickets.       This

was not only time wasting but was a further contri­

butory factor which prevented the smooth flow of spec­

tators through the turnstiles.




It has been suggested that there was an element within

the crowd who were attempting to gain entry through

the turnstiles by offering money in the way of bribes

 to the operators.    Police Sergeant Crawford paid          STATEMENT
                                                             22
 particular attention to this problem while engaged in

 duties inside the turnstiles A-G.     It must be con­

 sidered that the majority, if not all, of those per­

 sons attempting to bribe the turnstile operators were

 turned away but their actions would, of course, once

 again cause delays at the turnstiles.
Apart from the problems with ticket touts, forged

tickets and non-ticket holding Liverpool supporters,

there began to emerge a realisation that alcohol was

becoming a problem.    Even as early at 11.00am that

day, officers on duty in the car parks and coach parks

near to the Hillsborough Football Ground were being

asked directions to licensed premises and off-licence

premises.




Officers on duty on perimeter patrols around the

ground, including PC Prince, were aware that Liverpool   STATEMENT
                                                         23
supporters were entering licensed premises, and as he

patrolled the area he became more and more concerned

at the number of persons drinking.    Some of the fans

were sitting and lying about in the roadway openly

drinking alcohol.




PC Marsh was aware that the licensee of the local Fox    STATEMENT

Public House had placed an advertisement in the Liver­   24

pool tabloid press, informing the Liverpool suppor­

ters:

        "We ran out of beer last year, I've got

        more this year."

Supporters were monitored entering and leaving these

premises in large numbers.




Officers on duty on the Leppings Lane concourse recall
that fans from 11.30am onwards were seen walking to­

wards the turnstiles, no doubt in order to familiarise

themselves with the area, then after making enquiries

regarding licensed premises, walking away.     It was

impossible to estimate the numbers of supporters but

these were considerable.




Superintendent Marshall states:

     "There were a substantial number of fans

     wandering around the streets and I was

     saddened to see that most were openly

     drinking alcohol from cans and litre

     bottles, many were carrying four-packs and

     I was asked by groups of fans where they

     could find pubs that were open.    All the

     fans I encountered were Liverpool suppor­

     ters, I spoke to one man who was drinking

     from a can of strong lager, and had another

     three cans in his possession.     I expressed

     the view that were he to drink all the

      lager he had in his possession he might

      later have difficulty getting into the

     match."




The Superintendent also said that the Gateway Super­

 market was doing a roaring trade at its off licence

 section, with queues of fans buying drinks from the

 door, particularly four-pack cans of beer and lager.
Officers report that the nearest off-licence premises

to the Hillsborough Football Ground, situated on Vere

Road, closed down prior to the commencement of the

game, due to the stocks of alcohol having run out.

This is evidenced in the statement of PC Wilkes.         STATEMENT

                                                         25

There were visual signs all around the general area

leading towards the Leppings Lane turnstiles, of fans

congregating, sitting or generally hanging about, con­

suming intoxicants from cans, which were discarded in

large numbers in the general area around Leppings

Lane.    A Mounted officer, PC Scott, states,            STATEMENT

                                                         26
        "The situation on Leppings Lane was such

        that the bridge which crosses the River

        Don adjacent to the ground was thronging

        with people who were sitting and standing

        about, just drinking cans of lager, beer

        and other alcoholic contents, which when

        emptied were discarded at the side of the

        road.   Many of these people appeared to be

        in drunken states, but the situation being

        as it was, with two to three thousand
             people in the area it was both practi­

             cally and physically impossible to do any­

             thing about this matter.     On one occasion

             I took it upon myself, whilst riding the

             full length of the bridge, to knock off

             the bridge wall and into the river,

             numerous empty, partially full and un­

             opened cans and bottles of mainly lager.




5.8.18   The general mood of the crowd from the opening of the

         gates at about 12 mid-day, until just before 2.00pm,

         was described as friendly, good humoured, with a

         carnival like atmosphere.    This section of the Liver­

         pool supporters being mainly families and elderly

         persons but, as the time increased towards the 3.00pm

         kick-off, the atmosphere changed dramatically.       Sec­

         tions of the crowd were seen to be the worse for

         drink and unruly, as evidenced in the statement of

         Police Sergeant Morgan.     There is evidence from          STATEMENT
                                                                     27
         officers' statements that, as the

         large crowd of supporters prepared to converge on the

         turnstile areas, they were in possession of packs of

         alcohol and this is considered to be a contributory

         factor as to the reason for their late arrival en

         masse at the turnstiles.




5.8.19    (Point of Information - The question of alcohol sales

          at football grounds is well documented in Part 4
(64).   It can be argued that the absence of intoxi­

cants at the stadium contributed to the delayed

arrival of the fans).




In the Police Control Room, Superintendent Murray was     STATEMENTS

joined by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield at 1.50pm,

after which, the two Commanders visited the refereee

and his linesmen in the Referee's Room, where they

outlined the general demarcation of responsibility of

the referee, with the police having the right to go on

to the field if they felt the circumstances merited

this course of action.   The referee was informed of

the emergency evacuation procedure, and of the coded

message which would be broadcast in the event of the

need for evacuation, and was informed that the pro­

cedure for stopping the match would be through the

South Stand linesman.

Wadsley Bridge Railway Station when the train carrying

 Liverpool supporters arrived.   The Mounted and Foot

 officers formed a loose cordon around the 450 fans and
         escorted them from the railway station onto the con­

         course of the Leppings Lane turnstiles.   They were

         orderly, good humoured, and as they approached the

         turnstiles it was noted that there were no crowd prob­

         lems, although small queues had formed.   Timed photo­

         graphs indicate the arrival of this contingent at bet­

         ween 2.08pm and 2.16pm.                                  APPENDIX

5.8.23   All officers employed on this detail remained to

         supplement the officers already deployed at those

         turnstiles, and a concerted effort was made towards

         shepherding the persons loitering in the general area

         towards the turnstiles.




5.8.24   From his vantage point in the Video Room, PC Guest was   STATEMENT

         monitoring spectator arrivals, and noticed that the

         crowd appeared to be slow in arriving, and that by

         2.15pm he estimated that between 25 thousand and 30

         thousand spectators had arrived, which was approxi­

         mately half of the anticipated attendance.




5.8.25   PC Rich noted that:                                      STATEMENT
                                                                  18
              "From the opening of the turnstiles at

              12 noon until some time after 2.00pm,

              entry flow to the ground gradually

              increased without problem, like any other

              football match."
    5.8.26   It then became evident, however, that after 2.00pm

             the pace had quickened and, in addition, problems

             began to develop which led to an increase in tension,

             particularly (but not solely) outside the ground.




    5.8.27   From this point in time, attention is focused on the

             Leppings Lane and West Stand Enclosure end of the

             stadium, this being the area of the ground where the

             incident occurred.   There was a steady build up of

             spectators and queues were beginning to extend back

             towards Leppings Lane.   There were no problems at that

             location, with nothing untoward.

             trying to gain admission without a ticket.   PC Grant

             detained this person and took him to Gate C, where he

             was ejected.




    5.8.29   In the process, however, both this officer and his

             colleague found themselves surrounded by a number of

             the man's friends, who were generally abusive and

             claimed that he did in fact have a ticket.   This was

             a scene, which according to PC Grant, was repeated

             approximately a dozen times over the next 20 minutes,

             during which time many fans were also offering money



•
             to the turnstile operators in an unsuccessful attempt
          to gain entry.


                                                                     STATEMENT
5.8.30    PC 298 Scholey, who was on duty in the West Stand,
                                                                     30
          considered that the early behaviour of the spectators

          on the terraces was generally good b u t , at some time

          after 2 .0 0 pm, he saw a youth (who he describes as 6 '

          tall, 20 years, heavy build) standing on a barrier,

          gesticulating to the crowd in an attemept to encourage

          them to sing.



          Around the same time, his supervisory officer, PS 2001     STATEMENT
5.8.31
                                                                     31
          Burman, who was nearby, had occasion to speak to a

          youth who was trying to gain entrance to the West

          Stand by climbing up from the terraces.     Realising

          that the Sergeant could not reach him, the youth

          gesticulated with a 'V' sign, and shouted,     Fuck off

          on several occasions.   Although this man was just out

          of reach, the Sergeant could smell drink on his

          breath.




5.8.32     Sergeant Burman also witnessed the youth (mentioned by

           PC 298 Scholey) who was standing on the crush barrier,

           and saw that this individual fell off the barrier

           several times before being assisted back by his

           associates to take up his position as before.




 5.8.33    In addition, the Sergeant saw a second youth (des­

           cribed as 20 years with long, blond hair) climbing on
to the right hand side of the barrier and, once up­

right, the youth launched himself bodily with arms and

hands outstretched, as though he was diving into a

pool of water.    The Sergeant states:-

       "The crowd was so compressed in front of

       him that he had no likelihood of falling

       and hurting himself seriously, but kept

       landing on top of the heads and shoulders

       in front of him."

Sergeant Burman estimates that the youth climbed back

on to the barrier and repeated this performance on a

further 10-20 occasions before becoming involved in an

altercation with another youth directly in front of

him.    The officer tried to attract the attention of

both youths who he had seen on the barrier, but could

not get close enough to attract their attention.




It should be mentioned that both officers believed

that the barrier concerned was the one which later

collapsed, with Sergeant Burman being quite definitive

"This youth was stood on top of the barrier that was

later to collapse...", and PC Scholey being rather

less so, "In hindsight I believe this barrier was the

one that collapsed."




PC 2167 Frost, who was also on duty in the West Stand,

was, during the same period, approached by a Liverpool

supporter, who told the officer that on two separate
occasions there has been a build up of spectators out­

side the Leppings Lane entrance, and that turnstile

operators were accepting £10 "in the hand" from spec­

tators who had arrived without tickets.    This officer

had occasion to eject a spectator from the West Stand

who had gained entrance by scaling a barrier wall, and

whilst this individual was not drunk, the officer con­

sidered that he had been drinking.




At 2.17pm the Control Room received a message from        STATEMENT
                                                          5
Superintendent Marshall, requesting that Leppings Lane

be closed to traffic.     Although the closed circuit

television monitors did not identify any apparent

problem, appropriate action was taken for officers to

attend and to effect the closure.




At 2.22pm, a further message was received from Super­     STATEMENT

intendent Marshall, advising Control that Leppings        5

Lane was still open to traffic and, as a consequence,

a further message was communicated to the appropriate

officers for action to be taken.     Superintendent

Marshall then asked for a message to be passed to

 South Yorkshire Transport, advising them of the

 closure, in order that bus routes could be deviated,

 and this was arranged.




 As 2.30pm approached, Superintendent Murray noticed      STATEMENT
               that the North Stand appeared to be about half full,

               and that whilst the West Stand was filling, there

               still remained a number of large, clear sections in

               certain ’pens’.   By this time a large crowd was

               gathering outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles, which

               was not considered to pose any real problem, as there

               was still 30 minutes before kick-off.




5.8.39         At around this time Chief Superintendent Duckenfield        STATEMENTS
                                                                           3 & 5
               and Superintendent Murray had a short discussion about

               the criteria for delaying the kick-off, and Superin­

               tendent Murray informed the Chief Superintendent that

               it had been agreed that, in the event of any identi­

               fiable problem which prevented people from arriving on

               time (e.g. motorway accidents or bad weather con­

               ditions), then kick-off would be delayed.   However, if

               it was simply a case that spectators arrived "at the

               last minute", having previously decided to go "else­

               where", then this would not normally be a reason for

               delaying the kick-off.




         (i)   The Developing Situation

               By 2.30pm the situation outside the turnstiles at

               Leppings Lane end was becoming much more congested.     A
typical observation is that provided by PC 2887 Grant ,   STATEMENT
                                                          29
who said that large numbers of Liverpool supporters

had arrived by this time and were pressed up to the

turnstiles.   The view through the turnstiles was

totally obstructed and it quickly became apparent that

the searching of fans was no longer practicable or

even possible.   The priority was to permit a quick

entry to as many ticket holding fans as quickly and

safely as possible, whilst at the same time ejecting

those without tickets.




It was during one such ejection via, Gate C, that the

steward on duty refused to open it as he feared that

spectators would rush in.   He was, however, instructed

to open the gate, and the individual was ejected with­

out significant problems.




Pressure continued to increase outside the turnstiles

and fans were becoming trapped within them, which

caused further problems.    It was noted that a large

number of fans who were entering at this stage were

under the influence of alcohol, (some quite heavily),

but by this time it was not possible to eject them

due to crowd pressure behind the turnstiles and at

Gat e C •




There is video evidence to show that there were            VIDEO REFERENCE

greater numbers of fans at the turnstiles, extended        14.35.20
back into Leppings Lane.     This figure was increasing,

despite the continuing entry of fans into the ground

via the turnstiles.    At this time fans were attemp­

ting to climb the fencing and a densely packed crowd

of at least 5,000 were seen forming back from the

turnstile area into the main road.      There was an over­

spill of 500 or more away from turnstiles A-G into the

service road, down at the side of Gate C.




At about 2.30pm Inspector Purdy was on the concourse

outside the turnstiles, supervising and assisting

serials 16, 17, 18 and 19.     The spectators had been

queueing orderly, when suddenly the turnstiles seemed

to fill and he could smell beer in the atmosphere.       He

stated, "It just smelled like the tap room of a pub"

and there were a considerable number of drunken per­

sons all around him.




The crowd became a mass of pushing, shoving persons,

and he says:

     "People were crushed up against the wall,

     the turnstiles, the far wall and barrier.

     I saw people in pain, suffering.      There

     was a child passed from well in the middle

     of the crowd to me on the rail.     He was

     limp.     I thought he was dead.   He was limp

     in my arms.     (The child recovered almost

     immediately and was passed to the edge of
     the crowd).     The pressure was so great,

     people were screaming and crying, they

     could not move."

2.40pm, two serials were instructed to attend Leppings

Lane. Sergeant Higgins, under the command of Inspector

Delaney, was ordered to attend the turnstiles, the

full serial 20 being required.     On arrival at the

rear of the North Stand, they were deployed to Gate A,

where they remained.

officers (later increased by 4 to a total of 17) was

heavily engaged in crowd control duties on the outside

of the turnstiles.     The fans had changed from a quiet,

good humoured crowd to a mass of people intent on

getting into the ground.     He was fully aware of the

serious situation developing, and states:

     "I shouted continuously to the crowd to

     stop pushing, as did the other officers.

     We waved our arms to convey our meaning.

     The crowd simply ignored us and kept

     increasing in volume.     Things eventually
    became so overcrowded that my horse,

    ’Hussar’, who is seventeen and a half hands

    high, and weighs well over half a ton, was

    surrounded by fans who were wrapped around

    his whole body like cellophane or cling­

    film.   The horse could not move a muscle.

    He began to lose his footing as he was

     lifted by the crowd."




Inspector Hand-Davis used various tactics in an

endeavour to control the crowd, but he states:

     "Realising the hopelessness of the situa­

     tion, I formed a line of horses across the

     Leppings Lane access area outside of the

     blue wrought iron gate, in a further

     attempt to stop fans joining the 'melee.'

     I would think around 11/12 horses lined

     up and formed a quite effective barrier

     sideways onto the crowd, who were still

     pouring along Leppings Lane towards the

     ground. I could see the tactics working

     to some reasonable effect - the crowd began

     to thin slightly at the turnstile -

     suddenly they started throwing themselves

     under the horses legs and bellies.     They

     forced themselves between each horse with

     a complete disregard for their own safety."

             able to hear each other on the 'talk through' facility

              and that the fault appeared to be located in some part

              of the equipment within the Control Room.




              At this time the ground control personnel at Hills­

when the Landrover driven by PC Buxton arrived.     The

vehicle was carrying a roof mounted public address

system, which was used in an attempt to control the

crowd.     Inspector Ellis climbed onto the roof of the

Landrover and took control of the public address

system and personally instructed the crowd to stop

pushing.



At 2.44pm, Superintendent Marshall requested the           STATEMENT

requested that they refrain from pushing.




Superintendent Marshall was monitoring the worsening       STATEMENT

situation, he observed mounted officers in the thick

of the crowd who were clearly having a most difficult

 time, their horses were struggling and anxiety was

written on the faces of more than one officer.      Over

 the next few minutes scenes outside the turnstiles

 deteriorated very rapidly, supporters were under the

 influence of drink, people were fighting each other,
the best efforts of Foot and Mounted officers failed

to deter the relentless pressure at the turnstiles.




By 2.45pm it was also becoming obvious to officers on

duty inside the turnstile entrance to Leppings Lane

that serious problems were developing.      PC Grant    STATEMENT
                                                        29
states that at this stage:

     "Fans entering the ground were near to

     collapse. Many did fall down through

     exhaustion on gaining entry.   Some fans

     were crying, nearly all were extremely

     angry, abusing us and shouting at me to

     do something.   I was grabbed by one

     hysterical man in his late 2 0 's, who shook

     me violently and screamed at my face,

     'Listen, you fucking bastard, they're

     dying out there - kids.   Where's your

     fucking radio, do something, do some­

     thing.” ’




PC 1675 Rich is one of the many officers who provides   STATEMENT

                                                        18
a similar account:

     "As the crowd built up, I became con­

     scious of people having difficulty in

     entering through the turnstiles.    The

     crush outside was such that the turn­

     stiles, on occasions, were unable to

      function properly, and people were being
    injured in the turnstile passage.   More

    than one man emerged from the turnstile

    bent double, and I saw one man physically

     sick."



Spectators then began to scale the walls, some bran­

dishing valid entry tickets and other complaining of a

crush outside.   Inspector J. J. Bennett, who was the    STATEMENT
                                                         21
Logistics Officer for the semi-final, witnessed what

was taking place, saw that all the officers on

duty were fully engaged, and concluded that further

assistance was required at this location.   His

request, which was made with his personal radio, was

acknowledged, after which he then approached the turn­

stiles to find that whilst many spectators who were

being admitted were abusive and offensive, his over­

riding impression was one of panic and fear amongst

the spectators that serious injuries or death were

about to occur in the crush outside.




Inspector Bennett informed Control, with a view to

additional action being taken outside the ground, and

was then joined by Inspector Delaney and members of       STATEMENT

the 'F' Division Crime and Vandal Squad, who had res­
                                                         37

ponded to his initial call for further police assis­

tance.   Inspector Bennett noted that those who were

attempting to gain entry over the boundary walls

appeared to be in considerable danger from electric
cables, and he therefore climbed onto the roof of a

turnstile in order to deter further incursions.

Instead, however, he found himself confronted with a

huge crowd which extended beyond the outer barrier

gates and into Leppings Lane in both directions.

Under normal circumstances he would have estimated the

size of the crowd as being approximately 2 thousand,

but such was the concentrated crush that he considers

 the true number was probably twice this figure.

Realising the immediate and obvious danger which

existed, Inspector Bennett decided that, rather than

preventing persons from climbing over the wall, he

would allow them to do so, and indicated a safe route

back to ground level, via the route which he himself

had taken to reach his current point of vantage.     He

noted that, whilst none of the men were disorderly at

this stage, a number had difficulty in standing and

had obviously been drinking.   A number, having gained

entry, passed their tickets back to waiting spectators

and this was a further problem with which the officers

found themselves so suddenly and unexpectedly con­

fronted.




Many fans who jumped from the turnstile

roof, injured themselves in the process, and, in

addition, guttering was dislodged, which fell to the

ground.    One spectator almost landed "on top" of WPC

3107 Pearson, who asked him if he could produce a
ticket.   At this, he became very abusive and

struggled violently with the female officer, who had

to be assisted by one of her male colleagues to eject

the offender from the ground.



A further complication which had occurred is mentioned

in the statement of PC 1543 Aitken, who found that        STATEMENT
                                                          39
spectators had been queueing at the wrong turnstiles,

and were being returned to other queues.   As the

pressure increased, a stone pillar had become loose

and had to be removed for the protection of the

spectators.




The pushing on the outside gates continued, and one

spectator said to PC 1423 Newbould, who was also at       STATEMENT
                                                          40
this location, "It's fucking hell out there     you'll

have to do something, people are getting crushed."

Similarly, according to PC 1780 Craighill, "People        STATEMENT
                                                          41
were screaming and shouting for help".




Officers outside, including Mounted officers, were

 having increasing difficulties in maintaining control

 of the crowd.   There was immense pressure observed at

 Gate A, officers stationed within the turnstile

 concourse were concerned that the gate would be forced

 away from the wall supports.   There was continuous

 pressure at this gate for the next 15 minutes.

             one child had a bright red colour to his face.     People

             were shouting, "I'ts going to be another Heysel and

             people are going to get fucking killed."




    5927     The Constable recalls that he now feared for his life

              and the life of those near, as the surge of the

              turnstiles reached unbearable pressure -

                   "I was aware thre was an old man on the

              floor, but could do nothing about it.

              There was a look of sheer panic on the

              faces of those around."

              He himself began to feel extremely frightened and

              faint.   People were shouting, "Someone's going to die

              here".



    5 9.28    Officers deployed on the outside of the turnstiles and

              on the inside ground area of turnstiles have similar

              accounts of the fear, anxiety and distress as the

              crowd relentlessly crushed towards the turnstiles and

              regardless of the attempts that were being made by all

              officers, along those lines of turnstiles, an

              impossible situation was developing where positive

              action was necessary to relieve the pressure.



«
As fans came through all sections of the turnstiles,

some were saying words to the effect that "if

something isn't done then people will be crushed and

killed outside."    These fans were white faced, shaking

and crying.

During this time, senior officers in the Control Room

had been monitoring the situation, and Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield now wondered whether,           STATEMENT
                                                           3
because of the deteriorating situation, he should

delay the kick-off, to ease the difficulties.

However, the first team then ran out onto the pitch

and he therefore considered that this was an option

which was no longer available.




At 2.47 pm Chief Superintendent Duckenfield, whilst in     STATEMENT

                                                           3
Ground Control, received a request, from

Superintendent Marshall, for the exit gates to be

opened to release the pressure arounjd the turnstile

entrances.    Whilst considering this request, assessing

the space in the ground and looking at the CCTV

monitor, Mr. Duckenfield saw Gate C open and

supporters enter at the rear of the Leppings Lane

Stand.




Sergeant Crawford was on duty at the rear of               STATEMENT

turnstiles A - G, which are adjacent to Gate C.     The
                                                           22

Sergeant was present when Gate C opened, the time

would be 2.48 pm.    After a few moments he, together
with a steward, was able to close the gate, only a few

fans having entered by that gate.




Fans were climbing the walls of the turnstiles, and

turnstile G collapsed and was inoperable.   After a

period of what can only be described as chaos Gate C

was opened.



Mounted police officers, including PC Lindsay,            STATEMENT

opened, and force the crowd back away from the gate

through Gate C.



A large number of spectators continued to converge on

 Leppings Lane from both directions, the people were

 amassed outside the turnstiles and, again, a fairly

 large section of the crowd were spilling down the

 service road and being forced up against Gate C.




 There is evidence from officers' reports to show that

 the extreme pressure in front of the turnstile had

 slowed the movement of fans through into the ground.

 Sergeant Crawford states that turnstile G was             STATEMENT

 distorted through physical pressure and it was
          inoperable and fans were becoming stuck in the

          turnstiles.   This is supported by evidence in the form

          of a computer print-out, which has come into our

          possession, which shows that Gate G admitted only 583

          during the whole of the afternoon, as compared with an

          average of 1076 spectators through the other gates in      APPENDIX
                                                                     62

5.9.37    Detective Superintendent McKay was present when
                                                                      11
          Superintendent Marshall deployed both Mounted and Foot

          patrol officers in an attempt to stem the movement of

          fans towards the turnstiles.




5.9.38    Conditions deteriorated, missiles were thrown and he

          witnessed a beer can with drink flowing from it strike

          a Mounted Officer, who was almost unseated.    The crowd

          became progressively    unruly and aggressive and he

          began to have grave fears that the situation could

          only end in disaster.




5 .9.39   At this stage a second message was received from

          Superintendent Marshall to open the gates, stating         STATEMENT
                                                                      4
          that if this was not done then someone "was going to

          be killed".

          Chief Superintendent Duckenfield that the police were      STATEMENT
                                                                     3
          now faced with a serious situation and that Mr.
Marshall was making a demand rather than a request.

Nevertheless, the Chief Superintendent realised the

serious implications of what was involved, and saw

from his television monitors that the scene outside

the gates was one where spectators were being crushed

and officers were under severe pressure.    On the

inside of the ground, however, there were spaces on

the inside of the terrace and on the concourse, and

room to ease the situation.




Chief Superintendent Duckenfield reasoned as follows:

     If the gates were opened there MAY be crushing

     and injuries inside.     If the gates remained

     closed, there WOULD be serious injury or death on

     the outside.

Faced with this predicament, Chief Superintendent

Duckenfield says that he was left with no reasonable

or practical alternative.     He therefore issued the

instruction, "If there’s likely to be serious injury

or death, I have no option but to open the gates -

open the gates."

 Sergeant Crawford was standing at the rear of the

 turnstiles A - G, very near Gate C:

      "The mood of the fans entering through the

      turnstiles was getting worse and many were under

      the influence of drink, the noise outside was

      tremendous.   Suddenly, Gate C burst open for a

      second time and fans in increasing numbers
     entered the ground."

At 2.52 pm the video recording shows that Gate C was        VIDEO REFERENCE

opened and fans, encouraged by Mounted officers, were       14.52.30

moving away from the front of turnstiles A - G, and

entering through the open gate.    There was no rush as

the fans were seen to just walk into the ground.




The video shows that the situation still remained           VIDBO REFERENCE

critical within the turnstile areas 1 - 16, and             14.53.43

considerable pressure was being exerted on Gate A,

which was closed.   Officers all along this section of

the turnstiles continued to struggle in their attempts

to get fans through the turnstiles as quickly as

possible.   Officers' reports give graphic accounts of

the worsening situation.    Sergeant 1757 Bums was in       STATEMENT
                                                             44
charge of Serial 15, consisting of 10 officers.      They

were reserved for the area of the Leppings Lane

turnstiles 11-16.   The accounts of some of this serial

have been quoted earlier.     Sergeant Bums describes

some of the fans as behaving like animals, others were

shouting for assistance, Gate B was under immense

pressure.   There were references to "people going to

be killed out there."   The smell of alcohol is said to

have pervaded the atmosphere.     The general opinion of

the serial was that many people were in great

difficulty outside the turnstiles.     There was concern

that Gate B would collapse.     Officers relate to

two other policemen not from their serial, and a
steward, opening Gate B.    Estimates differ, but it is

said that between 200 and 1000 fans gained access at

this point.



The perimeter gates were still held by the Mounted

Section, although there is evidence of increased crowd

pressure on the ranks of Mounted officers.




The video shows that the crowd within Leppings Lane            VIDBO REFERENCE

was swaying and exerting considerable pressure on the          TAPE 14
                                                               14.54.20
police.



Gate C remained open and as the crowd immediately in

front of the turnstiles began to diminish, the mass on

Leppings Lane broke through the rank of horses and

surges in through Gate C.




At 2.45 pm the turnstiles 1 - 1 6   and the front of Gate

A were still severely congested.    Fans were climbing

the walls and turnstiles, and a large number were

attemtpting to force Gate A open.     Officers on duty

behind Gate A (Sergeant Higgins) state that the                STATEMENT
                                                               33
 pressure on the gate was so great that it was in

 danger of being forced from the wall.    The gate

 steward was having to physically hold the bolts in

 place to prevent them springing open.




 (Point of information - The steward at this gate was

 Jack Stone, who is known to Sergeant 840 Wright.     He was    STATEMENT
                                                                45
requested to open Gate A for reserve officers being

deployed at the Leppings Lane turnstiles.     Mr. Stone

refused and, as a result, these officers had to

negotiate a number of internal gates from the North

Stand to Gate C on the West Stand, which by this time

had been opened. When Gate A was eventually opened, at

the behest of the police, the incoming fans only

gained access to the North Stand and could not

transfer to the West Stand.     Mr. Stone has since

received much publicity.




Gate C was still open, the Mounted officers were

attempting to     hold the crowd back at the perimeter

gate, but the     line was breached, and the fans simply

surged forward, defying all attempts by the Mounted

officers, and     began to enter through the open Gate    C.

During this time, Gate     B was opened.




At this time, Inspector Delaney, Sergeant Higgins and

F Crime and Vandal (Serial 20) were deployed to Gate A

having been instructed by Ground Control to attend as

a reserve unit.     The unit were gathered on the inside

of Gate A as it was impossible for them to go out onto

the concourse due to the pressure on that gate.          Gate

A had to be held by two stewards, and they were

pushing up the top bolts as continuing pressure and

shaking was loosening them,and the bottom bolts.

Sergeant Higgins radioed Ground Control and requested

that Gate A be opened to save life and
limb stating that if not, someone would be killed.      A

reply came back over the air to open Gate A.




Serial 20 were gathered together and made a single

file on the wall side, the Sergeant nearest the gate.

Another unit did likewise on the turnstile side of the

gate.   The Sergeant ordered that gate to be opened,

the steward at first refused, suggesting that were he

to conform to the police request, then many more

deaths would occur.     The Sergeant explained his

reasons for wanting the gate opened, the steward then

shouted through the glass panel, telling the crowd he

was opening the gates.     The steward then showed them

the key through a small glass spy panel,

demonstrating he was going to use it to open up.

The lock part was opened, followed by the top and

bottom bolts.    The two serials prepared to stop any

stampede when the gate was opened as the pressure

was relieved.




Due to the fact that all three gates were now open,

the crowd began to diminish in size as they entered

the ground.     At this moment, a cheer went up from

within the ground and the urgency of spectators to

gain entry increased.
Once action was taken to open the gates,

police officers within the concourse found themselves

a target of abuse as the spectators entered the

ground.




According to the statement of WPC 3131 Lewis:            STATEMENT
                                                         46
     "There was continued abuse from the fans.

     A short time later I recall the blue gates

     being opened.    The following scene was

     terrible.    Fans were pushing, running,

     fighting their way through the gates like

     a stampede, people were being carried

     through.    Again, anger and abuse were

     directed towards police officers.     One

     fan was pulled from the crowd with two

     cans of beer, others asked if they could

     stand with us as they were frightened...

     I saw one of the stewards stood flat

     against a wall to avoid being injured."




Another officer, PC 2654 Richardson, describes the      STATEMENT

                                                        47
scene as follows




     "Such were the numbers of people entering

     that I feared for my own safety, and I

     released my hold on the youth I was escor­

     ting and took refuge in a turnstile until

     the flood had subsided.    As these people
     had entered Che ground, there was obvious

     panic and they were literally climbing

     over each other in an attempt to get to

     the terraces.    After they had passed, I

     gave what assistance I could to those

     injured and trampled, and when the situa­

     tion appeared calm, I returned to my

     position."




At 3.00pm Gate C was closed and, once more, spectators

were seen entering the ground via the normal turn­

stile procedures.    Very shortly after this, according

to officers' statements, Gate A, under the control of

Inspector Sykes, and Gate B, were also closed, thereby

effectively restoring normality and allowing the

correct entry procedures to be adopted.




The number of police officers engaged in duties out­

side the Leppings Lane turnstiles at the height of the

problems, just prior to the opening of Gate C at

2.48pm were as follows - Sector Commander, Superinten­

dent Marshall, Detective Superintendent McKay, Chief

Inspectors Waring and Creaser, Inspectors Purdy,

Sykes, Bennett, White, Ellis and Delaney, Sergeants -

9, Constables - 78, Detectives - 6 , Dog Handlers - 1,

Traffic Officer with Land Rover - 1.




Mounted Officers - Inspector Hand-Davis (SYP),

                                                                                  48
                   13, was positioned in the West Stand shortly before the

                   3 .00 pm kick-off,   and noticed that the crowd build-up on

                   the terracing appeared to be normal, with no evidence of

                   overcrowding or crushing.      He could see that the gates

                   which allowed people to move from 'pen' to 'pen', at the

                   rear of the goal, were open all the time, and that mem­

                   bers of the crowd were, in fact, using these constantly.




5.10.2             After the 2 teams had been on the pitch for what     he des­

                   cribes as "several minutes before the kick-off , Inspec­

                   tor Bullas looked down on the crowd from a position in

                   the centre of the stand, and saw what he describes as a

                   "river of people" suddenly enter the terracing from the

                   central tunnel.      The "wedge of people" seemed to push

                    forward down the terracing - pushing the people that

                   were already standing there, forward.      Inspector Bullas

                    attempted to contact the Police Control Post by personal

                    radio, but was unable to do so, due to the amount of

                    "traffic" on the radio, and the crowd noise around him.

                    He attempted to beckon the attention of the officers who

                    were standing at the rear of the Leppings Lane goal, and

                    saw, shortly afterwards, that these officers were

                    obviously aware that something was wrong within the

                    crowd.



                    Police Constable 1285 Smith was one of those officers         STATEMENT
  5-10.3
                                                                                   49
            and, on the 15 April 1 9 8 9 , was carrying out a duty which

            he has performed almost continually since 1 9 8 3 .   He has

            policed a number of semi-finals at this location, and

            was present in 1988 when the same teams met at Hills­

            borough .




5.10.4      On that occasion, the terraces were filled well prior to

            kick-off and during the course of the match, PC Smith

            and his colleagues had to suffer a great deal of verbal

            abuse and spitting from the spectators in the terraces,

            many of whom had been obviously drinking.




5 .1 0 .5   At the conclusion of the game two of the perimeter

            gates, leading from the terraces to the playing area,

            were opened by spectators reaching through the fencing

            and releasing the lock mechanism.    Part of the perimeter

            fencing was ripped away and, by this method, a number of

            spectators were able to gain access onto the perimeter

            track.




            As a result of the problems experienced during the 1988

            semi-final, modifications were carried out to the gate

            mechanisms to prevent fans from reaching through and

            releasing the mechanism.   Metal sheets were welded into

            place, and the fencing which was replaced had a smaller

            mesh.



5-10.7      Prior to kick-off on the 15 April, 19 89 PC Smith was
            relieved, to take refreshments, and returned to his post

            at 2 .50 pm, to    find that whilst there was no gap within

            the crowds in      the centre 'pens', "they were not full."

            This is corroborated by PC 700 Helliwell, who relieved          STATEMENT
                                                                            50
            PC Smith for refreshments, and confirms that there were

            empty spaces in the 'pens'.       It is relevant to note that

            the crowd in the centre 'pen' were seen to push and

            surge forward on three or four occasions, but there was

            no crushing at the front at this time.       PC Smith walked

            towards Gate      3, where he saw a group of fans (approxi­

            mately 20-30 in number) jumping up and down, whilst at

            the same time pushing, thereby causing a surging towards

            the front parts of the terrace.      According to PC Smith,

            this group were positioned half way down the terracing,

            to the left of Gate      3 and, as he looked towards them, a

            cheer went up      and he knew that the teamshad come onto

            the pitch.     PC Smith states:

                 "There was a lot of pushing in the crowd

                  in the 'pen' in front of me, the Centre

                 South, surged forward to the fencing, some

                  people at the front shouted and screamed.

                 The crowd then moved back.       I recall a ball

                  hitting the perimeter fence near to Gate 4,

                  and the fans again surged forward and

                  back..."



5 . 10. 8   At this stage PC Smith saw a serial of police officers

            walking in front of the North Stand, near to the corner
with the terracing.




Suddenly, Gate No. 3 "flew open", and the crowd moved

back from the 'pens'.    PC Smith closed the gate

immediately and assumed that the pressure of the surge

had been responsible for the gate opening.     At this

state, there was nogreat pressure at the front, and

PC Smith was joined     by 2 more officers, who he assumed

were from the serial he had seen a few seconds earlier.




Without warning, the gate opened again and PC Smith

states:

     "...I attempted to re-close, but was unable

     to do so, due to pressure from the fans,

     these were not the same fans who had been

     stood there on the previous occasion."




Why the fans were not the same as those who PC Smith had

seen on the "previous occasion" is a matter of conjec­

ture, and it is not felt appropriate that any conclusion

should be drawn in this submission.     On this occasion

PC Smith was assisted by    his colleagues to close the

gate, but he is not     sure whether it was fully locked at

this point.   Suddenly, PC Smith heard fans shouting and

screaming, "We're squashed, open the gates you bas­

tards."   On stepping back from the gate he    saw

that people were tightly packed up against the perimeter

fence and noticed, in particular, 2 or 3 young women to
          the right of the gate.     It was at this stage that the

          officer realised the seriousness of the situation and

          transmitted a message over his radio, asking permission

          to open the gates.     In doing this, he was merely com­

          plying with the instruction of his Operational Order.        APPENDIX
                                                                       39


5-10.12   It is relevant to note (in respect of the order of

          events as they took place) that whilst PC Smith received

          no reply, he recalls hearing some message about "a gate

          being opened elsewhere."     If this timing is correct,

          then it would appear that the crushing at the front of

          the terraces began prior to (or at approximately the

          same time) as permission was granted for the opening of

          the exit gates by the Police Commander.




5.10.13   In his statement,    PC Smith then describes how "the

          noise was terrible and people were screaming a different

          type of scream."     He opened Gate 3 fully, and then saw

          that people were being forced onto the fence, and turn­

          ing blue.   He communicated another radio message to the

          effect, "This is serious, people are drying in here",

          before attempting to pull people out of the gate.       He

          found, however, that spectators were "jammed solid" and

          that one of the females was "turning a dark colour."

          At this stage, PC Smith climbed onto the hoardings,

          looked over the fence, and gestured for the fans to get

          back, but to no avail - he was told, "Fuck off, copper",

          and was spat upon.    In his statement, PC Smith concludes
          as follows:

               "On reflection I cannot see any connection

               between the gates being opened at the rear

               of the Leppings Lane stand and the crush

               in the terraces.   There never appeared any

               blockage in the tunnel entrance/exit.       I

               formed the impression when trying to get

               people out of the gate that there were

               people underneath the ones I could see.

               Whilst getting people out of the gate, a

               barrier from the terrace was thrown over

               the perimeter fence.    It was at this time

               I realised that a barrier had given way.

               I was completely unaware of where it had

               come from.   The fencing mesh had bulged

               outwards whilst the fans were against it,

               and I later saw that the barrier was

               situated directly behind 3 gate and the

               perimeter fencing had been forced to the

               perimeter wall and buckled.    At no time

               did there appear to be any great influx of

               supporters into the pens.     The crush at

               the front had been considerably lightened

               by the time the barrier was thrown."




5 10.14   0ne of PC Smith's colleagues, PC 417 Illingworth, was on   STATEMENT
                                                                     51
          duty at Gate No. 5, and witnessed a similar scene in the

          centre 'pens'.    This officer states:
                "I saw the Centre pen was very full, but

                the two outer pens were only about half

                full.     This surprised me as I had never

               seen the fans so badly dispersed.      At first

                there did not appear to be a serious prob­

               lem, fans were swaying back and forth and

               some were climbing...into the stand pen.

               This is a common occurrence at most matches,

               the swaying and pushing became much worse

               to the extent that females were screaming

               and fans were beginning to panic."




5.10.15   By this time, PC Illingworth had moved near to Gate 4

          and transmitted a radio message to the effect, "There

          is a serious crush down here, it is serious."      At this

          stage, the officer opened Gate No. 4, and assisted an

          injured man onto the track.     Fans began to spill out

          and PC Illingworth attempted to shepherd them back

          through Gates 5 and 6 (into     the side ’pens'), which he

          had also opened.     It was at this stage that PC Illing­

          worth saw the body     of a man behind the fence, but it was

          impossible at that     stage to get to him, as he was laid

          flat and was trodden on by other spectators in their

          attempts to escape.




5-10.16   Police Sergeant 2379 Swift, who was stood nearby,              STATEMENT
                                                                         52
          realised that a serious problem was developing as Gate

          4 was opened.     He fully expected a flood of spectators
          tosurge onto the track,    but then found that no person

          came   through the gate of their own accord.    The crowd

          was so tightly packed that each person had to be pulled

          through, as officers became embroiled in frantic efforts

          to rescue people through the gate.




5.10.17   Paradoxically, it was obvious to the Sergeant that the

          problem was confined to only an area at the front of the

          terracing; indeed:

                 "It was obvious that the people only a

                 short distance away into the terracing

                 and only a few feet away from the fence,

                 were unaware of the people in distress...

                 there was still a crescendo of noise from

                 the main body of the crowd, who were

                 engrossed in the match."




5.10.18   This is confirmed by DC 1177 Davies, who states:            STATEMENT
                                                                      53
                 "After assisting a couple of persons over

                 the fencing, it became apparent that there

                 was no obvious cause for the crushing.

                 Behind the 5 deep crush there was plenty

                 of space and most people were ignoring

                 the crush at the fence and looking forward

                 over towards the pitch without any apparent

                 distress or discomfort."

          These accounts would appear to be further confirmed by

           photographs which are now available and also by newsreel
            film recordings which were taken at the time.                 VIDEO

            aimlessly on the track, without any direction.   No radio

            communications were being received, and it was con­

            sidered at this stage that there had either been a

            "pitch invasion" or alternatively spectators had been

            re-located in the outer wings of the terraces.

                                                                          3 and 6
            tendent Duckenfield directed the Ground Commander,

            Superintendent Greenwood, to the Leppings Lane terraces

            for an immediate appraisal of the situation.




5.10.23     On his arrival, Superintendent Greenwood saw police
officers near to the open perimeter gates, and it was

immediately apparent to him that there was a crowd prob­

lem involving heavy congestion at the front of the

terraces.   He saw quite clearly that supporters were

being squashed against the fencing in 'pen' 3 and

states:

     "The area behind the gate was heavily

     congested, preventing persons from exiting.

     I should mention that the perimeter fence

     gate is not wide enough to allow a mass

     exit of persons, being in the order of a

     normal door's width.   The actual terracing

     is at a lower level than the perimeter

     and one has to mount one or more steps

     so as to exit from the terracing, through

     the gate onto the pitch.   Police officers

     were trying to get supporters out.     I then

     mounted the advertising hoarding, and from

     above fence level, surveyed the whole of

     the crowd in the 'pen'.    I could see that

     there were also people behind the front

     row who were squeezed and being pushed

     towards the fencing.   As one looked further

     back, the crowd, probably more than two

     thirds, were watching the match, quite

     unaware of what was happening at the

     front."
    5.10.24   Superintendent Greenwood's immediate assessment was that

              the problem could be alleviated if the crowd at the

              middle and the back of the terracing moved back to ease

              the pressure at the front:

                   "There was room to do so, and the central

                   tunnel was clear.    I therefore gestured

                   to the crowd in the middle and towards the

                   back, with both hands, in a pushing

                   motion, shouting at them to move back,

A                  and also with both index fingers, pointing

                   down to the front of the crowd, so as to

                   indicate to them that there was a problem

                   at the front.    I gained no reaction to

                   this, and more people started to climb

                   towards the fencing.    It was apparent at

                   that stage that the match could not con­

                   tinue ."

              standing at the back of the goal, gesticulating by

              intendent Murray that this was an indication for the

              game to be stopped, and Chief Superintendent Duckenfield

              agreed with this request.

a pitch invasion, shouted instructions through a loud

hailer.




Superintendent Murray went onto the track and approached

a linesman, whilst Superintendent Greenwood ran onto the   STATEMENTS

pitch, past the Liverpool goal keeper (who was seem­

ingly unaware of what was going on around him), and

succeeded in attracting the referee's attention.   The

referee was informed that a serious incident had

occurred, that the game must be stopped and the

players removed from the pitch.   The referee agreed

without argument.



Superintendent Greenwood returned to the perimeter fence

but found radio communications extremely difficult

because of the noise.   An officer was despatched to

summon the ambulance which was standing nearby, and

another to alert St. John's Ambulance staff to attend at

the scene.




The presence of press photographers proved a serious

hindrance and an officer was deputed to "keep them at

bay."



By now it was obvious to all concerned that a major

incident had occurred and, at 3 -08pm, Superintendent      STATEMENT

                    for cutting equipment to be brought to the scene, and

                    for tannoy messages to be broadcast, asking people at

                    the Leppings Lane end to move back.




    5.10.31         Whilst all this was taking place other officers had

                    arrived at the scene. It is appropriate at this

                    stage to quote a number of examples, in order to illus­

                    trate the overwhelming efforts of individual officers to

                    rescue those who were trapped or injured, and also to

                    tration of the problems which they encountered.




    5.11      (k)   The Rescue Effort




    5.11.1          PC 2887 Grant                                                 STATEMENT
                                                                                  29
                    After the gates had been opened, and the resulting crowd

                    had dispersed into the stadium, PC Grant took a moment

                    to recover, and thought, "thank God that's over."     As he

                    did so, however, he saw a number of police officers

                    running towards Leppings Lane terraces, and at the same

                    time heard a tannoy announcement, asking Liverpool spec­

                    tators to leave the pitch.   Together with other officers

                    PC Grant ran onto the pitch, went up to the front of the

                    terrace, and was met with a "scene of carnage", with

                    fans crushed tightly against the fence of the Centre

                    South enclosure, some already blue in the face.     A spec­

                    tator behind Gate 3 fell forward to escape the terrace

                    and, in so doing, became pinned down by those behind him
and completely blocked all escape from this exit.        He

was eventually removed and officers tried to tear down

the fencing around the perimeter.




Throughout this period the officers at the front of the

fence had been subjected to a hail of missiles from the

crowd.     A blue metal crash barrier was thrown from

the crowd, and landed next to them.     PC Grant was hit by

a shoe and coins thrown from the crowd, and removed 9

bodies from the terraces, 4 of which he tried to rescus-

itate, but to no avail.




PC 1790 Craighill

Together with other officers in his serial, PC Craighill

made his way to the back of the terracing and attempted

to move supporters from the Centre South 'pen' into the

less congested South 'pen'.     He states:

     "I shouted to them to move into the South

         'pen', most of the supporters refused

     point blank, others moved in slowly,

     either by me pushing them or of their own

         free will."



At this stage PC Craighill was approached by a drunken

youth, who shouted, "It's your fault, you bastards",

before striking the officer in the face.         PC Craighill

struck the youth on the arm with his staff and then

 lost sight of him.     The officer then went down the
           terracing, and states:

                "I stopped when I reached a number of

                bodies on the floor.       I saw that within

                the pile of bodies, a barrier had fallen

                over, and had been uprooted from the con­

                crete.       There were a large number of

                bodies, mostly lying on top of each other.

                I saw people climbing on top of the

                bodies, trying to climb over the perimeter

                   fence."




5.11.5     This officer then tried to rescusitate a youth aged

           about 1 5 - 1 6 years, who had been vomitting, and appeared

           to have stopped breathing.       As he did so, PC Craighill

           was grabbed by a "fan", who was described as "blind

           drunk", who began pushing at the officer, swearing and

           shouting various obscenities.       Rescusitation on the

           youth continued, and he was carried onto the pitch,

           where a man who identified himself as a doctor, advised

           the officer to "give it up."       He agreed that he was

           dead.

                                                                    58 and 38
         Both officers had been standing inside the Leppings Lane

         entrance when they were approached by a man in a dis­

         tressed state, who told them that children at the front

         of the pen were being squashed.    They went through the

         tunnel and found that cries for help were coming from

         different directions.    The officers reached a point

         where they came across "a pile of bodies", at which

         stage PC Martin comments:

              "I think some supporters didn't realise

              how serious the situation was, and were

              more concerned about keeping their spot

              in case the match started again.    As I

              was trying to get the injured out, I was

              getting a lot of verbal abuse from suppor­

              ters, and could smell alcohol in the air."




5.11.8   The dead and injured were removed to the tunnel at the

         rear of the stand, and PC Martin was approached by a

         man, who pointed his finger in her face and called her a

         "fucking murderer."     Both officers witnessed fans

         wandering amongst the dead and injured, frantically

         searching for friends or relatives who were missing.

         PC Pearson recalls:

              "Most of the fans were in an extreme state

              of shock.    I tried to comfort and reassure

              several of these people, but there was

              little   I could do for them, one man clung
     to me and cried hysterically.   I had to

     sit him facing a wall, so he couldn't see

     the dead bodies lying all around."

This officer believes that from the number of injured

and dead and the condition of some of the bodies, the

crushing must have started some time before the exit

gates were opened. Since her original statement was sub­

mitted PC Pearson has been asked to clarify these re­

marks in greater detail and she has since submitted a

supplementary statement, in which she describes how she

entered the West terrace via the tunnel, forced her way

down the terrace in ’P e n ’ 4, and was confronted by a

pile of bodies, the uppermost being that of a female,

who was briefly examined.   The deceased had a purple

complexion, and her eyes, lips and nose were almost

black.   PC Pearson felt her face and found that it was

cold and it is this officer's opinion that the woman had

been dead longer than the few minutes which had elapsed

between the gates being opened and her discovering the

body.    PC Pearson is an officer of only 8 months service

and, as such has only limited experience.    She is, how­

ever, quite categorical in her belief that the woman had

been dead for some time.




A further statement has since been received from PC 3023

Martin, who confirms that as she went to the terrace via

the tunnel, there were no dead or* injured persons within

the tunnel at that time.

Inspector Sykes entered the West Stand terrace through

the tunnel and instructed officers in that area to

assist in moving people from the back of the terraces

and out of the ground, in order to enable those at the

front to be rescued.   Some spectators were at first

reluctant to mo ve, but eventually a path was cleared

for the casualties to be transported.    He then saw some

officers who were struggling to carry a young teenage

girl, who was unconscious and who had stopped breathing.

Inspector Sykes assisted to remove the girl, and as she

was being carried up the terracing, her T shirt was

pulled over her head, as a result of which, the top half

of her body was partially naked.   Someone in the crowd

was then heard to shout, "Throw her up here” , which was

followed by a profane obscenity.   The girl was removed

to the enclosure area, where she was rescusitated, with

the assistance of a young policewoman.




PC 2806 Butler                                                 STATEMENT
                                                               59
In his statement PC Butler describes how he removed

spectators from the terraces, many of whom were

obviously dead.   However, attempts were made to rescusi-

tate each person until death was confirmed by one of the

several doctors, who by this time were at the scene.      PC

Butler tried to rescusitate 7 or 8 persons, and one

subsequently recovered.   Throughout this time, some of
          the fans were being abusive, and missiles were being

          thrown, including a large metal angle plate, which be­

          came embedded in the turf.     PC Butler describes how some

          fans removed hoardings and piled them on the pitch to

          use as stretchers, whilst others climbed onto them,

          singing and jeering, and pulling them to pieces.




5-11.12   PC 2191 Llewellyn                                             STATEMENT
                                                                        60
          PC Llewellyn assisted in directing spectators at the

          back of the terracing, through the tunnel, in order to

          provide more space for the injured at the front.     He

          then saw a man lying on his back, who appeared to be

          unconscious.   With the help of a supporter, PC Llewellyn

          tried to drag him towards the tunnel entrance, and was

          shouting for other spectators to help.     He states that

          "people were watching us struggle".although, eventually,

          two others came to his assistance and carried the

          injured man to an ambulance.     Other people were being

          similarly treated, and PC Llewellyn was asked by a young

          female ambulance attendant if he would try to rescus-

          tate a young boy, (aged 1 0 - 1 1 years), whilst she worked

          on another casualty.    The officer saw that the boy had

          been vomitting and that he was not breathing, and did

          not appear to have any pulse.     The officer attempted

          heart massage, and oral rescusitation, but was unable

          to inflate his lungs.   As the ambulance made its journey

          to the Northern General Hospital the boy continued to

          vomit and PC Llewellyn and the young ambulance atten-
            dant held him upside down by his legs, in order to re­

            move the obstruction, but they were still unable to

            inflate his lungs.   The officer continued with oral

            rescusitation, until they reached the hospital, but the

            child continued to vomit.   On arrival, hospital staff

            continued the efforts in vain and approximately 5

            minutes after arrival, they pronounced the child dead.




• 5-11.13   A short time later PC Llewellyn returned in the ambu­

            lance with an emergency team, and continued to attend to

            the injured who were still being brought out.     PC

            Llewellyn states:

                 "Many of the fans were shouting and

                 swearing at the police, calling us

                 'murdering bastards', etc., and on several

                 occasions I thought I was going to be

                 assaulted, although this never actually

                 happened.   I was frightened for my own

                 safety, as were other officers."




  5-11.14   PC 159 Marsh                                                 STATEMENT

            The experience of this officer was very similar.       PC

            Marsh carried a young boy from the crowd and began

            rescusitation as the boy began to vomit.     The same pro­

            cedure was repeated and the officer was then joined by

             a doctor and together they transported the boy to an

             ambulance where , en route to the Northern General

            Hospital, PC Marsh repeated the rescusitation and
          eventually got a response.    The child was detained in

          hospital and died a few days later.

5.11.15                                                              47
          WPC Lewis succinctly summarises the situation with which

          she suddenly found herself faced - a situation shared by

          many of her colleagues who were involved in the rescue

          operation:

               "...I went back to the fence, it was

               horrific, I could not get over the fence,

               I couldn't get into the terracing to help,

               and people were dying in front of me.       I

               went back towards one of the gates, I

               could see police officers inside the

               terracing being pulled back, pushed and

               abused, as they tried to climb over the

               dividing fence, I could see bodies almost

               dead, others badly hurt...I turned and

               attempted to move wandering fans from the

               centre of the pitch, again coming up

               against anger and abuse.    I can remember

               seeing other police officers trying to

               rescusitate people who were dead... There

               were still bodies at the front.     I can

               remember seeing a young girl, approxi­

               mately 1 6 - 1 7 years, squashed against the

               fence, again, blue, her eyes open, vomit

               around her mouth and nose, she was still
                       clinging to the fence with her right haitd,

»                      her face turning a pale yellow colour,       a

                           again she was dead.   I tried again to   3

                           get through the gate, I was this time    ;£'

                           elbowed out of the way by a fan.   I dontt

                           know how long all this took to happen,

                           it seemed like a life time."

                   for off-duty personnel to report to Hammerton Road

                   Police Station, and arrangements were made for the

                   Casualty Bureau to be set up at Ecclesfield.           By 3*10pm

                                                                                      STATEMENT

                   ponse to immediate calls for assistance and saw that

                   the mood amongst the Nottingham Forest supporters was

                   hostile, and that they were making violent gestures

                   directed towards the Leppings Lane end.




    5.12.2         Together with Chief Superintendent Nesbit, a police                STATEMENT
                                                                                      61
                   cordon was then formed along the centre line of the

                   playing area, to separate the two factions, and to pre­

                   vent the immediate probability of spontaneous public
         disorder.    This, however, will be covered in more detail

         in subsequent sections, and it is relevant at this point

         to briefly summarise the immediate action taken by the

         police in respect of the dead and injured.



5.12.3   Initially, the casualties were placed on the perimeter

         track of the playing area, many being passed through a

         hole in the perimeter fencing which had been 'forced'

         by police officers.   Gradually, however, as spectators

         were moved from the rear of the terracing, it became

         easier to remove the casualties to the tunnel area, and

         also to the concourse within the entrance of the

         Leppings Lane turnstiles.



5-12.4   Evidence is forthcoming that many of the bodies were

         recovered in the vicinity of the crush barrier (Pen 3)

         and others in the adjacent pen (Pen 4).



j.12.5   With the exception of the initial 'crush' at the turn­

         stile, prior to the gates being opened, there is no

         evidence that death or serious injury occurred at any

         location, other than the two pens behind the Leppings

         Lane goal.



5-12.6   Police Constable Aitken recalls that at 3.02pm he            STATEMENT
                                                                      39
         looked at his watch and remarked to one of his collea­

         gues to the effect that "they should have kicked off by

         now."   Within a minute or so PC Aitken was directed to
the West Stand, he saw that this was clear, apart

from a few spectators making their way out.




Similarly, WPC 3107 Pearson also entered the terraces      STATEMENT
                                                           38
via the tunnel and noted that the tunnel "was empty at

this stage except for a couple of fans making their

way out."



Any reference, therefore, to casualties "in the tunnel"

would appear to arise solely as a consequence of the

dead and injured being moved to this location.




In this respect, it was felt that the statement of

Inspector Bullas (who was located at the West Stand) was   STATEMENT
                                                           48
slightly ambiguous and, subsequently, he was asked to

clarify the situation and has since submitted an adden­

dum to his original statement.   He now states, quite

clearly, that he is not aware of any casualties

receiving their injuries at this location.




Within a short space of time the injured were trans­

ported to hospital and the dead were removed to tempor­

ary mortuary facilities in the gymnasium at the Hills­

borough Stadium.




 Behaviour of Supporters and Actions of Ground Staff

 In the preceding paragraphs a number of references have
been made to the unruly behaviour of seme of the spec­

tators.     It is important, however, that a sense of

perspective should be maintained, as it would appear

that this behaviour was limited to a relatively small

minority of the total number of spectators in atten­

dance.     Indeed, PC 1543 Aitken makes the following      STATEMENT
                                                           39
observation:

     "Some fans were abusing officers, some

     called us murderers, and some were still

     complaining about Liverpool having the

     wrong end of the ground.      However, this

     abuse was taken by the officers, and the

     majority of Liverpool supporters were

     sympathetic towards us, and kept the angry

     element under control.      Several fans came

     and shook hands with me and thanked me,

     some said they were sorry for the behaviour

     of a small number of their friends."




Some stewards, whose duties include marshalling spec­

tators and manning entrances/exits, clearly felt

intimidated by some of the Liverpool supporters, as they

were seen replacing their stewards' tabards, which had

been removed.      This was witnessed by a number of

officers, including PC 2717 Savoury, who states:           STATEMENT
                                                           62
         "Stands searched for items left behind.

         Negative result.   During this time I

         noticed two stewards taking tabbards from
                  under coats and putting them on again.

                  I spoke to the Chief Steward, Mr. Basil

                  Jones, and told him what I had seen.     He

                  replied,    'What do you expect them to do

                     if they’re going to get thumped?” ’




^ 23    ^    It should be noted, however, that many spectators

             rapidly tore down hoardings once they realised the

             severity of the incident, in order to supply improvised

             stretchers for the transportation of the casualties.




5 .1 3 . 4   Nevertheless, there is strong evidence that elements of

             the crowd were abusive and unruly and that, as 3-00pm

             approached, the influence of alcohol was strongly evi­

             dent.     This is referred to in the statements of a number

             of officers, including Inspector D. Bullas, who entered       STATEMENT
                                                                           48
              the terraces via the West Stand tunnel and noted:

                     "...one of the first things that struck

                     me as I entered the tunnel - was the strong

                     smell of intoxicants.   I hadn't really

                     noticed this before with me being out in

                     the open - but on entering the confined

                     area of the tunnel, it was immediately

                     apparent. It was also apparent to me that

                     the people that were in front of me had

                     consumed intoxicants to varying degrees."




5 .1 3 . 5    Once the scale of the disaster was known, it was agreed
                      that the game should be postponed.   However, the

                      decision was taken by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield     STATEMENT
                                                                                 3
                      to withhold such information from the crowd in order to

                      prevent a mass exodus, which would have hampered the

                      rescue efforts and would have seriously impeded the

                      rescue services as they fought to rescue the injured and

                      remove the dead.




•
                      Immediate consultations took place between Chief Super­

    5 - 13- 6         intendent Duckenfield and the managers of the two teams

                      involved, Mr. Brian Clough and Mr. Kenneth Dalglish,

                      and the latter was asked by Chief Superintendent

                      Duckenfield to make an appeal over the tannoy system

                      for calm and tolerance amongst the Liverpool supporters.

                      This was done, and the effect appeared to be both

                      positive and immediate.



    ^ ^^ j            The rescue operation progressed and, by 4.00pm, only

                      one casualty awaited transportation to hospital, and the

                      stage had been reached where the crowd could be fully

                      informed of the situation.



    5.14        (n)   Communications

    5 !4    !         The Hillsborough Inquiry Report Part Vll relates to the

                      Police Communication System used during the FA Cup Semi­

                      final. This gives a detailed account of the arrangements

                      for the UHF and the VHF channels operating during that

                      day, 15 April 1989.   The radio reception area, use of
equipment and method of operation of those radios is dis

cussed.    Within that report reference is made to the

fact that, at about 2.20pm that day the Radio Operator

within the Ground Control Room notices that messages

from the Controller were clipped, the full text of the      STATEMENT
                                                            63
message was not being transmitted.    Messages passed via

personal radio were not effective.



The radio fault was rectified at 2.30pm when Communi­

cations staff changed the battery pack, a task which

necessitated there being no radio communication for 30

seconds.



This differs somewhat from the account given in state­

ments of officers who were engaged in various areas

around the football stadium.    Officers report inter­

ference on their radios and Superintendent Chapman, Sec­    STATEMENT

 stated that radio communication was poor and that

messages were broken.



 Chief Inspector Edmondson in the HQ Force Control states   STATEMENT

 that the radio was working correctly at 2.15pm but from

 that time, for the next 20 to 25 minutes, reception was

 poor, transmission was broken and there was a constant

 whistle, so much so that the Control Room monitor had to

 be turned down to enable all the monitors, VHF to be

 heard.

               assistance at Leppings Lane, but Ground Control did not

               acknowledge this transmission.   Superintendent Marshall

               changed channel from 25 to the Hammerton Road channel

               35, this is corroborated by the 'F' Division Incident

     5.14.9    Superintendent Murray was Ground Controller and recalls        STATEMENT
                                                                              5
that scaneone, possibly Mr. Marshall, was trying to con­

tact Ground Control, but the message was unreadable,

transmission was breaking up badly and difficult to

understand.   The Superintendent said:

     "We must have communication at least talk

     through.11



Suddenly, the radio started to function properly and

Ground Control had no further problems. There is no

indication as to what caused the transmission faults but

a Communications Officer did attend at the Ground Con­

trol Room and exchanged the W15U battery back-up pack

and this appears to have restored normal transmission.



The fault was rectified by 2.45pm in sufficient time to

enable Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and all other

officers engaged in the serious crowd disturbance at

Leppings Lane to communicate easily with clear, uninter­

rupted transmission through the remainder of the inci­

dent.



Traffic Movement

Traffic problems on the 15 April 1989 were almost

exclusively restricted to the Nottingham Forest suppor­

ters routes, the only exception being a build up of

traffic at about 1.00pm at the junction of the A616/A61

which was quickly alleviated.
5.15.2   At 1.30pm the officer in charge of the motorway patrols,

         Inspector Scholey, stated that motorways were quiet.      At   STATEMENT
                                                                        65
         2.20pm he relayed a further message to Force Control,

         informing them that all motorways were clear.



         At 2.11pm reports to Force Control from traffic per­           APPENDIX
5-15.3                                                                  63
         sonnel indicate that there was congestion on Attercliffe

         Road, this most probably would be attributed to

         Nottingham Forest supporters.   The traffic in and around

         Sheffield was moving freely.



^    4   At 2.21pm there was a report of a solid line of traffic

         at Hillfoot Bridge on Neepsend Lane approaching the

         ground.   This congestion once again was from the

         Nottingham side of the city.    There were no recorded

         messages of any congestion on roads leading from the

         direction of Liverpool.



          Superintendent Brougham states that despite vehicular
5-15-5                                                                  STATEMENT
          traffic arriving in the vicinity of the ground from           66

          all directions, there was sufficient time for both

          Liverpool and Nottingham Forest supporters to get to the

          ground before kick-off.   At 2.40pm the Superintendent

          informed Force Control that all main roads were now

          clear.



5.15.6    All modes of transport appeared to have arrived at the

          Hillsborough Football Ground without hindrance and well
                 before the kick-off.   Any suggestion that traffic delays

                 may have caused Liverpool supporters to arrive late at

                 the ground would appear to be without foundation.


5.16       (p)   Turnstiles at Leppings Lane

5 - 16.1         This must be regarded as a key issue when considering

                 the question of why the crowd of Liverpool supporters

                 failed to gain admittance into the Hillsborough Football

                 Ground in a rapid, orderly manner.    There are two

                 matters which could possibly be pertinent to this issue:



5.16.2           (Q ) Tickets to both the Liverpool and Nottingham

                      football supporters were colour coded to enable          APPENDIX
                                                                               50
                      the recipient to be aware of which section of

                      ground he was to proceed to in order to gain entry.

                      Brown tickets denoted entry into the North Stand

                      via turnstiles 1-10.     The red tickets allowed entry

                      into the West Stand at turnstiles 11-16, and

                      supporters with purple tickets were able to enter

                      the West Stand terraces at turnstiles A-G. A

                      sketch plan shows the     flow of the direction   fans   APPENDIX
                                                                               64
                      would have to take as     they entered via the

                      Leppings Lane turnstiles.     One can quickly envisage

                      the major confusion that could and in fact did

                      develop outside those turnstiles as fans queued for

                      some considerable time, only to arrive at the turn­

                      stile to be told they     were in the wrong queue,and

                      then having to return     back to Leppings Lane   in
order to jo in the correct queue.



There are numerous accounts from police officers of

the confusion that ensued outside the turnstiles,

when spectators were refused admittance due to them

being in possession of the wrong colour coded

ticket for that particular turnstile.   Chief

Inspector Creaser states:                              STATEMENT
                                                       67
     "The signs above the turnstiles were

     not clear and many fans were concerned

     and confused.    It was necessary for

     police officers to give constant

     advice and assistance as fans

     endeavoured to gain entry into the

     ground."




This problem is exacerbated by a lack of adequate

signs and notices informing the approaching

Liverpool supporters of which queue to form for

their particular colour coded ticket.




The only colour code direction indicators were

boards measuring 18" x 18" mounted on the turnstile    APPENDIX
                                                       67
walls approximately 5' 6" from the ground to the       (PHOTOGRAPH
                                                       13)
base of the notice.    As the crowd of people formed

up in front of turnstiles it would have been almost

 impossible to see those colour direction boards.
5.16.6    (b)   When one considers the question of late arrivals

                and the large crowd which formed at the Leppings

                Lane turnstiles one must take into account the

                ground capacity and the turnstile allocation

                available to accommodate the influx of spectators.

                The turnstile allocation for Nottingham football

                supporters is 62 turnstiles, which are set at

                intervals along the South Stand and the Penistone

                Road area of the ground, a total of 62 turnstiles

                covering an area of 50 per cent of the ground

                perimeter.   This is to enable a total of 29,844

                persons to pass through the turnstiles.   The Liver­

                pool supporters, however, were allocated only 23

                turnstiles within the restricted area of Leppings

                Lane, this has been referred to as a funnel or

                bottleneck leading directly into those turnstiles

                and this area was allocated to accommodate the

                admission of all of the 24,270 Liverpool suppor­

                ters .




                The Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds, paragraph       APPENDIX
 5-16.7
                                                                       29
                4 7 , states that the maximum notional rate at which

                spectators will pass through turnstiles is unlikely

                to exceed 750 persons per hour.   It is therefore

                possible to calculate how many spectators can be

                accommodated in the final hour running up to the

                start of the game.
5.16.8              So far as the Nottingham supporters are concerned,

                    by use of the maximum notional ratio, 62 turnstiles

                    would have easily accommodated the 29,844 fans in

                    the last hour before kick-off.   When this same

                    equation is compared to the Liverpool allocation,

                    the number of turnstiles being 23, the 24,270

                    Liverpool supporters could not have been accommo­

                    dated in the last hour.




5.16.9              This is exactly what occurred on the 15 April 1989

                    and must be regarded as a contributory factor as a

                    major crowd disorder problem developed outside

                     those turnstiles.

5.17-1
                Hillsborough on the 15 April 1989, arrangements were

                made for Scenes of Crime officers to be present at the

                stadium, together with members of the Underwater Search

                Unit, who were identified as an evidence gathering team

                in possession of both video and still cameras.




^ J7 2          Owing to their presence, a large number of photographs

                were taken pre-match and subsequently following the

                events in the Leppings Lane terrace.   A total of 22      AVAILABLE

                albums of photographs resulted and these contain a

                variety of views both inside and outside the stadium,

                covering a time scale of 12.24pm to 16.02pm.     Each
         photograph is timed automatically. However, due to a

         lack of overall synchronisation of watches, the time

         scales are generally out for a period ranging from 30

5-17-4   Examination of the 22 albums reveal certain aspects

         which may be of assistance in determining crowd build-up

         and events on the terraces.        To this end, two composite

         albums have been prepared from the total photographs             APPENDICES

         available, the first containing 28 photographs depicting

         the build-up outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles.         The

         second album contains 18 photographs and depict the

         scene on the Leppings Lane terraces, particularly pens

         3 and 4 respectively, known as South Centre and North

         Centre pens.      It should be noted that in no way do

         these albums provide a definitive picture of what took

         place but merely give some indication of the activity

         and problems being addressed.

             the album covers the period from 2 .0 8pm to 2 .5 9 pm,

             taking into account the real times this period is

             2.07pm to 2.58pm.       The first photograph shows Inspector

             Hand-Davis, the officer in charge of the Mounted congin-

             gent and other Mounted officers escorting the special

             train supporters to the ground.       The crowd is orderly

             and well contained.       Photographs 2-12 are a continuation

             of this, showing the general pictures in Leppings Lane

             and indicating that supporters are being contained

             against the wall in an orderly queue and without diffi­

             culty.    Photograph 13 displays the crowd outside turn­

             stiles A-G and the time is now shown as 2.31 (2.30 in

             real time) once again the crowd is orderly and well

              contained.



^   5 17 6   Photographs 14 and 15 show similar views, photograph 16

              timed at 2 . 3 5   (2.34 real time) shows that the crowd has

              grown somewhat and has over-spilled the barrier but is

              being contained.



    5.17.7   Photograph    17 shows a view from the South service road

              to C Gate and displays a mass of people in the Leppings

              Lane area.




    5-17.8    Photographs 18 and 19 show similar views and the fact
that whilst some of the crowd has spilled into this area

between turnstiles A and G and the South access road,

the situation in that immediate vicinity is fairly well

controlled.




Photograph      19 shows a build-up in that area and a move­

ment towards Gate C which appears to be closed.         Despite

this, a Mounted man on photograph       20 is moving towards

the gate and on photographs 21 and 22 appears about to

enter.    On photograph    22 there is an indication that the

gate has been pulled back and a large number of fans

are following and appear to be entering in an orderly

fashion through Gate C.




Photograph      24 shows that the effects of this appear to

have thinned the crowd but on photograph        25 the time now

being 2 . 5 6   (real time 2 .5 5 ) they are being followed by a

larger number of supporters who appear to have come

through the outer perimeter gate but who are once again

being controlled by Mounted men.        At this time the Gate

C is wide open and the crowd is passing through in

large numbers but there is nothing to suggest that they

are other than orderly.       Photograph   27 shows a large

number of people heading towards Gate       C in an orderly

fashion and officers do not appear to be distressed.

Photograph      28 shows the barriers adjacent to Gate C with

officers relatively relaxed and no sign of large crowds.

The time is now shown as       2.59 (2.58 real time).

                                                                                66
               As indicated, this album relates to a series of photo­

               graphs commencing at 2.45 (2.46 real time) and goes

                through to 3 . 0 7   (3 . 0 6 real time) photographs are all

                concerning the centre pens and the first picture shows

                Gate 4 to the pens and shows that the rear gate is

                fastened back against the wall and open.




5.17.12        Photograph 2 significantly shows the tunnel and particu­

                larly identifies a number of people who are in situ at

                the time (2.45 - 2.46 real time).        In particular there

                is a young man in a green anorak immediately in the

                centre of the tunnel and a child sitting on the wall to

                the left of the tunnel in a blue anorak with a young

                man behind him in a white shirt.        More particularly the

                packing of the pen appears to be fairly loose, particu­

                larly at the front of the pen where at least one indi-

                vidual has his arms stretched against the mesh and does

                not appear to be under any pressure.         Photograph 3 re­

                confirms the people in situ around the tunnel and again

                indicates the relative space at the front of the pens.

                Whilst the crowd is fairly heavy it is clear that the

                packing is not excessive and there are no apparent signs

                of distress.     Photograph 4 shows the time at 1459 (real

                time 1500) and shows Sergeant Swift going to Gate 4 of

                the pen, there is some movement onto the pitch which

                indicates that between those 14 minutes there has been
some change.      Photograph 5 shows much the same situation

and is timed at 1 5 00 ( 1 5 0 1 real time).




Photograph 6 timed 1501 (1502 real time) shows the same

people in situ at the entrance to the tunnel.




Photographs 7 and 8 show an over-view of the South

Centre pen and whilst there is some indication of

crowding at the front of the pen, it does not appear

that there are difficulties, the crowd appear to be

watching the game and responding accordingly.




Photograph 9 is much the same but there are clearly

signs of anxiety and photograph 10 shows the gate being

opened,      it is now 1503 (real time 1 5 0 2 ).




Photograph 11 shows clear problems at the entrance to

the pen with people being forced against the fencing.

Photograph 12 repeats that but extends the view to the

tunnel and it is interesting to note that the same

 individuals mentioned before are in situ in that

 location.     Photographs 13, l1* and 15 show similar views.

The time is now 1506 (1505 real time).          Photographs 16,

 17 and 18 continue on the same theme and show those

 individuals at the tunnel mouth still in position with

 the time being shown as 1507 (1506 real time).

5.18         (r ) Observations

5.18.1           It is not felt appropriate in this submission to draw

                 any definitive conclusions or to attempt to identify the

                 cause of the tragedy from the (necessarily) limited

                 amount of information available to the Force.     Rather,

                 the Chief Constable is content to make a number of

                 observations which he feels may be pertinent to the

                 Committee of Enquiry:-




5 .1 8 .2               Every conceivable care and effort was taken

                        at the pre-planning stage to provide a

                        sufficiency of police resources to deal

                        with the normal (or anticipated) oper­

                        ational problems associated with a major

                        sporting event.




5 .I8 . 3         (k)   Such arrangements have been implemented

                        on many previous occasions and have been

                        found to be entirely satisfactory.   Indeed,

                        the 1988 semi-final involved the same

                        teams and the event passed without inci­

                        dent, as evidenced by the statement of

                        Inspector R. Walker, who was present at              STATEMENT-
                                                                             68
                        that location.




5 .1 8 . 4        (c)   The manner in which sections of the stadium

                        were segregated between visiting suppor­

                         ters was based not only on historical
               precedence, but primarily in order to pro­

               tect law abiding spectators and local

               residents (in accordance with the recommen­

               dations of the Popplewell Enquiry) in this

               highly urbanised and environmentally con­

               gested area by minimising the opportunity

               for conflict and violence between the

               minority of opposing spectators who regard

               such actions as being normal and acceptable,




5.18.5   (d)   Saturday   15 April 1989 was a warm and

               sunny Spring d a y , which should have pro­

               vided the perfect atmosphere for a major

               sporting attraction.    Instead, however,

               it would appear that many visiting spec­

               tators used this as an opportunity to

               find local public houses and off licences

               where they could purchase and consume

               alcohol, to the extent that in so doing

               their arrival at the stadium was seriously

               delayed.




^    g   (e)   The situation was exacerbated by the

               obvious influx of a large number of Liver­

               pool supporters who did not have a ticket

               to gain admission, and whose presence

               seriously aggravated the worsening situa­

               tion at the Leppings Lane turnstiles as
                  the time approached for the game to

                  commence.




5.18.7      (f)   Despite substantial police resources which

                  had been allocated for the event, senior

                  officers found themselves suddenly and

                  unexpectedly overwhelmed by several

                  thousand spectators who had converged on

                  the Leppings Lane entrance within a few

                  minutes of the designated time for kick-

                  off, many of whom being the worse for

                  drink embarked upon a determined course

                  of action, the aim of which was to enter

                  Hillsborough Football Stadium at all cost;

                  irrespective of any danger to property or,

                  more importantly, the lives and safety of

                  others.




5 .I8 . 8   (g)   Faced with the immediate danger which had

                  arisen, senior police commanders had to

                  make an instant operational decision to

                  protect those involved from death or

                  serious injury.
5.18.9   (h)   The senior officers in command did not

               shed their responsibility; but rather

               embarked on a course of action which

               they knew presented certain risks.       Chief

               Superintendent Duckenfield took account

               of all the information which was then

               available and decided that -

                      (i)    if the gates were not opened

                            then casualties WOULD occur;

                     (ii)    if the gates were opened

                             casualties MAY occur.

               Based on this reasoning, the decision was

               taken to open the gates, and in so doing,

               the immediate danger to the life and

               safety of those at risk was relieved.

               Many police officers have indicated in

               their statements their total support for

               the initial decision by senior police

               commanders to open the gates.     Typically,

               PS   1757 Burns, a serial supervisor, states     STATEMENT

               in his concluding paragraph that "being

               on duty in the inside of Leppings Lane,

               seeing and hearing the mass of the crowd

               outside, I agree in full with the actions

               taken by Superintendent Marshall.        I saw

               the state and pleading of spectators

               entering the ground.     I am certain if

               these gates had not been opened, many
would have died outside the t u r n s t il e s .

I myself became very apprehensive for my

safety shortly after 2.45pm.         Despite the

fact that additional resources were

deployed to try to contain that situation,

the best efforts of those officers were

not successful.




Police officers were later suddenly faced

with a situation, the true nature of

which did not become fully apparent until

tragically the bodies of the deceased

were recovered from the West Stand

terrace.    Accounts provided by officers

nearest to the scene indicate that the

crush may have occurred as a consequence

of lines of spectators swaying backwards

and forwards.      It is a fact that by 3-05pm

the spectator 'pens* on the West Stand

terraces were apparently filled to capacity

However, a number of officers at the scene

refer to the fact that on their arrival,

despite the crushing at the front of the

 'pens', spectators only a few yards away

towards the rear were totally unaware of

what was taking place, and were engrossed

 in the spectacle on the field, whilst the

 tragedy unfolded within a few yards from
                     where they were stood.   One officer (PC

                     Pearson) considers that the first body       STATEMENT
                                                                  38
                     which was recovered had been dead for

                     some considerable time, whilst another

                     officer (PC Smith), who was nearer the       STATEMENT
                                                                  49
                     scene of the tragedy than any other

                     officer, can draw no association between

                     the crush at the front and any "great




•
                     influx" of spectators into the 'pens'.




    5.18.11   (j) Once it became evidence that serious

                     injuries had occurred, police officers

                     acted totally selflessly in their efforts

                     to help and rescusitate victims, in

                     conditions of congestion, threats, abuse,

                     and in some cases, physical violence.




    5.18.12   (k) The help    and assistance provided by many

                     spectators is worthy of the highest praise

                     and should be a matter of public record.

                     Once the full extent of the tragedy be­

                     came clear, a sense of grief descended

                     upon the stadium and spectators rapidly

                     provided improvised stretchers for those

                     who were dead and injured.




    5 18 13   (1 )   Regretably, however, it must also be a

                     matter of public record that within the
                crowd during that fateful afternoon was

                an unruly element of individuals, whose

                actions were clearly influenced by alco­

                hol.    Such was the degree of intimidation

                that there was evidence that certain

                stewards discarded their identification

                at the crucial time, thus negating their

                presence in any official role, and any

                capacity to steward or direct the large

                number of spectators.




5.18.14   (m)   The decision not to inform the crowd of

                the true nature of the occurrence was

                taken by the Commander in charge of the

                stadium, in order to ensure that the

                immediate area outside the stadium re­

                mained relatively free from congestion

                to allow those who were injured to be

                transported as quickly as possible to

                hospital.




          (n)   Despite the scale of the tragedy, resources
5.18.15
                were quickly organised, temporary mortuary

                facilities and a Casualty Bureau were set

                up     and,in a little over an hour all the

                casualties had been transported from the

                scene.
The South Yorkshire Police has been deeply involved with

the tragic events which occurred on Saturday 15 April

1989.   Police officers and civilian personnel involved

in the operation have been deeply grieved by the death

and suffering which they witnessed on an occasion which

should have been an enjoyable sporting event.   Many have

had to seek professional counselling.




This has been further exacerbated by many reports in the

media which have wrongly communicated the role played by

the South Yorkshire Police.   It is hoped, therefore,

that this submission may rectify this imbalance.




For those most directly involved, memories and a deep

sense of sorrow will remain with them for the rest of

their lives, particularly those officers who tried so

desperately to save the lives of men, women and

children.




The Force extends it sincere condolences to the rela­

 tives and loved ones of those who died.

+         EMERGENCY PROCEDURES IN THE IMMEDIATE

          AFTERMATH OF THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER




          EMERGENCY CONTINGENCY PLANS AND THEIR IMPLEMENTATIONS



6.1.     Following the tragic events which took place at around 3 00pm on

          Saturday 15 April 1989, at the Hillsborough Stadium, emergency

         procedures aimed at dealing with the aftermath of the disaster were

         brought into effect.



6.2.     In the event of any major disaster in their area South Yorkshire Police

         have contingency plans contained in the Major Incident Mannual aimed       APPENDIX

         at dealing with all aspects of the results of the disaster being faced.    67



6 .3 .   In definition the major incident plan identifies a "major incident" as



                  "a serious disruption of life, arising with little

                  or no warning, causing or threatening death or

                  injury to numbers of people in excess of those that can be

                  dealt with by the Public Services operating under normal

                  conditions, and which require special mobilization and

                  organization of those services."



6 .4 .   The plan further outlines the objectives and states



                  "it is impossible to cater for every contingency which might

                  arise in a major incident situation.   The major incident plan,
         therefore, contains a basic format     on which all major

         incidents should be based.     Whilst setting out basic

         principles and responsibilities to be adhered to, it also

         allows for flexibility and initiative in the prevailing

         circumstances".



The plan details full descriptions of action to be taken but

specifically outlines police duties and responsibilities as follows :



1.       Prevent further danger.

2.       Mobilize emergency services.

3-       Command of incident.

4.       Site control and security.

5.       Off-site control.

6.       Communications.

7.       Casualities.

8.       Logistics.

9.       Investigation.

10.      Reports.




In the case of the Hillsborough Disaster each of those duties and

responsibilities were addressed and action taken.



Due to the fact that the disaster took place at an event which was

already being policed, many of the resources and facilities required

under the Major Incident Plan were already in being.    Examples of thi

refer to manpower, first aid facilities, police control point and

communications.   To this end the police response was enhanced and was
clearly able to take efficient and effective control of the situation.




Despite this the nature of the events which took place created

considerable difficulties as a consequence of the attitude of

supporters, many of whom were suffering from the effects of drink.



There was confrontation with the police and with the rival supporters

and a tendency made to lay blame in one direction or another.     These

actions clearly hindered police operations in the early stages.



Each of the ten areas of duty and responsibility outlined in the plan

have been addressed separately and the police response was as follows:
PREVENT FURTHER DANGER



In dealing with any major disaster one of the first priorities of the

police is to prevent further danger to the public.   So far as the

Hillsborough disaster was concerned there were a number of areas where

danger might occur due to the fact that there was a concentration of

some 5^,000 people at the event, the event was taking place in the mid-

afternoon of a busy Saturday and in close proximity to the centre of

the City of Sheffield.   Bearing these facts in mind it was clear that

in the first instance the actual area of the disaster had to be

contained and rescue operations put into effect and interference from

other areas of the Stadium likely to hinder those rescue attempts had

also to be dealt with.   Further to this the problem extended beyond the

Stadium, firstly into the immediate vicinity of the Hillsborough Ground

and secondly into the city centre and surrounding areas where at some

stage the supporters would be disgorging to.   A further consideration

was the security of bodies and property which were subsequently located

in the temporary mortuary facilities at the Gymnasium.



It is clear that all the factors were in the minds of the Senior

Officers in charge of the event and the actions and decision making

processes which followed the actual disaster reflected these

considerations.



The first indication of problems on the Leppings Lane terraces was fans

climbing the perimeter track fencing.   As a result, Chief Supt

Duckenfield sent Supt Greenwood to that area to appraise the situation.
 Supt Greenwood attended in the area of Gate 3, realised that there were

 problems and after being unable to contact Ground Control via radio,

 waved his arras indicating for officers in the Control Box to stop play.

 Chief Supt Duckenfield agreed and sent Supt Murray to the pitch to          STATEMENT
                                                                             5'
 contact the linesman.    Mr Murray attempted to speak with the linesman

 but was unsuccessful, the linesman being engrossed in his duties and

 ran away following play.    At this point, Supt Greenwood ran onto the

 pitch, spoke with the referee    and stopped the game at 1506.



Whilst these attempts were being made,     Ground Control contacted Force

Operations Room at (1504) for dog handlers to attend the Stadium for

possible deployment.     Simultaneous actions then followed which can best

be described using the officer concerned as reference.

On returning   to the Leppings Lane end of the ground, Supt Greenwood        STATEMENT
                                                                             6
found rescue attempts were being hindered by the press and an officer

was deputed to clear them away.    Mr Greenwood was then joined by Chief

Supt Nesbit who took command of the situation on the pitch. .Supt

Greenwood obtained a loud hailer ana used this to ask the Liverpool

supporters to remain calm and co-operative.     He also used the loud

hailer to give instructions to police officers involved in the rescue

operation.



SUPERINTENDENT MURRAY

Following his return to the Police Control Box, Supt Murray heard            STATEMENT
                                                                             5
Police Constable Ryan addressing the crowd via the ground public

address system asking for calm and for supporters to leave the pitch.

Mr Murray again returned to the pitch and requested use of the public
        address system to ask Leppings Lane spectators to move back.    He then

        deployed a Serial to the South Stand perimeter track and, following

        liaison with Supt Chapman regarding the Spion Kop track and Insp

        Wallace regarding North Stand track supervision he returned to the

        Police' Control Box.



6.18.   At approximately 15^5, Mr Dalgleish, Manager of Liverpool Football    Club

        went to the Control Box and appealed over the public address system for

        calm.   A request was received from Chief Supt Nesbit to deploy dogs on      STATEMENT

        Mr Jackson at 1510.    A request for a fleet of ambulances was relayed to

        Force Operations (1508).   This was followed by Mr Duckenfield giving

        instructions for the implementation of the Major Incident Plan and for

        Police Constable Ryan to continue to broadcast via the public address

        system requesting calm and for fans to leave the pitch.

                                                                                     3
        officials and the Football Association and informed them of his

        deicision not to tell supporters of the extent of the incident or

        attempt to evacuate the ground as he felt such actions would hinder

        removal of casualties as well as create further public disorder.

6.21.    At the instruction of Chief Supt Nesbit, a further cordon was placed       STATEMENT
                                                                                    61
         across the full length of the halfway line to isolate the Liverpool

         supporters who were already on the pitch.



6.22.    A number of officers successfully ripped away a section of the Leppings

         Lane perimeter track fencing to speed up the method of egress from the

         terraces whilst others assisted fans through the gates and over the top



•
         of the fencing.

         being used as a temporary mortuary and casualty collection point.

                                                                                    74
         to move supporters back and thereby relieve the pressure on those at

         the front.   Once casualties/fatalities had been dealt with the decision

         was made at 1610 to release the supporters from the Stadium and

         officers and supervisors were deployed outside the ground to ensure

         supporters left safely into Penistone Road.



6.25.   Prior to that at (1607) arrangements were made for ’F I ’ Sub-Division

         officers to cover the A61 so far as Liverpool supporters were

         concerned.   Simultaneously, mobile serials were deployed to deal with

         any reports of public disorder and indeed reports were subsequently

        received at several locations, including Wadsley Lane, Parkside Road,

        Bassetts Public House Cowper Avenue and Penistone Road.

         public houses to be closed and this was implemented.   This action was

         taken in an effort to encourage supporters not to remain in the City

         and to reduce the possibility of disorder through drunkneness.



6.28.    During the course of the remainder of the evening following the

         clearance of the public from the Stadium security was maintained.     At

        2005 containment was placed on the gymnasium area of the Stadium which

        operated throughout the night as a temporary mortuary and

        identification centre for relatives.   These proceedings finished at

        0530    the following morning, once the bodies and property of the

        deceased had been removed and there was no further likelihood of danger

        to any individual in and around the Stadium.   Despite this a police

        presence was maintained for the purpose of preservation of evidence.



6.29    Throughout no further danger was caused to members of the public and

        despite difficult circumstances rescue operations were able to take

        place effectively and the crowds dispersed from the area.
MOBILIZE EMERGENCY SERVICES




During the planning stages arrangements were made with the Ambulance

Service for Liaison Officers to be available at the Stadium throughout

the operation.   In the event two Ambulance Service Liaison Officers

were present at the ground and were accompanied by one ambulance with

crew.   This ambulance was located at Gate 0 and was insitu by 2 10 pm.

In addition a second ambulance and crew dedicated to the semi-final

were on stand-by at Middlewood Road Ambulance Station.



Through the Club arrangements had been made for the service of St Johns

Ambulance Brigade to be available on the day and they had an ambulance

on stand-by at the rear of the North Stand adjacent to the First Aid

Room.   St Johns Ambulance personnel were on duty around the ground and

also operating from their room situate at the rear of the North Stand.

A total of 36 St Johns Ambulancemen were available at the Stadium.



In normal circumstances these facilities would be adequate for any

situation which might arise.



Whilst liaison had been maintained with the Fire Service and they were

fully aware of the events, including possible congestion in the area,

they did not have the facility of a Liaison Officer at the ground, but

felt that their ability to respond to situations from normal Fire

Stations was adequate .



Following the stopping of the game by Superintendent Greenwood, members

of the St Johns Ambulance responded to the Leppings Lane perimeter
          track and rendered first aid.     In terras of alerting emergency services

          the following action took place :-



g 25      At 15   07   the Ambulance Service was told of the incident by Force

          Operations Room as an advance warning.     Officers on the pitch including

          Supt Murray and Chief Inspector Sumner requested ambulances to be            STATEMENTS

          directed to the Leppings Lane Terraces and this was relayed via Force

          Operations Romm to, Supt Clark of the Ambulance Service.    The time that

          this message was passed was 15 08.



^ 36 .    At 15   10 the Ambulance Service confirmed their response and this was

          further confirmed one minute later at 15 11.



g 27      At 15 12 Ground Control requested the closure of Leppings Lane to all

          but emergency services and this was achieved at 15 19.     This course of

          action was made in an effort to ensure free movement of emergency

          traffic to and from the Stadium.



6 .38 .   Following identification of the difficulties in recovering bodies and

          injured persons from the terraces at 15 13 Ground Control requested the

          attendance of the Fire Service with hydraulic cutting equipment, with a

          view to removing the 'fences.   The Fire Service arrived at 15 23-     In

          addition to this 2 traffic mobiles also responded with the "jaws"

          cutting equipment and arrived at 15 16.



6 .39 .   In an effort to facilitate free movement of emergency vehicles Police

          motor cyclists were put on stand-by at Claywheels Lane Traffic Office

          at 15 17.
 Following requests from Chief Inspector Sumner the Royal Hallarashire

Hospital and the Northern General Hospitals were alerted as to the

problems in hand, this communication being transmitted at 15 19.



By 15 20 three ambulances were present at the Stadium and Police

Control contacted Operations Room to     confirm that more    were on route.

Twenty additional ambulances were suggested.



At the same time the Ambulance Service contacted Rotherham District

General Hospital and Barnsley District General Hospital and informed

them of the incident in the event of further facilities being required.



At 15 24 an ambulance and a motor cycle escort was brought to Gate 0 of

the ground and confirmation was made that motor cyclists of the

Sheffield Wing of the Force were covering routes to the Royal

Hallamshire Hospital to ensure free passage.    Other motor cyclists from

other Divisions of the Force area were covering the routes between the

ground and the Northern General Hospital.    At this same time Ground

Control requested a further ambulance to be directed to Leppings Lane

in view of the fact that some of the bodies of the deceased had been

removed from the terraces and taken to that location.    Injured persons

were also in that locality.



At 15 31 Ground Control requested Operations Room to contact the

Ambulance Service Senior Officer and arrange for his attendance at

Police Control.   In response to these   requests the Chief Ambulance

Officer Mr Don Page and his Deputy Mr    Alan Hopkins both   attended atthe
Despite the attendance of Ambulance Service and the presence of the

St Johns Ambulance Brigade it was quite clear that facilities of other

medical staff in the form of doctors were required at the scene.



At 15 33 broadcasts were made on Radio Hallam and Radio Sheffield

requesting doctors to attend at the ground, this was linked with a

request for off-duty police officers to report immediately at Hammerton

Road Police Station.



At 15 53 Police Force Operations Room were requested to arrange for a

medical team and drugs to attend the Gymnasium.   At 1555 the Ambulance

Service responded with One Team at the scene, two others en route, one

from the Barnsley District General Hospital and the other from the

Royal Hallamshire Hospital.



At 16 26 Ambulance Control were informed that no further ambulances

were required.



During the course of the operation medical attention was given to 140

persons who were dealt with at Hospital and the 95 deceased persons.



Whilst there was clearly some confusion in the early stages due in the

main to the attitude of supporters, it is clear that medical assistance

was on hand and was quickly supplemented by the Ambulance Service.



The role of the Fire Brigade was less than that of the Police and

Ambulance Service.   However, they responded promptly and were quickly

at the scene once requested.
COMMAND OF INCIDENT




The Major Incident Mannual provides for the setting up of a Police

Incident Post under the control of the Site Commander.    As indicated

because of the nature of this event and the presence of the police an

Incident Post was already in being in the form of the Police Control

Room at Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground.   In addition to running

the Operation this Control Room took on the role of the Police Incident

Post.and co-ordinated police response to the emergency.   In the initial

stages this control was under the command of Chief Supt Duckenfield,

who directed operations for the containment, rescue and general

recovery of the situation.   Chief Supt Duckenfield continued with this

role until 5 15 pm when he was required to attend at Force Headquarters

and the continuation of the role was undertaken by Chief Supt Mole.      By

this time all emergency procedures had been implemented and were in the

course of being concluded.
  SITE CONTROL AND SECURITY




  Following the requests through the media and Force Operations Room,

  medical staff and additional Police Officers were initially requested

  to attend at the Police Room adjacent to the Gymnasium at the Stadium.

  Whilst this procedure was arranged in the event doctors and medical

  staff who attended in fact made their way into the Stadium and rendered

  what assistance they could directly to those requiring it.       To this end

  the control was somewhat fragmented but was brought about by the

_,.dii iicuit circumstances being experienced concerning the attitude of

 supporters and the need to clear the Stadium to ensure free passage of

 emergency vehicles.      However it was noted at an early stase that tha

 additional police officers attending should be re-directed from the

 ground to avoid c o m us ion and in T s. cz they were asked to rsrdevcus   sl*~


 Hammerton Road Police Station, where the Reception Officer, Chief Insp

 McRobbie was appointed to receive and subsequently deploy them.                   STATEMENT
                                                                                   55



 Following the vacating of the Stadium Supt Murray organized Offic^^s t^

coniaxn the area and tape- 011 the relevant sections where the disaster             STATEMENT

had occurred.   A twenty-four hour police presence was maintained to

ensure that the sits was not tampered with.



So far as security of property was concerned all items of found

property were uoKen to the Gymnasium where thev were records''’ *ov

Police Constables Newbould and Pears .                                             STATEMENT

Property taken from deceased persons were recorded separately,      remained


with the body and were subsequently handed to relatives following the'

opening of the inquest.
  OFF-SITE CONTROL




  Once again the nature of this event has some bearing on this asoect of

  the major incident raannual, in that we were already in command of the

  locality m    and around the Stadium.   Whilst a number of officers had

  been drawn in to provide emergency assistance to the injured, a number

 of officers were still in the vicinity outside the Stadium and were

 able to ensure that routes to and from the Stadium were passable . To

 assist in this the Ground Commander, Chief Supt Duckenfield took the

 decision not to oificially abandon the match for some time, bearing in

 mind the difficulties that would be encountered with a large number of

 supporuers being in and around the Stadium and the congestion in the

 locality.     In fact the abandonment wasn't announced until 16 10. By

 which time much of the initial action had been taken.



 So far as emergency access of vehicles to the Stadium is concerned the

plan involves the use of Gate 0 in Penistone Road and this was utilised

on this occasion and maintained free from other vehicles by officers

deployed to that specific duty..;v




During the course of events it was realised that a number of casualties

were being removed from the terraces towards the West Stand enclosures

and in fact a number of deceased persons were taken to that locality

for transportation to temporary mortuary facilities.     To this end

ambulances were also directed to that location for reception purposes.



Throughout, routes and escort duties were monitored and undertaken by

motor cyclists of the South Yorkshire Police Motor Cycle Wing.
 COMMUNICATIONS



 In addition to the communication already in being at the ground, the

 following were taken into use :



         Loud nailers were used to issue instructions to officers

         at the Leppings Lane end of the Stadium, to make appeals to

         the crowd for calm and co-operation and to also inform the

         crowd that an incident had occurred as many were apparently

         unaware of the fact.



2.      Road Traffic mobiles were utilized in the initial stages as

         Communications vehicles utilizing VHF channels.   Three such

         vehicles were in position at the ground at 1515, 1519 and

         1521 hours respectively.



3-      At 1557 Police Sergeant Butler, Communications Department

        attended the Force Training Centre to set up extra

        communications for the Casualty Bureau.



        A communications vehicle was directed to the Casualty Bureau

        as an additional resource (1659)



        At 1706 the Northern General Hospital was supplied with an

        ex-directory 'police line'.



        At 1/3/ direct radio links to the Casualty Bureau were set up

        at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Northern General Hospital,

    •     7.     Direct telephone lines linked to the Casualty Bureau were

                 installed at the Northern General Hospital and Royal

                 Hallamshire Hospital at 175o.



          8.    At 1756 additional telephone lines were installed in the

                Cas ualty Bureau.




                Celinet telephones were made available at Headquarters and

                issued to the mortuary (2 ), Royal Hallamshire Hospital (2 )

           CASUALTIES



6.62.     The Major Incident Mannual provides a number of sections which deal witr
                                                                                       the

         c)    ,-Make provisions for a temporary moT'tua—



         d)     Identification and notifying next of kin.
  V>l




         So far as the first aspect is concerned, that is the rescue and care of

         individuals, this was immediately taken up by Police Officers, St Johns

         Amouiance Officers and a large cross section of members of the community wh
                                                                                       o

        were attending as supporters.    Whilst it has been said that difficulties

        were encountered by some supporters who were truculent, under the influence

        of drink and aggressive, it must be said that a large number were extremely

        helpful and displayed courage in attempting to rescue individuals who were

        trapped on the terraces'.   There is no doubt that had it not been for the

        prompt actions of police officers and the civilians alike there may well

        have ceen more difficulties in the terraces.   These actions are adequately

        aepictea on photographs taken of the rescue operation and in the accounts of

        police officers who were directly involved in the rescue procedures.
       4«       So far as the Casualty Bureau is concerned this was activated

                by the call out of Supt Torr through Force Operations at 1521.   By 1623

                the Casualty Bureau had been established at Ecclesfield Police Training

                School and Hospital Liaison Officers were in position at the Northern

                immediately brought into effect utilising the provisions of the gymnasium a

             the scene in charge of the Criminal Investigation Department, took command       STATEMENT
                                                                                              11
             oi this aspect and established the temporary mortuary' facilities, pending

             the arrival of Det Chief Supt Addis, who oversaw the continuance of events.

             ior tue reception ana storage of bodies.    The second section for the

            location of police oificers and the thira section to subsequently be used

            for identification purposes and receotion of relatives and friends

            ,
0   .67.    i^le identification and notifying of next o f kin was undertaken under the

            direction of Det Cnief'Supt Addis, who remained at the temoorarv mortuary

            Relatives and friends were directed to Hammerton Road Police Station and

            because of the large numbers involved the facilities of the Hillsborough

            Boys Club adjacent to the Station were utilised for the receotion of

            families.    The centre was under the direction of Supt Sleath, who dealt with

            the welfare aspects of relatives and friends and subsequently made

            arrangements for them to be transported to the Stadium for identification
 purposes.




 In dealing with the identification photographs were taken of all deceased

 persons in order that they could be viewed by relatives with a view to

 formal identification in due course.    Throughout the night relatives were

brought to the Gymnasium and were met by police officers together with

Social Workers and representatives of the Churches who had attended in lar

numbers to assist with counselling and welfare.    Upon identifying a

photograph the body was brought to a viewing area where formal

identification could be made and the relatives were then taken for stateme

purposes by CID officers.   Once identification had been completed the bodi

were transported to the city mortuary.    Throughout one police officer was

allocated to each body for continuity purposes.    This procedure continued

until 4 30am by which time a total of 74 bodies had been identified and th

remainder of the bodies were then transported to the Sheffield City Mortua

for the procedure to continue the following day.



On Sunday 16 April 1989, the identification procedure continued and by

the end of that day all bodies had been identified.
  LOGISTICS



  In dealing with logistics il. must be appreciated that many of the

  aspects covered overlap the other areas referred to in the Major

  Incident Mannual.          In general this deals with the organization of

  manpower 3.n.Q ©Qiiipmsnt s.n.Q 2.nc 1 udss v/0 2 . 3 .it*s s.n.Q C£.ts” ',*rio"

  facilities .




 In dealing with manpower many references are made to deployment by

_-"Chisf Supt Duckenfield in overall command, assisted by his Sector

 Commanders in the form of Supt Murray in the Control Room and Supt

 Greenwood in charge of the Ground Sector.                    Supt Greenwood played a

 prime role in this aspect and in essence dealt with the rescue ana

 evc.cuc.tion fj.om tne terraces.           During the course of this he took

 action in organizing officers to recover the bodies of the

 deceased and rescue the injured and deputed other officers to

 maintain order and keep press and other interested parties at bay

 to ensure that they did not hinder the rescue operation.

Mr Greenwood appointed a police constable as his communications

officer and obtained the facilities of loud nailers in order that

he could address the crowd.



In the case of Supt Murray he arranged for gangways to be cleared

in the South Stand to facilitate tne removal of casualties and

deployed serials and supervisors to the North and South Stand and

Spion Kop perimeter tracks to maintain public order.                         During

these actions the operation was still in being and mobile units

were deployed to deal with the reports of' fighting outside the

Stadium.     Subsequent action by Supt Murray involved the organized
   searcnes of terraces and the containment and sealing off of the

   terraces and the containment of the gymnasium to prevent

  intsrierence with the temporary mortuary facilities and

  identification procedures.



  Throughout; these actions Chief Supt Nesbit who had been at the

  ground took over as overall co-ordinator on the ground and

  arranged for a cordon of officers to be stretched across the pitch

  to prevent further confrontation from Nottingham Forest supporters

     ~ ie south 01 the Stadium and the Liverpool supporters. In
     l

 addition this course of action allowed the rescue operation to go

 ahead unhindered.      To supplement this cordon dogs were brought on

 to uhe perimeter track to ensure that supporters remained in their

 respective locations.




 In tne realization that further officers were required Operation

 Support which is referred to later in this section, was requested

 at 15 06 and was authorised at 15 10.          That action ensured ready

available resources to supplement those officers already at the

scene .




Whilst the rescue role was clearly paramount and was organized in

the manner outlined further organization had to take place

Cunc«. ning th.6 tempos diry mortus.i'y s.nci css us.1   rscscCion 2.its~

This activity was organized by Det Chief Supt Addis in overall

command, o.nd he was assisted by Det Supt McKay, Inspector Charles

and Det Inspector Webster.       In general the officers of the

Criminal Investigation Department were used for this task and were

involved in the receipt, searching and identification of the
deceased and the preservation of property.




In recognition of the major disaster which was in being the Force

Operations Room activated the call out procedures for the Casualty

Bureau Enquiry Teams and Hospital Liaison Officers.     This action

took place at 15 17 and 15 29 the Medico Legal Centre was alerted

regarding fatalities.     Major Incident Boxes which are held at Sub-

Divisional Stations were requested and deployed to the scene.



At 16 32 the Major Incident Room staff were called out to set up

operations at Hammerton Road Police Station to co-ordinate police

activity and follow up enquiries.     From 16 40 contact was made

with the Salvation Army, the Emergency Services Organizing Teams

and the WRVS.     These facilities were for counselling and assisting

relatives and friends of the deceased and injured.      At 17 02 the

Force Welfare Officer, Mrs Penny Grimshaw was contacted and

requested to attend at the scene.



Conscious of the needs of relatives at 17 40 arrangements were

made for the care and reception of relatives and friends and this

was directed under the control of Supt Sleath and Inspector

Hogan-Howe.   Initially relatives were taken to Hammerton Road

Police Station.    However, in view of the numbers involved this was

extended to the Hillsborough Boys Club and Police Officers were

assisted by Social Workers and Clergy who were in attendance.
^7 0
       In terms of catering provisions had been made in view of the

       operation ±Jiat had been planned.   However this was extended

       through Headquarters Managment Services Department who ensured

       that sufficient provisions were available for what clearly was to

       fce a pro-lcnged enquiry in particular with the identification of

       deceased persons.   In lact this proved to be correct in that the

       identification procedures ran through the night and did not

       terminate until 5 30 am and resumed the following day.

P
INVESTIGATION AND REPORTS




At 1804 Acting Detective Superintendent Smith began setting up the

Major Incident Room at Hammerton Road Police Station.   The room

contained the HOLMES computerised system and all information to      APPENDIX

hand was inputted into that system.
                                                                     68



Because of the magnitude of the disaster it was later decided that

an outside investigation should take place and Mr Geoffrey Dear

the Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police was requested to

carry out that investigation.



In addition a judicial inquiry has been embarked upon under the

chairmanship of Mr Justice Taylor.
POLICE MANPOWER RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO RESPOND TO EMERGENCY SITUATIONS



In any major incident manpower availability is a crucial-element and

once again the South Yorkshire Police have plans inbeing to cater for

such contingencies.   The plan in question is headed Operation Support    APPENDIX
                                                                          69
and in brief identifies the method by which manpower can quickly be

assembled and deployed to situations requiring immediate increase in

manpower levels.



In the first instance the manpower is raised from that on duty and each

of the 14 Sub-Divisions of the Force is required to identify its

minimum manning levels capable of maintaining normal policing and to

deploy the remainder to the scene of the incident to which the manpower

is required.   In addition there are facilities for the call out of

officers off-duty should further manpower resources be required.

Details of the plan are incorporated in the Appendices.



In the case of the Hillsborough Disaster it was quickly recognised that

additional resources would be required to deal with the aftermath of

the situation, bearing in mind the large crowds which were still in the

vicinity and the large number of deceased persons and relatives who       APPENDIX
                                                                           70
were seeking information concerning the whereabouts of loved ones and

friends.   To this end Operation Support was activated at 1510   under

the direction of the Assistant Chief Constable (Operations) Mr Jackson.



The co-ordination and activation of Operation Support is controlled by

the officer in command of the Force Operations Room, and at this time

this was Chief Inspector Edmundson.
                                                                                             /




    6.67.      .    As a consequence of the activation of Operation Support, Officers were

                    required to 'attend at the Hillsborough Stadium and to report to the

                    Police Room.




    6.33.           In response to Operation Support a minima* total of 26i officers

                   total of 176 officers attended and were received by Chief Inspector

                   McRobbie , who was designated as the Reception Officer at that

                   location.   These officers were also deployed to duties around the

                   Stadium in an effort to maintain calm and give reassurance to

                supporters who were in the vicinity of the Stadium following

                abandonment of the match.

INTRODUCTION

The following communication arrangements     were   made for the police
operation at Hillsborough on 15th April      1989   and the subsequent
emergency action.

PC Claxton of the Communications staff attended a planning meeting at
'F 1 Divisional Headquarters, Hammerton Road on the 22nd March 1989 to
note the requirements defined by the Division and offer advice if
required.


RADIO

The arrangement for radio cover for the match were the same as all
other games at Hillsborough.     For F.A. Cup Semi-Finals an additional
facility is provided at Neepsend to control CID officers working on
crime prevention duties.

Radio Cover

Radio cover for the Hillsborough ground,       both inside and external
patrols, is provided by a UHF scheme operating on channel 25 with the
aerial on the floodlight gantry at the side of the police control room
inside the ground.      This gives radio cover over a radius         of
approximately 1 mile from the ground.  The definitive area of cover can
be established by the Directorate of Telecommunications if required.

The radio installation in the police control room is permanent and used
for all matches at the ground.

Channel 25 is one of 4 emergency channels available to all U.K. police
forces (channels 19: 23: 29 are the others) and are regularly used for
controlling activity at football grounds.  It is a matter for the force
to control use to prevent interference between police operations
working on the same channel.        There was nothing else taking place
in-force on 15th April 1989 to cause interference.     Because of the
hilly terrain between the ground and surrounding forces interference
between the ground and anywhere outside the force is highly unlikely.
There was none reported on the day.

In addition to the UHF scheme at the ground channel 19 was used by CID
officers working on security duties in the designated parking areas at
Neepsend and Parson Cross.

The aerial for this is on Shirecliffe College and because of the
geographic height of the site cover is provided over an area of
approximately 3 miles radius.  This use of channel 19 is similar to the
arrangement in previous years for semi-final matches.
Radio Issue

Paragraph 4.11.4 of the Operational Order identifies radio issue Jto all APPENDIX
supervisory officers on the detail.                                      39

On the morning of the 15th April                1989 Communications Department
delivered 100 B u m d e p t 3 channel radios,   tuned to channels 19s 25:   29,
and 120   Pye PFX multi-channel sets to         the police room at the ground.
In addition 36 earpieces were delivered         which would fit either of the
radio types.        Spare batteries were         also provided, but no battery
charges.

Allocation and distribution of the sets and           earpieces   was   done    by   statement
personnel from 'F' Division - PC Fiddler.                                            77

Two radio issue books were used which are now at Headquarters
Communications Department. 76 PFX sets and 63 B u m d e p t sets are shown
to have been issued. Only 4 earpieces are booked out to serial 21 (see
operational order). It is known that more earpieces were in fact taken
for use because at 24.4.89 20 were still outstanding for return to
Headquarters.

Radio Equipment

There is a permanent UHF radio      scheme installed at the ground             for
policing   all football matches.    This scheme was used for the F. A.         Cup
semi-final on 15th April 1989.

The radio set is provided by the Directorate of Telecommunications  and
referred   to as a W15U portable base station.      It is in fact a Pye
Westminster Mobile radio adapted for use as a temporary fixed base
station.   This type of installation is in frequent use at all football
grounds in the Force and by most other forces who have          similar
requirements.    The set is powered by mains electricity and is located
in the police control room.

Method of operation

The W15U can be operated in either 'talk-thro' or 'non talk-thro'  mode
by pressing or releasing a button on the radio set.  The choice is with
the radio control operator.

The radio operator in the control room uses a handset with a 'press to APPENDIX73
talk'  switch and a speaker for incoming messages.  The installation at (photograph'
Hillsborough has a 'tulip' microphone which stands on the desk in front
of the controller and an in-car radio speaker, also desk mounted.

It is normal practice at Hillsborough to use the UHF radio scheme on
talk-thro' and this was the case on the 15th April 1989.  Talk-thro' is
also used at other grounds in the force for policing football matches.
Even with the use of an earpiece noise levels in crowd situations,
particularly in the confines of a football ground, can reach a level
where the volume of the radio output is not sufficient for the user to
be able to receive transmissions.


Effect of Talk-thro' Choices

Talk-Thro' on

  Everyone with a radio, turned on to the appropriate channel, can hear
  all transmissions by anyone else, including the control room.

  If more than one radio transmits at any one time all other sets
  including the control room,  get all the messages.       However,  it
  becomes increasingly difficult to understand individual messages when
  several officers are speaking.

  If the controller is transmitting on the handset and one of the
  personal radios transmits at the same time, then the control output
  is cut off. All the users, including the controller,  will receive
  the   message   from    the personal radio.    This arrangement is
  electrically built into the equipment. It can only be overcome by
  de-selecting talk-thro.

Talk-Thro' Off

  If the controller transmits all sets switched on to that channel will
  receive.

  A message transmitted from a personal radio   is   only   heard   on   the
  controllers set.

  Whilst the controller is transmitting any of the personal radios can
  transmit and the message will be received on the controllers     set.
  The transmitting personal    radio will not receive the message being
  sent by control.

Equipment Operation on 15.4.89

Technical

Channel 19 operated without incident.

The scheme was in operation from the time of the briefing around
10.00a.m.  on the day.     A member of communications department was on
stand-by at the ground, in the gymnasium to assist with   communication
problems  should they arise.      He had a Pye PFX multi-channel radio
switched on all the time,  and was using an earpiece      extension to
receive incoming messages.
The equipment worked without incident until about 2.15 p.m.  At this
time it was noticed that messages from the controller were 'clipped.1        STATEMENT
Whilst it was possible to understand what was said the full text was
not being transmitted.      Messages passed by personal radios, (on
talk-thro') were not affected.

At 2.30 p.m. the communication staff went to the control room to attend
to the fault. As a contingency at semi-final matches a stand-by W15U
is provided in the control room, with battery back up in the event of
mains power failure.

The first check made was to exchange the microphone between the set in
use and the stand-by, which did not clear the fault.

The stand-by set was then taken into use. This involved moving the
aerial connection from one set to the other and connecting the mains
power supply by inserting the plug.

The operators microphone on the stand-by set was of a telephone type.        APPENDIX 73
Transmissions are made by pressing a bar built in to the hand set.  The      (photograph
cable connection from the hand set to the base station was of a coiled
telephone type.    It did not allow the same freedom of movement to the
operator because of its shorter length compared with the original tulip
microphone.

The new set continued to be used on talk-thro',          but when the        APPENDIX73
communications staff left the controller was using a Motorola portable       (photograph
set instead of the microphone provided.   This has the effect of making
the controller equal to all other resources in respect of transmission
and receipt of messages.   The microphone and speaker were connected to
the replacement W15U but not taken into use.

The UHF radio continued to operate without incident from this time.

Practical Use

This section of the report deals with the practical views of Police
Officers who were making use of radio system on Saturday 14th April
1989.

It concentrates on the actual experiences related by officers who     were
'on the ground' and dealing with the situation.

Immediately following the change of equipment the operator stopped
using the microphone attached to the reserve set because he thought it       STATEMENT
was not working.      Two or three attempts were made to transmit, but       78
messages were not acknowledged. In addition the cable did not give
sufficient flexibility for him to work from the normal sitting
position, although he could operate whilst standing.  This problem was
overcome by using a personal radio in Ground Control on talk-through.
The result of this change was that the radio system was functional,  in
a technical sense,    and in working order,     but without any control
capability in terms of commanding the system.
7.36   The difficulties thereafter appear to have been a combination of two
       causes and these appear as a common thread in the comments of officers.

        (i)    a heavy   (continuous)  flow of radio traffic, from officers
               inside and outside the ground and from Ground Control, and,

        (ii)   officers were having difficulty in hearing transmissions due to
               the noise from the crowds about them.

Radio Control Operational Order

Paragraph 4.11 of the operational order deals with radio control on the
day and is produced below:-

"4.11     COMMUNICATIONS

 4.11.1     All communications   relevant   to   the event will be directed
            through Ground control.

 4.11.2     The following UHF/VHP channels will be utilised       in   relation
            to this operation:-

          (A)    UHF    personal radio channel 25 will be used by all
                  supervisory officers,  both inside and outside the
                  ground.

          (B)    UHF   personal radio channel 19 will be used by all CID
                  personnel engaged on duties in the Parson Cross and
                  Neepsend private parking areas.

          (C)    VHF   radio channel 1 will be used by mobile patrols.
 4.11.3   'FI1 Sub-Division's operational functions will continue to be
          transmitted on UHF personal radio channel 35.

 4.11.4   Personal radios will be issued at the Administration Desk        in
          the gymnasium to all supervisory officers.

 4.11.5   Strict radio discipline will be maintained at all times.
          Messages must be kept as short as possible and, where this is
          not the case, Ground Control has the overriding option of
          cutting short any transmission, irrespective of rank.

 4.11.6   Ground Control can also be contacted   on   internal     extension
          3277."

In connection paragraph 4.11.5 of the Operational Order this situation
cannot prevail unless talk-thro' is de-selected.


Radio Equipment Supervision

One member of Communications Department was on stand-by at       the   ground
from the briefing onwards.

At the request of the Division the Force Communications caravan and
Stonefield Communications Vehicle were located at Hillfoot Bridge on
Penistone Road and staffed by a further 2 officers from the Department.
A fourth member was on mobile patrol  to deal with communication demands
as they arose.

Activity on channel 19 and 25, and channel 29, which was being used by
West Bar for city centre football crowd policing was monitored in the
Communications   caravan.   Channel   25 was monitored in the Force
Operations Room by using a portable UHF set in a vehicle adaptor,
without any difficulty.

The following   contingencies were    in place in the event of equipment
failure:-

 A stand-by base station was located in the control room.    This was in
 fact taken into use as described previously.

 The mobile Stonefield Communications Vehicle was on stand-by at
 Hillfoot Bridge.  If both base stations or the aerial installation at
 the ground fail then the vehicle could take over.     It is equipped
 with a pump-up aerial and base        station   and   would   restore
 communications on the same UHF channel (25).   It would take about 10
 minutes to bring into operation plus the journey time to the ground.
 In the pre-match planning this year, as in previous years, decisions
 were made not to park the vehicle at the ground, whilst on stand-by,
 because of congestion.

 The third option available is to change the ground operation from
 channel 25 to channel 19 by using the communications caravan which
 was located at Hillfoot Bridge.     This would mean that control could
     either be from the caravan, or using talk-thro’ by the police control
     room using a portable UHF set. The difficulty with this option is
     informing patrols of the channel change.  The caravan would not have
     to be moved because the base station/aerial site at Shirecliffe gives
     cover at the ground.

VHF Cover

Force channel 1 was dedicated to patrols operating on route supervision
prior to the match.    This channel is controlled from Force Operations
Room and worked without incident.

A portable VHF set was used in the ground control room to monitor
activity on the Force channel one, and provide a communication link if
required.  This set worked without incident.

 REQUIRING POLICE RESPONSE                                            22

A        Recommendations in the Interim Report

1.       Evacuation procedures should be a matter of police trainincr
         and form part of the briefing bv police officers before a
         football match.

              Following publication of the Popplewell Reoort
              both the police and fire service held a joint meetina
              at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club with officials
              and stewards to discuss the requirements the recort
              placed on the training of stewards.

              As a result of this meeting, the club issued revised
              emergency evacuation procedures which were circulated to
              all club personnel. South Yorkshire Police, 'F' Division,
              incorporated emergency evacuation procedures in their
              match orders for games played at Sheffield Wednesday
              Football Club, these procedures being broken down to a
              serial level.

              Prior to the commencement of each match at Sheffield
              Wednesday Football Ground all personnel are verbally
              reminded by the briefing officer (normally the Sub
              Divisional Superintendent) of the evacuation procedure to
              be adopted.  Each serial is also reminded of the need
              to identify officers to be deputed to man emergency routes
              and exits should the need arise.  In addition, on each
              match day, Inspectors responsible for the four main areas
              within the stadium, brief club stewards as to their
              responsibilities.

              The procedures have been tested twice during the 1988/9
              season, whilst league matches have been in play.  These
              tests were. •conducted on

2.        The local authority team responsible for issuing safety
         certificates in respect of designated grounds should, as
         heretofore, include police officers.

             The Safety of Sports Ground Advisory Group is chaired by
             Mr D Bo.wnes, City of Sheffield Metropolitan District
             Council, Administration and Legal Department, and meetings
             are attended by either Divisional or Sub Divisional
             representatives responsible for policing designated sports
             grounds.
    3.      Early attention should be given by the Home Office Directorate
            of Telecommunications to consider t h e .practicality of
            producing a more suitable personal radio for the police.

                  This requirement has been superceeded by the fact that
                  South Yorkshire Police now purchases its own radio
                  equipment and new equipment has beenobtained.
    4.      The   Green Guide should be amended to include Paragraph 11 a
            provision that, wherever practicable, roads within a quarter of
            a mile of a sports ground should be kept entirely free of
            parked vehicles.

                  Parking is restricted on main roads in the immediate area
                  of the ground by use of no waiting cones.  However, due to
                  the fact that there is a considerable amount of housing in
#                 the area, it is neither feasible nor practicable to
                  attempt to create a one quarter mile no parking zone.
    5.      In designated grounds it should be a term of the safety
            certificate that an adequate first aid room should be provided.

                  This has been incorporated in paragraph 8(1) of the
                  Safety Certificate.
    6   .   Stewards in all grounds should not only be trained in fire
            precautions and fire fighting (see Recommendation 7 above) but
            should also be trained in how best to help the police in
            evacuation.

                  As at 1.

    7.      Paragraphs 6.14.6 of the Green Guide should be amended to read:

            "All exit gates should be manned at all times while the ground
            is used by the public and Be capable of being opened
            immediately from inside by anyone in an emergency."

                  This is a function of the stewards and is monitored by the
                  police on all match days and is complied with.
    8   .   The Green Guide should be amended to contain a specific
            provision, in relation to stewards.

            (i)     that they should be trained and instructed to deal
                    with any emergency relating to fire or evacuation
                    (see.also Recommendation 7 and 10)
          (ii)       that they should be given written instructions about
                     theaction to be taken in cases of emergency

          (iii)      that they should receive practical instruction and
                     training appropriate to their responsibility

          (iv )      that no one should be employed as a steward unless
                     they have been so instructed and trained;  and

          (v)        that they should be adequate in number, physically and
                     mentally capable of performing their duties,
                     effectively deployed, effectively supervised and
                     readily identifiable.   (Now see paragraph 4.129 and
                     Appendix !E !, paragraph E4 9)



#                 See 1, 7 and 10, the remainder is a matter for club
                  policy

    9.    Urgent consideration should be given to introducing a
          membership system in England and Wales so as to exclude
          visiting fans.

                  This is currently the subject of a proposed Bill yet
                  to be presented through Parliament.
    10.   Closed circuit television should be introduced at League
          football grounds in England and Wales and in the Premier
          Division in Scotland.

                  CCTV is already in being at Sheffield Wednesday Football
                  Club (five cameras and seven monitors) for sole police
                  use.

This report deals with the paragraphs in the
guide of particular relevance to the police
service.

A copy of          the      guide    is   included   in   the
Appendices.

Paragraphs       considered          relevant  so    far as
Sheffield         Wednesday           Football    Club   is
concerned,       have been          flagged on the guide
itself.

CHAPTER 5    -   IN G R E S S

Paragraph 46 states:

46.       Contingency plans should be made to
deal   with   situations    where  the   available
entrances at a ground have proved insufficient
to stop unduly large crowds from gathering
outside.     This may,     for example,    include
opening    additional    entrances,    but   local
knowledge of the ground, crowd patterns and
advice from the police should be taken into
account   in   drawing   up   contingency   plans.
Larger grounds should have intercommunication
systems and metering systems at turnstiles
(see   Chapter   12),  and    installation   of  a
centralised computer monitoring system may be
of   assistance    to   management    in   quickly
identifying particular areas of difficulty.

    Whilst     comprehensive      emergency
    evacuation        procedures        are
    incorporated     into     the    police
    operation for each match day and the
    club is,-privy to these arrangements,
    it is not known whether or not the
    club has contingency plans to deal
    with   unduly    large    crowds   from
    gathering outside.     The police have
    not been approached to discuss and
    advise on such arrangements.
CHAPTER 12 - COMMUNICATIONS

Chapter 12 states:

There should be a communication system capable
of clearly relaying essential messages to all
parts   of   the   ground    in   both  normal
circumstances and in an emergency.

192.   Precise requirements for communications
will depend on the sort of ground and the
numbers of people that attend there.        In
general the communication system should be
determined after consultation with the police
and   emergency  services.     It  should   be
available for use and capable of coping with
all emergencies.

193.   A central control point, preferably a
room, should be set aside for the use of the
supervising police officers and the ground
safety officer.

194.   At   larger   grounds   the    following
arrangements are likely to be needed:

      i.     There      should    be    inter­
             communication between the central
             control and all turnstiles or
             banks of turnstiles and all entry
             and   exit   gates  used  by the
             public.

      ii.    Metering systems to record all
             admissions should be installed at
             turnstiles and,    to ensure that
             ground "'‘capacities     are    not
             exceeded    in any    section,
             arrangements should be made for
             central control to be informed
             immediately     a    predetermined
             number of spectators has       been
             admitted through each turnstile.
  iii.    Public address equipment should
          be installed so that broadcast
          messages   can   be  heard    under
          reasonable conditions (including
          emergencies) by all persons of
          normal hearing in any part of the
          ground to which the     public has
          access.     The system should be
          capable of being controlled from
          the central control point and
          should   ideally  be   capable   of
          addressing messages to each major
          section of the ground.   The power
          supply to the system should be
          such as to enable it to continue
          to operate in an emergency such
          as fire or a failure of the mains
          supply.

  iv.    Loud hailers should be available
         for   the  use  of stewards  and
         police     in     directing   or
         instructing spectators.

  v-     Any   police    radio    facilities
         available for the maintenance of
         law and order should augment and
         not     supersede     the    ground
         communications system.

 vi.     Installation of closed circuit
         television is considered likely
         to be    of significant value in
         assisting emergency evacuation.

This chapter     is ... relevant to the
police   operation" and       the advice '
contained in the above paragraphs
has been met.

However, the areas of responsibility
peculiar to the club and the police
service respectively have resulted
in two 'control rooms'.
     The club control room is situate on
     the ground floor adjacent to the
     players entrance.    This contains 16
     television monitors linked to the
     cameras which give views of the 95
     turnstiles on the stadium perimeter.
     A   further  4    television  screens
     monitor views afforded by 4 cameras
     sited in the corridors giving access
     to the clubs' office complex.       A
     final screen is linked to the police
     CCTV circuit and monitors the views
     afforded by the 5 cameras used by
     the police.

     The police control room is quite
     separate and is situate between the
     South and West Stand in an elevated
     position.

     This control room houses UHF and VHF
     radio    facilities,   7   television
     screens linked to 5 CCTV cameras, 2
     video recording machines, a link to
     the clubs public address system and 3
     telephones   (1 national network,   1
     police network and 1 club network).

     A radio and telephone link exits
     between the two 'control rooms' and a
     police liaison officer is utilized in
     the club   'control room'   on match
     days .

CHAPTER 14 - GROUND CONTROL

The introduction to this chapter states:

Where there- is a disorderly element among the
crowd .intent on violence, additional safety
measures are needed to contain and minimise the
potential   disruption,   to . isolate  quickly,
identify and remove     the   offenders  and to
prevent their re-entry on future occasions.

Paragraph 204 states:
204.    As in other areas of safety, management
is    responsible     for    the   crowd    control
arrangements    and   ground   conditions.     They
should ensure that spectators are safe bearing
in mind that a game can lead to a build up of
tension or excitement.       The safety measures
described elsewhere in this Guide will help to
achieve reasonable spectator safety, but for
management    to discharge     its  responsibility
properly a special police presence inside the
ground may be necessary        to deal with     any
problem of disorder which may arise, as well as
to   provide support     and leadership. in      an
emergency.    The number and disposition of     the
police must be determined by Chief Constables
who have    the sole     responsibility   for   the
direction of police operations.        To aid the
police in their duties, a police control room
should be provided within the ground.

      A special police presence is always
      maintained on match days the number
      being determined by the police.   The
      number   is  based on a number     of
      factors,    the   main   ones   being
      anticipated attendance, intelligence
      (particularly behaviour),     mode of
      travel, and segregation.

     A police control is provided         and a
     description   can   be   found       under
     Chapter 12 - Communications.

Paragraph 205 states:

205.   Proper advance planning with the police
is   essential    to   counter     potential     crowd
disorder.    There must be an effective liaison
between .club and police for this purpose to
including not just the arrangements inside the
ground   but   also    the   escort     of    visiting
supporters,    their     likely     numbers,     their
separate   entry    to   the    ground     and   their
departure at the end of the match.               There
should be debriefing meetings as necessary to
evaluate existing arrangements and provide the
flexibility necessary to deal with different
circumstances.
      Effective   liaison   is  maintained
      between club officials and police
      officers at varying levels dependant
      upon the subject matter.

     Whilst a debriefing does not normally
     take   place   immediately  after  the
     match has finished any problems, of
     whatever degree, are fully discussed
     at the earliest opportunity.        In
     practice     the    need   for    such
     discussions is rare.

Paragraph 206 states:

206..  Crowd movement on terraces should be
strictly controlled in order to give the police
the fullest opportunity for crowd control.
Less problems occur when terraces        are sub
divided as far as possible into sections by use
of both radial and lateral barriers or railings
which   should   comply   with    the   strength
requirements set out in Chapter 9.          Each
section should ideally be self contained and
should be serviced by its own entrance/exits,
refreshment facilities and toilets (in keeping
with the principles of general ground division
described   in  Chapter   8,   paragraph   101).
Special care is needed to ensure that sections
and sub divisions are provided with sufficient
exits for use in an emergency.

     This   paragraph   can   be  related
     directly to Leppings Lane terraces
     and enclosures.   The sufficiency of
     exits are the responsibility of the
     club, acting on " the advice of the
     various agencies.    South Yorkshire
     Police have been included in these
     discussions.

Paragraph 207 states:

207.    Home    and  visiting   supporters    at
professional soccer matches should normally be
segregated but segregation is not advocated for,
other sports where crowd disorder is not a
problem.    This should be borne in mind when
considering barriers at grounds used for other
sports as well as association football.
      It is a fact that the present design
      of the .club is geared towards total
      segregation   of    home   and  away
      supporters and police operations are
      formulated to meet this need.

 Paragraph 208 States:

208.    Where possible a neutral or sterile zone
should be provided within a ground so that home
and visiting supporters are not physically
close to each other.        The arrangements for
admitting spectators    into the ground, whether
by tickets purchased in advance        or through
payment at the turnstiles, should be drawn up
in consultation with     the police, and must be
carefully controlled      to ensure    as far  as
possible that segregation is effective and
known trouble makers are excluded.

     In practice,   the numbers of away
     supporters   normally   enables   the
     Leppings Lane terraces and enclosures
     to be utilized to create sterile
     zones at the north and south ends of
     the terracing.  However, large crowds
     of away supporters necessitates usage
     of all enclosures and the sterile
     zone principal must be waived.

     Police officers are positioned both
     inside and outside turnstile areas
     and part of their duty is to deal
     with  the   'known trouble  makers'
     factor.

Paragraph 209 states:

209.    Access to the "‘pitch must be made as
difficult as possible in normal circumstances
while at the, same time ensuring that the police
have effective access to the terraces for the
purpose of crowd control and enabling the pitch
to be used (where appropriate) in the event of
serious   emergency     (see  also   Chapter   11,
paragraph   186).      Where  a pitch    perimeter
barrier fence is installed to keep spectators
off the pitch, care is needed to ensure that it
does not impair the visibility of the playing
area from the terraces.      If spikes or barbed
wire are installed they should if possible be
at a height of no less than 2.4 metres (see
Chapter 3, paragraph 33).      One alternative to
fencing is the construction around the pitch of
a wall with a smooth surface which should not
be less than 1.22 metres in height on the
terrace side.     This boundary wall should have
gates or access points to the pitch which could
be manned by the police or stewards.   A walkway
between the boundary wall and the terraces,
which would be solely occupied by the police,
first aid and-official club personnel, has been
found to be effective as regards safety and
security.  In order to achieve this it might be
necessary   to  remove  one   or   two  rows  of
terracing and to protect the walkway from the
terrace by a continuous l.ine of barriers, so
designed as to discourage access to the walkway
except at authorised points.   The access points
from terrace to walkway should be directly
linked with the access points from the walkway
to the pitch.    Where a walkway system is in
use, sliding gates may be installed at the
access points from the walkway to the pitch, ie
where there can be no crowd pressure against
them (see Chapter 6, paragraph 55 regarding the
use of sliding gates elsewhere).    A barrier to
the pitch is usually unnecessary where seating
extends to the level of the playing area.

     Pitch perimeter barrier fences are
     installed   at  the   Spion  Kop  and
     Leppings Lane terraces end of the
     ground only. A pitch wall with a
     smooth surface has been installed in
     front of the North and South Stands.
     Gates are incorporated in the barrier
     fences (7 at Leppings Lane end and 6
     at  the   Spion Kop end)    following
     consultation between the club, the
     South Yorkshire Fire Service and the
     police.

     Police officers are positioned in the
     enclosed areas and gangways and also
     around the perimeter track.       The
     latter focuses on" the aforementioned
     gates in the Spion Kop and Leppings
     Lane end fencing.

Paragraph 210 states:

210.    At larger soccer grounds, particularly
where there has been a record of frequent crowd
trouble,    secure  detention    rooms  may    be
necessary for use by the police.

     The    secure   detention   room   at
     Sheffield   Wednesday  Football  Club
     comprises one small room within the
     Police Room situate on the ground
     floor level at the rear of the North
     Stand.   On matches with a history of
     a large number of arrests or where
     intelligence predicts the likelihood
     of trouble leading to a significant
     number of arrests, then a mobile cell
     unit is used to supplement this
     facility.
Paragraph 211 states:

211.   There   should  be   adequate  vehicular
access for the unobtrusive removal of detainees
(see also Chapter 11, paragraphs 189-191 on
access for emergency vehicles).

     Police    transit    vans    are   also
     specifically identified for use for
     transportation of persons arrested to
     Hammerton   Road   Police  Station   to
     eleviate    any   build   up    in  the
     detention area.

Paragraph 212 states:

212.   Hard containers such as glasses, bottles
or cans can make dangerous missiles and should
not be used for the sale of refreshments. All
refreshments   should   be   served   in   soft
containers.

     In terms of refreshments, only soft
     drinks are on sale inside the stadium
     and   these  are   sold   in  plastic
     containers.

Paragraph 213 states:

213.   Alcohol  should   not  be on   sale  for
consumption on the terraces or in the stands.

    It is a police requirement, enforced
    by   the   Licensing     Bench   of   the

      A P P L IC A T IO N AND GRANT OF GROUND SAFE TY
          C E R T IF IC A T E TO S H E F F IE L D WEDNESDAY
                             FOOTBALL CLUB




On 30 March 1977, the Chief Constable of the
South Yorkshire    Police wrote   to the     Under
Secretary   of  State   with  reference   to   the APPENDIX
proposed staging of the F A Cup Semi Final 74
between Manchester United and Leeds’ United on 23
April 1977. (Policy File paragraph 22.02.12 Part
III Public Entertainment - Football - Safety
Precautions refers).

The letter proposed that consideration be given
to   extending    general   safety  certificate
requirements to this stadium as it was then a
Third Division Ground and, at that time, the
Safety of Sports Ground Act 1975 applied to
First Division grounds and those regularlary
used for international matches.

The   Home  Office,   in   turn,    "consulted  the
interested bodies, including the Football League
and the Football Association", and, in their
letter dated 24 August 1977, declined to press                APPENDIX
for designation in view of the fact that the                  75
Football   Association   were    uncertain   as  to
whether or not Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
would be invited to stage future events.

The Home Office did undertake to look at the
matter in 1978 when consideration would be given
to extending designation of grounds to include
Second Division clubs.

On   9 August    1978,   the   Home  Office  again
corresponded with the Chief Constable of the
South Yorkshire Police.    On this occasion it was            APPENDIX
stated that    the   Football Association      now            76
welcomed the proposed designation of Sheffield
Wednesday Football Stadium and that ministers
had decided to proceed with the matter.
The Safety of Sports Grounds (Designation) Order
1978 was laid before Parliament on 7 August 1978      APPENDIX
to come into effect on 1 January 1979 , listing       77
Sheffield   Wednesday   Football   Club   as   a
designated stadium.    A copy of that Order is
included in the Appendices.

On   8   September  1978,   Sheffield  Wednesday
Football Club applied for a Safety Certificate
under the Safety of Sports GroundAct 1975.

A General Safety Certificate was granted on 21        APPENDIX
December 1979, a copy of which is included in         78
the Appendices.
The club still operates under this certificate
as the general terms and conditions of the new
certificate have yet to be agreed upon.      All
reference to the police having been deleted from
the proposed draft certificate by the South
Yorkshire County Council.

So far as the police service is concerned,      the
conditions of the existing certificate -most
relevant are:-

  6.   (1)   The Holder shall agree with
             the Chief Constable at least
             21 days (or such shorter time

             may consent) prior to every
             Specified     Activity     the
             methods of admission to be
             employed in connection with
             the Specified Activity and
             (in relation to a Football
             match)' the methods to be used
             for the segregation of home
             and visting supporters.

 7.          The Holder shall at     his own
             expense   arrange     for    the
             attendance at every Specified
             Activity   of    an    adequate
             number of police officers to
             secure the orderly and lawful
             behaviour of the spectators
             and the   number    of    police
                officers .required    at  each
                Specified Activity shall be
                agreed   between   the   Chief
                Constable and the Holder at
                least   21   days   (or   such
                shorter time to which the
                Chief Constable may consent)
                before a Specified Activity
                takes place.

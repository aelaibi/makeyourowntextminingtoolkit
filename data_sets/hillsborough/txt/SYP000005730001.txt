playground             of a s c h o o l         which       had       been      opened         up       for    the     game.

The      school        was    about        a    15 mi ns w a l k            from       the     ground.            We    all       walked

towards         the     ground and              I stopped             for    a hot        dog a n d           then     they were

j u st    ahead        of me.         There          were     l a rg e      crowds        of       people        milling          but

there       was    no    trouble.               A Policeman              on a h o r s e          stopped          me    and my          four

friends         went      on a h e a d ,        I did       not       see a n y        one     of       them again           u ntil

after       the    game       was     stopped.

I was       held       up for        about       10 m i n u t e s        and      I could           a    la rge      crowd ahe ad

and mini          b u s es    pulling           up    outside          the      main      entrance             gates       in L e p p i n g s

L-N a n d      people        getting           out,    this       struck          me    as     being          stupid       to a l l o w

vehicles          into a n      area           which       was    so     congested             with       peo p l e .        I saw        that

the      la rge    iron       gates        at    the       entrance          to    the       ground were               closed       and

once      these        were    opened           again       the P o l i c e m a n         on     the      horse        let    us    move

forward,          at    this     time          1 was       in a       lar g e     crowd        of       people       but     not    being

crushed.           As    I got        nearer          to    the       turnstile           the       crush        got w o r s e      but        not

serious.

As    I got       to    the    turnstiles              another           Policeman              on a h o r s e         shouted          "Don't

bother         with     the    turnstiles              the       g ate       is   open        go     in t h e r e . "        He    w as

pointing          to    the    right.           I could          see        the   gates         were open and                I went

in t h r o u g h       the    gates        together          with        a      large        n u m b e r of      other       people.

Once      inside        this     gate          there       was    plenty          of    room        before        I reached             the

tunnel         which     leads        to       the    terrace.              I checked           my       ticket        and    saw       it

was      for    entrance        8     on       looking       ahead          I saw a          large        A--B a n d       made     for

t h em.        I entered         the       tunnel          a n d at      first         it a p p e a r e d        alright          but     as    I

moved       along       it    became           more    and       more       congested            and      I became

concerned.              I had        no    control          o ver      my m o v e m e n t s         you       could     not       move

sideways          or    return        I was          being       steadily          pushed           forward.            It        was     my

intention          once       I got        through          the       tunnel       to m o v e           to m y    right,          but     once

through         the     tu n n e l    I saw          there       was     a fence          preventing              t his      but    I

could       not    move       anybody           because          of    the      crush.           I had m y           hands        crossed
                                                                                                                                       PAGE
                                                                                                                                       S'373

in f r o n t       of m y        cheat.

The      next      thing         1 knew       was       being         propelled           from       the       top    of    the     terrace

down       towards          the    pitch          stopping            about      six      or    seven          feet    from       the

perimeter             fence.           This       all     happened            in a f e w        seconds          and       there       was

nothing          I could          do.        I w as       j ust       pushed        from       the     back.          People        were

shouting           and      screaming             and Police             at    the     front         were       shouting          push

b a ck     but     you      just       couldn't          move.

I ha d m y a r m s           crossed          against            my     chest       and    was       pushing          out    in     front

of    me    which          enabled       me       to    gasp       to    breath.           People          all       around       were

being       crus h e d .          The     n ext        t hi ng     I rem e m b e r        was       s e ein g

                   go i ng       through          the    s m all        gate     out      into       the       pitch.        I did          not

see      any     of    the       other       friends          I had          travelled          d o w n with.

I was       crushed          for       sorne t i m e         I cannot          rememfaer            how    Iong       and    then       the

crowd       started          to    move       away       and       I made        my way         back       towards          the

tunnel.            I went         back       up    the       t u n n e l , because             of    the       crush       I had       been

in.        I cannot          remember             how     bad      it w a s      in the         tunnel          but    it was

nothing          like       the    crush          I had       been       in e a r l i e r .          I was       in a d a z e          and

was      wondering           around          there       were         people        all    around          the       rear    of     the

s t a n d gasping            for       breath          and    looking          bl ue      but       I di d      not    see     any

bodies.            I then w a l k e d             around         to     the    s ide      of    the       stand and          saw       that        I

could       h ave      got       into     the      terrace            from     there       and       if    I had       known        I would

have       g one      to    there       in f i r s t         place.

At    this       p o int     I had        seen         enough and             decided          to    go    home,       and     so      as    !f.

came       out     I saw a m b u l a n c e s            and      bodies        at    the       side.           People       were

milling          around and             I went          b ack      to m y      car.        I stayed             at    the    car       for

about       half       a n h our        listening             to      the     radio.           I heard          there       had     been

deaths.                                and                   :ame       to    the    car       park       at    twenty       five       to

five       (1640)          but    we    did       not     know what            had     happened            to B a r r y .

We w a i t e d        at    the    car       for       about       an    h our      and    then       we w e n t       ba ck      to    the

Solutation             pub w h e r e         we    rung       home,          and Georges             wife       to    tell     her
                                                                                                                                          PAGE
                                                                                                                                          S373

             where       we    were     if G e o r g e       and Barry       rang       her.

             It    got    to    half       past     eight      and    I rang       Georges          wife      again       and     told      her

             we    were       doing    no    good       'there a n d w a s        coming        h o me,     at    this       stage        she

             had    not       heard    from George             or B a r r y .

             We    started          'to 'travel       home     and    s t o p p e d at       the    motorway         service         area

             where       I again        rang      Georges       wife       and    she     had      heard      from George            but        did

             not    know what          had h ap pe ne d         to B a r r y .

             I then       came       home    and      Georges        wife    rang       me    up     in the       early       hours        and

             t o l d me       the    bad    news.

             It w a s     my    first       visit       to H i l l s b o r o u g h a n d      the     arrangements              made       in m y

             opinion          were    inadequate.              I think       t hat      Leppings           L.N s h o u l d    have        been

             closed       to    traffic,          there       was    one    turnstile           out      of a c t i o n      which

             caused       delays       in e n t e r i n g .         Once    inside        the      g r o u nd t h e r e      d i d n ’t

             appear       to    be    s i ngs     directing          you    to    the    wings        of    the    t e r r a c e . I on 1 y

             saw    the       sign    to    the    tunnel.           If    I had     known         I would        not h a v e      gone

             through          the    tunnel       but    out    to    the    wi n g s .

             In t h e     crush       1 suffered             bruising       but    no     s er io us injuries.

             I also       think       that      the     fences       which       run d o w n       the      terrace pre vented

             people       moving       sideways.              1 think       these       caused        more       problems         than      the

             perimeter          fence.

                                                                                                                                     SIGNED

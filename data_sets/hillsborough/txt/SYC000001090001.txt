1.11       Offlcer~ should receive a full briefing prior to taking up their
           duties which should include after match arrangements and clear
           instructions as to booking off. Where practicable such briefings
           should be carried out on site. In large scale police operations
           the operational commander should brief all officers not below the
           rank of Inspector, and Inspectors should be responsible for
           briefing officers of the rank of Sergeant and Constable.
1.12       In accordance wlth the ’Popplewe11’ recommend(~tlons the briefing
           must        tnclude.~evacuatton       procedures       a~d~the;~.dut.tes~ and

1.13       Briefing cards may prove advantageous, particularly when officers
           are unfamiliar with the routines of policing football. Where
           officers are unfamiliar they should be provided with a map of the
           ground and its immediate environs identifying ’home’ and ’away’
           sections of the ground and the numbers or letters used by the
           club, so that they can answer questions for supporters.
1.14       Briefing should pay particular attention to policy and practice
           as to searching, arrest and ejection and officers must know where
           to take prisoners.      Intelligence as to likely offenders and
           common practices of disturbance should be carefully outlined.
           Supervisors in particular need to know the ground commanders
           ’public order st~rategy’.
1.15       Copies of evacuation procedures and any briefing cards or other
           information passed out in documentary form during briefing should
           be available within the ’police control’.
1.16       Ground regulations, "which have national application, should be
           brought to notice as follows:-
                                              ,GROUND -REGULATIONS

                        FOOTBALL   HOOLIGANISM

      POLICING   FOOTBALL

      Introduction
1.1   This document has been compiled for the purpose of providing
      general advice to officers given the responsibility of arranging
      operational police planning for sporting occasions.     The level
      and degree of advance planning must necessarily depend to a large
      extent on the particular fixture and the amount of trouble that
      may reasonably be expected as a result of intelligence gathered
      by the police.

      Intelligence

1.2   Intelligence concerning the likelihood of crowd disturbance or
      hooliganism occurring will necessarily be obtained from a variety
      of sources and should be interpreted through experience and
      common sense.    It is recognised that the degree of advance
      planning for a particular game depends upon both the interest in
      the fixture and the amount of trouble anticipated, based upon
      intelligence available to the police. Aside from the importance
      of the fixture in terms of league position or ’cup’ prospects,
      football matches are often used by hooligans to celebrate
      previous encounters with particular sets of fans.          It is
      therefore particularly important to be aware of the history of
      that fixture.
1.3   The prime source of football intelligence is the Police National
      Intelligence System which is based on the network of Police
      Liaison Officers (see paragraphs 2.1 to 2,11 et. seq.).
      Summaries completed by police officers of the home club Force are
      forwarded to the visiting club’s liaison officer, making
      available intelligence about fans behavtour at both home and away
      fixtures. This information will be collated and made available
      for future matches involving that club.

      The summary includes details of those arrested, charged or
      ejected and complaints of misbehaviour both inside and outside
      the ground, including public houses, railway/coach stations and
      other places where football supporters gather. This allows for
      regular offenders to be identified and targeted, resulting in a
      systematic build-up of intelligence.     To ensure the maximum
      benefit of such intelligence it is essential that the match
      summary is completed accurately and comprehensively, and
      forwarded promptly to the Police Force concerned.

1.5   Htsbehaviour by football supporters whilst travelling on trains,
      London Underground, or ferries, or whilst on British Rail
      property is collated by British Transport Police       part of a
      national intelligence system operated by that ;:rce.        This
      information is available to Force liaison officers through their
      British Transport Police counterparts (see paragraphs 2.13 to
      2.20 et. seq.).

1.6   Sour.~es of intelligence may be summarised as follows:-


                                                                          63
        (a)       Match summaries compiled by the ’home’ club will provide
                  a record of the same fixture on previous occasions,

        (b)       Intelligence from the liaison officer associated with the
                  visiting club.
        (c)       Analysis of C.C.T.V. coverage to identify group leaders
                  and observe the ’tactics’ of the hooligans.

        (d)       ’Spotters’   supplied by the police associated with the
                  visiting club.
        (e)       The football clubs (home and away).

        if)       Travel agents, coach operators, British Transport Police,
                  supporters’ clubs.

        (g)       The development of intelligence wtll take into account
                  the history of the fixture, the anticipated size of the
                  crowd, importance of result to either club, strength of
                  ’away’ following, absence of other games in the area,
                  whether or not a ’derby’ fixture, press coverage.

        Pre..Match Plannlng

1.7     Depending on the fixture football matches wtll tnvolve the use of
        various branches of the Force (the mounted, traffic, special
        constabulary, etc.).      It is important that the officer
        responsible for policing the match determines the pre-match
        planntng in the light of the Intelligence at hand. In many cases
        an officer w111 be delegeted the planning task and it is
        recommended that as a routine the planning officer, intelligence
        officer and the officer in charge of policing the match confer to
        analyse ’intelligence’ and detemtne tactics.

        Use of ’J~ay’ Officers (Spotters)

1.8     The use of ’spotters’ from the Force area from which fans are
        travelling to ’away’ games may be of benefit, but there are
        difficulties, particularly if the officers travel with the
        supporters. A distinction has to be drawn between, on the one
        hand, routine ’spotters’ who seek to provide regular intelligence
        to the ’home’ Force and, on the other, covert intelligence
        gathering.
1.g     In the fomer case it is recommended that arrangements be made
        beforehand with the ’home’ poltce;      that the officersdo not
        travel with the vtstttng supporters, as poltce officers; that they
        report to and ltaise with the "home’ poltce to asstst with
        intelligence. Whenever possible their role should be solely to
        provide Intelligence and not to be directly tnvolved in the
        policing.

I .10   In the latter case (covert operations) it is important that a
        means of contact be established prior to the game and that the
        officers handling the coenunlcatlons, and the officer in charge
        of the game, know exactly what arrangements have l~made.

                                                                              64
              Briefing

       1.11   Officers should receive a full briefing prior to taking up their
              duties which should include after match arrangements and clear
              instructions as to booking off. Where practicable such briefings
              should be carried out on site. In large scale police operations
              the operational commander should brief a11 officers not below the
              rank of Inspector, and Inspectors should be responslble for
              briefing officers of the rank of Sergeant and Constable.
       1.12   In accordance with the ’Popplewe11’ recommendations the briefing
              must include evacuation procedures and the duties and
              responsibilities of stewards should be brought to the attention
              of police officers (see Duties of~Stowards - paragraph 3.1 et.
              seq.).

]      1.13   Briefing cards may prove advantageous, particularly when officers
              are unfamiliar with the routines of policing footba11. Where
              officers are unfamillar they should~be provided with a map of the
 !            ground and its immediate environs identifying ’home’ and ’away’
              sections of the ground and the numbers or letters used by the
              club, so that they can answer questions for supporters.
       1.14   Briefing should pay particular attention to policy and practice
              as to searching, arrest and ejection and officers must know where
              to take prisoners.     Intelligence: as to likely offenders and
              common practices of disturbance should be carefully outlined.
              Supervisors in particular need to know the ground commanders
              ’public order strategy’.
-q
J      1.15   Copies of evacuation procedures and any briefing cards or other
              information passed out in documentary form during briefing should
              be available within the ’police control’.
       1.18   Ground regulations, which have natlonal application, should be
              brought to notice as follows:-

17.   All persons entering this ground are admitted only
      subject to the above Ground Regulations and to the Rules

                                                                     66
              18.       The Club reserves the right for its servants and agents
                        to remove from this ground any person who does not comply
                        with Ground Regulations and with the Rules and

                        reasonably be construed as constituting a source of
                        danger, nuisance or annoyance to other spectators.
              Away Supporters

      1.17    Intelligence offtcers should provide clear Instructions to coach
              operators as to routes and parking facilities.      Car and coach
              parks should be clearly signed and a poltce presence maintained
              to ensure security and prevent interference.     The presence of
              police at such locations may also enable the early gathering of
              intelligence on the numbers and behavtour of vtstttng supporters.
      1.18    Zt may be prudent for police to escort supporters from coach
              parks to the sports stadium in order to ensure that they do not
              become the subject of, nor engage in, hooltgantm.     St~larly,
  !           railway stations should be monttoredby poltce and supporters
  i
              escorted to the stadium Where the match ts to be played. Close
              liatson wtth British Transport Poltce is recommended. Most fans
              are famlltar with escort arrangements and Where possible poltce
  t           should stick to routines which become familiar.

      1.19    After a match coaches leaving the area may require a poltce
              escort until they are away from trouble.

              Flashpotnts
      I .ZO   Special attention should be given to any public house or other
              unofficial assembly point, and to the routes taken in general by
  |           supporters where confrontation between rtval fans may occur.
  !           Also attention should be given to waste ground and dereltct
              property along any such routes where ~sstles or offensive
              weapons may be gathered by hooligans.    Bridges have often been
              used by hooligans and should be monitored.

              Stadium Searches

      I .Z1   Before spectators are admitted into the stadium a physical search
              should be made of the ground and terraces by the officer in
              charge of poltctng the game to ensure that all fences and gates
              are sufficiently secure and that no objects which may be used as
              offensive weapons or mt sstles are to hand. There should be an
              arrangement wlth the club for an official to be available when
              the inspection is carried out to put right anything which is
              amiss.
              Entry Into the Ground
i
      1.2Z    Approaches to the ground are themselves flashpotnts and need to
              be well monitored. Careful planning to co-ordlnato as far as
              possible the routes taken by different groups of supporters to
              relevant turnstiles may reduce the opportunity of conflict.

            ] .23   Clear marking of turnstiles is essential          and all officers on
                    football duties should be briefed as              to the segregation
                    arrangements.

            1,24    The searching of spectators depends on circumstances. The tems
                    of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act afford a right of search
                    only where there are grounds to suspect an offence is being
                    committed, and the suspicion must relate directly to the person
                    searched.   The Codes of Practice, however, exempt the need to
                    make customary records if in the circumtances it is not
                    practicable to do so.    Ground regulations reserve the right of
                    the club to decline admission to any person who refuses to be
                    searched by a police officer, and this may a11ew for routine
                    searching on entry to grounds, but police officers need to know
                    the limits of this provision. Refusal to be searched may entail
                    a refusal to allow entry.

            1.25    Within the limitations officers should seek to prevent supporters
                    entering the ground with weapons, missiles, flag poles etc.

            1.26    Drunkenness is recognfsed as a major cause of hooliganism and
                    supporters may attenq)t to enter sports grounds whilst in a
                    drunken condition or carrying alcohol. Where the conditions of
                    the Sporting Events’ (Control of Alcohol Etc.) Act, 1985, apply
                    the provisions should be enforced.   The main conditions are as
                    follews:-

                    (a)     Section 2(la) and (lb)     -   It ts an offence for any
                            person to have Intoxicating liquor or an ’article’ to

                  Exclusion Orders

           1.28   The Public Order Act, 1986, also gives the courts power to make
                  an exclusion order to prevent a person convicted of certain
                  offences attending a football match. The court can make an order
                  of conviction where:-
                  (a)    The person has been convicted of an offence which fulfils
                         one or more of the following conditions:-

                          (i)        The offence was committed during any period
                                     relevant to a prescribed football match whtle the
                                     accused was at, or entering or leaving or trying
                                     to enter or leave, the ground concerned.

                         (ii)        The offence was committed going to or from a
                                     match and:-
                                     (1)       involved the use of threat of violence
                                               by the accused to another person;

                                     (2)       involved the use of threat of violence
                                               towards property;
                                     (3)       was committed under Section 5 of the
                                               Act.

                         (iii)       The offence was committed under Section 1(3) or 4
                                     or 1A(3) or (4), Sporting Events’ (Control of
                                     Alcohol Etc.) Act, 1985. These are the offences
                                     of possessing alcohol travelling to or from a
                                     footha11 match.

                  (b)     No exclusion order may be made unless the court is
                          satisfied that making such anorder in relation to the
                          accused would help to prevent violence or disorder at or
                          in connection with prescribed football matches.

 J
                  (c)     An exclusion order may only be made in addition to a
                          sentence,   probation order or discharge,   following
                          conviction, i.e. it does not apply to person brought
                          before the court to be bound over under Section 115,
...J                      Magistrates’ Court Act, 1980.
                          If these conditions are satisfied, the court may make an
-,S
                          order "prohibiting him from entertng any promises for the
                          purpose of attending any prescribed football match
                          there,"
           1.29   A crucial factor in the enforcement of orders is the availability
                  of photographs of those subject to them. Section 35 of the Act,
                  makes provision for the court, on application of the prosecution,
                  to order a photograph to be taken.      However, where possible,
                  persons arrested for any offence which might result in the
                  impoLition of an order shoUld be photographed at the time of


       r
       i                                                                                 69
                                                                                #
           charging. Photographs taken at this time are likely to be of
           more value for subsequent identification purposes than those
           taken at or following a court appearance.
    1.30   Photographs which should conform to the following specifications
           should be affixed to each police copy of an exclusion order:-
           (a)    Standard passport size 2" x 2".

           (b)    To be in colour.

           (c)   To be in single aspect three quarter profile or full face.

           (d)    Polaroid photographs are NOT recommended for this purpose.

    1.31   Photographs held for the purpose of enforcing exclusion orders
           are for police officers only and must not be circulated to any
I
T
           other person.

    1.32   Wherever an order is made, copies, together with photographs
           should be forwarded to the Chief Officer of Poltce for the area
           where the offender lives and to the Chief Officer of Pollce for
           the area(s) in which any club he is known to support is situated.
           It is recommended that any photographic negative also be
           forwarded to the lattor.

    1.33   Circulation of information relating to Exclusion Orders        is
           incorporated into the football match intelligence system.

    1.34   Football Liaison Officers wtll maintain schedules, together with
           photographs of those subject to orders who are known to support
           their club.   Prior to each match, com@lete schedules should be
           forwarded to the away team liatson officer. Schedules should be
           returned after each match, together with the coe@letod football
           match summry form.

    1.35   These schedules and photographs will be of particular importance
           to those officers operating C.C.T.V. equipment, When scanning
           crowds during the course of the game or when viewing videos of
           disorder after the event, operators will be able to check the
           crowd against the photographs.
    1.36   Where weight of numbers of those subject to orders makes the
           supplying of full schedules impracticable, circulation should be
           restricted to targetted hard core offenders.

    1.37   Liaison officers will need to maintain several schedules of
           orders to cater for midweek games, late returns, etc.,

    1.38   Where an individual first came to notice after 31.12.80, as
           indicated by h ts C.R.O. number, suffix informtton relating to
           exclusion orders wtll be maintained on the P.N.C. within the
           subjects convictions file.

    1.39   In certain circumstances, c~fences which might lead to the
           i~osttion of exclusion orders are not reportable to the N.I.B.
           Therefore, where an Individual has no P.N.C. record, or first
           came to notice pr!or to 1.1.81 or where there.ts any other reason



                                                                               70

          to believe an individual is subject to an exclusion order, a
          check should be made with hts home Force.

          NoB,   Where an order has been in force for a period of 1Z
                 months, application can be made to the court for the
                 termination of the order. Details of Termination Orders
                 will not be shown on the P.N.C.

Entrance to the Ground
1.40     Stadium entrances must be signed to indicate clearly the stands
         and terraces to be used by home and visittng supporters.
1,41     Officers with local knowledge should be posted to turnstiles to
         prevent supporters entering a section of the stadium allocated to
         supporters of the opposing team.        When possible, the same
         officers should be regularly used at locations considered to be
         of particular importance, e.g. main entrance, points of potential
         trouble etc.
1.42      It is emphaslsed that effective turnstile policing ts the key to
          prevention of disorder inside the ground.     Officers should be
          encouraged to talk to those waiting to enter in order to identify
          non-local accents, drunks, etc.

I ,43     Queues forming at turnstiles should be closely monitored by
          poltce and stewards.   It is recommended that mounted officers,
          where available, are used for this purpose.       There ts often
          frustration at turnstiles if queues remain after the game has
          started. Orderly control wtll mtntmise the risks.

1.44      All ticket matches also need turnstile control as supporters in
          possession of tickets for a particular section of the ground may
          seek to gain entry to another section of the ground, which could
          result in some sections of the ground exceeding the limit
          specified tn the safety certificate. Where lindts are critical
          police should make arrangements to monitor turnstile counts.

1.45     Htgh interest ’all ticket’ fixtures have the effect of generating
         a black market in tickets and ’touting!.        This will ltkely
         undemtne segregation.     Itis therefore recommended that some
         section of the ground be set apart to accommodate identified fans
         who support one side and have tickets for opposing supporters’
         area.    If circumstances warrant tt ’ticket touts’ should be
         arrested, and efforts made to discover where the tickets came
         from. For all ticket games every effort most be made to tighten
         up the sales procedure to assist segregation policy, preferably
         by restricting sale of tickets to those attending home ftxtures
         and selling tickets within the ’home~ enclosures.

          Team Managers, Referees and Llnesln

1.46      All officials concerned tn controlling the game should be aware
          of the police action that wtll be taken tf there ts any invasion
          of the playtng pitch, or serious disorder occurring within the
          crowd. All officials concerned tn contrelling the ganm should be
          aware of any planned emergency procedure that maybe "taken tn the
          even~ of an emergency or bomb threat.


                                                                              71
    1.47   The conduct of players on the field can have a marked impact on
           crowd behaviour.     Particularly where the fixture is judged
           volatile the club should be encouraged to arrange for players to
           leave the tunnel together and to shake hands at the end of the
           game.   They may also be reminded of the importance of good
           behaviour on the pitch.    It rests with the match commander to
           take up with the club any misbehavtour by players.

           Ent.ertat ment
    1.48   The club should be encouraged to provtde some form of
           entertainment to take place during the half hour preceding kick
           off, for example bands, displays and recorded music.     A good
           ’announcer’ using the public address system can establish a
           rapport with the crowd and influence behavtour. Thought should
           be given to liaist ng with ’announcers’      to make suitable
           interventions if appropriate. Thts means may be used to advise
           ’away’ supporters as to arrangements for their leaving the
           ground, changed travel instructions etc.

           Crowd Dtsl~tbutt ons

    1.49   It is emphastsed that stewards should ensure that all sections of
           terraces and stands are ftlled to capacity before allowing access
           to further sections where possible. This wtll require monitoring
           turnstile totalisers and the use of publtc address systems in
           some instances.    This operation is greatly assisted by the
           comparmentaltsatlon of grounds, each compartment being filled in
           sequence.

           SegregaUoa

    1.50   Home and visiting supporters should be segregated inside the
           stadium by means of segregation fencing and/or sterile zones, and
           steps should be taken to impose segregation before they enter and
           after they leave the stadium.       Each section of the stadium
           designated for the use of particular supporters should have its
           own toilet and refreshment facilities. Barriers and doors should
           be provided so as to segregate home and visiting supporters and
           thus avoid confrontation at entrances/exits,      Experience has
           shown that policing segregated areas is best achieved by placing
           officers ’inside’ the segregation if this is possible.

           Stewards
    1.51   Good liaison between stewards and police should be established.
           (See Duties of Stewards - paragraph 14.1 et. seq.) The officer
           in charge of the match should make periodic inspections of
           stewarding standards and report results to the club’s management.
           The poltce control must be able to contact the Chief Steward and
           Head Ftre Steward at all times.

           Disposition of Hanpouer

    1.52   Where no pitch perimeter fence exists a presence may be required
           by poltce and stewards tn order to tsolate the playtng area. In
           such circumstances police .officers should take up standing
           positions away from and facing )the crowd Hen incidents occur to


%
                                                                               72
                      arouse the crowd. Where fencing has been erected police officers
                      and stewards must have keys for the gates and a universal locking
                      system should be used.      Pitch perimeter gates should remain
                      unlocked and manned at all times the public have access to the
                      ground.
               1.53   All bars, refreshment and toilet areas should be poltced in order
                      to prevent hooliganism occurring.

               1.54   At the conclusion of the match consideration should also be given
J                     to deploying police in appropriate areas to mtntmise a sudden
                      stampede or pushing within the crowd in their endeavour to leave
                      the stadium quickly,

                      Police Reserves
-I             1.55   A number of police officers should generally be held tn reserve
J                     in order to deal with spontaneous incidents occurring inside, or
                      immediately outside the stadium.

  !                   Persons Arrested or ~ected From the Ground
               1.56   Ejection is an option which can be used    where behaviour is poor,
     i                but falls short of an actual offence        (e.g. contravention of
_J                    ground regulations). However, ejection     should not be used as an
                      alternative to arrest; where there is       sufficient evidence the
                      offender should be arrested and charged.
     !

               1.57   It is recommended, where possible, that tn violent situations
                      police officers tn groups should enter the affected section of
                      the stadium from above the incident, making arrests where
                      necessary, and then making their way onto the perimeter of the
                      pitch. Officers should not enter from the perimeter if this can
                      be avoided. Arrest operations should be planned and controlled
                      to avoid officers being isolated or overwhelmed.

               1.58   A standard procedure should be adopted with regard to arrests and
 /
 t                    ejections.   Prisoners should be taken to a forward reception
                      point where detatls are recorded (Including ejections), and
                      prisoners photographed together with arresting officer.
               1.5g   Persons ejected from the ground or supporters who are not
                      admitted for whatever reason should be carefully poltced.
                      Experience indicates that such persons often gain further entry
                      to the ground either at half time or Immediately before the end
                      of the match, and provoke confrontation.

               1.60   In the event of a footha11 match generating a large number of
                      arrests, it is worth considering bailing prisoners to spectal
                      courts in order that Magistrates may be fully aware of all the
                      circumstances appertaining to the events of that game.      Early
.-J                   liaison with the Crown Prosecution Service is advisable to inform
                      them of the intention to hold special courts, tn order that they
                      can be fully acquainted with the background facts.

              Contingency Planning

      I .61   Pre-determined plans should be available to control such

m             contingencies as serious disorder, pitch incursion and locked out
              spectators. Because of the great divergence in ground and crowd
              factors these plans must be ground specific.       However, these

is]           plans    must   take   into   consideration    the   ’Popplewe11’
              recommendations with regard to the transmission of coded messages
              over the public address system, the availability of emergency
              telephones and a faciltty for the police to intercept the public
at]           address system.

              Emergency Evacuation

it]   I .6Z   Stewards mst be familiar with the action to be taken in the
              event of an evacuation of the whole or part of the stadium.
              Police should assist in the rapid evacuation of a stadium in such
at            circumstances. Stadia should have a universal locking system and
              all stewards should be in possession of keys for the exit gates.
              They should wear a distinctive tabard or other means of easy
              identification.     It must be made clear to both the club
              management and to the individual stewards that they must not
              leave their post without being relieved. It is essential that
              exit gates can be opened without delay in the event of an
              emergency.    Simulated emergency evacuation exercises for the
              staff employed by the club must be held at least twice each
              season to test the emergency evacuation procedure. The crowd
              will not be involved but depending upon circumstances it could be
              an advantage to explain to the crowd that an emergency evacuation
              exercise is taking place. Experience has revealed that in an
              actual evacuation it is essential to monitor exit doors when the
              crowd has left the stadium to prevent them wandering back into
              the stadium before the reason for the evacuation has been
              completed.
              Retention of Vistttng Supporters

      1.63    In some circumstances the officer in charge may decide to hold
              the visiting supporters tn the ground until he considers it
              appropriate to release them.  If such a tactic is employed then
              the situation will be greatly eased if the visiting fans are kept
              informed.
              Early Re-Oeployment of Poltce Offtcers

      1.64    Police officers should be deployed outside the ground, in key
              positions, early enough to be seen in these positions by the
              crowd as tt leaves the ground. Thts gives an appearance of good
              order and poltce control. At crtttcal points the use of poltce
              officers in groups under the Command of a sergeant should be
              considered.    The effective after-match deployment of police
              officers is dependent on the pre-match briefing and allocation of
              tasks.

              Vehicular and Pedestrian Traffic

      I .55   At.the end of the game early dispersal of supporters ts clearly
              beneficial. Host Poltce Forces wtll develop a traffic control


                                                                              74

             plan to facilitate this. Particular attention should be given to
             routes used by ’away) supporters. Supporters who are not local
             must always be able to find coaches where they got off them and
             generally it is good practice to convoy and escort coaches away
 J           from the general area.    Hany grounds are in heavily built-up
             areas of old industrial towns and it is extremely difficult to
  f          move police resources in the immediate aftermath - it is
 i
.J           therefore essential to detail traffic and public order duties
             beforehand.

             Bus, Ratlvay and Hatn .Line Stations

      1.66   Foot patrol and mounted officers (in liaison with British
             Transport Police) should be used to control queues and prevent
             rowdyism occurring. Large groups of supporters should generally
             be escorted on to the station and, mere necessary, British
             Transport Police may wish to consider travelling with supporters
             untll they are dispersed.
             Oe-Brteflng of Sentor Offtcers

      1.67   In the event of inadequacies being exposed in the police
             operation, at the conclusion ofthe match there should be a
             de-briefing of supervisory officers.

                Travel by British Rail - Liaison with British Transport Police

         2.13   British Transport Police policy is to segregate football
                supporters from ordinary passengers as far as practicable. To
                achieve this, pricing and other policies have been introduced in
                an attempt to encourage supporters to travel in the following
                order of preference:-
                (a)       Charter Trains or Carriages

                These trains are not normally accompanied by British Transport
                Police.   The chartering club MUST arrange for insurance and
                stewards, and accept responsibility for any damage which may
                occur on the train.

                (b)       British Rail Sponsored Trains

                These are special trains used for the exclusive carriage of
                football fans and which should always have a British Transport
                Police escort.

                (c)       Schedule Services
                Encouragement being given to organised party travel.   Such trains
                are policed on an "as required’ basis.

                Each E.C. Country has a permanent correspondent with whom contact

 2.15    The responsibility for preventing and dealing with incidents of
         hooliganism on trains carrying supporters of footha11 clubs to
         and from matches lies primarily with the British Transport Police
         and they should be given full co-operation and assistance.

2.16    If disturbances involving travelling supporters have taken place
        during the game or outside the ground afterwards, particularly if
        arrests have been made, it is usually an indication that trouble
        may be expected on trains carrying supporters home.           Any
        incidents which may have a bearing on the behaviour of supporters
        travelling by train should be reported as soon as possible to the
        local office or Headquarters control room of the British
        Transport Police.

2.17    For their part, the British Transport Police w111 inform the
        local police at the teminal station and, if necessary, at any
        stopping point on the route when hooliganism breaks out on the
        train or if they have any reason to suspect hooliganism is likely
        to occur either on the train or at the terminal station.

2.18    The British Transport Poltce send by telex detatls of the timings
        of all spectal and charter trains to Police Forces covering the
        departure and terminal stations and those en route.

        Football Trains Etc., Ban on Alcohol

2.19    The Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol Etc.) Act, 1985, as
        amended by The Public Order Act, 1986, prohibits alcohol on a
        vehicle which:-

        (a)     is a public service vehtcle, or not a public service
                vehtcle but adapted to carry more than eight passengers
                (i.e. minibus), or a railway passenger vehtcle, and

        (b)     is being used for the principle purpose of carrying
                passengers for the whole or part of a journey to or from
                a designated sporting event.

2.20    A bye-law made by the British Rat1 Board under Section 67 of The
        Transport Act, 1965, in effect bans alcohol from any train in

           The Effect of Safety Certtftcatos Issued Under the Safety at
           Sports Grounds Act, 1975
 n


     3.1   A level of control is provided by the Safety at Sports Grounds’
           Act, 1975, at those grounds which are required to be certified.
           The Local Authority, before issuing a Safety Certificate, is
           required to consult the Chief Officer of Police regarding the
           terms and conditions to be included in the certificate.
J    3.2   Whilst police do not dtrectly control the employment of stewards
           at foot~a11 grounds, it should be accepted that there is a
           responsibility, within the wider context of publtc safety, to
           exert influence to ensure that the arrangements made by the
           management of the ground are adequate in thts respect.     It is
           most important that stewards are sufficient in number, suitably
 )
           deployed, well trained and capable mentally and physically of
           carrying out their routine and emergency functions.        It is
           recommended that the poltce regularly tnspect stowardtng
           arrangements to detemine they are in accord with certification.

           Identification and Supervts|em

     3.3   Persons employed as stewards at football grounds should be
           clearly identifiable, wearing coloured tabards. They should at
           all times be under the direct control of supervisors whose
           identities should be made known to the police officers on duty at
           the ground and who should be in contact with the Poltce Control.
     3.4   Stewards should be distributed throughout the ground in
           accordance with a detailed pre-arranged schedule, agreed between
           the police and management of the ground.

     3.5   Their duties may be divided into four main categories:-

           (a)      controlling or directing members of the public who are
                    entering or leaving the football ground;

           (b)      patrolling the ground to deal with any emergencies, e.g.
                    raising alams, extinguishing fire, etc.;

           (c)      manning entrances, exits and other strategic points,
                    particularly exit doors, and gates which are not
                    continuously open whilst the ground is in use;

           (d)      undertaking specific duties relattng to emergency and
                    evacuation procedures.
     3.6   In accordance with the ’Popplewell, recomendattons all stewards
           should:-
           (a)      be trained and instructed to deal wtth any emergency
                    relating to ftre or evacuation;

           (b)      be given written tnstructtbns about the action to be
                    taken in cases of emergency;



                                                                               81
        (c)    receive practical instruction and training appropriate to
               their responsibility;
       (d)     not be employed as a steward unless they have been so
               instructed and trained;

       (e)     be adequate in number, physically and mentally capable of
               perfoming     their    duties,   effectively     deployed,
               effectively supervised and readily identifiable.

       Emergency Procedures - Stewards Role
3.7    Fomal emergency procedures at each ground require joint
       consultation between police, the management of the ground, fire,
       ambulance and other services.

3.8    It is essential that stewards and their supervisors are fully
       aware of th part they have to play tn the plans which are
       produced,   eThe management of the ground should ensure that
       written instructions concerning the action to be taken in the
       event of an emergency are made readily available to all staff and
       stewards and, in particular, that all the staff and stewards
       should receive practical instruction and training appropriate to
       their responsibilities in the event of an emergency. Exercises
       for the staff and stewards should be carried out regularly to
       ensure the smooth operation of the procedure for dealing with an
       emergency.

3.9    A record should be kept by the club authorities containing
       details of the training and instruction given and the exercises
       held, and should include the following matters:-

       (a)    date and time of the instruction or exercise;
       (b)    duration;
       (c)    name of the person giving the instructions;

       (d)    nams of the persons receiving the instructions;

       (e)    nature of instruction or exercise.
       Consideration should be given to the inclusion of           these
       conditions in any safety, or special safety certificate.

3.10   After initial practical instruction all members of staff and
       stewards should receive verbal instruction, given by a conpetent
       person, at least once in every period of three months at regular
       intervals. Stewards should be given briefing cards relevant to
       particular points.




                                                                            82

        POLICING FACILITIES AT FOOTBALL GROUNI}S
 4.1    There are marked differences in the facilities provided by clubs
       and it must remain a matter for local negotiation between police
       and clubs as to the standard of facilities, bearing in mind
       average attendance and a need for police presence.          It is
       recommended that General Safety Certificates are reviewed on an
       annual basis in an effort to achieve continuing improvement.
       Prisoner Reception Point Within the Ground

4.2    It is considered essential that a prisoner reception point should
       be available at the ground.     The office should be sited, .tf
       possible, so that there ts adequate access for the unobtrusive
       removal of prisoners. There should be either a G.P.O. telephone
       line or a direct line to the nearest poltce station. Ideally the
       ~olice accommodation should have two detention rooms to separate
         home’ and ’away’ supporters.

       Paradtng andBrteftng
4.3    It is desirable that police officers to be deployed in the ground
       are briefed on site.   Thts can usually be done under cover tn
       most grounds. A standardtsed form of stadium grtd reference used
       by police and club personnel wtll facilitate briefing and
       evacuation.
       C~t~rol
4.4     It is desirable, and in some cases essential, that a control room
        is provided to oversee poltce operations in the ground.
       Provision should be made for a base station to control the U.H.F.
       police radio.     It should have a direct access to the ground
       publtc address system and either a G.P.O. or direct talephone
       line to the local police station, and the poltce office within
       the ground. The room should be of adequate stze to accommodate
       C.C.T.V. monitors and ancillary equipment. It is desirable to be
       able to operate, in addition, htgh intensity 11ghttng systems
       from the poltce control which may be switched on when there ts
       trouble or emergency.

4.5    The control room should be sited to give an over vtew of the
       ground and to allow the match poltce commander ready access from
       the ’touch line’.
4.6    The costs of the provision of the police office and control room
       and facilities should be borne by the club. The poltce generally
       provide radio communication and additional items such as loud
       hailers and binoculars.

4.7    Safety at Sports Grounds) Act, 1975, by providing for
       consultation between the local authority and police (Section
       3(III)) on conditions to be included on safety certificates has
       had ~d clear effect on improving ground facilities. Full use
       shou       be made of these provisions to ensure adequate police
       facilities.

             C.C.T.V. AND STXLL PHOTOGRAPHY

      4.8    The guidance offered in this section is intended to assist
             Commanders having operational      responsibility for policing
             football.   It is not a definitive work and should be read in
             conjunction with the report of the A.C.P.O. Working Party,
             entitled, ’Use of Video and Sttll Photography.

             Introduction

      4.9    The use of C.C.T.V. and still photography as an aid to the
             effective policing of football is a recent development. At the
             present time, all First and Second Division football grounds are
             provided with static video cameras and recording facilities,
             which enable the police to monitor crowd behavtour within and in
             the immediate vicinity of stadia.        Xt is anticipated that
             videoing facilities will be extended to all Third and Fourth
             Oivsion 9rounds in the near future but not necessarily of the
             same type as in the two higher Divisions.

             The quality of the equipment and re-production of image presently
             available in football grounds ts now always compatible with tts
             adequate presentation before the courts, and its use has resulted
             in some confusion between its function in relatton to ’command
             and control’ and to evidence gathering.       Experience to date
             indicates the greatest value lies in developing a system for the
             use of C.C.T.V. and sttll photography within stadia for the
             purposes of intelligence and evidence gathering.

             All systems at present in use at football grounds are capable of
             being enhanced and developed.    When these changes are made it
J            should be ensuredthat the replacement equipment ts of sufficient
             standard that the quality of recording is such as to be
             acceptable for use as evidence in court.

             Accepting the need for identification and evidence gathering for
             prosecution to be the primary function of the system, the
             following points are worthy of consideration tn the use of
             development of existing and anticipated facilities.

             Technical Considerations
..J

      4.10   Ca)   At the time of Installation, consideration should be given
                   to the siting of cameras and cables so as to prevent
                   interference or damage.

             (b)   As good video recording requires gocd light and as most
                   football fixtures are played during winter months, the
                   need for adequate l~ghttng within and around football
                   stadia is essential to eliminate areas of darkness which
                   may be used as cover for disorderly behavtour. Fans are
                   increasingly aware that such behavtour is monitored by
                   C.C.T.V. and they wtll attempt to evade detection by
                   seeking whatever cover ts available.     It ts therefore
                   important that cameras are sited in such a way as to
                   mtntmtse blind spots and that facilities are provided to
                   increase lighting intensities tn stands, etc." The siting
                   of video cameras should take account of sloping roofs, to
 _j




  J

                                                                                 ¯84
                     enable recording at the rear of stands. This problem can
                     be    overcome  by   the   use   of   hand-hel d  cameras.
                     Consideration must be given to all foreseeable problems
                     that may affect the performance of video equipment,      A
                     good example that is easily overlooked is the path of the
                     setting sun. A video camera would be ineffective if the
                     sun was shining directly into the lens.
                     Pollce Control Rooms contain valuable equipment and are
                     often vulnerable. Consideration should be given to taking
                     protective measures to increase security.
             (d)     Control Rooms should be placed i        a position which
                     commands a good all round view nof the ground and
                     consideration should be given to plactng the video
                     monitors in such a position that the operator is not
                     distracted by activities within the ground.
            (e)     Careful consideration to the type of 11ghting and the
                    provision of glass partitions should be given to prevent
|
i
                    reflection or distortion.    The Control Room should have
                    adequate background heating to protect the electrical
                    equipment and for the comfort of personnel employed within
                    the room.   Heating should remain switched on 24 hours a
                    day during cold weather.

            (f)     The use of flash equipment in the vicinity of sensitive
                    video cameras may damage the tube t f discharged facing the
                    camera. Even if this damage is not pemanent, the video
                    camera would be unable to function for some time.      As a
                    general rule flash equipment should not be used in the
                    vicinity of operating video cameras.
            (g)     Police Control Rooms must be provided with multi-recording
                    facilities in order that the opportunity exists to capture
                    all incidents which may occur in different areas within
                    the stadium.

                    Operational Considerations
    4.11   (a)      It is important that police officers are made aware that
                    their actions in dealing with disorderly behavtour within
                    the stadium will also be recorded on C.C.T.V.

           (b)     Consideration should be given to the preparation of a
                   ground specific video, to be used in briefing officers who
                   may not be fmlliar with the stadium,

           (c)     It is important whenever posstble to use the same
                   personnel in police ground contrel room operations. They
                   will more readtly identify regular troublemkers and
                   )target’ them within the ground. Over a period of time
                   they will develop similar abllltles       In   relation   to
                   vl sl tlng supporters.
           (d)      Immediately fol lewtng a ftxture where arrests for
                   misconduct have occurred, arresting offtcers "should be
                   ~11eyed an opportunlty’to view any .recording of the



                                                                                  85
                                                                                      l


                 incidents     concerned   to establish   (1)   the evidence   for
                 their arrest and (2) whether the offender has committed
                 any further acts not witnessed by the arresting officer.
                 Intelligence Gathering

#.12   (a)       Away fans arriving at grounds may be videoed as they come
                 through turnstiles, get off buses or leave railway
                 stations. This helps with identification and the tracing
                 of those responsible for causing trouble. It also makes
                 the fans aware that they are on record.
                 When grounds are full, the crowd may be ftlmed all round,
                 so that if trouble starts, identification will be
                 assisted. It will also make the crowd aware that they are
                 on record. To assist this procedure, it is always useful
                 to have identification marks around the ground so that the
                 fans’ location within the stadium can be pin-pointed with
                 accuracy.
       (b)       Some clubs have followings from areas of the country many
                 miles from their home base.       Therefore, when it is
                 necessary to identify persons from the crowd, photographs
                 and video recordings should be circulated to Forces who
                 have supporters~ clubs of that particular football club in
                 their area.
       (c)       Each Force should c~ile sets of photographs and/or
                 videos of its own clubs’ hooligans and either (i) forward
                 on such compilation to each Force that ts ltkely to host
                 the club during the forthcoming season, or (tt) one such
                 compilation be taken to each away game by officers
                 travelling with the club’s supporters.

                 Each host Force should supply the visiting team’s home
                 Force with photographs and video recordings of the
                 visiting team’s supporters, if their conduct is such as to
                 warrant this. This will keep Forces aware of how their
                 own club’s supporters behave away from home.

       (d)       Some clubs have a section of supporters who are notorious
                 for hooligan behaviour.     It would assist in future
                 investigations into serious disorder at other grounds if
                 the host Forces of these clubs prepared video recordings
                 and photographs of their hooligan element and established
                 the identity of those involved. Then by co=~artng this
                 recording and the photographs with those of the incident
                 under investigation, identification should be greatly
                 assisted.

       (e)       Known hooligans should be targetted and followed in video.
                 This requires local officers operating the video who can
                 be assisted by officers from the visiting team, s home
                 Force.
       if)       Identified   fans  displaying    consistently, aggressive
                 behaviour, not amounting to a chargeable offence on a
             "   single occasion, but who. can be identified on other video


                                                                                     86
                                                                                             I

                             recordings displaying similar conduct, should be traced
                             and charged on this evidence of system.
n


                      (g)    The video recording of a football fixture is a valuable
                             source of Intelligence which is often overlooked in the
                             absence of identified disorder.          It is strongly
          q
          i                  recommended that all video recordings be viewed for
                             intelligence purposes, and that tapes be retained until
                             the corresponding fixture in the following season has been
                             played.
                      Identt fiction
              4.13   In the event of large-scale and serious disorder at a sporting
                     fixture, there will be a need to develop a strategy to identify
                     and arrest offenders, using the evidence obtained b       video
                     recording and stt11 photography.    Practical guidance ~n thts
.3                   process is as follows:-

N                     (a)   Photographs or sttlls from video recordings should be
      #
                            displayed for public view and identification wherever
                            possible, e.g. T.V., newspapers, match programmes,
                            posters, etc.
      e

      ]              (b)    A viewing studio should be created not only for the use of
                            police officers, but for the public as well as such
                            organisations as supporters’ clubs, stewards, residents’
      !
                            associations, social workers, probation officers, etc.

          i
                     (c)     Immediately after the incident, all press photographs and
      I                     other media evidence should be obtained and statements
                            taken from those responsible for taking the photographs,
                            video recordings, etc.   Attempts should also be made to
                            obtain all amateur videos and photographs, and the
                            appropriate statements taken. All this material, together
                            with police photographs and video recordings, should then
                            form part of the viewing studio exhibits.

                     (d)    Officers from the host Force should visit the visiting
.o
                            team’s area and other areas containing supporters’ clubs
                            of the visiting team, where they should exhibit
                            photographs and video recordings for identtftatton
                            purposes as at (b) above.
o..


                     (e)    The size of the police team working on identification is
                            critical. There should be sufficient to do the work, but
                            it should be kept small enough to be cohesive.

                     (f)    The task of viewing video recordings and photographs many
                            times is tedious, therefore tt is rec__omme_.~nded that staff
                            should ’be selected who are interested in the sport
                            involved.

                     (g)    Once identified and traced, offenders should be invited to
      t
                            vlew the video recordlngs and If they am able, to
                            identify   themselves    whilst   tn   non    controversial
                            circumstances before being questioned about alleged
                            offences on video recordings and photographs.



                                                                                            87
                 (h)       Where people identify themselves in photographs, they
                           should be invited to indicate this on the reverse of the
                           photograph over their signature.
                 (i)       Consideration should be given to videoing suspects whilst
                           they are watching the recording of the incident.   Facial
                           expressions, bodily movements and verbal   exchanges may
                           form vital supporting evidence.

                  SAFETY   AT   SPORTS   GROUNDS’   ACT,   1975   -   CERTIFICATES
     5.1   The Safety at Sports Grounds’ Act, 1975, provides for the
           certification of designated football grounds specified within the
           Act, which includes all Football League and Rugby League Clubs.
           On application for certification the management of the football
 )         club concerned must satisfy the local authority that certain
 I

           legislation requires the local authority to consult with the
           Chief Constable of the area in which the ground is located
I          regarding the terms and conditions to be included before any such
           certificate can be issued.

/                        On 18 July 1988, I made an inspection of the ground
                   du~ing the time that this year’s quota of crush barriers

                        The results of the crush barrier testing are given
                   ~n a separate report of today’s date.
                           made ~ visual inspect-ion of all the main structural
                   features of ~he ground. Particular attention ~as paid to

     18.3 Access to playing pitches must be made as difficult as possible
     in normal circumstances while, at the same time, providing the
     police with proper access to the terraces for the purposes of crowd
     control and enabling the pitch to be used in the event of serious
     emergency. One alternative to fencing is the construction around
     the pitch of a wall with a smooth surface which should be not less
     than 4 feet in height on the terrace side. This boundary wall should
     have gates or access points to the pitch which could be manned
     by the police or stewards. A walkway between the boundary wall
     and the terraces, which would be solely occupied by police, first
     aid and official club personnel, has been found to be effective as
     regards safety and security. In order to achieve this, it might be
     necessary to remove one or two rows of terracing and to protect
     the walkway from the terrace by a continuous line of barriers, so
     designed as to discourage access to the walkway except at authorised
     points. The access points from terrace to walkway should be
     reasonably near the access points from walkway to the pitch. (see
     paragraph 7.9). Where a walkway system is in use, sliding gates
     may be installed at the access points from the walkway to the pitch,
     ie where there can be no crowd pressure against them. (see paragraph
     6.14.2 regarding use of sliding gates elsewhere). A barrier to the
     pitch is unnecessary where seating extends to the level of the playing
     area.

     18.4 Clubs should carefully consider their arrangements for the
     sale of alcohol. In any case all refreshments should be served in
     plastic containers.

     each of the matches and determine which should be all-ticket,
     and the allocation of tickets to the visiting club. So far as the

   distortion of connections) as to the safety of the barrier or                           O

   the results of this investigation remove the doubt as to the safety
   of the barrier or handrail, the barrier or handrail, as the case
   may be, should be deemed to have failed the test.

7. A record should be kept of all the barriers and handrails tested
   and of their performances during the tests.

     Dear Dick,
F                                      Ground Safety
                        Thank you for your letter of’21 April enclosing a copy
     of the co;~munication from Peter J. Kirby.    You will probably
     ~now that there are several of these quick acting h~Dlt devices
     on the market. We have inspected some of them and have not
     yet been convinced that any of them are foolproof and good
     value for money.    The South Yorkshire Fire Service have
     also been keeping their ears to the ground and share our view.
            The one which is proposed by Mr. Kirby sounds to me
     to be possibly dangerous. Firstly, the gate is hin~ed about
     its bottom edge and falls forward on to the pitch surround
     when the explosive bolt is released.     It has to be kept in mind
     that police walk past the gates and clearly there could be a
     risk of injury.    It is also undesirable that the crowd should
     have tO walk out over the top of the gate which would be lying
     on the ground.
            The arrangement is also likely to be very expensive as
     it would be necessary to buy completely new gates and fit them
     in the safety fence. There will also be the cost of wiring
     all the gates back to the central control point.
            It seems the device is ~nllkely to be attractive but if
                                                                                               $~E£T

d,.    Dear Mr Chester
       SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS TO LEPPINGS LANE END OF THE GROUND
       With reference to our conversation of last week regarding improv~ents
       required to the West End of the ground, I forward herewith our thoughts.

       You will see that we favour the erection of a stone wall on the gTound side
       of the current terraces, with such wall housing a bank of turnstiles. Our
       belief is that once a spectator goes through the turnstiles he should then
       be segregated from the other fans, and this can be achieved by the erection
       of permanent high metal railings on that concrete~r~esentbehind
       the Stand. Similarly, there should be a hi~"~he centre
       of the West Stand. What is then created ~total segregatlon~all three
                                                                  , with each of
       portions of the Terrace and the two are a s~f the W~t.-S~,wi~
       these segregated areas having its own refreshment and toilet facilities.

       If you have any query on these reco~endations, no doubt you will come back
       to me.
       Yours sincerely

    1.    Purpose of Heetina.

    The purpo.se of the. meeting was to carry out the "s~mer" inspection of the
    Stadium wxth partxcular reference to the Leppxnge Lane end 4mprovements and
    the metal sheeting of the upper seated area of the South Stand.

     2.    Ground Inspection.

    A.     Leppir~s Lane End

    The progress of the works to segregate visiting supporters behind and on the
    West Terrace and Stand were inspected with particular reference to the
    points raised at the Officer Working Party’s meeting held on 29th July,
    (forwarded to Hewers. East~nd and Partners by the Chief Executivets letter
    of 3Oth July) and Hewers. Eastvood a Partners reply of let August.

    Hesers. Eaettmed a Partners had confirmed that all the calculations which
    were likely to be required had nov been sent to the Building Authority for
    checking and ,-.-~ent.


     t~othe inspection,
        be the          the Building
               poor standard         Authority
                             of workmanship in pointed out tdlat of
                                               the construction  they considered
                                                                    the new
     dividing wall which was being built behind the Stand. The position of the
     Police Personnel access Kate and the stepping of the face of the wall by
     45 chamfers so as not to form footholds were acceptable.

     The foundations of the new handrail by Turnstile 23 had actually been
     aligned so as to maintain the exit width between the outer (river) vail
     and the Turnstile (unlike the indication on the plan submitted).

     As regards the single block thickness of the internal wails of the cubicles
     in the new male and female toilet facilities at the rear of the stand,
     Hesers. Eastvond and Partners considered that the inside of a toilet cubicle
     was not a very vulnerable area, and pointed out that the walls were braced
     by both the outer walls and the door frames. The Building Authority noted
     the assurances given by Dr. Eastwood. but expressed concern that the
dividing wails in the new toilet facilities evldently did. not have. any     .
foundations, apparently havlu8 been built straxght onto the exxstz.nS
concrete slabs. It was noted that there ~re some 9 inch thick brxck walks
in the 14sle Toilets, it being considered that any hooliganism or vandalism
would be more likely to occur there than in the Female Toilets.

The Club pointed out that the new toilet facilities would not be completely
finished by the first match of the season (on 17th August) but that
temporary facilities would be available and that no building material would
be left on site.

The position of the new refreshment area under the most westerly staircase
up to the North-West corner terrace was noted. This again had been built
straight onto the existing concrete slabs.

                       it vas noted that. there was an existing gate in the
On the Terrace itself,
new 2 m. wlde gap formed by the new radxal fence for use by the Polxce.     /
This gate uould stxll be evaxlable for the use of spectators xn an
emergency as the gates at the top o£ the Terrace~£ the
 olice would enablespectators to be dxrected do~~"
~agreed that steps or a longer gate would be requxred. It
was also agreed that a new gate would be required from the new South
Central Terrace Pen.

 As regards the upper seated stand area, Hessrs. Eastwood and Partners had
 sent by letter dated 2nd August plans of the new fences and barriers in
 both the Stand and at the Access level.




 (a)   that the condition of the internal vails in the new male and female
 toilet facilities at the rear of the Stand should be monitored;

  ......
  b)              ~--~-- -ate
       that one exxs~nB  ~    in the pitch
                                      .    perimeter fence should either be
                               .
 extended or have steps to provxde easxer access frcm the new 2 m. vxde gap
 formed by the new radial fence;

 (c)   that a new gate in the pitch perimeter fence should be provided from
 the new South Central Terrace Pen;

 (d)   that the advertising hoardings at the front of the upper seated stand
 area should be securely fixed to the concrete wail;

 (e)   that the spalling of the concrete of the vail at the front of the
 upper seated stand area should receive attention as shatter of maintenance;

  (f)   that the corrosion of the steel columns at the rear of the Stand
  should receive attention on a maintenance basis.

  B.    South Stand

 Hessrs. East~ood & Partners reported that the condition of the upper
 concrete outer portion of the exterior wall of the Stand had been
 investigated and was considered to be satisfactory.

  It was noted that the metal sheeting of the wooden upper portion of the
  Stand had been largely completed, and the spraying of the non-sllp
  surface was to cuuuence very shortly (and certainly be completed by the
  start of the season),
TT WAS AGREED that the metal sheetinz of the wooden upper portion of the
Stand should larselY overcome the flamability problems inherent in such
timber structures, and the Club stated that they vouEd ensure th&t the
wooden lntermsdtate steps were securely replaced upon completion of the
laytn8 of the uetal sheeting.

C.     SpionKop

Hessrs. East~ood & Partners recallad that outllne details ofthe Club’s
proposal to cover the Spion Eop had been sent for the information of the
Officer Working Party by letter dated 22nd July. As part of that scheme,
the bridse portion of the Kop would be removed. Zts present condition
remained acceptable with continuing maintenance.

In view of experiences last season, the Club were requested to provide an
additional Kate in the p~tch perimeter fence in the front corner nearest
to the South Stand to overcome the lateral crushing hazard which could
occur when larks crowds were present.

IT WAS AGREED that the Club would provide a new ~ate in the pitch perimeter
fence in the front corner nearest to the South Stand with a stepped
arransement to assist access and esress.

D.      North Stand

Tie temporary storaKe facilitzes created by the erection of a timber wall
(In front of the Ladies’ Changing Facilities in the Sports Ea11) were
 inspected.

 IT WAS AGREED that so long as liKht combustibles (such as paint) vere not
 stored in this area, its use continued to be acceptable on a temporary
 basis.

 E.     Closed Circuit Television Facilities

 The advantases for seneral crowd control and security (both in and outside
 the Stadium) which would be Kiven by the recently installed Closed Circuit
 Television System were explaimed to the Officer Working Party.

 ZT WAS AGREED:-

 (a)   that a 2] ks. (:02 Fire Extinguisher should be installed in both the
 Police Control Box and’the Disc Jockey Boz;

 (b)     that loose external vires on the outside of the Boxes should be made

              For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan

              Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                                 Safety of Sportsground Act, 1975
                                   :~:
                            Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC
                  Thank you very much for your letter of 30 July giving the
          outcome of the Working Party meeting on 29 July.         We note
          the general comment that the calcul&tions have to be approved
t
          by the BuildingSurveyors Department. We believe that all the
          calculations which are likely to be required have been sent for
          checking and comment.
                  With regard to your detailed observations our response
                                    - ~-
          is as follows ~-                            ~
           (a)    We are~not sure of the location on the West terrace of
          the proposed extra security gate. There is already a gate in-
          the 2mwide~;ga~[fo~ed by the new radial fence for use by the
          police’:~ This’:~e;*~;~: gate will still be available for the spectators
          in emergency a~’there are gates into the 2m gap from the terrace
          which will be under the control of the police.         This point may
          perhaps be clarified during the Working Party’s visit on 7 August.
          (b)              The foundations-for this fence are in fact already aligned in
                                           An Unlimited Co                         i~emd in England- N~ 18331~           -               -.-,   -:.   ¯

                   the way you suggest.
                   (c) and (d)
                          We are a little surprised by the suggestion that a
                   single block thickness is not sufficient for the cubicle
                   walls. The inside of a toilet cubicle is not a very
                   vulnerable area and the walls are braced by the door frame.
                   Stmdding is not at all suitable in terms of strength or
                   durability, and would probably invite vandalism.
                   (e)    The refreshment area is under the most westerly
                   staircase up to the north west corner terrace. There will
                   be an opportunity to inspect on 7 August.
                   (:f~-    ,-The handrail is to be at a height of 1250mm (4’i")
                   above the horizontal step, measured at the face of the vertical
                   s~ep.
                   [g~   The stepping of the face of the wall is achieved by 45°
                   c~mfers which will not form good footholds.
                   |h)    Mr. Chester says that the club will certainly not
                   ob~ect to the provision of another gate at this point, and
                                                             . .
                   the precise location can be discussed on 7 August.
                             As with point (a), we are not sure what is intended,

                   tmRem cave of by Mr. Chester.

           Purpose of Meeting

    The purpose of the meeting was to consider the detailed plans submitted by the
    letter dated 25th July from Messrs. East-wood and Partners of arrangements
    for the segregation of visiting spectators at the Leppings Lane End of the
    Hillsborough Stadium of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club. It was
    recalled that consideration of outline proposals had ta.ken place by the
    Officer Working Parry on 18rh April, 1985. Whilst formal application had been
    made for Building Regulation a~proval and some of the work had actually
    commenced, Messrs. Eastwood and Partners had apologised by ’phone that
    submission of the detailed proposaTs for Safer~ of Sports Grounds Act
    approval had apparently been overlooked due to pressure of work and staff
    holidays. The plans also incluKed dera~Is .of repairs to certain crush
    barriers on the Spion Kop ....

    IT WAS AGREED-- that, subject to the   fol!o~ring points and to the submission of
    the necessary detailed calculations    to the Building Authority, the proposals
    for segregating visiting supporters    at the Lepp~ngs Lane End of the
    Hillsborough Stadium were generallz    Acceptable:,
    (a)    Plan No. 6705/6 - for both secur£r~j access and emergency egress purposes,
    a pitch perimeter fence gate t~ be provided;
    (b)    Plan No. 670518A - the new handrail by Turnstile 23 to be either
    shortened or re-aligned so as to m-intain the exit width between the outer
    (river) wall and Turnstile 23, and the exit width between Turnstile 16 and
    the new handrail not to be less ~han the width of the roller shutter gate
    between Turnstiles 16 and 17;
    (c)    Plan No. 670519A - the s£ngIe block thickness of the interal walls
    (e.g. the cubicles) is not considered to be Subs te/ttlal enough, and a
    substantial stud partition (timber or steel --suitably faced) is felt to
    be required;

    (d)    Plan No. 6705/IOA - same co~-.ents as for plan 9A;
    (e)    Plan No. 6705/IIA- no objection £n principle, but details of exact
    location required;

    (f)    Plan No. 6705/12 - no objection in principle, but no barrier height
    indicated;
                                                                 I

    (g)    Plan No. 6705/14A - so long as increased thickness is achieved by steep
    slopes as indicated on the plan and not b~ "a~ed" arrangements to give

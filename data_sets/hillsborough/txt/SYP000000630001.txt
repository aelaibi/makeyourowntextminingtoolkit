g r o u n d , Hi 1 l s b o r o u q h ,           Sheffield,               on S a t u r d a y       150489.

The    father         of                                is a s e a s o n          ticket          holder          at     Liverpool             F.C.

and     I became           aware           on    the       Saturday            morning           that    he       had       two      spare

tickets        for        the       g ame.                        father        lives         in L i v e r p o o l .

                                                                                  I decided             to       go    to      the    match

with       some      friends,              those        I mentioned,                             and

At    1130am         on S a t u r d a y          150489           I was        picked        up    by                  and

c a r , from my            home          and     travelled              up     to S h e f f i e l d      via          the JM1

motorway.             We       di d      not     stop        on    the w a y         nor     were       we       subject            to a n y

delay       u n t i 1 we        reached Sheffield.                             Once     we       came    off          the      motorway

there       there         police           signs        followed             by P o l i c e       Officers             directing

traffic        to     the       ground.               We     arrived           in S h e f f i e l d      at a b o u t            1330      but

were       then      held       up       in t r a f f i c         queues.

Eventually            a woman              who       obviously            knew       the     area who             was       in a n o t h e r

c a r , and was            unknown              to    us,     led       us     to a     r o a d M/here we                pa r k e d .         None

of    us    were      aware           of      the     location            of    the     ground          from          t hi s     point,        but

were       directed            by t h i s        woman.            I d o n ’t k n o w            the    r o ad        n a me     where        we

parked,        one        of    the        others          may     know        it.      We       did    not       know         the    area         at

all.

After       a while            of     walking           we    encountered               crowds          of       other         people         making

their       way      to    the        ground.              There        was     no    police           direction               at    t hi s    stage,

h o w e v e r , where           we       were        p a r k e d wa s        about      a    thi r ty m i n u t e              walk       from      the

ground,       and         probably              not     close          enough        to w a r r a n t        a    police            presence.

I did       not w i t n e s s            any     d i s o r d e r , fighting                 or    drunkeness                on      our    way      to

the    ground,            but       did       see a        couple        of     pubs        w hi ch w e r e           obviously            heavily

c o n g e s t e d , as         supporters               were       stood        outside           drinking.                 All      of    the

supporters            we       saw       on     the    way        to    the     ground were              Nottingham Forest

supporters.

We    approached                the    ground          on    fo ot       from    the       north       and    eventually             came

At    this       p o in t       I witnessed               numerous          persons         gaining          unauthorised             entry

              ten     minutes              had       elapsed.                 AX' no     stage          had        I witnessed                  any       match    play,
                                                                          /

              I wa s        again          forced          bayk       to p o i n t           £ on       th e       grid and              again        managed          to

              force         my way          b a ck        %,</ p o i n t       3 marked            on    the        grid.            I wa s          obviously

              aware         of    the       danger             of    bei ng         n ea r    a fence              or    barrier             in      the    pen.

              At     no s t a g e          d id      I see          any       barriers            collapse              or    gates          be i ng       opened.

              At     this        ti me      the       pressure                seemed         to    ease        a    little           and        I thought

              something               was       being          done       about        the        congestion.                   I was           then^able          to

              move     my        limbs          a    little          whi ch         I had         not    been able                to       previously.                 This

              lasted         for a b o u t            thirty          seconds           and        then        the       pressu/e               r e t ur n e d very

              suddenly.

              Othe r than                 the       aforementioned                   white         lad, I d y ^ n o t                    see      anyone         else       in

I was        having          extreme              breathing            difficulties             and after             about        3-4

minutes           I became             uri/oncious.                  I h ad     just      given        up,      I ha d      fought        for

I    was     going          to    die.

At     no    stage          during           these        probiems           di d    I he a r a n y > ^ n n o u n c e m e n t s          made.

The     next          thing       I recall              was     to     some     extent         regaining           consciousness                  in

th e    corner          of       the     pitch          by West         a n d Soutjy s t a n d s .              I have        no    idea      ho w

long        I had       been        unconcious                 for at        thi/s s t a g e .        Shortly after                 I passed

ou t    again          and       next        regained           concija'usness            in    the       gymnasium a r e a .

I can        r et a i l      seeing           a     numbsax— -tff^peopie              laid      out       near     to me,          after      I

had     found my             s el f      on       the     pitch,        and     saw     them        receiving           treatment           or

attention              from       other           people.            There     were       about       f ou r     of     them,       whi te

males        b e t w e e n 30 and                 40    y e a r s , of       stout      to     heavy       buiIds        with       bee r

guts.            I think          they        were        d e a d , or       died     w h i 1st      I was       on     the    pitc h.

The     people          r ende r i ng             first-aid            were     mostly         in    civilian           clothing,           but

I did        see       at    lea st          on e      uniformed          fi r s t - a i d e r .      These        are      vague

during           this       time.

At     no    stage          did     I witness              anything           which       I. w o u l d     consider           to    be a

crim ina 1 offence                     and        I cannot           really         comment         on h o w     the     incident          was

handled           after          the    match           was     stopped         because         I was        uncons c io u s .

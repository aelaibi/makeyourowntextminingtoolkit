Dear Sir

Availability o f Access to Hillsborough Documentation

Our latest efforts to view the material deposited in the House of Commons Library following
Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s “Scrutiny” have again proved to be unsuccessful.

The documentation appears to be crucial to our campaign. However, despite requests to the
Home Office and Merseyside M P’s, it has been extremely difficult to establish what was
placed in the Library, when it arrived, and how we could gain access to the material.

Maria Eagle’s office have offered their assistance but because o f the burden it would put on
her staff, they are not able to undertake the whole exercise single-handed. We did intend to
have a member o f our own staff travel down and copy the material, but as we now understand
that she will not be allowed admission into the Library. We have also been advised that we
will be charged “per page” for the photocopying.

I understand that the material is due to be returned to South Yorkshire Police on Friday 31
July. This means that unless this impasse is resolved quickly, the Group will effectively have
been prevented from access to the material, which I am sure was not your intention when you
spoke to the House on 18 February 1998.


Yours sincerely

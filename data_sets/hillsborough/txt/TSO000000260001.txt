 For the Attention of Mr. P. D. Nicholas



    Dear Sir,
                    Hillsborough Stadium Disaster Inquiry - Dr. W. Eastwood

        As you know I act for the above Inquiry.

        You are already aware of the general criticisms which have been indicated
    against Sheffield Wednesday F.C. in the letter of 9th May, 1989 addressed to
    Davies, Arnold, Cooper, a copy of which is enclosed and which, I understand, you
    have been shown by the Club.

        Since that letter was written, much more information has become available.
    In the light of that information, I consider it appropriate that you should be
    aware of matters which may form the subject of criticism against your client and
    his firm.

        I should make it clear that I am writing you this letter because of Lord
    Justice Taylor's indication at the outset of this Inquiry that, if any criticism
    might be levelled against any person advance notice of it should be given.

        The following are the main general criticisms against your client which
    appear from the evidence now available

        1. There are a number of failures to follow the Green Guide recommendations
    in the construction, disposition and height of crush barriers on the West
    Terrace generally and more particularly in Pens 3 and 4, which affected the
    capacity of the pens on the terrace and the flow of spectators.

        Particular consideration should have been given to the effect of the removal
    of Barrier 144 in Pen 3 in 1986.

        2. The construction of the new radial fences in 1981 and of that in 1985
    which created the sterile area behind Gate 5 reduced the capacity of the
    terraces. Your client failed to take proper account of this in his advice to
    the Club and in his dealings with the Local Authority.

        3. Your client ought to have advised the Club of the effect of the
    installation of radial fences generally on capacity and evacuation particularly
    having regard to the narrowness of the gates in the perimeter fencing.

        I should advise you that if, in the light of this letter, your client
    wishes to be represented on Thursday when he gives evidence, Lord Justice Taylor
    has indicated that he will be receptive to such a request.
    I enclose herewith for consideration a copy of a report by Dr. Nicholson of
the Health & Safety Executive dealing with certain factual matters.

    Please make any response to me here, at the Inquiry at the address shown on
the fax covering sheet.



                                  Yours faithfully,

HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY - SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB


You will recall th a t a t the pre-inquiry meeting on 28th April Lord Justice Taylor
indicated th a t any body against whom any allegation was to be made would be informed
of it and the substance of the evidence supporting it.

You will appreciate th a t the task of assembling the evidence for the Inquiry is a
formidable one, and statem e n ts are still being taken. However, it seemed right to let
you have what must be a preliminary indication of criticisms which may be levelled at
the Club and its employees as soon as possible before the commencement of the
Inquiry. We suspect th a t you are already aware of the general thrust of the criticisms
which have been made and th a t what is set out in this le tte r will be no surprise to you.

The following are the main general criticisms which so far appear from the evidence
available to us:-

1.           There appear to have been a number of significant failures to follow the Green
             Guide recommendations. In particular, we refer to the following paragraphs:-

             26.     Training of stewards in carrying out their roles in natural and emergency
                     situations.

             29.     There may have been breaches of the following sub-paragraphs, namely
                     (v)(a) and (c), (vi), (x), (xii) and (xv).
                                                                          t
             45.     Walls could be climbed over.

             46.     There were insufficient contingency plans to deal with the e ffe c t of
                     opening the g ate to relieve crowd pressure outside.

              57.    There was no proper signposting in the ground.
              99.   The gangways in the terra c es were not indicated.

             176.   The planning for emergency, in the light of events, was inadequate.

             m . (ii) and (iv). No steps were taken to ensure th a t the capacities of Pens 3
                    and 4 were not exceeded and loud hailers were not provided for steward^
                    and police to control the crowds.                                stewards

            195. (a). No stewards were available to direct persons entering the ground to
                   ensure th a t the te rra c es filled up evenly.        8     ground to

            215.    The gates in the perim eter fence were not marked as such anrf +h=t +
                    Pen * was difficult ,o use,    since th ere were no S e p s L d " n g t o “

 2.       Turnstiles A -G were insufficient to ensure ease of adm ission to                              +
           inside, there were inadequate directions to the pens to the side the                           ®rraces

5.        Since the gates to the perim eter fence were small and unmarked an A tho „ -

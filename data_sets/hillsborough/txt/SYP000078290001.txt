              was working with Police ConstablVZgUNTQN and SEVERN, as I have stated

there was a steady stream of fans which grew as time went on all the

fans appeared to be in good h umour» as time went by it be came evi dent

that people who had passed on their way to the ground were again

passing us in the opposite direction as though they were                  looking for

something.           Later   in the day some of these fans were asking others

making their way to the ground if they had any spare tickets.                       I saw

several tickets changing hands in^tfeg street in front of me, one I saw

and hear'dl b e i n g \ d d     for twenty five potThds.     During my duty I was

approached b K s e v e r a l     f^ns asking for the location of the following

two pubs, The Sportsman and The Beehive.                As time went by I remember

saying to Police Constable PUNTON that               if the s t a dium’s capacity was

54,000 there were more fans than that from Liverpool alone.

As kick off time drew nearer,             it became evident that large numbers of

fans were walking past drinking cans and bott1es of beer,                  they were

arSkqcar ry i ng four packs of beer.

At 2.56 pm 1456 a group of fans came running up the road as they got

near us Police Constable PUNTON said to one of them 'come on y o u ’ll

havKto           hurry you h a v e n ’t got long’ , he replied,   ’I ’ve got four

mi n u t e s ,

At 3pm 1500 (kick off t i m e ) tha<e were still fans walking past our

point in the direction of the grourmv               By this time I could see that a

large crowd had gathered at the LeppingsHj^ end of the ground.                       I

could sh&fi several mounted Officers            in the crowd.     I also saw a person

in what apeered to be a Police uniform standing on the top of a w ^ l l

near the entrance tA the ground, this person appeared to be helping
    ,               - - ^ 7 5 -------
people oiitTa^the tS^liaf the w a i l , but I d i d n ’t know why. I could also

see that the Po!his^e horses appeared to be doing a lot of moving about.

At 3.10 pm 151Q PolickyConstable COULSON, a member of our serial, came

to Police Constable P U N T O N N ^nd myself and told us to go with him to

the Leppings Ln end of the grouncTas there was some trouble.                    As we
                                                                                                    PAGE    3

                      arrived at the ground there were already people standing around and

                      others leaving the ground,       some of them were saying       'Get in there

                      there's    people dead in there and its worse than H a y s e l .'

                      People appeared in an aggressive mood, others appeared numbed and had

                      blank faces,    some were in tears.     At this time I was unaware of what

                      was happening    inside the ground.

                      I then moved through a side gate to the          entrance which leads to the

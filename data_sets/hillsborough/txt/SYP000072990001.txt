park    and     tha t       is      p r o b a b l y w h y we            ended        up at       the F o r e s t       end       of    the

ground.        We    d id      not     receive            any Police             d i r e c t i o n as         such,        or a n y     es c o rt ,

but    I remember              seeing           a Policeman              apparently              directing            traffic,          near

to w h e r e    we     par k ed .          Whilst         we      were    walking           to     the       gro un d,      I can

remember        seeing           Forest          Supporters              standing           outside           pubs     drinking.              We

approached           the       ground           from      the      Forest        s id e     and       h ad    to w a l k     alongside

the    ground        to     get       to    the L i v e r p o o l         end.        Neither          myself         or               we re

familiar        with Hillsborough,                           so    it was        a    case       of    following            the       crowd        to

get    to    the     g r o un d.       I cannot              remember           seeing          any    form      of    disorder             or

fighting        on     the w a y           to    the      g r ou nd .     We     e v e n t u a l l y a r r i v e d at            the    ground

at    the F o r e s t       end,       so we          h ad     to w a l k       alongside             the     ground        to    get       to

the    Leppings           Lane^trdTnsti l e s . We a r r i v e d at                             the    turnstiles            at       about

quarter        to                There          were      no      queues        outside          the     turnstiles              a n d we

were    abreto            walk        straight            into      the       ground        through a turnstile.                        I

handed my           ticket          in a n d       w as      given       hal f       back.       I still         have       the       h alf      of

the    ticket        and wish              to    retain           it.    There        were       Police        outside           the

turnstiles           who       were        saying         go      straight           in.    On     the       other     s ide      of    the

turnstiles,           there           was       a Policeman              to     each       turnstile,            searching             p eo p l e

as    they walked              through.            I c a nn o t         remember           seeing        any     stewards

outside        the    ground,              but     there          were    a     few    stewards              standing        behind           the

turnstiles           as     you walked                through.           T he    stewards             were     not     directing

people       and     w e r e n ’t d o i n g           anything           in     particular.              There        were       no    signs

inside       the     ground           directing              you    to y o u r        viewing          point.         I w as      aware

th at     you       could enter                the       stand        through          the       tunnel          and      t hat       you    could

also      go       round       to     the      r igh t        hand       s ide    of      the     stand          to    the       standing

areas         at    the       side.       I knew          t his       because          I have          previously                been       to

Hillsborough when Stockport                                    h a ve     played          th e r e.      On      this       o c c a s i o n we

decided            to use          the    tunnel          to       get a       c e n t r al      position.             Once       inside          the

ground.            I did       not       see a n y        people          drinking,              or a n y        s o rt     of    disorder             or

fighting.             At      no    stag e,         did       I see a n y         gates          open      other          than        the

turnstiles.                I did         not       see a n y        unauthorised                 entry        to      the     ground.            We

were      able        to w a l k         along          the    tyfonel         quite        freely and                there       were       no

Police         or S t e w a r d s         either,             at    the       entrance           to    the       t u n ne l      or    inside          it.

which         I k n o w as          p ern f jt^ir. We              got    into        pen     f ou r     at a b o u t         te n m i n u t e s           to

       tr, w h i c h w as           c e nt r a l ,       towards          the      rear.         We    were        not      by a b a r r i e r             at

t ha t    time.          I have m a r k e d              our       i n it ia l     position            on the          seperate             grid,

with      the       figure          one.       From       t hat       time       on,      the     pen w as            gradually             filling

up,      as    was       pen       th ree,         to    our       right.        The      pen was          getting            fuller         and

fuller,            a n d at a b o u t          two m i n u t e s          to     three ,         I realised               t hat       I was

being         c r u s h e d as        I could            not m o v e          at all.         There        was        pressure          f r o m all

sides,         and       no    one       c o u l d m o v e.         At    the     s ame       time,        there          was     tremendous

pressure            from       the       rear       of    the       pen,       presumably              because            there were              still

people         coming          into       the       pen.       Because           of    this,          t h er e     was      a surge          forward

by     the     crowd          in the          pen.       It was          not a g r a d u a l           surge,          j ust a         sudden

one.      Within a             c o up le       of m i n u t e s          of    this       surge        I can          remember          people

shouting,             "Open         the       gates",          and       there        were       people          climbing             out    of       the

pen,      going          ov er      the       front       fence and              o ve r     the       s ide      f e n ce s.      As    a    result

of     the     sur ge,         I w as         pushed          forward          down       the     terraces and                   ended       up

towards            the     front         of    the       pen,       to    the     left        of w h e r e         I was         originally.                I

perhaps          u ntil      about         three        t h i r t y,     I can       remember            not     b e i ng     able        to    see

anything          a r o u n d rne, as             I am       not       very    tall,        and     I was        surrounded               by

other       pe ople.         I remember                somebody          saying          t h at    there was            a g a te         open.

That     may      h av e     been about                f iv e    past      three.          I c a n no t       remember            if     the

game     wa s     s t ill       going        or      not as        I could          not     see     the       pitch.         Gradually

the    pressure            eased          off     as    more       people         left      the      pen,      t his        would        have

been about             three         t h i r t y.      It was          then    that        I got a         bit    of        space        a n d was

able     to      look a r o u n d a             bit     gradually.             I got        more        space,         so    I went

straight          to     the     b ac k      of      the     terraces          in    pen      four.        I just           stood        t h er e

as    I had       pins a n d          needles           in m y arms.              I s t o o d at         the     b ac k      of    the

terraces          for a b o u t           fifteen minutes                  and      then      I went          o nt o    the       pitch.        I

went     through           the m e t a l          fencing          th at      had    been         r i p p e d a w a y at          t he    f r on t

of    the     pen.       I had         not      seen                   since      the      sur ge .      So    I went         to       look     for

him.     I could           see       numerous            people         being       carried          on the a d v e r t i s i n g

hoardings           to     the       far     e nd      of    the       ground.        It    became         apparent           to rne that

there       may also            be     dead       people         on     the    p i t c h as        well.       I eventually                 found

Adam     on      the     pitch         some       t en m i n u t e s       later.          Myself        and                 then        sat    on

some     hoardings              for a w h i l e                        a p p e a r e d alright.            I d o n ’t t h i n k            he was

i n j u r e d at       all.      We       eventually             heard        the a n n o u n c e m e n t        o ve r      the       tannoy

saying        the m a t c h w a s            a b a n d o n e d a n d we           decided          to    l e ave a bit             after

that .      We    left       the       g r o u n d at        about        f our     t h i r t y,     and went           straight            back

to    the     car.

Throughout             the      course          of     t hi s    tragic        i n c i d e nt .      I d id      not w i t n e s s

anything          t hat      I would            consider           a    criminal           offence.

I cannot          comment            on    the w a y         the       situation           w as    handled         from       the        time

that     the m a t c h w as               stopped           as   I w as       unable        to     see a n y t h i n g        and        c a n no t

even     remember            the m a t c h           being       stopped.           By     the     t ime      I got a w a y            from     the

crush       things         were       obviously              in hand.

I feel        the      match         should          not     have       been      p l a y e d at        Hillsborough               because

of    insufficient                spa ce ,      particularly               standing,          for    the a m o u n t      of

Liverpool             supporters.             There       w as a      considerable             lack     of    direction          to

supporters,                particularly            at     the    t u nn el       where      Police      or    stewards          should

have      been        there       to m o v e      p e op l e    round       to    the    s i d es    away     from     the

central          a r e a.

I feel       there          should          be m o r e    gates       at    the    front       of    the     pens,     so as         to

allow       p e o pl e      to    get       out m o r e      quickly        if    needed and          t h e re   should         be

more      freedom           to m o v e       across       the    terraces.

As    a    result          of    th     .........                                   “       I sustained           bruising

across       my       chest, bruised               r i h f     and    streaming          to    b o t h arms.




                                                                The    bruising          has    since        c l e a r e d as    has

the       straining.

I d id      not a t t e n d           the    corresponding             semi       f in al     last    year.




Can       I just       clarify          one     point,         when    I said about             more       gates     at    the

front       of     the      pens,       there      should        not       be a n y     fences       at all,       and

therefore             no    gates       would      be     nee de d .

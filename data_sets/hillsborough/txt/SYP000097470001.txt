    From:    Police Constable                                           Station/Bgptk    West Bar

    To:      Chief Superintendent 'D' Division                           Date:           3 May 1989



            SUBJECT:        MEMORIAL SERVICE AT SHEFFIELD CATHEDRAL

            On Sunday 23 April 1989, I was engaged on duties at the Sheffield Cathedral
            for the Memorial Service in respect of the disaster at Hillsborough.

             I escorted members of the bereaved families into the Cathedral through a
             small trancept door and virtually every one in the party made a point of
             approaching me to shake my hand.

            Several people in the party stated that they did not hold responsible or
            apportion any blame on the Police officers on duty at Hillsborough. They
            made particular mention to Superintendent Marshall and wished me to pass
            their feelings and comments on to him, which I have already done. This was
            obviously a very upsetting time for all concerned and I considered it to
            be a marvellous gesture on their part at their time of grief.

             I submit this report for your information.

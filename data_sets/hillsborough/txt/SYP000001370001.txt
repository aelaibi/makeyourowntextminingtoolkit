                   people       just having              a good           Urne.      After       leaving          the    pub we w a l k e d     to

turns t i l e s and        there was             no orderly queueing,                    everyone was              just    a

great       big mass.           There was a P o l i c e m a n at                  tnis    point who a p p e a r e d             to

had    no    problem finding                my entry          point    it was           only due        to the       number

of    people       that    problems             occurred,           It was        a really        bad    crush outside

kept    my ticket          because          no one asked me                for      it at all,,          I a i d n ’t see

anyone       climb over          Che turn s t i l e s          at all,.           I would       la, :-<e to keep my

ticket.           Ones    inside       the       ground       I wa i t e d       for a while          near     to the

tunnel       entrance       that       leads       to    ;:>ens 3 and 4 for my friends                         but       they

did not       show up so           I decided            to go       in anyway.            At this        point       I was

still wit h a mate               called                   1    d o n ’t know nis              first     name.        At    this

time    we    went       into    the    tunne 1 and            it    was     packed       solid       with     people.              We

din* t go         into    pen    3 by       choice      we     just w e n t        along       with     the    crush       and

due    to the       crowds and          the       pushing       from behind,                  I could see           no    police

in or near          the tunnel          or any          stewards.            1    do    not    recall        seeing       any

alocho'l      being       dr unk      i ns i de the       ground       it was           too    packed.         There       was

no disorder             going    on    like       fighting          or anything.               It was        just    one       big

crush.        I must have             got       into     pen 3 at about                 three     o * c 1o c k ,     It was

so bad at          this    time       that my feet were                off        the    ground and           I could          not

               time     I left         the    ground,       I think      it was       quite    late.          I did not        see

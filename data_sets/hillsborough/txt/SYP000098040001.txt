PROPOSED CONTINGENCY PLAN FOR DEALING WITH FOOTBALL SUPPORTERS ATTENDING
SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL GROUND - THE WEST END (LEPPINGS LANE END) OF
THE GROUND


1.   In an ideal world              consideration would be given to the closure of
      Leppings          Lane   between Catchbar Lane       and Penistone Road North,            and
      only allow those fans into Leppings Lane who are bona fide football
      supporters with tickets or the cash to enter the ground, and this
      minimises any difficulties from disorderly elements who either do not
      have tickets or would not be permitted to enter the football ground.


2.   This is impractical for several reasons, the first of which is that
      the number of officers to secure Leppings Lane would be prohibitive
      for a normal football league game.


3.   There are also commercial interests to consider, not least of which
      is the Law Brothers Garage, a car sales pitch, and a tyre company,
      who may argue that a considerable amount of their business is carried
      out on a Saturday afternoon and someone must compensate them for loss
      of revenue.


4.   The next suitable alternative to the closure of Leppings Lane would
      be     to     restructure      the     turnstile    accommodation     and    to    move   the
      turnstile walls from their present position to the corner of Leppings
      Lane, and thus remove the bottle-neck that exists at the present time
      with        the    fan-like    shape    of   the   reception   area   which       traps   fans
      against the wall of the shops near to Gate A.


5.   I have heard it rumoured,                although at present I cannot recall the
      source,           that   Sheffield     Wednesday   were   considering       purchasing     the
      property between the Leppings Lane                   turnstiles and Vere Road with a
      view to extending the Leppings Lane                  access/exit facilities to remove
      the problem area by Gate A.


6.   The suggestions mentioned are costly and can be applied in a perfect
      world, but dealing with the ground                   as it is I will set out briefly
      the views of senior officers in this                 Division:-
The events of 15 April 1989 clearly demonstrate the impracticality of
filling the North Stand, West Stand and Leppings Lane Terrace, i.e.
24,000 fans, from the existing 23 turnstiles in Leppings Lane.


Without structural modifications, entry from Leppings Lane must now
be    restricted to theWest Stand and Leppings Lane Terraces only.


It    follows that all         entry to the North Stand, therefore, must be by
the 12 turnstiles in Penistone Road, i.e. 77 to 88.


 Access to the South Stand must now be from Penistone Road to avoid
 unnecessary congestion at Leppings Lane turnstiles and in Leppings
 Lane itself.


 The strategy to achieve this is as follows:-


 a)    Leppings Lane - visiting fans only, i.e. West Stand and Terraces
       only.


       As    previously         indicated,    if    we     can   overcome commercial
       pressures and interests          the following should apply:-


 b)    All     'Home'   fans   down    Catchbar    Lane/Parkside      Road:    also,    no
       access     to Leppings Lane via        the roundabout,         barriers,      police
       presence, P.A., consultation with club, supporters' club, media,
       letters to season ticket holders.


       Leafleting over         first   few games will be necessary to achieve
       this objective.


 c)     Turnstiles to be re-allocated to increase number available for
        standing fans          -   clearly marked        'STANDING'   or   'SEATS'    - At
        very high level and illuminated.
Filter cordon across mouth of turnstile area, using Foot and
Mounted to encourage/enforce queuing in the actual turnstile
area.


Greater          use    of    crowd      control     barriers      to    establish      main
queues          in Leppings Lane,           on footpaths to right and left of
turnstile area.


At present there is evidence of a vigorous searching of fans,
to       the     extent      that    many     are   searched    on   leaving     a coach;
outside the actual turnstile; and inside the turnstiles.                                This
is a good deterrent but slows entry and produces little in the
way        of     results.          It   is     suggeted    that          the   constables
stewarding the barriered queues perform selective searches, as
do the officers manning the filter cordon.                           Police Constables
outside the turnstiles to concentrate on maintaining order and
tightly controlling queues.


A    backstop          for    persons       with    contraband     will    exist   on    the
inside of the turnstiles by the presence of other officers.


    The    club MUST monitor              turnstiles,      flows,       and be proactive
    in:-


    i)          pen filling;


    ii)         stewarding of pens;


    iii)        provision of advice on numbers to admit.


     Queues       accessing         the North Stand        to form along Penistone
     Road out of City (nearside traffic lane) to be coned off.


     Kop queues similarly organised but tail to go towards City.


     All South Stand access from Penistone Road.
 k)          We need to use a facility of 12 noon Sunday kick-offs more,
             where a game might produce problems.


  1)         Big crowds, henceforward, will need a large mobile reserve
             of officers, as they may need to be deployed quickly, i.e.
             coach with up to 5 Serials may be necessary on standby in
             vicinity - possibly Vere Road.


      m)     Unmanageable/hostile       crowds     may     significantly         alter   the
             tactics necessary.


We have          accepted the ground as it is, and that to some extent is
inevitable, but turnstiles need to be modern, able to cope with the
1,000       fans an hour suggested by Sheffield Wednesday, and they must
be wide enough to admit the largest of people.


The        external    and   internal     illumination         needs.^ to   be     improved
considerably:          the signing for turnstiles needs to be clear,                      and
consideration should even be given to flashing indicators to attract
attention to a particular spot so that there is no misunderstanding
from a reasonable distance.


It is ludicrous to have electronic counters on particular turnstiles
without them being related to pens or specific areas, and there is a
need       for    a constant    flow of      information    from    turnstile      to    club
control box to police, and in turn back to the officers on queuing
duties outside the ground so that there is a constant monitoring of
crowd build up, and            queuing and filling, to avoid difficulties.


Consideration         should    be   given    to   a   large    electronic       indicator,
similar to an electronic score-board, equipped with flashing lights
so that fans queuing can be given, visually, up to date information
regarding delays or police messages and, whatever the noise, this
can be seen clearly by all queuing or waiting in Leppings Lane.
16.   The tannoy system has its limitations, and club loudspeakers mounted
      on walls are only effective for a short distance, and these in the
      past have been supplemented by police mobiles.                                   There is a serious
      need to consider regular static public address equipment along the
      route of fans walking towards the ground.


17.   Stewards'       responsibilities          within           the        ground need     to be    clearly
      defined and agreed upon by all parties, with demarcation lines for
      police and club clearly defined.


18.   The police chain of command also needs to be more clearly                                     defined,
      with    the     joint    bodies     responsible                 for    the   event   having a clear
      indication of what their responsibilities and roles in a disaster
      are.

                £
19.   PoliceJtibvses should be required to send 'spotters' and,                                   if need be,
      Mounted officers who know the visiting fans and are members of the
      visiting fans' Police Force.


20.   Consideration         should   also be         given to the recognisedSupporters'
      Club providing          their own stewards to encourage their fans to get
      into the ground on time and form orderly queues.


21.   This may seem an unusual departure, but with political                                      marches and
      demonstrations the responsibility for stewarding marches rests with
      the organiser, who provides stewards, and I do not see that this is
      any    different:       the    fans   may      respond            to     their own as opposed to
      police        officers on some occasions.


22.   Serious       consideration        must   be       given         to     taking     action   under   the
      Licensing       Act     to   ban    all   sales            of    alcohol      at   both     on and off
      licensed premises near the ground.

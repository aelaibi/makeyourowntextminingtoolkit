                  sitting         and     standing            on    the     other      side         of    the       r oad      from    the     pub    by    the

                  seemed        to     be h a v i n g    a        good    time,       enjoying            themselves             drinking        and

         different           lot      of    supporters.




         The    youths          sitting          on    our      wall     were       aged       in t h e i r       early       twenties          with

         the    exception             of    on e      who     appeared         to    be a p p r o a c h i n g          thirty.         Obviously

         with    them        being         so    close        to   the    cars       we     feared          that       some    damage          might

         be    caused        so m y s e l f        and                   w ent      over       to     speak       to    them.         I spoke

         with    them        for      about        fifteen         to    twenty minutes,                    keeping          the    talk       lig h t

         one    of    the youtrks w h o                I can       only     describe             as    a w h i t e m a le,          aged       early

         twenties,           normal         build,          5 ’ 10 tall        with       brown        hair       t h a t was       cut    quite

         short       at    the     front         but     long at         the     back,         took        from     his      pocket       a small
                                                                                                      \

         sniff       the     contents            of^i^very              strongly.              I have        no     i dea w h a t      was      in

D/U€j    cannot       describe.                 The    effect       of    this       on     this       y o u t h was         amazing.           In a

         matter       of    seconds             from     sniffing         the       bottle           his    e yes      sort    of     ' popped '

         put    his a r m a r o u n d            him     to     stop     him     falling             backwards          over       the w a l l .



         Another          one    of    the       lads       took    the        bottle          from him and also                   had a       sni f f ,

         but    he    d i d n ’t s n i f f         the      contents         so      long      a n d the      effects          to    him       were

         mini m a 1 .



         During       the       conversation                the    lads a s k e d         me     where       a good          pub w a s     I

         suggested           'The S h a k e s p e a r e ',          but     they       said          they    d i d n ’t w a n t      to    go

         Whilst       all       t hi s w a s       going        on we     began        to      get     pestered           by L i v e r p o o l

         supporters.               They were             generally asking                   to       use    the     toilets         but a

couple       were       asking       to     us e    the     telephone .^            They       became          quite       abusive

and    hostile          to                  who     initially           refused          them access                to    the

facilities.             It w a s     obvious         t his    group        had      had a       ' f e w ’ to         drink       and

             eventually             let     some     of     them     use      the       toilet       and       phone       as    I

believe       he w a s        concerned            t hat    they may          start       causing             trouble.           Once       ha

had    let a       couple          use     the     toilets,        we    were       suddenly             plagued with                people

wanting       to    use       them.




This    carried                until        about       twenty       five      p as t     two       < 14 2 3       hrs),    when       I

had    to    leave.           I drove                                who      I believe             is       the

save    them walking.                    The     route      I t ook      was       straight          down La ngset               Rd,

into M i d d l e w o o d Rd,             I was      then going           to    turn       rig h t        into       Leppings          Ln

but    was    unable          to as        the     Police     ha d      blocked          it    off.           On most       of       the

roads       surrounding             th e   ground          I was     aware         of    thousands             of    supporters.

Because       there          was    so m a n y      people a bout             it    l o o k e d as           though       the    game

h ad   finished and                everyone         was     leaving        all      at    once       rather          than       people

who    were       just       making        their     way     to    the     ground.




I briefly          saw       into    Leppings           Ln and       saw      thousands             of       people       queuing          to

g et   into       the    ground.                                           jot out            of m y         vehicle       at    t his

point       and    I drove          off.



I turned          left w h i c h         is a      continuation            of M i d d l e w o o d            Rd a nd      had    to

proceed along                there       for     about      two    miles.           I had       to       travel          this

distance          before       I was       able      to     turn     round         because          further          down       the    r oad

was    too    crowded and                busy with          supporters             walking          to       the    ground.           As    I

said    I then          turned       my     vehicle         around       and       began       to    drive          back    along

Middlewood          Rd.        I could           only      drive     s l o w l y as       people were                walking          in

the    road.       As    I neared             Leppings        Ln     I saw a         number          of    parties             of

supporters          drinking             from       b eer    cans.           Some    groups          were       discarding                the

empty     cans      by     throwing            them     over       the       fence       i nto      the    park.           On       t his

journey       I d i d n ’t a c t u a l l y           witness         any      trouble          between          the       fans.           I

eventually arrived                   back       at     the    garage          at    about        te n     to    three          ( 1 45 0

hrs),    this       journey would                   normally         take a b o u t           ten m i n u t e s          there       and

back    again       so     t his     was       an    indication              of    how    slow       I was          having          to

drive.




Outside       the       garage,          people        were       sti l l     making          their       way       towards          the

ground along             the m a i n          road.         Myself       and                     began         to    collect             up    the

empty    beer       glasses          and       bottles        that       had       been a b a n d oned outsida                       our
                                                                                   AO   I                   ~

glasses       and       bottles          in tot-aK ju st             from around               by our w a l l             and       these

were    given       back       t         he    pub.




About    3    pm    <1500          hrs)                     put    the       radio       on    in o r d e r         to    listen          to

the m a t c h .         It w a s     at       this     point       t hat     we     became          aware       of       the    disaster

that    had    o c c u r r e d at         the       ground.




A   short     while       after          this       I saw     people         making           their       way       from       the

direction          of    the       ground.           One     of    the       supporters             was    very          distressed

and    asked       to    use       our    phone        a n d we      obliged         him.



             then       returned          to    t he    garage,          very       distressed and what                         he       had

seen and                  came       some       thirty        to     forty minutes                  later.




Prior    to                    arrival          I saw a           blue       transit          van    drive          past       on    the

Langset       Rd away          from       the       direction         of      the    ground.              The       transit          had

windows       all       around and             I presumed            it w a s       full       of N o t t i n g h a m F o r e s t

         supporters           as       it had         their       team     scarves        hanging           out     of    the win d o w .

         Due     to    traffic          congestion               t his    van was        travelling              quite        slowly.




         As    it w e n t     past       the                                     Public        House        I saw a g r o u p             of a b o u t

         twenty Liverpool                    supporters             standing           outside        on    the     corner          of    road.

         One     of    these       Liverpool               supporters           'f T r e ^     a    distress           flare        at    the

_      /) van.        I d o n ’t k n o w         how       this     red    flarsKwas           fired        but     it    struck          the

         transit        van       on    i t ’s side,             bounce     o n , into         the       air     finally         landing            by

         the     Old Barrack             where         it     burnt       itself        out.         The    v a n at      this       point          was

         now     stationary             due      to    the       traffic.          I    then'saw           this group           of

         Liverpool           supporters               run     dl^onally           across            the    r o a d to     the       van,

         screaming           and       shouting.              I think       they        were        s h o u t i n g "Get       them " , t h e y

         then     started          kicking^and                thumping          the     van and          rocking         it    in a n a t t e m p t

         to    turn     the       van    over         onto       i t ’s side.           Luckily          the     traffic        had moved

         enabling           the    van       to m o v e       off,       otherwise        I believe              someone        would          h ave

         been     seriously             injured.             As    the     van drove           off       t his     group       ran       back       down

         Langset        Rd    towards            the       pet r o l     Station        further          down      the    road,          all    of

         them     screaming             and      shouting.




         A    double        decker       bus      had m o m e n t a r i l y       stopped           outside         of    our       premises             in

         the     traffic.              You    could         hear       an alarm         buzzer        sounding           from       this       bus

         and     I then       saw       t ha t    the       upstairs        rear        escape        window        had       been       opened.

         I saw a number                 of y o u t h s        hanging       out        from    this        escape        window          shouting

         down     to    the       the    screaming               'yobs'     who        were    running           past,        obviously             to

         find     out w h a t          was    going         on.        About     twenty youths                  then     filed       out       of

         this     bus       and also          began         to    run d o w n     the     road        towards          the     petrol

         station.            At    t his      point         I went        outside,        sickened              by w h a t    was        going       on

         around        us    I looked            down       the    road     towards           the     petrol        garage          where       I saw

         a    large     congregation                  of    people        who    appeared           to     be    fighting.               At    t his

             decided       to   lock all     the      doors.




             We    remained      inside     the    building       until      everything     had   quietened      down

             w h e n we all     left   and     went     home,     this      being   about   quarter   to   six    ( 1 74 5

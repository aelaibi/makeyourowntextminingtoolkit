                                                       BRIEFING



                                         3.30pm Monday           17 April        1989



           I will      touch b r i e f l y upon the             incident w h i c h o c c urred            on S at u r d a y    for

           the benefit           of an y o n e who was          not    there.



           Last     S a t u r d a y was a Cup Semi - F i n a l          b e t w e e n N o t t i n g h a m Fo r e s t and

           Liverpool.             That was almost a carbon                   copy of the S e m i - F i n a l       that

           oc c u r r e d    12 mo n t h s   earlier at         the same        place.       That S e m i - F i n a l   went

           off with o u t m uch          trouble.        I was at        that Semi-Final                12 mo n t h s ago and

           towards          3o'clock     there was a b u i l d - u p of drun k e n s p e c t a t o r s             coming       to

           the    gates at L ep p i n g s        Lane w h i c h had been            reserved        for Liverpool.

           Ihis was an all              ticket match.            Last year         the b u i ld-up of s u pporters

           lasted       five minutes.            There was        some       d i s order    but,    nevertheless,             the

           turnstiles           cleared      those    people and everyone                  got    into the      ground.

           They     had a good match,              there were          the usual        bouts      of abuse and

           rowdiness          but,    by and     large,        it was    very good for a crowd of that

           size.       A fter      the m a t c h there was            very    little       trouble.        There was          one

           incident          in H i l l s b o r o u g h Park    but e v e ryone went             home    satisfied.



           It was under            those     circumstances            that    it was       thought       by the
                                                                                                                    PAGE
                                                                                                                    D27
organising         people       that     the a r r a n g e m e n t s    for      that m a t c h had been so

s u ccessful       that     they w o u l d also          be succe s s f u l        and a d e q u a t e    for       this

m a t c h and as a result               similar a r r a n g e m e n t s       were made.          It was        thought

that as the          spectators           had been to the              gr o u n d on the      previous

occasions         they w o u l d       know    the    facilities,           the entrances and              that

w o u l d make     it all        the more       easier and we e x p e c t e d s o mething                  of an

improv e m e n t     this year.            We are all          very m uch aware            of how wrong we

were     in this a s s u m p t i o n .




                                                                                                           <   2)



liy job on the day was                  to s u pervise         the     crime aspect         of    it.      It was

split      into three           broad areas?          motor     vehicle          crime,    crowd     pick       pockets

at    the t u r n s t i l e s    and    reported        crime    during          and after       the game.



Because       of my e x p e r i e n c e       the    previous year            I decided       that at about

half     past     two    I would        be near       the L e p p i n g s     Lane    turns t i l e s     because

that was        the most         likely area          for     pick     pockets.          I was    s u r p r i s e d on

arrival       at 2 .30      to find a huge              flood of s u pporters              there wait i n g           for

the    t u rnstiles a n d         the     t u rnstiles        did not       seem to be        coping.           People

were a r r i v i n g     faster        than the t u r n s t i l e s      could keep up with.                    a

public      order       s i t u at i o n developed.            More and more             police    o f f icers and

mounted       police      offic e r s were           brought     into       the a r e a an d at          some       stage

a d e c i s i o n was made         for     the gate          to be opened.            I know of one             gate

w h i c h was     opened and           I watched        spectators          go    into that       gate,        w hich

was m a r k e d    *C’.         It may well          have    been      that      other gates were              opened.

I don't know.             Nevertheless              there was a huge              influx    of supp o r t e r s         in

through       that gate.           It star t e d off as a trickle.                        During     the       half

hour     that     I was     there a number              of   people,        particularly          injured

people,       were      taken through.               Police O f f i c e r s       used    it as did
                                                                                                                  PAGE

officials.              F i n a l l y w h e n these      gates were         opened       (they are         concertina

type metal          gates)       anyone walk i n g          t h r o u g h them w ould         see    direc t l y

facing       them a tunnel             which      leads u n d e r n e a t h    the stand and              into a

te r r a c e d a r e a d i r e c t l y      behind      the L e p p i n g s Lane       end.         The    gates       were

opened and a trickle                   of    people went         in,    some may have             been

opportunists             who    had been wait i n g            in that area          for    the gates        to be

opened.           The    trickle       developed         into a steady          stream of supp o r t e r s and

during       the    next       two or three minu t e s               that    stream of suppo r t e r s            became

a flood.           An a t t e m p t    was made         by a police          officer       on hor s e b a c k     to




                                                                                                            <3>



regulate          the    flow but they were               then flowing          down each side              of the

police       horse.         My a t t i t u d e   at that        point was       that       the    pressure was

off and       they were          getting         into    the    ground.        Of     course      I had no        idea

of the       trag e d y     that was         to follow.          I turned and            left at      that      point

and made my way to the                      other    end of the ground               going       to the Police

Room.        As    I walked        on the track           beh i n d the Kop goal              I looked up and             I

could see          d i s o r d e r and      this was whe n all              the mass of          people who        had

gone    in thro u g h that             gate had made            their way down the                tunnel     like

lemmings.           As     these      people were         going       in there was a roar                 from the

gr o u n d that         i n dicated      either      that      the    players       had gone        on or the          game

had started and                there     then became           some    i n c reased degree           of urgency.



It w o u l d appear            that    there was a great               deal    of    pressure        into    the

smaller       area       of te r r a c i n g and that also              is si g n i f i c a n t     in that       in as

m u c h as    there        is little         depth      in that area.



It was       in that area             that    the    crush occurred.                E x a c t l y what    happened        I

do   not know.

It is a matter               of fact    now that 94              people      lost their          lives        in that

crowd and a n o t h e r         one    is e x p ected          to die w h i c h will           being      it up to

95.     I am not going               to dwell        upon the scenes              in the gymnasium,

principally          because         they upset me.               There was a huge               operation,              under

dreadful        circumstances,              to    identify        the victims and to                   sort    out

relatives.           Everyone         has    been      identified.



It was a p p a r e n t        that    this       enqu i r y    could not be and should not be

u n d e r t a k e n by the      people a g a i n s t w h o m         fingers were a l r e a d y being




                                                                                                               <   4)

up the      Incident Room,             equip        it and       build the m a c h i n e as             it were,          but

not    start     the engine.            1 hat       is what we did and                 the only         enquiries

w h i c h we made were           those       that we          ident i f i e d    in the a reas           of

informations           list     of Pol i c e Officers,               list of Ambul a n c e m e n ,             list of

that    d e c i s i o n had     been made          then we        could step a way from the machine

that we       had built.             We had secured all                the evidence            that was            there    in

terms     of exhibits           and    that we        could       leave anot h e r         team to step              into

our    shoes and do            the job.           I o b v i o u s l y was       not    thinking         straight

because whe n you              think about           it   it    is not      feasible         for       them to send

in the      huge     team of officers                needed       to do that           enquiry.

I have       no doubt        that       in the fulln e s s          of time a separate                 team will        be

e n q u i r y that     is building.              The    enqu i r y also          needs     to    cover    the scene

at L e p p i n g s    Lane;       the    scene     behind       the goal;         which     o f f icers were

w h e r e an d what we did.                   I have    no doubt          that    they will        be    looking at

our a c t i v i t i e s     in the       g y m n a s i u m an d how we        coped w ith the enquiry,

perhaps        even    to date.



1 went       this m o r n i n g     to a c o nference             in the Chief C o n st a b l e ' s             office

and    the Chief          Constable           said this.          He said        "We have        to pinpoint

i n f o r m a t i o n and    indicate          to the e n q u i r y team where              it    can be found

and    the     nature       of    it and       that    is in a d d i t i o n      to a n y t h i n g    else which

the    e n q u i r y team        requires       of us."



This     puts a t o t a l l y d i fferent              comp l e x i o n   on what we have               to do..        1'

must     say    right       now that          under    no    circu m s t a n c e s   will       we be taking

they have a n y t h i n g          pertinent          to give.        We will        be    i dentifying          the

areas     w h i c h are      very     pertinent           to the e n q u i r y and of w h i c h enquiries

need to be u r g e n t l y made              before,        as    the C hief        puts      it "the       evidence

disappears            into the       sand",       and     there     is so m uch          press   pu b l i c i t y that

the w i t n e s s e s    we need       to speak           to,    might    well      have      their    thoughts

coloured        by what        they may be           reading        in the      press.



One    of the areas            that    we need to           look at       urgently         is the Leppings

Lane     turnstiles.            It has       been s u g g e s t e d      that      the    reason      that       the

tu r n s t i l e s    could not       cope was          that     the Liv e r p o o l      suppo r t e r s    were

getti ng




                                                                                                             <   6)



to the       turns t i l e s and       instead          of offer i n g       tickets were            offering

money.        At      this   stage     the       crush was        such that         they      could not          turn

a w a y from         these   turnstiles.             I do not        know whether             this    is the          case

or not       but      if that was          the    case     that w o u l d     e xplain.to me why there

appeared        to be no m o v e m e n t          thro u g h those        t u rnstiles all            the time          I

was    there.          1 o b v i o u s l y was      not    privi l e g e d    to what was            happening.              It

ma y well       be that        the    blockage was              on the    other side           in that       there was

a   constant          stream    of    people        going       through,      but that         is an are a that

we need       to      look at    urgently.              Some     o f f icers will        be    interviewed,

Police       on horseback,            the serials           who were         on duty,         fire m e n will          be

interviewed,            the s t e wards who were                 on duty on the            turnstiles.             We

also     need to know how man y of the three                             gates were           opened,       when they

were     opened,        in what       sequence          they were        opened and who a u t h o r i s e d

them to be opened.                   The   enquiries            there are       quite      o b v i o u s l y the

Po l i c e O f f i c e r s   who were        on the gates and                the   stewards          on the gates.



There were m o u n t e d Po l i c e              from Liv e r p o o l     there      during      the whole             time
                                                                                                               PAGE

and     I think     they       could give       the    best    evidence        possible          in that       they

wer e    high above        the     crowd.       I am    talking        about    the disorder.                 They

will     give     us some       good    information.          T h e y were s u p p l e m e n t e d       by

®^^      ® ® ■from N o t t i n g h a m s h i r e and •from S o u t h Yorkshire.                    All       these

en q uiries       have    to    be done with some             degree     of urgency.



We also      need for          the Coro n e r     to find      out w h e r e a b o u t s    the    bodies          have

come from.          It    is not       going    to be an       easy task but           one of the ways




                                                                                                         <   7)



we are going         to be able          to find out          in some degree where                 the       bodies

have     come from        is from       speaking       to the     officers who             have    taken bodies

into     the gymnasium,           speaking        to the      firemen,      speaking            to the

ambulancemen.             There was          conjecture       that     bodies were          removed          from the

turnstiles.          If this          is so we need to know as that alters                          the whole

compl e x i o n    of the       possible       result    of the        enquiry.        If yo u hear anyone

talking about            bodies       coming    from the turns t i l e s and               it    is just

hearsay      please,       please,       shut     them up.        We    do not     know whet h e r            bodies

have     come from        this area.            If we see        people who say "I have moved a

body from the t u r n s t i l e s "            then that       is som e t h i n g we need          to know

urgently.




That     is the     nature       of    the     beast and       I hope      that     our input        into          it

might     only     last    for a few           days.     The     house     to house enqu i r y team                is

something         different.



What    I would      impress          upon yo u    is that as          I have said we are                not

taking     statements.            We are       engaged     in pinpointing           those ar eas              of

information         for    the    enquiry team and             indicating        to the e n q u i r y team

what     that     i n f o r m a t i o n might       be.



It    is a b s o l u t e l y   vital       that     in your           e n quiries you are                 seen       to be

impartial        and      that yo u are           not seen            to    be    colouring             the    information.

Whatever         information            is f o r t h c o m i n g      we want         it good or              bad,    warts and

all.      We w ould all            be    relieved         if     it was          in f o r m a t i o n    in our       favour

but    there      is danger         in going          down the             road that we are                   going

down that         someone,         at a      later     stage,          will       say that we are                getting        our

act    together         before      the enqu i r y team a r r i v e s and that                            definitely           is

not    the      case and       no one should add                   or say a n y t h i n g          to     indicate           to any

potential         witn e s s      that     they ought            to    change         their       in f o r m a t i o n   in any

way.       The    information            that yo u give               back       to the       Incident R oom will                   be

in the       nature       of an     officer's           report.             I do not want                that    information

to take         the form       of a statement.                   In other words,                 we are         just

pointing         them     in the        right     direction.                We just want a few                   remarks,

for    instances           "This man            removed a body from L e p p i n g s                       Lane area".

That     is all      we    need     in order          that       the       enqu i r y team          can go and

What     I w ould just            like     to    reinforce wit h y o u                  is that          this    enquiry        is

s l i g h t l y dif f e r e n t    from      the norm          in that           it   is not       the normal            type of

Mr.    McKay        has made         the    point       in respect       of not        taking s t a t e m e n t s        and

impartiality.                 The    reason for          that     is quite          obvious.        We    now have        to

let some o n e          else    take       over    the    enqu i r y and        it    is really not              our job

to go out           now taking          s t a t e m e n t s and      so on,     it    is a matter             for them.



                                                                                                                 (9)



It goes          back    to    i m p a r t i a l i t y , u n b i a s e d and    so on.           That    is how we

have     got      to a p p r o a c h    it.       We have       not    got     to    let a n y thing          w h i c h you

have     seen,       heard      or     read,      colour      our judgement,               even officers who

were     there at         the       time,     we have got            to try and forget about                     that.        We

have got          to a p p r o a c h    this      c o m p l e t e l y open.         We have got          to    be

completely           impartial.



Plans      of the gr o u n d are a v a i l a b l e              for those who              are not       conversant

wit h the area. We will                    hand these         out     later.

cause      because we will                 not    know that          until all        the    evidence          is

what     yo u think was              the    cause.        We want       the     cause       to    come    out good        or

Coroner's       O f f i c e r Supt       Sleath

I have been a s k e d          to    prepare      the    report         for    the benefit        of the Coroner.

It m a y be that           during     the     course     of your         e n q uiries     that you need to

liaise wit h the Coro n e r                or the C o r on e r ' s       Officer.         Can    I ask     that        it

is    imperative       that you do so t h r o u g h me or De t e c t i v e                    Inspector

Charles.        It    is    important        that we       do not        flood the C o r o n e r ' s       Office

with    details.           These     should      come t h r o u g h us.



Part    of the e n q u i r y that           I have      been a s k e d        to    carry out by the

Coroner       is to    locate and           identify where              the    people were        prior     to the

incident and w here             the      bodies    have       come from.            Mr M c K a y has a l r e a d y

it may well          be that a body has              been hand l e d           three or four        times         by

three      or four     dif f e r e n t     people.       If an officer              tells you that          he

            body from?" a n d          "Where     did you         leave     it?"     We may have       the    s i tuation

            wit h    these    bodies      that    they are         being m o v e d about.          They may have

                                  BRIEFING

                      3 . 3 0 pm Monday 17 A p r il 1989

I will touch briefly upon the incident which occurred on Saturday

for the benefit of anyone who was not there.



Last Saturday was a Cup Semi-Final between Nottingham Forest and

Liverpool.   That was almost a carbon copy of the Semi-Final that

occurred 12 months earlier at the same place.              That Semi-Final went

off without much trouble.       I was at that Semi-Final 12 months ago

and towards 3 o 'clock there was a build-up of drunken spectators

coming to the gates at Leppings Lane which had been reserved for

Liverpool.   This was an all ticket match.        Last year the build-up of

supporters lasted five minutes.           There was        seme disorder but,

nevertheless, the turnstiles cleared those people and everyone got

into the ground.    They had a good match, there ^ t h e            usual bouts

of abuse and rowdiness but, by and large, it was very good for a

crowd of that size.      After the match there was very little trouble.

There was one incident in Hillsborough Park but everyone went heme

satisfied.



It was   under   those    circumstances    that   it was       thought   by the

organising people that the arrangements for that match had been so

successful that they would also be successful and adequate for this

match and as a result similar arrangements were made.                    It was

thought that as     the spectators had been to the ground on the

previous occasion^they would know the facilities, the entrances and

that would make it all the more easier and we expected something of

an improvement this year.      We are all very much aware of how wrong

we were in this assumption.
My job on the day was to supervise the crime aspect of it.               It was

split into three      broad areas;    motor vehicle crime,           crowd pick

pockets at the turnstiles and reported crime during and after the

game.



Because of my experience the previous year I decided that at about

half past two I would be near the Leppings Lane turnstiles because

that was the most likely area for pick pockets.            I was surprised on

arrival at 2.30 to find a huge flood of supporters there waiting for

the turnstiles and the turnstiles did not seem to be coping.             People

were arriving faster than the turnstiles could keep                 up with.    A

public order situation developed.         More and more police officers and

mounted police officers were brought into the area and at some stage

a decision was made for the gate to be opened.             I know of one gate

which was opened and I watched spectators go into that gate, which

was marked 'C'.    It may well have been that other gates were opened.

I don't know.    Nevertheless there was a huge influx of supporters in

through that gate.     It started off as a trickle.          During the half

hour that I was there a number of people, particularly injured

people,   were   taken through.       Police    Officers    used     it as     did

officials.       Finally   when   these    gates   were    opened     (they    are

concertina type metal gates) anyone walking through them would see

directly facing them a tunnel which leads underneath the stand and

into a terraced area directly behind the Leppings Lane end.                    The

gates were opened and a trickle of people went in, seme may have

been opportunists who had been waiting in that area for the gates to

be opened.   The trickle developed into a steady stream of supporters

and during the next two or three minutes that stream of supporters

became a flood.       An attempt was made by a police officer on
horseback to regulate the flow but they were then flowing down each

side of the police horse.     My attitude at that point was that the

pressure was off and they were getting into the ground.    Of course I

had no idea of the tragedy that was to follow.     I turned and left at

that point and made my way to the other end of the ground going to

the Police Room.    As I walked on the track behind the Kop goal I

looked up and I could see disorder and this was when all that mass

of people who had gone in through that gate had made their way down

the tunnel like waaiacs.    As these people were going in there was a

roar from the ground that indicated either that the players had gone

on or the game had started and there then became seme increased

degree of

It would appear that there was a great deal of pressure into the

smaller area of terracing and that also is significant in that in as

much as Kfcs&x. U

Then Lhere waa tho barriers and it was in that area that the crush

occurred.   Exactly what happened I do not know.



It is a matter of fact now that 94 people lost their lives in that

crowd and another one is expected to die which will bring it up to

95.   I am not going to dwell upon the scenes in the gymnasium,

principally because they upset me.      There was a huge operation,

under dreadful circumstances, to identify the victims and to sort

out relatives.   Everyone has been identified.



It was apparent that this enquiry could not be and should not be

undertaken by the people against whcm fingers were already being
                                                                            (4)

pointed.       However, we now have to start up the investigation and set

up the Incident Room,equip it and build the machine as it were, but

not start the engine. That is what we did and the only enquiries

which we made were those that we             identified in the areas of

information:      list of Police Officers, list of Ambulancemen, list of

Police Officers from other forces, list of injured people.



Yesterday      the   Chief   Constable   asked   Geoffrey   Dear,   the   Chief

Constable of the West Midlands if he would irecfruj't someone to

undertake the enquiry.         I understand he has accepted and at seme

stage there will be an enquiry team caning up here.                 I assumed

yesterday that once that decision had been made then we could step

away from the machine that we had built.            We had secured all the

evidence that was there in terms of exhibits and that we could leave

another team to step into our shoes and do the job.           I obviously was

not thinking straight because when you think about it it is not

feasible for them to send in the huge team of officers needed to do

that enquiry.



I have no doubt that in the fullness of time a separate team will be

set up in Liverpool using Liverpools computer equipment, together

with ours and West Midlands.



House to house enquiries in Leppings Lane area.             Obviously     tfeey

fl-pa rp-ing            a team to do house to house enquiries, interview

every officer in the ground, interview every ambulanceman, every

fireman, every injured person, every St John's ambulanceman, every
person on the turnstiles and already you can see the nature of the

enquiry that is building.   The enquiry also needs to cover the scene

at Leppings Lane; the scene behind the goal; which officers were

where and what we did.   I have no doubt that they will be looking at

our activities in the gymnasium and how we coped with the enquiry,

perhaps^to date.



I went this morning to a conference in the Chief Constable's office

and the Chief Constable said this.    He said    "We have to pinpoint

information and indicate to the enquiry team where it can be found

and the nature of it and that is in addition to anything else which

the enquiry team requires of us."

This puts a totally different complexion on what we have to do.      I

must say right now that under no circumstances will we be taking

statements of any nature other than exhibit handling and that sort

of thing.    We will not be taking witness statements from people

should they have anything pertinent to give.    We will be identifying

the areas which are very pertinent to the enquiry and of which

enquiries need to be urgently made before, as the Chief puts it "the

evidence disappears into the sand", and there is so much press

publicity that the witnesses we need to speak t o ,might well have

their thoughts coloured by what they may, dE -way-jaot, be reading in

the press.



One of the areas that we need to look at urgently is the Leppings

Lane turnstiles.   It has been suggested that the reason that the

turnstiles could not cope was that the Liverpool supporters were getting
to the turnstiles and instead of offering tickets were offering

money.        At this stage the crush was such that they could not turn

away from these turnstiles.            I do not know whether this is the case

or not but if that was the case that would explain to me why there

appeared to be no movement through those turnstiles all the time I

was there.        I obviously was not privileged to^what was happening.

It may well be that the blockage was on the other side in that there

was a constant stream of people going through, but that is an area

that     we    need   to   look   at   urgently.     Seme   officers    will   be

interviewed, Police on horseback, the serials who were on duty,

firemen will be interviewed, the stewards who were on duty on the

turnstiles.       We also need to know how many of the three gates were

opened, when they were opened, in what sequence they were opened and

who authorised them to be opened.              The enquiries there are quite

obviously the Police Officers who were on the gates and the stewards

on the gates.



There were mounted Police frcm Liverpool there during the whole time

and I think they could give the best evidence possible in that they

were high above the crowd ^tnd I am talking about the disorder.             They

will give us seme good information.                They were supplemented by

officers frcm Nottinghamshire and frcm South Yorkshire.                All these

enquiries have to be done with some degree of urgency.



We also need for the Coroner to find out whereabouts the bodies have

cone frcm.       It is not going to be an easy task but one of the ways
we are going to be able to find out in seme degree where the bodies

have ccme frcm is frcm speaking to the officers who have taken

bodies into the gymnasium, speaking to the firemen, speaking to the

ambulancemen.     There was conjecture that bodies were removed frcm

the turnstiles.     If this is so we need to know as that alters the

whole complexion of the possible result of the enquiry.   If you hear

anyone talking about bodies caning frcm the turnstiles and it is

just hearsay please, please, shut them up.    We do not know whether

bodies have cone frcm this area.    If we see people who say "I have

moved a body frcm the turnstiles" then that is something we need to

know urgently.



That is the nature of the beast and I hope that our input into it

might only last for a few days.    The house to house enquiry team is

something different.



What I would impress upon you is that as I have said we are not

taking statements.     We are engaged in pinpointing those areas of

information for the enquiry team and indicating to the enquiry team

what that information might be.

It is absolutely vital that in your enquiries you are seen to be

impartial and that you are not seen to be colouring the information-

Whatever information is forthcoming we want it good or bad, warts

and all.   We would all be relieved if it was information in our

favour but there is danger in going down the road that we are going
down that someone, at a later stage, will say that we are getting

our act together before the enquiry team arrives and that definitely

is not the case and no one should add or say anything to indicate to

any potential witness that they ought to change their information in

any way.     The information that you give back to the Incident Room

will be in the nature of an officer's report.      I do not want that

information to take the form of a statement        in other words, we

are just pointing them in the right direction.     We just want a few

remarks, for instance: "This man removed a body frcm Leppings Lane

area".     That is all we need in order that the enquiry team can go

and interview him at depth.



Press

Under no circumstances will anyone speak to the press.

Is there anything else?

Detective Chief Superintendent Addis

I think you have said it all.



What I would just like to reinforce with you is that this enquiry is

slightly different frcm the norm in that it is not the normal type

of crime.    If you would approach this in the form of an Inquest.



Mr McKay has made the point in respect of not taking statements and

impartiality.    The reason for that is quite obvious.   We now have to

let someone else take over the enquiry and it is really not our job

to go out now taking statements and so on, it is a matter for them.
It goes back to impartiality, unbiased and so on.     That is how we

have got to approach it.    We have not got to let anything which you

have seen, heard or read, colour our judgement, even officers who

were there at the time, we have got to try and forget about that. We

have got to approach this completely open.       We have got to be

completely impartial.



Plans of the ground are available for those who are not conversant

with the area.   We will hand these out later.



ACC Mr Jackson

I will mention one thing.    It is important not to speculate on the

cause because we will not know that until all the evidence is

gathered together, bearing in mind we have videos, etc.   The reasons

for that tragic event on Saturday will come out.     Do not speculate

on the cause,    putting into the minds of people that you might

interview what you think was the cause.    We want the cause to come

out good or bad and we are not taking statements.



Just one minor thing.   We do not know at this stage how much time we

have to do what we need to do before West Midlands or some other

force takes over this particular enquiry but it may well be that

whilst we are concentrating on the main areas of the incident, in

respect of the location down at Hillsborough, you may well interview

people who were elsewhere either before, during or after the event.

Do please record what these people say.      They may, for instance,

tell you something which is very relevant, something which happened
 before the event, what they were doing, where they had been and so

 on and so forth.      Please do not shy away frcm people who were not

 at the specific location at the ground.      Always bear in mind all

 information is relevant in this type of enquiry.




 I have been asked to prepare the report for the benefit of the

Coroner.   It may be that during the course of your enquiries that

you need to liaise with the Coroner or the Coroner's Officer.     Can I

ask that it is imperative that you do so through me^ Detective

Inspector Charles.       It is important that we do not flood the

Coroner's Office with details.    These should ccme through us.



Part of the enquiry that I have been asked to carry out by the

Coroner is to locate and identify where the people were prior to the

incident and where the bodies have come frcm.    Mr McKay has already

mentioned that although you are not going to take statements frcm

people in respect of the bodies can I just stress the importance

that it may well be that a body has been handled three or four times

by three or four different people.    If an officer tells you that he

picked up a body frcm position (a) that may well be where he had

been put by someone else.    In order to follow continuity with these

bodies it is important that we ask the questions "Where did you take

the body frcm?      and "Where did you leave it?"    We may have the

situation with these bodies that they are being moved about.      They

may have died in one place and moved through a succession of police
officers.   It is crucial that you ask the questions;      where you

found the body and where it was taken.

Detective Superintendent McKay

When we put out the request for officers, having see^Tthe telex, I

rsyig each Division and asked them to send their best men and I am

sure they have.   Bearing that in mind is there anything anyone here
                            7
thinks we ought to be doing.     This is not a murder enquiry it is a

new situation for all of us.     If at any time there is an area you

think we ought to be considering, please let me know.



Thank you

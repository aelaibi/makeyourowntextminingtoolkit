DUCKENFIE/LD a n d a n u m b e r                    of     other         senior          officers,          followed            by a n

Intelligence             briefing             by D e t e c t i v e           Sergeant          CHARi^ESWORTH.                After       the

briefing,          we    were       all       supplied with a                      light       p a c k e d meal        and

instructed             that       all       officers          should          be    on    their       points       by     no     later

than     11.15 am a               po int      that        wa s     emphasised.

At    11.00 Am          I took          up    position             on    t         p i t ch m i d w a y     between          the      player

tunnel/and             the E S t a n d         Spion K o g /                  I d o n ’t       recall       the    exact         time        but

I remember             thinking             th at    the      spectators              were      entering          early,         and     1

took     t his     as a g o o d             sign     t ha t      the     turnstiles             were       open    ear ly,         rather

than     the      often       hurried           hunt       up of         turnstile             operators          to    open       up a n d

get    people          off    the       streets.              I remained              in this         position          doing a

general         patrol         between          p l a y e r s ’ tun n e l           and E Stand.                 During         that     time

I saw      several           V .I . P .      guests        arrive            and    talked         generally           with      the

came r a m e n / p r e s s / s p o r t s        pe rs o n a l i t i e s / T V         peo p i e .

Between         1.20      pm a n d a p p r o x i m a t e l y             1 . 45     pm    I had a          cooked meal             in    the

gymnasium          behind          the       North        Stand.

At    1.45      pm a p p r o x i m a t e l y ,        I went            back       out    o nt o     the    pitch and            I. was

immediately             aware       that        there         was       already a             good    number       of     people         in

the    ground and             the       d a y ’s w o r k         had     begun.

At    2,00      pm a S t e w a r d           pointed          out       to me a g r o u p            of 3 or 4 L i v e r p o o l

supporters             that       were       seated        in the            front       of    the    So ut h Stand.               I knew

that     with      it     being         a    capacity            crowd        that       there       was    no    chance         of

transferring             t h em     into        another            part       of    the       ground,       so    I decided             to

speak      to     them and          found           that      they were             from N o r t h e r n         Ireland and

seemed        decent         lads.            I advised             them       to     t a ke    off    their Li verpool

scarves         and     told       them       very        firmly         t h at     should         Liverpool           score,         not

for    them       to    j um p     up       cheering          as    this       would          cause     problems          and      I would

have     to     eject        them.           I continued                walking          up a n d     d o w n my       b e at    and     as

such     striking            up    several           short         conversations                with       peopie       on      the

first      fe w    rows.           This       was     a    policy            that     Chief        Superintendent                HOLE        had

encouraged             that       I think          he      rightly        believed             set     the        atmosphere          on

what       should        have      been an            enjoyable           pleasure             activity            for    the       fans.        I

remerriber a s k i n g            one      young        man who         t o l d me        he w a s         from Lon do n            what    he

had    p ai d      for      his    ticket,            he    said £50.00 and                    I believed            him,       although

I said        something            to      him     like,       ’Y o u m u s t        be m a d ’ „           I quickly           spotted a

good       number        of L i v e r p o o l         s u p p o r t e r s in the              S o u t h S t a n d a nd         I tried        to

get    round          t h e m all,         advising           them about             cheering.               T h e y all        seemed        to

understand,              but      it wa s        at     the    back       of m y m i n d           that       this       could       c ause

problems,             but    I knew          that       cros s      transfer             was     impossible.

A t 2.. 3 0      pm    I remember              looking         at      my w a t c h       to     see       h ow    the    numbers          were

going,        I was         surprised            to     see    both       the Ko p /and S o u t h S t a n d a p p a r e n t l y

full,       but L i v e r p o o l          a c c o m m o d a t i on     only                   full.         The     centre          pen    on

stands        a n d wing s.

Just       after 2.30             pm    I noticed             that      the     upper           level       of     the    elevated

terrace          (N W ) was        getting            quite       full       and     they        had       started with              the

pushing          wav e.           I thought             how    stupid         they were              and      how easily             it was

for    someone           to get         seriously             hurt.           I t ’s a         problem            that    we    have       with

all    the       big     clubs         that      visit        us,      but    fortunately a                   p r o b l e m we       have

managed          to    overcome            with       our     awn      supporters.                 It s t a r t e d w h e n          the    new

Kop    was       o p e n e d a n d at          that        time     I was       employed             on V i d e o        Camera

duties        in      the    Police          Control.             We    spent        a    long       time         trying       to

identify           the      culprits           t hat       were     starting             the     wav e,      a n d we      dealt       with

it    by    putting          several           officers           at    the     back,          which        resulted           in m a n y

ejections             an d arrests.                We      seemed       to    h a ve      cracked           that     problem within

a few       home       games       and       the      same     went       for      obscene           chanting.             We       seemed

to    be    l u c k y as         far    as     racist         chants         go,     even        though           we^have       had    black

players,           but      we    h a ve     always         had a       policy           of     ’f i r m    but     fair'.

Just       after       t h at     t im e     (still         just       after       2.30         p m ) I remember               thinking

that       the     Liverpool            train must             be      late     or       something,               because       of    the

lack     of       nu!               ijr the L i v e r p o o l            end.            I walked              down       to P o l i c e

Constab1                                 wh o      .1 s a w    ha d a     radio.              He     said       t h at     there         had      been

loads        of       bothVr        outside             the    ground,         I    think          he    said        that     they          had

wrecked           a     pub      somewhere.

By     this       t i me      the       supporters             were      baiting             one a n o t h e r         from        one      end       to

the     other          and       the a t m o s p h e r e        w a s n ’t good,              some       people           seemed

particularly                  bitter          when       chanting.             I said           to      quite        a few,         "Do       that

a gain and             y o u ’ re o u t . "             I considered               taking          one     out as a n              example            to

se e    if    it w o u l d          settle            them     down,      but       every          time        I ha d      strong           words

Stand,        the        noise          was     so      great     now     t h at        I was        having          to    shout         at      the

top     of my           voice.           They         were     using      obscene             chants           and     baiting           the

Liverpool               fans.           Some       were       starting         to       put     their          legs       over      the w al l

as     if to          get     to    the L i v e r p o o l         end a n d         I thought              t h at      if t h e s e

I thought               t h at     the       g am e     had    better         get       started          soon        or we         w il l     have a

some     pre-match                 entertainment                on the         pitch.              All     these          people

th at    the          pitch        quality            was     more    important               to     the       game.         I w a s n ’t

ra dio     so    I couldn't               monitor            what       was     going       off.        I sa w m o r e          of       them

what     wa s    going          off,        I remember               feeling         quite          angry,       thinking,               "Wh at

the    b l o o d y hell          is g o i n g         off,        get     them      arrested          or      get    them       back       in

by    this      time       the    crowd          b e h i n d me         had     seen      the       fans      invading          the

pit ch .        The      Notts      f an s       were        seething           a n d all       I    could       h e ar    w a s , " W e ’ ll

Heysel        again."            The      Notts         f a ns      were      shouting          to me         directly          now,        "

Stop     the     bastards."                 They        were        pointing         to     the      goal.          None       of    us,

including            the     fans,        had a ny           ide a w h a t       was      going       off.          I thought             if     I

move     from        here,       these          f ans      w il l    be a c r o s s       the w a l l         and    t h e n we          have

one    has      got      the     potential              to    be a        lot w o r s e .           I knew       I was         only       one

man,     but     I seemed              to       be    holding them               back,      1 w as         pleading with                 the

fans     to     sit      down and           c a lm      down.             Somewhere             in^tji^^rffidd 1 e of               this,        I

saw a senior               officer          run       on to         the    p i t c h ai^K*st o p the m a t c h .                     I

clearly         l ea d     to    the      loss        of     life.            I thought             it w a s     only a matte r                  of

time     before          they were              coming        o ver       the    w a l l.       A    f ew L i v e r p o o l

went     between           them        and       persuad ed them                to    turn       back,        it w a s g o i n g

against         the      grain         not       to     have        arrested         them       but     I t h o u g h t if          I do,        my

s tan d will          be     over.          I    probably            used       foul      language            in m y a t t e m p t          to

A Sergeant            and Police            Constable             walked          past        me     from      the       Leppings          Lane

I remember            seeing         the    players          looking            confused             and      hanging           around         on

attacked         him.          I reflect                                 sals we           were      dealing          wit h.

At 3.0 5        pm/3.10         pm a p p r o                             saw several                 /ans       coming          o v e r the

stopping         them moving               forward.              My    first         i d ea     of      the    problem           (gross

understatement)                w as    when        an a m b u l a n c e rushes                  onto         the    p i t c h a nd       pulls

up    behind       the     goal.           I then          see    people          climbing              onto       the    to p    of     it,

which     was      only        confirming             my    view       of      the    animals            we w e r e       dealing

with.       S h o r tl y after             t hat      I saw       someone            being         carried          o n one       of     the

walking         along      the       track       of    the N o r t h S t a n d .

Still     my     thoughts            are    focused          intently             on a m a s s i v e           pitch        invasion

and    h av e    we     enough        officers             to deal          with      it.          Several          officers            ar e

now    coming         onto     the     pitch,          but       t h e y are         all      going          up to       the     far     end.

I think         they want            more       even       spreading.                Some       fans         r ush d o w n       towards

the    running         track          for    the a m b u l a n c e s .           Th e   photographers               have       dumped

all    their         gear    on the          track         and    I start         to    pick       it    up to m a k e         way          for

the    ambulance,            but       the      first       one    drives         straight          across         the     pitch,            so

I just       throw         the    rest       to      the    side,        thinking        how       stupid       I was

thinking           about     t h e se       b l o k e s ’ equipment when                  it     now      l o o k e d as      if       life

really       had      been       lost.

Several        groups        were       n ow      coming         forward         towards         the     Notts      fans,

baiting        them,        shouting            at    Police       Officers,            "Murdering            bastards,

but    I have         never       seen       such anger            on     such a        l a r ge    scale       before.                 I

tried       to a p p e a l       to    the N o t t s        fans,        telling        them       th at     the    s i t u a t i o n wa s

very      serious,          pe op l e       had      lost       their     lives.           All      I can       remember               is

their        bit     for      today.            I wa s         only    too       glad      to    go,       but    because          I was

very      fami liar           with        the     football            ground and               its    dut ies         I went       round

to     the    gymnasium              to    see       if    I could          help,         but    things          looked       very

organised and                 cons i de r i ng            the    enormity           of     the       situation          I considered

it     looked a very                 professional                set       up.         I ret i f § 4 f r o m           duty       at

If     1 look        back      on the           situation             now,       I can         only    believe          t ha t     even

when      the      Police          were        faced       with a tragedy                  of    such          enormity,          t hat    it

was      only       the      professionalism                    of    the    Force         that       prevented          the       deaths

of     further         p e r son s,        the       obvious          consequences               of a m a s s i v e          pitch

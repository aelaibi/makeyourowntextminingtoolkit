               paid     6 for my ticket when                          gave       it me.         My ticket          is for the

At about       half        past    ten the m o rn in g          of the     game myself,                           ana

                     started off          from work        in the        van to the       game at

Sheff i e l d .       At    about    ten to eleven we               p i c k e d _____________ up at        his     home

a d d re s s in                       We then          continued on our way to Sheffield.                          We

d i d n ’t stop on our             jour ne y or at anyt im e              or e xp er ie nc e a delay.

On our       journey        in the     car    no-one       consumed any alcohol                 in the    car.         We

a r r i v e d at S h e f f i el d about          one    o ’clock        (1300),    I d o n ’t know what

s treet we           parked       in but we were only five m i nu te s walk away from the

ground.        When we        parked         we went      to a chip shop, had a sit down a nd

ate    our    chips,.        We then         s t ar te d walk in g       towards the ground as we

could see..           We had only            been walking a mi nu te              and we went          into a     pub

called The Stones                 a big      pub that was all white.                    The    pub was all

b oar d e d up and we had             to knock          on the door to get               in.     When we got           in

the    pub    vjas    full    of L iv erp ool          fans,,     We were       told to go to the            pub by

a mate       up here)______ |I think              his    name     is because        the this               had been

there    last year           to a chri st en in g and the                 licensee       had said to go back

anytime,       so thats           why we went          we just     k no ck ed on the d o o r and said we

were    friends        of             rod they let us             in.     Once     inside we had two

pints. We had got            in the        pub         about     half    past     one    (1330)    and left        at

ten    past    two     (1410)..

Once    out    of the        pub we were          given no d i r e c ti o n we           just f ol lowed         the

crowd towards              the gound.         Towards       the ground at           no time at all          did        I

see any fighting              or disorder          or drunkeness.

We a r ri v e d at         the ground from Leppings Lane at about                              quarter    past

t w o , we were        outside       the     first      set of gates with a large mass                     of

people.           In the mi dd le         of the mass were              two    police     horses       that was

the only          Police     I saw.        There were           no orderly q u e u e ’s just            a mass     of

people.        We were given no directions                        by    the Po li ce      for the

turnstiles.          All     the    two Po li ce        officers        kept    saying        on the    horses

were    “S to p      pushing"       but you       couldn't        help     it because          of the m asses          of

p e o p 1e j u a t p u s h i n g

We    finally got        to the          t urnstiles      and there were           no stewards          or Police

a ut side of t,he t ur ns tiles.                 I mus t add t hat          b ef or e the t ur ns t i 1 es ar e

the    gates,       in front        of the gates was were                 the   two Police        horses were.

T here were         no stewards           or Police       on the gates          or the     turnstiles.

There were ma ss es           of fans        outside       the gates        and    in front       of the

t urnstiles.

As    I got to a turnstile                 I could see at the              other    side a P o l i c e m a n and

a Steward.           l'n front       of me at       the    turnstile waiting             to go thro ug h was

a fan who said to the                    tur ns ti le man and told him he hadn't                       got a

ticket       so he w o u l d n ’t let him            thro ug h at w hi ch the t ur nstile man

called the P o l i c e m a n over.               The P o l i c e m a n said       let him through

because       it was     impossible          far him to get              back   out of the        crowd.        The

bloke      in front was            let through.

Myself and                                went   through the         terrace turnstiles an d                  the

other      three went        thro ug h the N o r th Stand,                turnstiles.

I had no d if fi c ul t y           in finding my t urnstile                I just      followed        the

crowd.        The    only d if fi c ul t y       I had entering            or getting       to turnstile

was    the    fact    that    there was a mass               of    people and no o rd er ly queue.

There were          no other        places or gates           open only the t urnstiles                  and the

actual       entrance      gates.

At    no time at all          did        I see a ny b od y enter          the     ground    illegally only

as    I said the bloke              in front       of me.         Once    through the turnstile                the

t ur nstile man kept my stub and                     I retained my ticket w hich                      I have.

Once    through the turnstiles                   I was with                              an d    I saw the

tunnel.        We both wa lk ed            towards     the    tunnel       and through          it.

As we wa lk ed through the                  tunnel     e ve r yb o dy was       going    forwards        towards

the    standing       area.        The    tunnel    w a s n t ’t full      we were walking at our                   own

pa c e .

B e t w e e n the t ur ns ti le s and the tunnel                   were Police       and stewards
                                                                                                             PAGE


walk in g around..            In front       of the    tunnel        there was        no P o l i c e m e n or

s t ew a rd    standing       there,    or    inside       the     tunnel    and there were            none       in

the    standing area-*           At    no time at all              was    I bodily     searched.            At    no

time    at all      did    I experience         or see any fighting,                  disorder        or

drunk en es s      inside      the ground       tunnel       or a ny wh er e        else.,     I saw no one

co nsuming       alcohol       inside    the ground.

As    I got     to the end of the tunnel                   wit h                       we both went              left

of the fenc in g and stood t ou ching                      the middle         barrier        near to the

centre        fencing.        We were    standing          d ir ec t ly behind the barrier                  in the

middle.         Myself     a n d ______________ had only been standing                        there minutes

w he n w e could feel           gradual       pressure       from behind.             We started to get

crushed so we ducked                 under    the    barrier        thats    both of us and m oved

sl ig ht l y further          dawn    towards       the front.            I identify         this    on the grid

as    ref     no L3 where       I first       stood by the barrier                  and the     second one

K7 where        I e v en t ua l ly    fin ished      up,

I d i d n ’t see a barrier             break,        I first        took up my       position standing

by the        barrier at       two    thirty    nine       (1439).         I knew    it was     this       time    as

it said so on the ground                 clock       w hi ch was         on my right,         I wasnt

s ub je ct e d to any excessive               crowd crush at              this    time just         gradual

pressure.

At    this     point at the          barrier    I was wit h                      and w hen we both

du ck e d u n d er n ea t h    because       I was    holding        his    coat.,     I saw no

fight i n g     or disorder.

As we       both stood up from the barrier                       there was a gap a pp eared

straight        in front       of us of about          twenty        feet and we both got                  pushed

towa r d s     the end of the          gap.     Once at the              end we were         only about          four

feet    from the       fencing and about              ten feet           from the fencing            to our

right       s p l itting   up pens three and four.                       We were we dg ed solid and                I

c o u l d n ’t move    I had my        right    hand above my head because                      I had a

blow up ball o o n about              six foot       in length ye ll ow             in colour        in my
                                                                                                       PAGE


hand,                had a y el l ow       banana above       his    head w hi ch was about

three     feet.       At    this    point    the    pressure was       incredible        on my body

a nd at      one    point    my ears a c t u a l l y     popped.      I was    having     problems

.breathing.          The    presure       became    worse    and    I was now    pushed up

a ga in st    the fence,          chest first at this          point.     I was       being    pushed

do wnwards         onto    the floor a n d        let go of my balloon.           Above me a

bloke was          holding    onto    the fence and one             of his feet were          just by

the    front       of my    right armpit          and his    other    foot was    on the       right

side     of my neck..         My head was          twisted    to the    left and       I was

s l i g h t l y h u n ch ed up,      I then saw the gate             leading    on to the       pitch

in my     pen being         opened    by a P o l i c e m a n only about        five    people were

let out,           T h e n the gates were          closed.

At this       point       the m at ch had started.            The actual       surge     to the

front     s t a rt ed whe n       I got    to the gap and the          players    e n te re d onto

the    pitch.

A fter    the      gate    had been       closed    people    then started to scale             the

fence     to get      out and all          the    people were       started and screaming

to get out.           People were          crawling      on top of me to get           onto the

fence     to get out,             I could see       people dropping       over the        fence onto

the    pitch and the Police were                   pushing    them back over.            I think the

P olice were         doing    this as       they thought       it was a pitch          invasion but

b ecause      there were          so many    climbing       over    the top they then

r ealised       something was wrong,                The Po li ce     that were    in front        of

the fence were             being    pleaded w it h       by people     in the    crowd to help,

I could hear          this    but    not    see    it.   The Police      in front       paid no

attention          to the    pleads       of help.

The    bloke was          still    standing       on top of me hanging          onto    the fence

to my     left was a little               lad about      twelve years     old wear in g a

g rey sk i jacket an d b 1a c k s pi ky j e 11 ed hai r .                He was       screarni n g ,     I

caught       the fencing wit h my            right arm and with my             left    I grabbed the

kid a r o u nd      the waist        and    pulled him towards me an d move                   his     face

towards       the     fence    so he       could    breath.       As    I did that there             seemed

to fae a      lapse     in the       pressure an d         I moved      back    slight/.        At    this

the bloke        stand in g        a top of me fell          to the floor and            landed on

his    back a nd the young             lad fell       on top of him.             The    lad

who    fell    from the            fence was wear in g        jeans      in his twenties.              There

was    a sudden surge a gain and                   I was    pushed onto         the fence a gain

which    I grab be d w ith both hands.                     I dropped s li gh tl y and           I landed

on the     bloke       on my shins.

I star te d      to    crawl       up the fence w ith my hands.                  I stood on the

bloke    on the        floor       for about a minute.             I c o u l d n ’t help      standing

on him but          because        of the    pressure       from the back         I c o u l d n ’t help

it so    I started         to pull         up the fence as         hard as       I could to get             off

him.    But    it, took       so    long because       of the      pressure       from the       people

behind.        I crawled up the fencing and grabbed                            the overhang with my

hands and m an a ge d to swing my                   legs up and         I dropped down onto                the

other    side.         At this       point    I saw the       players      walking      off the

pitch.        I picked myself              up off    the floor and w al ke d onto               the

gras se d a re a a nd saw Alan H A N S O M             talking         to a spectator         on the

floor    two     feet away from me.

My    chest    felt     really tight and             I was    having      d if fi c ul t y breathing.

I looked       behind and the best way                 I can describe            it is that          the

people were           like squas he d fish against                the fence.           I saw the gate

being    op en ed and         I wa lk ed off        towards      the N or th     stand.       After

about    five m i nu te s          I saw                      in the      crowd and went and

s t o o d w i t h h im .

After    about        fift ee n minutes myself             and            went onto       the    pitch

and    found                          wa nd e ri ng a ro u nd the       pitch     in a dist re ss ed

state.

In the     pen      I d i d n ’t witness       any deaths         but    I saw    people      collapse

«
 by that      I mea n   there      faces     going     blue a nd        they were    just

collapsing       to the floor           close      fay me,       I c a n ’t describe      there

clothing       of the    people       collapsing,             The only bodies        I saw were

those    on the      pitch.        E v e n t u a l l y we    returned to the N or th S ta nd and

joined                      and                      and we       then    left    the ground by

choice     this w o u ld be at about               twenty five          to four    (1535),       We

werent     d i r e c te d out     of the ground             by a n y b o d y we just wa lk ed out as

a group.        I c a n ’t remember          any    loud speaker          announcements.

At    no time at all         before       during     or after       the game      did    I witness

anything which          I consider         to be      criminal.




In my vieM,! the mai n factor                in the deaths          or    injuries      to the     fans

was    poor    planning      by the FA w it h           regard to the a l l oc a ti o n of

tickets       and s e gr e ga t io n of supporters,               the    stewards    and ground

staff    didn't      have    a clue how to            control      the    situation.        There

w eren't      enough Police,          they had no            control,    and there was        no

control       over   them.        There were P o l i c e w o m e n       I saw    crying amongst

themselves       not helping          the supporters            who were     injured.

From    start    to fin i sh the          s i tu at io n was      c o mp le te ly down to bad

organisation.           Whe n the         realis a ti on of the           s ituation set      in it

w a s n ’t dealt wit h very well               by the e m e r g e nc y services         or ground

staff    due to the fact            that     there weren't          en ou gh of them and           they

weren't       sent   to the       scene    quic kl y enough.

               I arn a L i v e r p o o l       supporter.            On S a t u r d a y      15 April       1989,       together w it h

               t h re e f r i e n d s ,                                                                    and

               I went        to the       football         m a t c h at H i l l s b or o ug h ,       I paid        6 for my

               ticket        from Liv er po ol            F.C.     It was       for       the L e p p i ng s     Lane    S t an di ng

               Terrace,            We t r a v e l l e d    in my     car    to Sheffield, a r r i v i n g at about                  11,20

               am.      We     parked      on a small            industrial           estate      a bout    one and a half

               miles      from       the ground,            We walked, to the ground,                      saw a lot of         police,

               but there was              no trouble.

               As we a p p r o a c h e d       the    terrace        t ur n s t i l e s    there was        a large       crowd

               outside.            This w o u ld      be about        2,10      pm,        There w er e        no o rd e rl y queues

               and      people       did not appear              to be getting             t hr o ug h the       turnstiles.            I

               saw three m o u n t e d          police officers.                One of them           I remember          had a grey

               m ou st a ch e .     He was      s ho ut ing      at the       crowd,,         The    only      police     officer           I
                                                                                                                  PAGE


saw on foot was               trying       to hold       closed a perimeter                 gate - that was

some    time after            I arrived,.          About 2.50          pm I became           aware       that    the

gate    to the       right      of the       turns ti les        had been opened,                 and    I follo wed

the    crowd through.                No    person       took my ticket.               I used the mens             toilet

near    to the       tunnel         entrance,           The only sign           I saw was          over    the    tunnel

and    it said       'STANDING'.             I w a l k e d thr ou gh      the tunnel,              there was       no

problem,          I ended, up in pen 3,                  that    is on the           right    hand side as             I

left    the      tunnel.        I was       not aware          of a control           fence       dividing       pens 3

and 4 because            I had not          been to this          gro und before,

It w ou ld       be about 2.55             pm wh en      I got     into the          pen.     As soon as          I. got

into    p o s it io n    I was       being       pushed    forward,        The        game    had started and                  I

was    trying       to w a t c h the match,              it was     only when          I. realised that my

arms were         cr us he d ag ai n s t my sides               that    I began to get              concerned,             1

noted a crash barrier                     on my    left.        I saw an elde rly man                   crushed

against       the    barrier,         I think       his    chest was against                 it,        The mans       3.ip is

were    blue,       he was      leaning          over    the    top of the           barrier,       his    resistance

had gone,           I remember a. yo un ge r              chap,     a well       built man          standing       next

to him trying            to hold          people    back,       he was    shouting           'I can't       do

nothing       for him - I can't do                  nothing       for    him,’         I was       slowly getting

pushed further            fo rw ar d       towards       the wire mesh.              I was    trying to hold

people     up a l o n g s i d e and stop them stumbl ing and                           trying       to get       some

calm    in our       immediate            area.     The    crush       continued,           and    I then became

aware    of a body come from behind my                           left    shoulder an d just                sent    down

to the     ground        because          people    ste pp ed     back.         He    landed on his             back,

looking       up.       His    lips were          blue,    he a p p e a r e d    to be dead.              He would be

in his 30's,            wearing       a    "V*    neck    sweater,       beige        in colour.           He    had a

L i ve rp oo l    scarf       on,   and a pair of blue jeans                     on.        These were          opened,

The n a po l i c e m a n       c 3.imbed ove r t he            ra i 1 i ngs on my       left and          came t o t he

body,    a space d e v e l o p e d and             I was able          to get        out of       the    crush by

ge tting      over      the fence          on my    left,       someone     standing          on these          railings
                                                                                                           PAGE


gave me a hand up,                  I got       into    pen 4,     there was a. lot of            pol ic em en       in

it by then.               I made my way          to the       front and was able           to get out -onto

the    pitch th ro u g h the             small    gate at        the front,        I headed       towards          the

so ut h sand side and sat                     down to get over           the    shock.     I gave

assistance              to people       taking a d v e r t i s in g     hoard ing s     down to use as

stretch er s.             I ran down ar o u n d the area where                   the    bodies were       spread

on the       pitch,        people       placed a body of a man,                 I can't    descr ibe      him,       we

ran wi t h         him up the       ramp to the side              of the No rt h Stand.            We were

directed           to    place    the    body under        the    stand.        On the way       back to, the

pitch      I saw a po l i c e m a n and           p o l i ce wo ma n    carrying       another    body,    I

said     *1*11          do that,    you go back            and. help". This body was a l r e a d y                 on

a hoar di ng            and we took        it to the       same    spot     under the N or th        stand.          I

think      this         body was    covered over           so I c a n ’t describe          it.

There was a bit of                 chanting       from the Notts           su ppo rte rs    and some       of the

Li v e r p o o l    su pporters         were    going    to    charge     them,    I tried, to calm them

down.        Sh or t l y a f t e r w a r d s    a line of        police a r ri ve d and diffu sed

the    situation.

Near     to the          players    dugout       I saw a little           lad su ff eri ng       from shock.

I a s k e d a police             sergeant       to assist        him.     This    he did,

By this        time most          of the       bodies      were    being taken way.

After      some         time when       the    crowds      had mo st ly gone, I made my way out

t h r o u g h the        tunnel    and out.         I found that my friends were O.K.                          I

s u f fe re d a sore         chest and          shock as a result              of the    incident,

I did not see any of the                       ba rriers      collapse,        I think    I was able       to get

out    in time,



I want       to add that           I have       a l r e a d y made a sta te me nt        to Sir Harry

LIVERMORE           (Solicitor)          after a request           on the       local    radio   station.

                The    serial        Serge an t       was P O L PS 1771 J O H N S T O N E         from C2 Rawisarsh.           We

                were     de ta i l e d to        patrol     an area of H e rr ie s Rd aro und                 the Five Arches

                 public       house.          Fr om   1130 am onwards               a steady      influx     of No tt i n g h a m

                Su pp o r t e r s    filled       the    pub to     capacity.             The   doors ware        closed at noon

                and    people        then brought           canned      Deer        from a local       off    licence and

                brought        out     its entre         stock,.      The     crowds,          (between 300         800 at my

                estimation)           wars      in good spirits              and a l t h o u g h o b v io us ly    in va rio usl y

                differ' in g states             of    intoxi cation made              their way to the            ground.

                At 2 , 4 3 pm        ( "1445 ) we were         i n s t ra c t e d      tow a 1 k t a C lay w h eel sL n f o r a

                meal,         I could hear            c o n v er sa ti ons    on       my radio    from an      inspector       at the

                Le pp i n g    Ln gate.          At 3 , OS     pm   (1502)          we were     outside      the football
ground at the Pe n i s t o n e Rd end and were              instru cte d to enter          the

ground.        We w a l k e d to the La pp in gs Ln end,          I could see what ap pe ar ed

to be a d i s t u r ba n c e   in the terraces.          As we a p p r o a c h e d    I could see one

ma n s q u a s h e d and blue     in the face wi t h hundreds             of    people on top of

him and       being    squa sh ed themselves,.

My    colleague DC L A T H E M     stood on hoardings and             leaned over        the high

perimeter       fence and began extra cti ng             people,      I "watched his        back'

ta king      hold of fans who were            trying    to fight wi th the Police           to get to

their     friends and       relatives        on the terraces,         I ph ysi cal ly took

several       people away from the fence               to the goalmouth,             I saw a body

being     passed over       the fence and m a n a g e d     to find a stret che r wi th three

other     un kn ow n P C ’s we    ran the      length of the       ground..       The man was

o bv io us ly dead.       At   the N o t t i n g h a m end I was    spat       on by a man who

looked at the body             I was    carrying and he shou ted           ''The only good

scouser       is a dead s c o u s e r " .

We    left    the     body near    the g y m n a s i um and went      back.       By this time all

the    people       behind the    fence had also         tur ned blue,

I carried two more             bodies    to the gymnasium.          One        was a yo uth aged IS --

20,    the third a child aged. 12 - 14,                  They were      taken        to the gymnasium,

I then es co r t e d a St J o h n ’s ambul anc e          nurse    from        the field as she

had co l l a p s e d and took          ner   to th e,P oli ce   room,

I was     ord er ed to form a line across               the field with other            officers and

for half an hour kept             the fans apart wi th the other PC's,                    I was   then

i n st ru ct ed to unde rt ak e a van          patrol    for an hour aro und the ground and

during       this   time took a M e r s e y s i d e DS to the Boys             Club as he had     lost

his    son,

I was     stood down ar o u n d 8 pm.

             At 9„0 0 am S a t u r d a y       15th April           1989     <130489,        I com me nc ed duty and

              a t t e n d e d at H i l l s b o r o u g h Footblal        S t a d i u m where     I took up duties         in

              the P o l i c e Room.        My a l l o c a t e d     duty for the day being that                  of C u st od y

             Sergeant       along wi t h s e rg ea nts            838 Long and             1164 Colley,



             Once    the Po l i c e Room was              pre pa red for        prisoner       re ce pti on there was

              little     for the staff           to do unless            someone was arrested.



             A P o l i c e UHF     radio     is n o r ma ll y       in the Po li ce Room an d on this day                   I

              h ea rd several        me ss a g e s    from of fi cer s         on duty outside          the ground

              relating      to   large groups            of    people on the          fo ot pat h outside        public

              h ouses drinking.             I particularly              remember      one mes sag e w hi ch named the

              'Royal'     Pu b l i c House,          P e n i s t o n e Road.     According        to   records,       the first
                                                                                                              P AGE


pris on er who was            brought        to the Po lic e Roo m had been a r r e s t e d at                   1*40

pm for a t t e m p t i n g      to enter          the    ground wh il st        in pos se ss io n of alcohol



From      that     time onwards,          prisoners          star ted ar ri v i n g at the           police      room

initially          in ones and twos               but,     at about 2 . 1 5       pm the     number     of

pr isoners         a r r iv in g at    the Po l i c e Ro om         in cr eas ed d r a m a t i c a l l y and,

between 2.15            pm and 3.15          pm w h e n any att em pt          to     process any other

pr isoners         was abandoned,            25    prisoners        were    brought       to the     police

room.        This     number      does    not      include        those    brought       to the Police Roo m

prior      to ejection.



Th es e    pr isoners were            from both ends of the                  gro und and so were             both

N o t t i n g h a m Forest and Li v e r p o o l            fans.



The    one      thing     I did notice about                the vast m a j o r i t y of these           prisoners

was    that,       even      if they had not             been a r r e s t e d for alcohol          related

offences,          they had been d r i nk in g alcohol,                    some     in very     large

q u a n t i t i e s and most       of them were             very ve rb al ly abu si ve and a gg re ss iv e

 One      prisoner        a s s a u l t e d the ar r e s t in g     officer whi lst          being    booked        in

by the       custody sergeant             and had to be phy si ca ll y                 restrained.           Out si de

the    police       room and to the               rear of the N o r t h S ta nd           it is usual

pract ic e       to have      a mo b i l e     cell      unit     pa rked and for prisoners              to be

transferred           from the Po li ce R o o m             into the       cell     unit and whe n that             is

full      the    prisoners ware taken                   to H a m m e r t o n Ro a d Pol ice S ta ti on        for

v e r i f i c a t i o n of   identities and for other                     en qu iri es    to be    completed.



On this         occasion,       there were          two     cell    units an d one of two Personal

Carriers         parked outside           the Po li ce Ro o m for             prisoner       transporta tio n.

We m a n a g e d    to send a small               number     of    prisoners        to H a m m e r t o n Road

before       the    large     influx      of      prisoners        but were       preve nte d from sending
an y more      because        of the sheer           volume         of    prisoners        ar ri vin g at       the

Po l i c e Room.       S h o r t l y before         prisoner         process was abandoned;                    I felt we

were a p p r o a c h i n g    the    stage where          the       numbers      of    prisoners would

o v e r w h e l m our f ac il it ie s,         a s i t u a t io n    I have      never      before     known.



At about 3. 1 3        pm a female me mb er               of the St Jo h n Am b u l a n c e B r ig ad e                came

into    the Police Room,                 e x p l a i n e d that     there were         large numbers            of

casual ti es      ou tside and            re questing a d h e s i v e         labels       for    casualty

ident if ic at io n.          These       labels were         su pp l i e d and        I then a c c o m p a n i e d

this    lady ou tside          the       police     room where            I was met        by a scene of

pandermonium.           There were             people     lying all           over     the floor,         on

s tr et ch er s an d     in chairs.



I then M>ent towards                the     ramp vMhich leads              from the        pitch to the area

near    the Po li ce Room.                This    ramp    is si tu at ed         between the No rth St and

and the S p i o n Kop,              As    I reached the             ramp,     I was met          by numerous

Thank you for your recent letter to Michael H o w a r d , s n r l n a i n n n n p
from
          about the tragic events at Hillsborough.

As you will be aware, the Home Secretary has undertaken to consider
carefully the points which were made in the programme Hillsborough,
land the representations which have been made to him by the bereaved
families and by others. He has emphasised that he would not take
the decision to reopen the inquiry lightly but would need to be
convinced that it would be in the public interest to do so and that
it would stand a chance of providing a better understanding than
there is at present of what happened on that terrible day.

In coming to his decision the Home Secretary will consider whether
there is any new evidence; he will also consider whether that
evidence appears to be of such significance that had it been put
before Lord Taylor or before the coroner, either the outcome of the
Taylor inquiry or the verdict of the jury would have been different.

The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire has undertaken to provide the
Home Secretary with a detailed report of all the points raised by
the programme. The Home Secretary has promised that he will reach a
decision on any further action to be taken as soon as he has been
able to consider all the issues.

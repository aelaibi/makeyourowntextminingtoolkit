PRIME MINISTER                              2 August 1989



     HILLSBOROUGH:    LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR'S INTERIM REPORT


Lord Justice Taylor's interim report concludes:


     that the main reason for the disaster was the failure
     of police control;


     that Sheffield City Council were dilatory and inefficient
     in exercising their responsibility for safety at the
     ground;


     that Sheffield Wednesday were to blame for not acting
     to ensure that fans could be evenly distributed between
     the pens on the terraces at the Leppings Lane end.


Little or no blame is attached to the Liverpool fans.


The Police


The criticism of the police is very damning.     The Chief
Superintendent in charge is shown to have behaved in an
indecisive fashion.    ’Eo make matters worse, the senior officers
involved sought to duck all responsibility when giving evidence
to the Inquiry.    Their defensiveness apparently infuriated
the Judge.


Although the Chief Constable - Peter Wright - was not involved
directly in any way, Douglas Hurd thinks that he will have
to resign .    The enormity of the disaster, and the extent
to which the Inquiry blames the police, demand     this.     The
hope - which is shared by Lord Justice Taylor - is that
Peter Wright would announce his intention of resigning as
soon as his successor can take up the post.     This would
enable him to continue to lead his force during the very
difficult next few months.                                                                                                                               It is very likely that the families
of those killed at Hillsborough.will bring actions against
the South Yorkshire police.

Peter Wright is very highly regarded, and this will be a
sa^d end to an otherwise distinguished career.                                                                                                                               Leaving
him aside, the defensive - and at times close to deceitful
- behaviour by the senior officers in South Yorkshire sounds
depressingly familiar.                                                                                                         Too many senior policemen seem to
lack the capacity or character to perceive and admit faults
in their organisation.                                                                                                           (I shall be sending you a separate
note on today's seminar led by Douglas Hurd on improving
the calibre of senior police management).


Sheffield City Council


The report's criticism of Sheffield City Council's dilatory
behaviour over the Safety Certificate vindicates the Government'
decision to give the national licensing authority power
to ensure that local authorities are carrying out their
                                                                             •*".........     ■.................................................." - y

    "safety" functions in a consistent and effective way.                                                                                                                              This
should be helpful in terms of the Football Membership icheme
Bill.


Sheffield Wednesday


The main criticism of the club is that they made a number
of piecemeal changes to the layout of the terraces (some

in response to police suggestions) without thinking through
and acting upon the implications for capacity and crowd
control.                                They also tolerated poor and confusing signposting
wEich encouraged fans to stream down the central tunnel.
The report concludes that the club could have done more
on the day to alert the police to the fact that Liverpool

fans were slow in arriving, and could therefore be expected
to come in vast numbers all at once.                                                                                                                               The club could also
have done more to alert the police to the uneven distribution
of fans between the terrace pens.


Taylor recommendations


Lord Justice Taylor recommends a number of measures "capable
of being implemented forthwith and where possible before
the commencement of the 1989/90 season".                                                                                                                                    There should be
no difficulty in welcoming these.                                                                                                                       Action is for the police,
clubs}'     local authorities and local emergency services.
The Home Office will issue guidance to encourage prompt
and consistent implementation.


Conclusion


The interim report is likely to have little direct effect
on the passage of the Football Membership Scheme Bill.
Ministers are on record as saying that hooliganism did not
appear to be the root cause of the disaster at Hillsborough.


The main impact of the report will be on perceptions of
the police.                  It is very critical, and will sap confidence
                                                      f * * 1                                                  »w n — —                                                         *— » .......................................... I.—

in the police force, despite the report's praise for the
behaviour of individual constables who had to extricate
the dead and dying in the first half-hour of the carnage.
Liverpool fans - who have caused trouble in the past - will
feel vindicated.                        Aggressive behaviour by fans towards the
police may be encouraged.                                                                                   It is a very sorry episode.

But there seems no reason to think that the report’s conclusions
are wrong.

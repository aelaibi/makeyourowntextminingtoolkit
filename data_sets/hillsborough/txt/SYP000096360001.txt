                        9.00 AM, SUNDAY 16 APRIL 1989

Chief Constable:    I'm not in the business of questioning decisions,
                    questioning graphics, I know that everything that was done
                    was done in the proper spirit ana proper attitude of
                    dealing with a very very difficult situation but it is the
                    chronology of events which it seems to me are essential
                    for me to get in my mind.  I thought the best way we could
                    do this is to go through the events as I understand* them
                    and to get the individuals who can comment on those events
                    as I understand them to say so.   Don't be concerned about
                    disagreeing with me and if you disagree with my
                    understanding of what I think happened say so but it's
                    really an ability to grasp the overall picture.   I think
                    I've got a good idea of it now b}it there will be detail.
                    Each of you will have in your mind the detail of events
                    you witnessed and we know the parameters of what you
                    see are very narrow when tired and therefore don't try and
                    adjust your mind to what someone else is saying.   Stick to
                    what you know, stick to what you saw and don't attempt to
                    add explanations of it or try and make logic of it because
                    there are so many illogical aspects.   So we open the gates
                    as 12.00 noon and by 2.30 pm the Nottingham section of the
                    ground was fairly full but at that time I think it's true
                    that the control in the ground realised that there were a
                    lot of gaps and a lot of areas to fill within the
                    Liverpool stand.  That's at 2.30 pm. ■ Did anything happen
                    before 2.30 pm that anybody sees as significant?


Ch Supt            I looked out at 2.30 pm.   The Nottingham fans had got into
Duckenfield:       the Spion Kop and as far as I was concerned it was pretty
                    full, they were in the other areas on the south stand and
                    it was remarkable as far as I was concerned that the north

                           stand was almost empty and also the Leppings Lane stand,
                           particularly on the terracing.


        Chief Constable:   Can anyone give an explanation as to why they weren't
                           there?


        Supt Marshall:     Because they were drinking outside off-licences.


        Chief Constable:   Is this personal perception?


        Supt Marshall:     No it's not perception sir I've actually seen it, we have
                           seen it, its fact. The Gateway supermarket in Kilner Way
                           were selling four packs and bottles of wine through a
                           hole in the door. There were hoards of people on the
                           grass outside Halfords near Halifax Road drinking.  The
                           same applies there were 200 punters outside the ?
                           public house drinking. Every off-licence that was open
                           was doing a roaring trade.


        m s p Sykes:       Can I try and put it into perspective.  At 2.30 pm the
                           mass of people outside was such that I discussed with Supt
                           Marshall and we closed the road to vehicular traffic that
                           was the sheer weight of numbers out there at that time.


        Supt Marshall:     I have in my notes that at 2.15 pm Leppings Lane was full
                           of fans and in both directions and were drinking and we
                           had to close the road but there was a delay in that
                           because of the fact that service buses were still coming
                           from the road down into the Leppings Lane terrace.


        Chief Constable:   So we've got a picture of people from Liverpool in the
                           vicinity of the ground.  Have we got any evidence that
                           there was a delay in traffic that resulted in the
                           Liverpool fans' arrival at the ground being as late as it
                           was ?


        Ch Supt Nesbit:    No sir, I can tell you that as far as Penistone Road and
                           Halifax Road and Langsett Road that they were completely
                           sterile of football traffic, it was amazing, certainly by
                           2.30/2.25 pm I travelled all the way from the city centre,
                           all the way through to Halifax Road.


        Chief Constable:   So.there is no evidence whatsoever of the delay in transit
                           of the fans.  The fans arrived at the ground vicinity
                           early enough to go in the ground but instead went
                           drinking.     THIS WAS AGREED.

            Insp Sykes:          There were fans there who said there had been delay.   I've
                                 no idea whether they came by car, coach, or train.


            Chief Constable:     Can we just check on that aspect on the network of points
                                 and covers to make sure whether or not there is any delay
                                 anywhere.  It's simply to get ...


            Inso Hand-Davies :   Sir, the special was ir. early it was due at 1402 and that
                                 was in at about 1.45 pm and that was the only train in
                                 which is contributory as well ...


            Chief Constable:     What about the buses?


            Insp Hand-Davies:    No real problems as far as ...


            Ch Supt Nesbit:      No sir, you could travel - at 2.30 pm I drove from along
                                 Penistone Road past the ground to Halifax Road and there
                                 was no traffic whatsoever.


            Chief Constable:     Alright, well lees use as a basis for that then if there
                                 was delay it was individual delay, it wasn't mass delay
                                 and there wasn't any holdups that added to the frustration
                                 of people coming to the match.  That seems to be straight
                                 iO: .vc._a .

                                 Now, clearly at 2.30 pm w e ’d got problems in that area.
                                 We'd got the road closed, we'd got the sheer mass of
                                 people, would anyone like to give me and ... we've used a
                                 figure of 3/^ thousand for about ten to three, that was
                                 the sort of broad figure that was given to me.    Now was
                                 there a build up between 2.30/2.45 pm.    So what numbers
                                 are we talking about at 2.30 pm?


            Supt McKay:          In excess of 3,000 and from what I could see ...


            Chief Constable:     At 2.30 pm?


            Supt McKay:          Yes and increasing.   Can I take you back, it's worth
                                 mentioning the history and this of course is a repeat of
                                 last year's semi-final.   I was at that gate Leppings Lane
                                 last year, the fans were certainly not there in those
                                 numbers at that particular time last year and the increase
                                 came at 2.55 pm when all the drunken louts appeared and
                                 wanted entrance then.


            Chief Constable:     But we'd got problems before 2.55 P^-

    Supt McKay:        We had, they were■arriving ...


    Chief Constable:   Don'-    let's go/run on ahead and that's what I'm anxious to
                        do.    The focus of this enquiry will be on the period time
                        as I   see it from about 2.30 pin to about 3-10 pin. After
                        that   it's just a question of how we dealt with it after




    Supt McKay:        The picture is one of conjestion at 2.30 pm increasing
                       continually throughout because of the inability of the few
                       turnstiles to process the people as fast as they arrived.
                       They were arriving faster and the situation deteriorated
                       from 2.30 pm and never improved.


    Chief Constable:   What resources were deployed in that area at that time.
                       Was it in hindsight enough.  Were the resources that we've
                       allocated there deployed in that area. THIS WAS AGREED.


    (Mr Wright then scans room for insp Purdy - who was not present but at that
    time wor’k.ing g i.sswfici’c ;


    Chief Constable:   oecause as x ur    irstand it Roger, Mr Purdy was very much
                       involved.


    Supt Marshall:     Yes he was because by 2.4" pm there was an enormous press
                       of fans pushing ...


    Chief Constable:   Okay, but before we get to 2 .Up pm, has anyone      ;hin=
                       say about the period between 2.30/2.45 pm?


    Supt Marshall:     That was the period when the mounted officers and foot
                       officers were actually rounding up fans to get them into
                       the ground.  We were busy trying to shepherd fans towards
                       the gate.


    Supt Murray:       To add to that, at 2.30 pm there was a huge presence that
                       we could see on the cameras outside the Leppings Lane
                       turnstiles but that number that were there should have
                       gone into the ground by 3-00 pm.


    Chief Constable:   And shouldn't have been any problem.    AGREED - NONE.

                       Can you tell me what the general picture was, how many
                       arrests were taking place? Were there any arrests taking
                       place? AGREED - NONE.

    Insp Sykes:        Virtually impossible, the people who were arriving had
                       been drinking and the sheer mass of numbers of people -with
                       drink and ...


    Chief Constable:   And if we'd started making arrests we would have                    ...


                        Tell me about the radio.                    There was some fault/problem
                        t»VIl£"L   r£.d_C   £ .0    0 TiS. ~   ^2.1710.




    Supt Murray:        At that time reports were coming in into the control room
                        from officers outside.


    Chief Constable:    Were you in control?


    Supt Murray;       Yes sir, that there were radio pro-blems that messages were
                       breaking up and they weren't receiving control.   We have a
                       civilian communications officer on stand-by and before we
                       could contact him he actually came round to the control
                       room and said 'the radios are breaking up I've come to see
                       what I can do'.  He did replace the pack set.


    Chief Constable:    Can anybody say whether that caused anything other than
                        irritation.  Did it in any way contribute to the events
                        which followed?


    Supt Marshall:      Yes, I think it did.  I was trying to pass a message about
                        the gate and I could not get through on the radio and I
                        eventually changed channel on my set to Hammerton Road to
                        talk about the problem of the gate.  I would say that time
                        was a little bit later than 2.30 pm because the problems
                        surrounding the gate were about 2.45 pm.


    Chief Constable:    You see now, you've got to be very careful here because we
                        are talking about the gate and the gates.  You are talking
                        about how many gates?


    Supt Marshall:      I was talking about the gate at the side of the Leppings
                        Lane turnstile.


    (Mr Hayes clarif ies and points on the plan to the gate spoken of).


    Chief Constable:    That's gate 'C'. There’s another gate, gate 'B '. That
                        feature it seems to me, I'm anxious to get this particular
                        aspect...  You were talking about relieving the press in
                        front of the thing and the press was caused by everybody
                        trying to get in the ground within a short period of time.

                   When the message was passed that you wanted the gate
                   opened it wasn't received in the first instance.  Is that
                   right? I've made a statement ...


Supt Marshall:     That is right.   Eventually i was able   ...


Chief Constable:   What time Roger, what time are we talking about?


Supt Marshall:     Probably about 2.45.


Chief Constable:   About 2.45 pm when you first decided, in conjunction with
                   Mr Purdy as well.


Supt Marshall:     The situation became untenable outside and Mr Purdy was i:
                   extremis at that stage and was beg-ging for me to do
                   something to relieve the problem.


Cnief Constable:   When he was talking about the gate which gate was he
                   talking about?


Supt Marshall:     He's talking about the gate at the side, gate 'C '


Supt McKay:        Would it help if I indicated the ... at this point because
                   the gate 'C ' was never under any pressure at that point,
                   it was not a point of entry and it was just ignored.


Chief Constable:   People were not trying to go down the road they were
                   trying to get through the turnstiles.  THIS WAS AGREED.

                   Can anybody describe the nature of the events outside
                   those turnstiles?


Ch Supt            Can I give you a view as I saw it from the control room
Duckenfield:       sir? Times are difficult but at some stage we aid have
                   this radio difficulty and I've got it in my mind that the
                   situation couldn't be assessed and developed because of a
                   man in the control room changing radios and there was a
                   delay.   Mr Marshall was asking for help and the gate to be
                   opened and for one or two reasons he didn't get it, either
                   firstly because we didn't receive the message from the
                   radio or secondly I know at one stage that I was delaying
                   the situation because of assessing what the consequences
                   would be when the gates opened.   The situation was this
                   about 2.45 and I'll come back to the gate as I saw it. At
                   2.45 there was a crisis and a decision had to be made
                   whether or not to support Mr Marshall and for me to make
                   that decision to support Mr Marshall.   On the outside
                   tilers were 2,000,'3,000 fans. As I saw the situation in
                                     - 7 -


                    the ground there were spaces at either end of Leppings
                    Lane.  Behind that west stand there is a concourse area
                    that will easily accommodate if I've got ... right the
                    crowd outside.  The inside was full. Quite a large area.
                    So on that basis, then the other consideration was right
                    we delay the kick off but sadly before I could consider
                    delaying the kick off the players ran out onto the pitch
                    which must be I presume 2.50 and that decision was taken
                    away. Mr Marshall then came across or somebody did and
                    the message came in to the control room 'if you don't open
                    this gate soon someone is going to get killed outside
                    here'.  And I could see the developing situation.


Chief Constable:    And you don't know who said that?


Ch Supt             I don't know who said that, I know that somebody said on
Duckenfield:        the radio in a very distressed state, quite properly it
                    wasn't panic it was a case of for*God's sake help us here
                    because there are people who are going to be injured and
                    killed.


Supt Marshall:      I said that.


Ch Supt             Now I think the people in the control room will say what
Duckenfield:        we heard.  Mr Murray turned to me ana said 'Mr Duckenfieid
                    he want's the gates opened what's your decision'.


Chief Constable:    Let's pursue that.   We didn't know which gate ...


Ch Supt             Well no but the thing is I can take it a little bit
Duckenf ield:       further.  Now we get a situation where I can see on the
                    video and I think it's the gate on the entrance from the
                    south stand.   I-don't know the number of it but I went to
                    it last night.


(Mr Hayes identi fied and pointed to the gate on the plan).


Ch Supt             Right, now, there's a video sequence that's running that
Duckenfield:        shows that at that point fans were climbing over a wall,
                    fans were not only climbing over a wall they were
                    harassing a horse and a horseman was having extreme
                    difficulty.  Now I know that I've heard someone say it
                    lifted but certainly that man was in great difficulty,
                    that horseman, and the situation there was I thought that
                    that gate had burst open.  Now I don't know the truth of
                    that.


Chief Constable:    If anybody opened it it should be obvious on the v i d e o .
Ch Supt            Well it should, if you look for that corner where I was
Duckenfield:       watching it, that gate opened...


Chief Constable:    it couldn't be opened from outside could it?   AGREED NO


C m e f Sup”       ihat gate opened and it was shut again and then I'm not
Duckenfield:       not sure but I think it was opened again.  But the
                   siruarion was then that from recollection that peoDle who
                   came in from there didn't appear on the video to be
                   causing major problems and also not only could I watch the
                   video I could watch the terracing and looking at the
                   terracing there was still plenty of space around the sides
                   and considering the video and the terracing the situation
                   didn't look difficult at that stage.


Chief Constaole:   Coupled witn the large area inside the turnstiles.


(Mr Hayes identified and pointed on the plan, the large area which exists
between the rear of the west stand and the turnstiles leading to Leppines
Lane)


Insp Delaney:      Sir, it was no problem because i went through there.


                   'Amen gace


Insp Delaney:      Gate 'C' it was open and I went through, the gate.


Chief Constable:   What time was that?


Insp Delaney:      I don't know what.-time it was.


Chief Constable:   Pre-match, after match?


Insp Delaney:      Pre-match.  My serial was directed to assist with the
                   situation at 2.40 pm.  We went round to the back of tht
                   turnstiles because people were causing disorder at the
                   back.


Chief Constable:   Are you saying


Insp Delaney:      The public...


Chief Constable    The back of the turnstiles inside the ground.
                                         9 -


Insp Delaney:         Inside that area, inside that area at the back of the
                      turnstiles.


Chief Constable:      Inside that area marked 'AG'.     THIS WAS AGREED.


[nsp Delaney:         And they were saying that if sometnir.g was not done
                      someone was going to get killed out there. I heard a
                      message come over the radio 'open the gates at the back oi
                      Leppings Lane terracing'.  The gate was opened and I went
                      through that gate...


Chief Constable:      Any idea who authorised that?     That was at twenty-to?


Insp Delaney:         I don't know who authorised it.  No that was after sir
                      because I was there for a few minutes before...I went
                      through that gate and saw Mr Purdy and I was then engaged
                      in pulling people off the turnstiles because they were
                      getting crushed.  I was pulling them out to get through
                      the gate.


Chief Constable:      Can I just get that clear in my mind.  When you were
                      directed in response to Mr Marshall's plea for help in the
                      area you took your serial...


Insp Delaney:         No, I went I was on my own at that time. My serial was at
                      the back of the first gate which was gate 'A'.


(Mr Hayes then     pointed to gate 'A' on the plan)


Insp Delaney:            My serial was there. In response to that message I went
                      through round to,-gate 'C' to see what the problem was and
                      the gates were opened.    I went round the back.


(Mr Hayes then identified which gate Mr Delaney was referring to (gate 'C') on
the plan)


Insp Delaney:         I went through that    gate and the gates were then opened,
                       ' C gate was opened   and I went through the gate.


Chief Constable:      When you say it was    opened -who opened it?


Insp Delaney:         I don't know who opened it, the gate was opened,     well...


Chief Constable       Who was, was there an officer.
#                                         10 -



    Insp Delaney:      Well there must have been stewards on that gate.



    Supt McKay:        That fate was opened a number of times.   I was by that
                       gate for some 20 minutes.


    Chief Constable:   is it a gate that s normally usea lor people to go m
                       out?


    Supt McKay:        That's right and in fact it had to be opened to allow
                        injured persons in. There were several injured persons
                        went through in a period of 20 minutes and it was opening
                        and shutting all the time but it was never under the
                        pressure that. . .


    Sgt Gutcher:       My serial was between/on the turnstiles one to 16 sir and
                        I can support there were some very distressed people
                        coming through there.  You could see the crush through the
                        turnstiles and I told the man to just put his foot on the
                        pedal and let the people through to try to relieve some of
                        tne crushing, forget tickets at that stage, I was dragging
                        people over the top of the wheel and eventually went out
                        there, it was horrific out there.


    Chief Constabl'    Well fine, what we'd got is a real problem outside the
                       turnstiles in Lieocings i^ane . Nc douot aoou^  a t . xne
                       opening of the gate, now can we talk about what happened
                       when that gate was opened because there were a number of
                       things, one is M.r Duckenfield saying that there didn't
                       seem to be a problem and that the film just shows people
                       coming through the gate and into that area and going into
                       the ground and the other one is that there is a rush of
                       people coming through and did anybody see a rush of people
                       coming through that gate?


    Supt Marshall:     There was a movement of people who had been queuing in the
                       turnstiles, who ducted under the barrier, it's a sort of a
                       it s a    barrie:  they ducted under there and went into
                       that gate.   It was my impression and I've agonised over
                       this that there weren't that many people went through who
                       did that.   It wasn't an enormous crush on the gate.



    Chief Constable    When we talk about opening the gate, it's a concertina
                       gate .


    Supt Marshall:      It1s a concertina gate but it was only opened for about
                        four foot of its eight or nine foot...


    Chief Constable:   Now was there a police horse there as well?   AGREED - YES
                                               - 11 -



Supt Murray:       Yes sir.  Can I give you my perception from the control
                   room point of view. We were getting messages in the
                   control room to open the gates and considering the
                   consequences of that and before we'd made the decision to
                   open the gate the gate was opened or burst or whatever and
                   a number of people got into the ground, whoever was round
                   there. That gate was not the one that was getting all the
                   pressure, the pressure was near the turnstiles.  Gate 'A'
                   was open.  I'm talking about gate 'C'.


Chief Constable:   That's right but when you said the pressure was on the
                   turnstiles.on the gate fB' basically, that one, it makes
                   sense . . .


Supt Murray:       We couldn't see the gates sir on the video all you could
                   see was the mass but certainly the gate 'C' there was not
                   the tremendous amount of pressure on it.   So gate 'C'
                   opened sir, now I thought and I was only looking at it on
                   the video because you can't see it visually, I thought a
                   gate had burst open.   It may well be someone had opened it
                   but that was before the decision from the control room
                   came to open the gate.   A mounted officer recovered that
                   situation and put his horse outside and the gate then
                   closed.


^hief Constable:   So really what we are entering into hers is a situation
                   rtH S rS   uhc   g£.U c ,   Wc   W auU cd   CHS   gSXS   0001160.   S. HQ   u ilG T G   WS. 5   HO

                   the a c t u a l o p e n i n g o f t h e gate.    There doesn't s e e m to be
                   a comDlete        chain      of action.



Supt Murray:       You've got demands from the ground commander wanting the
                   gate open, the decision is being considered the
                   consequences from the control room and the gate is then
                   opened or burst../- It's then recovered by mounted officers
                   and shut and the requests are still coming in from the
                   ground to 'open the gate open the gate' and getting more
                   demanding and so the decision was taken to open the gate
                   again.  That time from my recollection was a large number
                   of people came in but again a mounted officer was acting
                   as a sort of a wedge and allowing ...


Chief Constable:   And we will in fact see the number of people who came in
                   on the video.


Supt Murray:       After that I think the numbers swelled and I just can't
                    recall exactly what numbers came in.


Insp Sykes:        The pressure on all those gates was tremendous and at
                    stages all the gates 'A', 'B ’ and 'C' were all opened.
                    Not just gate ’C ' all the gates were opened.

Supt Marshall:     # asked for the gate to the north stand to be opened.



Chief Constable:   You were talking about gate ’C ’?


Supt Marshall:     That's the one, yes. (ACTUALLY MEANT GATE 'A') There was a

                   because that gate was being attacked but that would have
                   had no effect   on the terrace because there is noaccess
                   between...


Chief Constable:   So the position now is that because of the pressure on all
                   the areas at some time all three gates were opened.   THIS
                   WAS AGREED.   Now can we put any time on the conjunction
                   of, is that a    wall? (pointing to the plan)


Ch Supt Nesbit:    It's a fence, a steel fence.


Chief Constable:   So anyone going through there is of no concern because
                   they are going to the north stand.

                   Now anyone who comes through here (pointing to theplan)
                   can get through there as well.  AGREED.  Can we put a
                   conjunction on those gates at all?


Insp White:        Yes sir. My attention was drawn to the people coming
                   through gate 'C ' I was in the area marked one to 16.           I
                   could see through           the gap in the wall the gate had
                   obviously opened.            I hadn't heard an order for it to be
                   opened but bearing in mind the noise that is
                   understandable.          I fought my way out to see what was
                   h a D o e n i n g because obviously there was a tremendous press
                   of people out there and I feared people were going to be
                   crushed against turnstiles a. to g. and I went outside
                   there...


Chief Constable:   How did you get outside there?


Insp White:        I went out of gate 'C ', it was open.  I went out there and
                   we started physically pulling people out of the crowd to
                   release that press and it seemed about a minute but it was
                   probably four or five, suddenly the press just seemed to
                   ease I realised gate 'B ' then had been opened.


Chief Constable:   Was the end product of all that that all this pressure
                   that was here went through?


Insp White:        Yes, the whole pressure was released.   But can I say one
                   tiling from my experience of six years of working that end
                                   - 13 -


                   that if they burst through or went in a deluge through
                   gate 'B ' the normal place for them to go into the north
                   steps to the west stand which there would be enough
                   stewards on there to prevent them, the normal way they
                   would go through would be to go round the corner to the
                   elevated section which is on the north end of the terrace
                   the elevated o n e , they would really have to turn to come

Chief Constable:   Are you in a position to give us a time for the release of
                   the pressure?  Is the time you took ycur prisoner out
                   t*n^ r*a ^


Insp White:        I came back from the prisoner and noticed the time when I
                   was in the police room was 2.45.  I came straight back
                   because you could hear there was exciting things on the
                   radio but couldn't make out what they were and I'd be back
                   aabout 2.50 when I realised that someone had opened gate
                   'C' and your're probably talking another two/three minutes
                   before gate ’B ' haooens.


Chief Constable:   Now all that was pre-kick off. AGREED YES.   And so the
                   actions in opening the gates took place and the pressure
                   was relieved before the match started.




                   happened In a minute the release of that pressure.   It was
                   like a boiler bursting and they went through the gates but
                   the surge of people from the road outside would take
                   several minutes to put all those people through that gate
                   and whilst that was going on there was a cheer went up
                   inside the ground and that added urgency to the flow of
                   people inside the gate and I ’m convinced that the cheer
                   from the ground whether the players were out or whether
                   the match had started was the catalyst that gave them that
                   extra spur to get into the ground through the gate.


Chief Constable:   Again, I ’m asking virtually the impossible. The situation
                   is that we have got ticket holders and non-ticket holders.
                   If the people who were there were ticket holders and got
                   inside the ground they were intended to. Have we got any
                   perception of the number of people who were seen as non­
                   ticket holders outside Leppings Lane?


Suot Marshall:     Must have been at' least 200/250 probably more.


Chief Constable:   But really we're talking about 3,000/4,000 of whom - if
                   you've got a ticket you're not in the queue are you?
                                     -   14



Insp Sykes:          There're milling around the area where the queues are. At
                     one stage I put a cordon of police horses across there to
                     release the orsssure on the actual turnstiles.


Chief Constable      3o we're putting a number on it which is only a                 .OP;

                     perhaps a i ‘1 cue; tion but i t ’s goir.




Ir.sp Kand-Davies:   I was on duty in that area and I think there are things
                     which need to be said that are crucial to the event.   I
                     would say there were more non-ticket holders than 250
                     nearer a 1,000 and that would be typical for Liverpool.
                     They are opportunists, they look for opportunities to
                     pinch a ticket, to rob a ticket, to get through a
                     turnstile but the press in. there was something I've never
                     experienced before.  This feeling-that they push the
                     person in front to get In quicker and to go back 20/30/100
                     rows had to be seen to be believed and we were working
                     very hard to say 'look, g^-^ bacK but tney cion't seem to
                     listen, they don't seem to have any response, they're not
                     normal in that respect.  I think that we must make the
                     point that drink played a big part.


Chief Constable:     if drink played a big part that will emerge.    When the

                     thing we want to be seen to be doing is trying to blame
                     someone else and I think let other people find that out.
                     I accept that completely.  Everybody's saying it and it's
                     true but it is really a question of how that's used.


[nsp Kand-Davies:    I appreciate that's difficult now but if you police a
                     coronation with 100,000 people a police horse would go in
                     and they would move for him and respond to the request.
                     These people weren't responding to any requests or
                     directions they were just intent on getting through those
                     turnstiles as quick as they could.


Inso Sykes:          When I put the cordon of police horses across there   to
                              tiie cressure.


Chief Constable:     What time did you cordon Mr Sykes?


Insp Sykes:          Across turnstiles one to 16 (shows area on plan) and they
                     were even diving under stomachs of police horses.


Chief Constable:     How many people when you put the cordon across what   sort
                     of numbers were in Lappings Lane itself.

(At this point someone said possibly 1,000, 500 at least)


Insp Sykes:                      More, probably more, because we closed it off to traffic
                                 to reduce the mass of people. It was virtually like when
                                 the ground empties, y o u’d got a mass of people there. At
                                 least 7,000/8,000.

                                 outside Leppings Lane when we look at the actual numbers
                                 who have gone through the computerised system which
                                 indicated something in the region of 12 ,000/ 12,500 people.


Chief Constable :                So about 1,500 . . .


Ch Supt Nesbit:                  Precisely, so we're talking in terms I would suggest if
                                 there's 3,000 people outside and there's still 1,500
                                 people coming in we are looking possibly...


Chief Constable                  Mind you, how many of those would be for the north stand.
                                 We're talking about 14,000 for the west stand, we don't
                                 know how many in that group will be for the north stand do
                                 we .

                                 into the north stand but also there is a dual access...


Chief Constable                  I think what we need to - this is a mathematical thing we
                                 need to look at but the real situation is you have got
                                 people legitimately trying to gain entry in grave danger
                                 of their lives and injury and action was taken to release
                                 that and clearly it's obvious there was need that there
                                 was need for action and all we're trying to assess now is
                                 the other forces that that allowed into play.


Ch Supt                          I can give you a figure for the north stand - 9,800 and
Duckenfield:                     Mr Beal's print-out from Sheffield...


Chief Constable                  So there's another 1,300 there who could have been trying
                                 to get in there.  Give me a little more so that I can...

                                 We've spoken about people being injured outside Leppings
                                 Lane can anybody give me any idea of how many were
                                 injured, whether anybody was seriously injured?


Ch Insp Creaser                  The situation outside the section of the Leppings Lane
                                 terraces standing area, the inspector there spoke to me
                                 and I told him to withdraw his officers who were stationed
                                 two to a turnstile to search people coming through.  Those

                   officers were at serious risk of injury.  Shortly after '
                   they were withdrawn there were six/seven people passed
                   bodily over ground who hadn't fainted but who had nearly
                   fainted if that gives seme idea of what the situation was
                   like.  I didn't see anyone having aabulance treatment but
                   there were a couple of 13/l^s being passed over the heads
                   who were suffering from crush-type...

                   for is your place to go. If you haven't got a ticket
                   you're looking for a place to hide.         Did anybody see
                   anything that happened through the tunnel?


Supt Greenwood:    I went round the inside of the ground and the timescale I
                   can put on it is that I went to the area of the Leppings
                   Lane terraces, walked round on the perimeter track and
                   when I got to the Spion Kop it was nearly kick-off time
                   and I went to the players' tunnel.      So the time span it
                   took me to do that I can now relate to what the situation
                   was In Leppings Lane terracing.      it was a carnival
                   atmospnere. In fact there were people, there was no
                   problem with that crowd at that time, there were people
                   who were pushing a little bit in the normal way of things
                   ana they were having a game with a lightweight beach ball
                   which was being flipped between supporters.         Timescale
                   wise I started round at the Leppings Lane terracing, saw
                   tr*is, n3.poy V 2.cn everyem-n^. no proD^enis, ws.j.rieci round
                   into the north stand to the Spion Kop we'd had a problem
                   there, couldn't stop because it was nearly kick-off time,
                   walked round to the players tunnel and shortly after that
                   the players came out.


Chief Constable:   So now when you got back to the west stand the atmosphere
                   was still as you described it.


Supt Greenwood:    Well, yes, that's prior to the kick-off.  When I went to
                   the players tunnel we had this problem it was the strategy
                   that was arranged and we knew there was going to be this
                   problems with the press and Brian Clough in terms of his
                   seat and the arrangement was that he would come out after
                   the referee and linesmen that's after the players had gone
                   onto the field and indeed after the trainers what have
                   you.  He came out after the match had kicked-off, in fact
                   we had to clear the press photographers there.  I turned
                   to one of them and said 'what are you waiting for' and he
                   said 'you know damn well what I'm waiting for, we're all
                   waiting for Brian Clough’ but by that time the game had
                   kicked-off, we had to clear them off, Clough took his seat
                   just behind the dug-out and I went back into the entrance
                   of the tunnel, looked to my left and at that stage I saw
                   people climbing over the fence in than central pen.  I
                   immediately then went round to the scene at that stage.
                   There was, it was difficult to clearly relate in terms of

                   tine scale but my distinct impression is that the tunnel az
                   the back of the terracing was not full in other words -one




Chief Constable            the tunnel was jammed full of DeoDle.

Sunt Greenwood:    Exactly.


Chief Constable    _ can't understand, I've looked at how that pressure can
                   cuild up to so many deaths.


 lot Greenwood:    Seen it before,       i can comment on tnat first if I may.
                   m fact ix"' I can comment on the Liverpool supporters, I
                   t h i nk this has got to be very relevant and the problems
                          the way my serials and inspectors are being talked on
                         terms of the Liverpool supporters.   In 1980/31 we had a
                         ilar problem.  That was the FA cup match with Wolves

                       nt of those pens and it was necessary on that day for
                       to open a gate.


Chief Constable:   How many times during the course of a season...


Suot Greenwood:            ;he only time I've known it.


Ch Supt            No, in 1979 sir.                It's happened before in that area.
Duckenfield:


Sst Godaarci:      We have done that before sir with Liverpool and Man U and
                   they are about the only two teams.  Not necessarily FA cup
                   normal matches.


Chief Constable    And the reason we've opened the gate is for the self same
                   problem?

Supt Greenwood:   The 1980/81 is interesting, it certainly is from my point
                  of view because tragically it went one stage further
                  yesterday than in 1980/81.  Certainly in 1980/81 the same

                  had come early, they opened the gates and on that occasion
                  we managed to eet them out but it was again pressure from
                  the back and I want to make that point quite clearly that
                  it's an experience that I have seen before but not to this
                  cxusnt.    in   rsia u io n   to     13n.6 u i v c r p o o i       s u p p o p ^ s i ’s my
                  inspectors were briefed on the basis of this.     Liverpool
                  supporters from my experience of them if everything is
                  going well  then there really isn’t much problem.   But if
                  things are  against them they turn, they are nasty, and
                  they have and this was experienced during the miners'
                  strike where there was trouble outside the Leppings Lane
                  area a Land Rover almost; went over on that particular
                  occasion, and that was when some people I think were being
                  ttransferred on that day from the Spion Kop again and they
                  were not Liverpool supporters put in another pen, unti.~ we

                  had rival supporters near to them was something you had to
                  witness and it was necessary to get the staffs out on that
                  occasion.   So my people were briefed on that basis.
                  They're okay when everything is going for them.    New I
                  made a specific comment to say that if the game goes

                  ous.c m u6i?~iS 02 oacxgrouna cna^ j. unou^riu 02101’6 v»ou^cl >^6
                  much more interest in Liverpool because of how things were
                  going with their particular league run.      And we were
                  looking and we had a plan and it was working well cn the
                  Spion Kop because we expected and did indeed get Liverpool
                  sunporters on the Spion Kop and had a segregated area at
                  the top.   Now I expected that there would be more of them
                  appearing on the Spion Kop than actually appeared,         That
                  happened last year, on that particular occasion again
                  there was a thin blue line and the only way that was
                  actually sorted out was when the officers got their staffs
                  out,   So I want to set it against that background of the
                  supporters and what have you,

                  I, on reflection now, I cannot understand, I can’t come to
                  terms with the fact that there must have been so many
                  people that we took out of there.   I cannot come to terms
                  with the fact that there were people that were dead in
                  there pressed against the fencing.   It was not evident at
                  the first arrival.  What was certainly evident on the
                  first arrival was that people were against that fencing
                  and that there was pressure from the back.   The officer on
                  there, the community constable, had the gate open at that
                  stage when I got there.   There were people coming over the
                  top as well.  They did try and assist us those people as
                  well.  Setting this in the arena of, it was total mayhem.
                  Even with an ear-piece and I was wearing one, one could
                  not hear anything it was absolutely bananas if you like in
                  that sense.  What was clear was that the pressure was
                  ccning from the back.   So there were 2/3 officers down by
                                        19 -


                   the gate who were trying to get people out.             They could
                   not get them out the pressure was so tight, it was
                   different than '80/’8l. So the only way we could approach
                   it was to try and get that pressure off the back and I
                   went ud onto "cnG isriCing, j_ C-l h h d s c . up on^o tns isncz-nsr
                   ar.d I wer.t to then back ar.d pointed down.          I got
                   absolutely no response, absolutely none.             People should
                   have realised that there was something seriously wrong and
                   the people at the front were in trouble but there was no
                   reaction to that at all.


Chief Constable:   On the question of putting Liverpool at Leppings Lane, are
                   we involved in that decision? AGREED - YES.


Supt Murray:       Yes.  This was discussed with Chief Supt Mole before Mr
                   Duckenfield cane and the main reasons are obviously
                   Liverpool cone from the north and west and Nottingham
                   people from the south and they head for those areas of the
                   ground.  i asKed Mr Mole n ws could, if there was any

                   We looked at it again, we looked very carefully because we
                   were getting pressure not only from Liverpool Football
                   Club but from British Rail who wanted to bring special
                   trains from Nottingham into the Wadsley Bridge station
                   rather than Liverpool because there were more passangers

                   izxcui?6  .sc y6s.r s.nc. issz y6s.r uivcrpooj. ns.Q uns Lcypin^s
                   Lane and the north stand and Nottingham Forrest the other
                   two sides of the ground.      We were of the opinion that if
                   we tried to change it round, even got over the logistical
                   problems of changing it round, the people would come to
                   exactly the sane place as last year, park in the same
                   places, head for the same pubs, and we would have had too
                   much...


Chief Constable:   We were involved in the decision and the reason that went
                   behind it is the reason just put forward.  AGREED - YES.


                   Right, I think I've got enough of a feel of the thing to
                   be able to talk it through.  Is there anything anybody
                   wants to say about it?


Ch Supt Nesbit:    I think one thing has to be said sir, I got there, Mr
                   Greenwood was there and it's fair to say Sergeant Gutcner
                   and Sergeant Morton had to physically climb over bodies,
                   they were four or five deep against the fence and the only
                   way we got the pressure off was because they went to the
                   back and started to pull bodies from the back and then
                   they eventually started to make a chain of people and were
                   passing policemen bodies to each one and through to get
                   then off.

    Chief Constable:       IlSw many bodies were in pen four.

    Chief Constable:       Do we know...


    Sgt Morton:            The first five rows in three were dead.


    Supt Greenwood:        I t ’s difficult to put this again into perspective.
                           Certainly when I got there I ’m sure there were people who
                           were dead.    I ’m sure of that on reflection but w e ’d no
                           irr.pact of that at all.   I had no impact, no.  I think in
                           terms of that there were clearly potential deaths and I'm
                           satisfied now that they must have been dead.     I've seen
                           that horrible photograph in the green paper that's been
                           printed in one of the Sunday paper's today.     I'm convinced
                           at that stage because the actual requests, going there
                           when they were actually were dead but it wasn't until and
                           again timescale is difficult but an officer turned round
                           to me and said 'these people at the front are dead' and I
                           looked at them, they'd get the grey look and they were

                           terms of numbers because there must have been people who
                           were actually underneath.  Well they were standing up but
                           there must have been people who were on the floor as well
                           but even then the fact that we'd created a funnel and we'd
                           got them out I can't relate to that total ... I saw in the
                           gymnasium.


    Chief Constable:       Nor can I. Looking at the nature and the size of the
                           enclosure I just can...and yet were there deaths in four?


    Insp Bullas:           .A lot of dead people being passed to the back of the
                            terracing.  I was in the stand looking down and I think it
                            ties in what was said at the front.  At the kick-off there
                            was definitely a consolidated push to the front.  It came
                            straight down looking at them, saw the crowd, could see
                            the people screaming at the front.  I ran to the back,
                            took some officers down the back and when I got to that
                            tunnel...


    Chief Constable:       Through the tunnel?


    Insp Bullas:           To the tunnel at the back, in contradiction of what Mr
                           Greenwood has said that tunnel was packed and we were
                           trving to drag oeoole back and then the dead...

                                           - 21 -



    Chief Constable:     Mas there anybody dead and injured in the tunnel?


    Insp Bullas:         They were starting to pass the dead people back, there was
                         a large number of dead people.


    Chief Constable:    ' But really then we have a position where the terraces are
                          full and there is still a tunnel full of people trying to
                          get out.   AGREED - YES.


    (Chief Constable then refers to plan regarding fence in pens three/four and
    the fact that he recollects fence being same size)


    Chief Constable:     Were there any dead bodies in four? When you come down
                         the tunnel in the centre of the passageway there's an iron
                         fence with a similar size gate, it's in half.  All the
                         impressions I gathered up to now is that all the dead were
                         in             tri0 "bs.r*r*i.sW6nt.


    Supt Greenwood:      I can't tell you that.   All I can say to you is that there
                         was certainly three was where the major problem was.
                         There were officers at four and clearly there were people
                         being taken cut of four.   Somehow they managed to get that




    Chief Constable:     Which fence?


    Supt Greenwood:      The link fence.


    Supt McKay:          One point which may be significant is some of the bodies
                         still had all three sections of their tickets which would
                         indicate that they were the people who went through the
                         gate and it's unlikely I would have thought they died at
                         the front of that crush having gone in.


    Det Ch Supt Addis    Albeit that quite a few of the injuries, facial injuries
                         indicate that these people have been walked on.


    (There is general discussion here about Mr Addis' comment)


    Ch Supt              Picking up what Mr Greenwood said and people in the
    Duckenfield:         control room might add to it, it was not evident that
                         there was a problem in three at the kick-off.  There was
                         no evidence as far as I see, when you see a situation
                         developing, any crowd problems, pushing, but it wasn't
                         evident from there and I have a recollection of thinking
                         why have they let that officer opened those gates onto the
                         track? Why have we got people going onto the track?
                                     - 22 -



Sgt Gutcher:       It wasn't really a long time before that gate was opened
                   onto the track sir, because I went in through two, the
                   gate into pen two was open and I went in through that gate
                   into pen two and I must have taken between 10/20 people

                   in mind I rd taken that many people cut: over there, pushin
                   them over dragging them the top, by that time when it had
                   cleared a little bit you could see I had a vision of a
                   woman's face in a pile of people and she was purple.          I

                   of the first'officers who leapt into pen three.        At that
                   time the gate still wasn't open.


Insp Delaney:      My impression sir when I got on the pitch when I heard the
                   request for assistance was not a problem with the pens I
                   thought it was a pitch invasion.


InsD White:        That's what ± was told when l went on the pitch, it was
                   nitch invasion, that's what we went onto the Ditch for.



Sgt Gutcher:       When I got into pen three sir and I was trying to give
                   first aid what ever I could do and there was just no way
                   to get people out.   There were officers up on the fence

Chief Constable:   'Well why wasn't the gate open, does anybody know why the
                   gate was open.   Who's got the means of opening it?


Ch Supt            The gate is spring loaded, you press it down and it flies
Duckenfield:       ooen, easy.   Maybe it caugnt on the hoardings restricting
                    it, I don't know l"'m just throwing that it, I mean that's
                   off the top.


Chief Constable:   -Well you've had a terrible time yesterday and certainly
                    thinking about it over the night to be involved in
                    something like that is the main difficulty you've got is
                    the feeling of not being able to do anything about it.
                    I t ’s just happening.


Supt Greenwood:    I'd like to say sir if I may that, and I told quite a few
                   afterwards, I think when the officers who acted there in
                   clearly extremely harrowing circumstances I was proud of
                   them. They really worked hard.


Chief Constable:   So, where do we go from here now.     We   ve got the Prime
                   Minister coming at lunchtime toge ther     with Douglas Hurd,
                   that's immaterial that's hew th ey see     it. This is the

likely I think there will be some form of judicial

level of pressure that was there and the nature and scale
of people.  It may be that when we get a little closer to
people who were in the areas marked one to 16 and a. to g.
we'll get some real idea of the movement down that tunnel
into those two sections.  I don't see that there's much we

pursue iirst anG to ii h g out wnstnsr gate o nao ossn
opened.   We know gate ’B ' had been opened, we know from Mr
White and Mr Sykes that gate 'A' was opened as well, so
there's no mystery about it the real issue is the timing
and the effect of those actions.    We've got the enquiry up
to now.   I'm just a little bit doubtful about whether we
should pursue it and that simply is a question of trying
to stand back from it see what other people might think of
it later.   We have got the Coroner's enquiry which he has
got to pursue.   The question of all the aspects we've
talked about today are matters for the Coroner ought to
know about so at this stage we will continue with the
enquiry as we would be conducting a Coroner's enquiry and
simply gathering all the evidence together instead of
pursuing priorities and aspects where the
responsibility/blame lies.    It will be with us for a long
time.   The most distressing and harrowing of situations
and I could see it on the faces of the officers last night
and I can still see a presence to an extent today and
that's as it should be. We cannot accept these things
lightly.   There're not easy, they are terribly hard and
the events which follow on...    I think we're over the
worst in publicity terms given the press have had a run
and we've tried to be as open as possible yet at the same
time not give too much away.    I don't think there's much
else we can pursue at this stage but you did a good job
and I feel for you in terms of what you have to deal with.
But it's events which are forced on us rather than sort
out.  Operational decisions are taken in the light of
all the information available and I see no reason to say

                   %h.a.t those operational decisions are questionable. What
                   we've got is a situation which was properly responded to.
                   The mounted branch knowledge of events, your knowledge of
                   events and what happened before.    We've been on that

                   with it as the professional people we are and give our
                   response in the professional way that is expected of us.
                   That's not to say that we don't give a true impression of
                   what we saw there that it something we've got to do.   What

NOTES OF WESTING HELD ON MONDAY 17 APRIL 1939



CQ - Need to establish how the build-up of spectators occurred outside
Leppings Lane, why it' occurred, and was there any aspect of policing that
caused the build-up.

Los at 2.17 oni shows a request for ueppings ians to oe cicssc Decause of tne


CC ~ Wore we searching oeoole — were we hindering the flow of peopie?

Marshall - No searching outside from that time onwards.

CC - Our view is that the turnstiles cope with the volume of                  people.

Murray's perception - 2.30 pm north stand about half full; 4/5,000 people to
go into there. West stand was quite full - centre two pens filling.      Still
quite a bit of room at Lappings Lane.   Majority would have to go into the
north stand - 8 turnstiles and the other 15 service the West Stand and the
Leopings Lane terrace.  There were a lot of people who, had to go through   the
north stand through the 8 turnstiles.

CC - What is the total number of people that would be approaching Leppings
Lane to get into the West Stand and North Stand jointly? Almost 24,000.

CC - First ingredient that led us down the path was the fact that given the


CC - How many people were in the ground at 2.30 pm.  At 2.30 pm we are tola
that a gate man on his own initiative opened the gate there.  Do any police
officer know anything about that?

McKay - PC Rich.

CC - We need to identify police officers           around gate B.      Should beable to   do
that from our deployment plan.

CC - 17, 18, ana 19 are the serials that were there.              Somebody amongst them
must have known what was happening then.

CC - This was entirely outside police direction but it gi”es an indication
that the steward had recognised the proolem tnat caused him to take action.

McKay - Not taken statements from anyone.   interviewed the PC yesterday -
about 2.30 pm the steward was concerned about tne press on gate B.    On his own
initiative the steward opened the gate.   PC estimates about 50? people went
through but the problem was then that those inside were passing tneir ticxets
over the wall and under the gate.

CC - What time was the radio down?          Were you receiving spasmodic
communication?

Murray - Several messages came in "we cannot read you, breaking up at
control".  Before we could ring the communications officer who was at
gymnasium, he turned up. He had been listening to the radio and knew
was something wrong with it. Tune about            pni.

CC - When was normal communication resumed?

Murray - Down for about 2/3 minutes.                           Operated from personal radios.

Duckenfield - Recollects seeing Murray with personal radio at about 2.45 pm.

CC - Did the            failure of the communications have a significanteffect?

Murray - Not a significant effect.  There was sti-ii wnatseemed to oe a
lengthy delay before gate 'C' was opened after I had asked for it.

CC - How did we get the message over to open the gate?

Murray - Passed over personal radio.

CC - It seems to be an   area for a great deal of investigation as to how and                                              by
whom the gates at Leppings Lane were opened.

Duckenfield - Conscious of the fact that messages being asked to open the gate
and in the process of discussing the options tne gate burst open and people
went through,

CC - Let us see if anybody knows what was going on there.

McKay - Series of photographs which show the lack of pressure that tne gate
was under.

Marshall - Gate not normally under pressure because oi barrier tnac separates
gates A and B.

this stage.  There was   a demandto do something about the problem outside and
there was a reauest and a requirement for that gate to be opened.    It is
immaterial about the chain of command. How and why does not seem to matter,
the number of times does.   The level of control hasgot to be tnougnt about.
Was there any attempt once the pressure had gone to control people going in.
How many people who should have been inthe north stand swept into the other
stand we will never know,

CC - Re gates between pens 4/5 and 2/3.                               Duckenfield said the gates were open
and Nesbit said they were shut.

Nesbit - The gate on the top                   of the fence that runsright                    angles          to the   pitch
was closed when I got there.

CC - Whose responsibility is                   it to     open the gates?

Mole - Inspector i/c of the sector who has a padlock                                      key, and       it is checked
before the match that the gates are open.

CC - We need to be able to say who opened it.  Need to determine whether the
gates were opened or closed and be able to supply the identity of the
individual who had the■responsibility.

Mole - Inspector White always works the Leppings Lane terraces                                                Convinced he
would have unlocked it.

     CC - G®!, back tQ the control inside the tunnel.   Whose responsibility is it.
    ■there to divert people - anybody?

/   Duckenfieid - Inspector White with serials 14 and 15-      Specific instructions
    on the Order at phase 2.

    CC - Inspector White experienced individual.

    Mole - Mr Crsaser was the Inspector who worked it before Mr White

    Nesbit - At the crucial time inspector W m t e was returning naving asa_t witn
    an arrest.

    T o d of the tunnel solid with horses - tnat procedure happenea last year.

    CC - Was there any element of that control put in the Order?

    CC - Unique situation.  The factor that encourages me is that we have a t
                                                                            team
    of officers who have seen and done it all before.  Your experience is wide

    Mole - Selected the officers for various duties in the- knowledge that they had
    the knowledge.

    CC - Other area of controversy is planning.

    Mole - Asked by the ground, can we deal with a semi-final and how would we
    deal with it. Ke explains the manner of allocation.    FA prepared to accept or
    not. A d o roaches from Liverpool for a change. Could we reconsider allocation
    - no way, logistics re. traffic, spectators etc.




    ACC (Ops) - I went into the control room about 2.20 pm.  Everything seemed to be
    going alright. There were not many of the Liverpool fans in at that stage but
    that is not unusual.  They usually leave it until the last minute.  Went to
    the directors entrance - no more crowd than usuai.

    CC - Is it true that they come at the last minute.  Why is it with the same
    crowd, the same factors, what happened this year to change it? 2.17 closing
    Leppings Lane.  What is the unknown factor?

    McKay - Whilst we thought we had learned from a good match last year, the
    Liverpool supporters have also learned - vuineraoility of this area - and
    decided to come in force.  Certainly we didn't have the same situation as last
    year when during the last five minutes the drunken rowdies turned up.  For a
    snort period tne turnstiles can cope.  This year there were far more people.

    CC - Issue to address our minds - same ingredients, same crowd, same clubs,
    same factors, same level of policing - all gone sour.

    Mole - Coventry v. Leeds match two years ago put back 15 minutes because of
    the same problem.

    Mole - Sheer weight of numbers was extreme in my view.      Where did it all come
    from.

    CC - Purpose of the meeting - not sitting back, need to keep talking about it
                                      - 4 -

Nesbit - I don't know where the crowd came from.   I travelled Penistone Road/
Halifax 'Road to Parson Cross and back - 2.25 pm no mass of supporters.

CC - Division to ta?y and establish where the crowds came from causing the
build up which flooded down.

CC - Got to establish how many of those people were seeking legitimate entry
to the ground and how many were opportunists.

McKay - Not a mass arrival.  Tnere was always going to oe a mass arrival in
the last few minutes as last year.  when tne mass arrival came tne turnstu.es
were already choked and had been for some time.  Appeared to be littie or no
movement through the turnstiles.

CC - Problem at 2.14 pm - Leppings Lane closed at 2.1? pm.

Marshall - Message didn't immediately get through.    Vehicles still coming by
the roundabout and problem with service buses.

Ops - What was done from about 2.15 onwards outside to try and alleviate the
problem.

Mole - How did we decide to deal with it.

Duckenfield - From the video it didn't look too bad when Roger asked for
Leppings Lane to be closed.  Remember seeing traffic flowing on Leppings Lane
and a bus having difficulty in getting through.

Murray -   Responsible for the log - nothingalter 2.21 pm, don't   know w n y .

Marshall   - Soectators sherherded towards the turnstiles.

CC - There was a problem and what were we doing to address it - we seemed to
be adding to it.

Marshall - The practice is to get people into the ground as quickly as
possible to stop them loitering.

CC - Pressure and problems around the turnstiles and we seem in terms of
responding to that....

Nesbit - PC told me that the problem with the turnstiles was that fans from
Liverpool were getting into the area of the turnstiles, getting to the bar and
had no tickets, and were then bartering and offering money to get in. Police
officers were trying to get into the crowdto pull those blokes  out.

CC - Can   we get holdof that evidence.

Mole - Same problem last year.    Publicity to say don't come if you haven't got
a ticket.

Marshall - Instructions to the Inspectors at the checking points and
Tankersley and Oughtibridge to be vigorous about checking the tickets.
Dilemma if half have tickets and half don't.
                                                                                       _       ->      _




Duckenfield - No ticket situation clearly set out in the press - don't cone if
you haven't got a ticket.  Spoke on Radio Trent and Radio Merseyside.   Letters
to Liverpool and Nottingham for notice to be put in official programme,
letters to respective Chief Constables.

Marshall - My experience is that you get a press of people in the last 10
minutes - important to get peop_e ir.to the ground before t ^0 1?=~ 10 fT} >“,

Nesbit - Which gate was the mounted officer across - pressure on him?

CC - Across gate 'C'.

Duckenfield - What action did we take about the build up at the ground.
Recollection of looking at the crowd situation on the terrace and thinking Its
building up. Put out a tannoy message for people to disperse.   Car with
louahailer.

Marshall - Message broadcast but people could not hear.

CC - what message was he sending out?

Marshall - Tannoy about the turnstiles to get people to stop pushing.  Also
asked control to send Mike Buxton? in the landrover with a double FA system
which we use at matches.

Marshall - Went into the crowd to ask people to stop pushing.

Duckenfield - 2.45 pm approx. consider delaying the kick-off because of the
situation.  There was an assessment that we should get these people in.
Whilst considering delaying kick-off the teams came out.  If last push came at
2,50 pm when the teams came out...

CG - Which came first?

Marshall - Never saw gate 3 open.

CC - Sykes? said A.and B were open.

Marshall - 'A' not significant.

Marshall - Attempt being made to storm the gate and the gate was being shaken
vigorously.  Not worried because they can't go anywhere under the north stand.

Marshall - Concern about injuries from being pressed up against the gate.

Duckenfield - When you sent the message Roger, I responded, I thought there
was also a message from somebody in difficulty - give us permission to open
the gate or it's going in any way (gate A).

Marshall - That was me.                              There were people climbing over the parapits.

Marshall - Asked for gate A to be opened.     Sgt Higgins? opened the gate.

Message every available officer on to the concourse of the north stand.

CC - On gate B is an officer who says it was opened at 2.30 pm.     Forget gate B
the officer will respond to that aspect.

Mole - What did we do about the tunnel and people seeing it and going for it?

Murray - Total lack of information, apart from Mr Marshall's information.

Mole - Somebody has agreed to open gate C.     What we have done to accommodate
opening 'C ' .

Murray - A lot of people in the centre pens.

DCC - Who is opening and closing gate ' C ?

Stewards out policemen are tnere.

CC - (looking at photographs) It was not open at 14.55.     14.52 clearly shows
the gate shut. Whether it was open and shut again.

Marshall - Yes it was.   Not through my direction but mounted men working


DCC - After you had the steel gates closed was it then you said let's get the
pressure away.

Marshall - Gate C was opened and then the mounted closed off the perimeter
gates.  Perimeter gates under attack and shaken.
£{C.C-
Ops - That barrier was broken and wants looking at.

Mole - If we opened gate A and expected a rush, mobilisedofficers     to meet it,
the same question is going to be asked about gate C.

Murray - Nobody ever said open gate A, B, or C - request for "open the gate,
open the gate" - no specific gate.  Gate C came open and the gate was shut
again.

Duckenfield - The Order has officers listed, and once that central tunnel
becomes full the officers control that and it is shut off and people directed
off to the wings.

CC - Is it a fact that regardless of the experience they will still have the
proper briefing in accordance with the Order? Mr White when briefing his team
will as part of the briefing say in the event of etc?

Duckenfield - Briefings were arranged for Friday morning in thenorth  stand.
Serials walked around the gangways and looked at the problems.  Every
Superintendent took his men around the ground and pointed out and talked
through the problems.

Mole - Significant to know when the perimeter gates were closed.

DCC - 2.45 pm Roger asking for the      gates to be opened.

CC - Understand the business about the log but it is a factor that         somebody   is
going to make something of. Not criticising (hurrayj.

CC - For Leppings Lane we have a series of photographs which in themselves are
good enough for the log as to what is happening.     Whilst the north stand

turnstiles.  Inspector Bennett climbed           top of the parapit. Inspector

CC - How do we proceed from here?

McKav - Have concentrated on securing evidence anc setting up tne m a c m n e r y

statements. So far as tne enquiry team is concerned - set down your
recollections over the next few days.   We should bedoingthat with officers
at the game.  Prepared a proforma to all officers.

CC - Very good point - ail officers at       the game tomakerecords of their
recollections.

McKay - Any other area I should be taking action?

CC - Paint the picture of what was taking place in the first instance -
identify those officers in the area - ask the 011icers to puil together their
recollections not only in terms of what they aid but what they saw.

Mole - Value of stewards being seen.

McKay - Need to be doing house-to-house enquiries, pubs, ambulance men etc.
Should get early contact with whoever is running the enquiry.

CC - Identify the persons who were on that turnstile and ask tne question what
were your percentions of it, capture that, and direct the attention of the
enquiry team.

McKay - Should we be circulating Merseyside asking lor officers who were at
the club?

CC - The enquiry team will clearly do that (see the injured persons).  Rather
let the enquiry team see the injured people.  Need to pull out the evidence
and attitude of people in Wadsley and Leppings Lane.

McKay - We do need to secure the evidence of the stewards.
Doug Lock anal            Ishould have the names of stewards.

CC - On the Leppings Lane terrace, you can go in any pen can't you?

Mole - Certain turnstiles filter to the left and others to the right.

CC - No control where people go inside the ground.

Addis - What he would like to do but don't feel it prudent   until somebody in
West Midlands is decided, i.e. set up a satellite incident   room in
Merseyside - most important.  Had an offer from tnat rorce   to use tneir r.jL.'ii
equipment, and to use their indexes.  We should be getting   on with that.

Duckenfield - Computer printout situation.  Is it right and proper tnat we
seek the information before the enquiry team comes.  it would help us to know
what the printouts say at 2.4p etc.

Mole - ? has them locked in his safe.

CC - How many people in pen number 3?

Addis - Healtn ana Safety Executive nave got cracKing on what tney need to do
Don't want H &. S to dig up the barriers and taxe them away. i'hey have carrie
out some stress tests and one barrier removed.

CC - Has no indication of where   the deaths and injuries occurred.




Addis - There is nothing in the tunnel to indicate which way the spectators
should go, it is a matter of choice.  Clear from the damaged barrier in pen 3
indicatesthat is the main area and agree with Mr Nesbit that it was not a
sudden surge from the back.

CC - We are in no way seeking to interfere in any way with the enquiry but
simply the problem of running SYP and policing events in the future.  We need
this type of discussion and to know what actually happened.  The focusing of
evidence that will assist in this is our proDlem and we cannot ignore xt.
Identify and feed into the system.

McKay - Report to the Coroner has to be done by us.

Addis -   It is a sudden death 9^ times.

McKay - Had assumed responsibility for Coroner's enquiry but    due to aspects
arising from the meeting will leave that to Mr Sleath.

CC - What is the nature of the enquiry? The enquiry is the gathering of
evidence.    The judicial review which is going to be announced today is going
to review   the evidence that is gathered and if we  leave it to West Midlands t
provide the evidence we might not get the broad scope of evidence flowing in.
We have to be the authors of most of the information fed in.      We have to be
active and find the areas where the evidence can be found.

 CC - How are we going to organise this.    Identify the turnstile people and
sjriaen we have names see the people concerned.

McKay - Need to set up seme machinery to help officers suffering distress

DCC - In hand - memo being prepared.

                 BETWEEN 4.00 PM/8.40 PM WEDNESDAY 19 APRIL 1989




Pr esent:

Deputy Chief Constable (Chairman)
Superintendent Greenwood
Chief Inspectors Creaser and Waring
Inspectors Bennett, Bullas, Darling, Delaney, Hand-Davis, Purdy and Sykes
Sergeants Booth, Burman, Burns, Crawford, Higgins, Morgan, Payne, Proctor,
  Thomas and Whitlam




The below is a precis of the notes taken.




TUNNEL CONTROL

It is possible that a spectators' rush through the tunnel impacted into the
back of densely packed standing spectators and caused a surge which resulted
in the disaster.

One police witness (Sgt Burman) says that pens three and four were filled by
2.00 pm.  Another witness (Supt Greenwood) says that the pens at this time
were not tightly packed and refers to a spectator climbing into the West Stand
and then out again into the crowd.

One officer (Insp Bullas) in the West Stand looking down over pens three and
four saw a crowd surging in both pens which went forward but didn't come back
and remembers hearing about this time the  whistle blown and aroar of the
crowd to indicate the start of the game.

Within minutes of the tragedy the tunnel was clear.  Bodies have never been
found in the tunnel but casualties were evacuated this way.  The same police
witness (Sgt Morgan) who after the tradegy moved from the track through the
tunnel found that spectators there, including police officers, were completely
unaware of what had occurred.

There is nothing in the operational order nor at the briefings     about
contingency for police protection of the tunnel to restrict or     prevent
spectator entry.  Officers remembered (particularly Chief Insp     Creaser) that
in previous years the above has been done by the use of horses     and static
police lines (referred to as Supt Freeman's policy).



COMMUNICATIONS

There was general comment that because of crowd noise on occasions it was
impossible to use the radio even with ear pieces.

There was further comment that the normal mode on these occasions is     'talk
through' which can soon overload the system.
                                     - 2 -



There was specific comment by more than one officer that circa 2.00 pm
tffcnsmission became impossible #ue to loud interference.

Loud hailers were used inside the ground to effectively appeal for calm.
Greater use of these as a contingency should be considered.



MOUNTED

Deployment

Five   deployed at 11.00 am (under control of Sgt Thomas).  Eight more arrived
with   the train spectators at circa 2.15 pm making a total of 13-  Around
2.30   pm following a request for assistance more (number unknown) were deployed
from   behind the South Stand.  (Insp Hand-Davis in charge from 2.15 pm).

General Comment

The crowd refused to respond to the persons on horses ( u niq ue). From 2.15 pm
onwards the crowd was so densely packed that the horses had difficulty or
could not get in and those in became so jammed that the riders feared any
movement would cause injury and one horse was physically lifted by the crowd
(uniq ue).

Mounted officers' opinion is to effectively deal with that situation it would
have required possibly 10 times the deployment of horses used.




TURNSTILES

Normally entry to the North Stand is through turnstiles one to six and from
Penistone Road.  On this occasion Penistone Road turnstiles were closed and
Leppings Lane turnstiles one to nine fed this area.

Normally entry to the West Stand seating and terracing is through turnstiles
seven to 16 and 'A' to 'G'. On this occasion only turnstiles 10 to 16 and 'A'
to 'G' were used.

There was general feeling that far too few turnstiles were used to feed these
areas when crowd capacity was this high.

Ticket touts were seen near Vere Road selling tickets for other entrances -
purchasers using these at Leppings Lane entrances.

From 11.30 am onwards a crowd amassed outside the turnstiles composed of
non-ticket and ticket holders who were not wishing to enter the ground at that
time and mounted officers had to clear away.

Selected turnstiles opened at 11.30 am.  By 12.30 pm all the turnstiles had
opened and orderly queues formed - these soon extended back as far as Leppings
Lane.  No significant problems.

Circa 2.15 pm - around the time the train contingent arrived - queues are
lost, the spectators merge and become solidly packed outside the turnstiles.
Queues never re-formed.
                                       - 3 -


Officers are outside the turnstiles checking re. offensive weapons,
drunkenness, etc., but their duties never interrupted the maximum throughput
flow.

Secondary Searching Inside

This operation became impossible circa 2.15 pm due to crowd density.

Throughput Problems

a.   Non-ticket holders;
b.   Wrong tickets;
c.   Attempted unlawful entry - climbing over etc.;
d.   Crowd compaction;
e.   At some point turnstile 'G' becomes jammed due tophysical distortion
        caused by pressure (Sgt Crawford) (unique);
f.   Attempted corruption at turnstiles.
g.   A point may have been reached towards the end with turnstiles  being
        freed.




MATCH DELAY

If spectators had been informed that the match was to be delayed this may have
reduced their frustration.

One officer (Chief Insp Creaser) using police Land Rover radio requested that
consideration be given to delaying start of the match.




MANPOWER (FOOT)

Manpower deployed at the ground from circa 11.00 am:-

     a.   outside the turnstiles and into Leppings Lane - four
          serials and supervisors;

     b.   -inside the turnstiles - 2 J serials initially, reinforced
           by a further serial (Insp Delaney/Sgt Higgins) circa
           2 .45 pm at Gate 'A '.

Plus 13 mounted officers   (see   'Mounted'   section).




CROWD BEHAVIOUR

The crowd started entering the ground at 11.00 am.  By 12.30 pm queues were
forming but were orderly.  The queues over time extended all the way back to
Leppings Lane but no problems experienced.

By 2.15 pm the queues were lost and spectators were now packed outside the
turnstiles in large numbers extending back to the perimeter gates in a solid
mass.   The train contingent arrived and spectators were entering the ground
in an injured and distressed condition.
                                       - 4 -



    2.30    pm the situation is worsening - 3,000/4,CMp crowd (some officers sees
 this as low figure).  Despite the continuous entering of spectators into the
 ground the crowd outside the turnstile area increases as fans in large numbers
 continue to arrive from along Leppings Lane in both directions.

One officer's (Chief Insp Creaser) description "...like a video of fans
leaving the ground played backwards...".

The above situation continued more or less up to the start of the game at
3-00 pm, relieved at times when gate opened.   The crowd pressure is such that
turnstile G is distorted and bacame inoperable.    Also believe wall adjacent
to the river is shifted 5 " out of line.

Large scale drunkenness is evident.     Spectators are attempting to      take alcohol
into the ground in large quantities.

The crowd at times is very frustrated, hostile, and missiles are thrown at the
police.- Many spectators completely ignoring police directions (unique).  On
one occasion when one perimeter gate was closed and a'line of horses were
across the road the spectators forced their way between horses legs.




SEQUENCE OF OPENING OF THE GATES

One officer (Insp Bennett) states that he arrived at gate 'A' inside the
ground and the stewards were making sure the gate was secure.  He described
the scene as chaotic with officers being urged to get people through the
turnstiles as quickly as possible.

That same officer then climbed onto the roof of the turnstiles and saw the
crowd was tightly pacxed, no-one could move and people were being crushed.

Sgt Morgan said he went through gate 'C' with Insp White and started to pull
people out who were pushed up against the metal barrier   leading to the South
Stand.  A lot of people were resisting any attempts to rescue them because
they would lose their place in the 'queues'.

Sgt Morgan also said gate 'C' was the first to open and it was opened at least
twice.  He said on the occasion when the gate was first opened, just before it
was opened he saw Insp Bennett in the area behind the turnstiles and when he
got outside Insp Bennett was on the turnstile roof.

Insp Delaney said about 2.^0 pm he was at the area   between the SDion K o d and
the North Stand with his serial when he received a   message to go to Leanings
Lane.  He deployed the serial at gate 'A', went to gate 'C' and that's'when he
heard a radio message to open the gates.  He went round and saw gate ’C ' open.
He assisted to pull people through.  A number of people entered the ground
before the gate was closed.  He then looked across and gate 'B ' opened.

Sgt Burns said that gate 'B' was opened by two uniformed officers,       there was a
massive rush and the gates were then closed.

Insp Bennett thought it was about 2.45 pm when he climbed onto the roof of the
turnstiles.

Insp Purdy said he   saw Insp Bennett climb onto the   roof   and gate 'B ’ opened
five to 10 minutes   after that.
                                       - 5 -




Sgt Higgins was the sergeant in charge of Insp Delaney's serial deployed
inside gate 'A' and it was definitely 2.40 pm when he got there.  Insp Bennett
was not on the turnstiles roof.  Sgt Higgins was at gate 'A' about 10/15
minutes taking abuse from people about the crowd outside.  He looked into the
turnstiles and three people were stuck in the area where one should pass
through. That was like that for some considerable time and this was because
the pressure was so great one person could not enter the turnstile alone.

Insp Sykes said it was about 2.50/2.55 pm when he was outside and gate 'A'
opened and hundreds went through.

Chief Insp Waring said he was there about 2.50/2.55 and that the opening of
that gate ('A') appeared to make a terrific difference in releasing the
pressure outside.

Sgt Higgins said that at 2.50/2.55 pm he radioed and said "if the gate isn't
opened there is going to be serious injuries and possibly loss of life" and
received a reply to the effect that "if that is the case open the gate".
First of all the steward would not open the gate and after a few more minutes
his officers assisted in opening that gate. He added that during the
preceding 10/15 minutes the gate had been bouncing and it looked as it if was
going to come off the wall.

Insp Sykes went through that gate.

It was agreed that it was a negative rush through gate 'A' in terms of the
happenings on the West Stand terracing.

Sgt Thomas was at the perimeter fence further up Leppings Lane.  He did not
see gate 'A' open and there were still many supporters outside turnstiles 'A'
to 'G' .

Insp Purdy said that gate ’C ’ was opened a second time but was unable to
supply an exact time or sequence in relation to the opening of the other
gates.

Sgt Morgan believes that the numbers 'going through gate 'C' were not massive.

Towards the end it seems highly likely all three gates were opened.  This may
have resulted from the message from force control to Sergeant Higgins.




RECOMMENDATIONS RE. PUBLIC SAFETY

 1.   Consideration should be   given to greater use of loud hailers.

 2.   Suggestion made that all the turnstiles be knocked down and replaced with
      a semi-circle of new ones.   There are gaps in the area where the
       turnstiles are currently and this is where people are getting crushed and
       trapped.

 3.   At normal matches entry to the North Stand is by way of turnstilesone   to
       six and also access via Penistone Road. On 15-4.89 Penistone Road
       turnstiles were closed and only turnstiles one to nine used. This is
       insufficient.
                                        - 6 -



4.      At normal matches entry to the West Stand is by way of turnstiles seven
        to 16 and 'A' to 'G'. On 15-4.89 only turnstiles 10/16 and 'A' to 'G'
        used.  Again this is insufficient.

 5.     Poor siting and insufficient numbers of indicator boards showing the
        routes to the stands and terraces.

 6.     Design of tickets very poor - they were all the same type of print and
        would have benefited from being colour coded to match the indicator
        boards (at 5 - above).

 7.     Many of the supporters en-route to the West Stand tended to go via the
        tunnel.  Suggestion was made that as an alternative in future the tunnel
        be closed thereby making supporters go round to the Stand via both sides
        and easing congestion in the tunnel.

 8.     No incentive for crowd to get to ground early - pre-match entertainment
        could be provided.

 9.     More horses to be deployed at big capacity games than on 15-4.89.

10.     Re. timing of the match - would have been good idea to hold game on
        Sunday morning thereby pubs/off licences being used less by supporters
        before start of game.

11.     Suggestion made that pubs near to the ground should have been closed
        prior to the match on 15.4.89 but general feeling re. this was that if
        near-by pubs had been closed supporters would simply visit licenced
        premises further afield.

12.     Suggestion made that there is no need for the fencing on the terracing
        which forms the actual pens.

13.     Suggestion made re. the removal of the wall which leads from the rear of
        the West   Stand to the rear of the turnstiles allowing greater freedom in
        the area of the West Stand terracing.

14'”.   Suggestion made that in future formation of queues would benefit from
        being like those used in Post Offices.

15.     Suggestion made that lay-out of the ground is    not conducive to a large
        crowd, therefore we have always had problems     with people securing entry
        into the  ground.   Because of this the police   have had to do too much
        stewarding re. which turnstiles supporters go    through.

PERSONS PRESENT :




Deputy Chief Constable      - Mr Hayes

ACC (Staff Services)        - Mr Anderson

Chief Superintendent Wain

Chief Superintendent Mole

Mr Bill Woodward QC

Mr Patrick Limb

Mr Peter Metcalfe

Miss Belinda Nortcliffe




Mr Metcalfe




I assume we will get the video and the other* documents back.   Any

briefs, accounts etc will remain privilege.   You ought to note uhat

pocket notebook entries can be called for and must be produced.       I

suggest at this stage that we don't call this present investigation

inquiry as such but that we look upon it as a gathering of evidence

You should be careful not to use the word inquiry.
Chief Suot Wain




This document bundle has been hastily pulled together.        We have not

taken any evidence yet with which to back up the comments contained

herein, but we should be able to validate it given time.        Parts IV and V

in particular ought at this stage to be treated with care.




Mr Woodward




We don't expect to have the details at this stage we merely want to be

aware of that which might be given in evidence at a later stage.        We are

interested in types of evidence you are able to gather.        What I am going

to do is ask for certain things don't be afraid to tell us that you

can't provide anything.     Look upon this as an informal meeting amongst

friends.   Don't worry if we are asking for things that you can't provide

its just our way of getting to the heart of what is available.        The

important thing that you have been tasked with is to get the information

as much of it as you can, as fresh as it is at the moment, and you

appear to have done that or already made a very good start.




Turning to the inquiry we don't know yet what form it will take.        Lord

Justice Taylor c o u l d ’do it any way he wants.   It may be done straight

fowardly. In that case Counsel would present evidence.        It could be done

in many difference ways, e.g. I could present the case but call

witnesses to give the evidence that can be given.        The main thing at

this stage is that you must be flexible.       You must be prepared to give

us more than we want, sooner than we actually need it.        You must be

prepared for us ringing to say we need it in such a fashion and at such
a time and your plans should be flexible enough to cope with these

demands.    In short we have no fixed idea we just want to be best

informed.     I can give you examples of some of the questions.   E.g. why

was that man there.    Why did X do Y.   What we ought to ancitipate are

questions that a third party might ask of police actions.     We might in

conducting an inquiry along those lines be identifying difficulties that

are not agreed as difficulties by other bodies and the danger always is

missing out on covering difficulties that appear at the case, but at

this stage don't be afraid of gathering too much information.       You also

ought to be aware that the information you give us is privileged so you

should encourage anybody giving evidence to put in his feelings , his

worries etc.    He must be aware that confidentiality is assured.

Confidentiality is important.




DCC




In terms of validation of this information we have here, we have talked

about obtaining evidence from Inspectors and above and from everybody

Pc's and Sergeants etc. who were on duty outside Leppings Lane, is that

appropriate?




Mr Woodward




Yes, but we need to address our minds to t h e 'what if questions, eg. What

if Nottingham Forest fans were put at the Leppings Lane end (Mr Woodward

posed further hypothetical questions along this line).
Chief Supt Mole




We have addressed that one   (referring to the question about Nottingham

Forest fans) Popplewell talks at length about segregation.

Chief Superintendent Mole then reviewed P o pp l ew e ll 's recommendations in

this regard.




DCC




What this represents is a shift of stand point.




Mr Woodward




Yes, what you should do is test what you know about the events of the

afternoon and test what you decided upon that afternoon by reference to

what a layman might ask or a man on the Clapham omnibus might ask about

what you know and what went on.     You ought to be aware of what others

know and what others are saying in the press or otherwise about the

events of that Saturday.




Part of our concern is not only in enabling Lord Justice Taylor to

conduct his inquiry but part of the concern is how we should deal with

later litigation.   We must at this stage present our evidence in the

most appropriate manner having.an eye towards the future.       Now what are

these charts   (Mr Woodward points to 2 charts showing deployment, of

manpower at the Hillsborough Stadium and in its environs ) .




Chief Superintendent Mole then addressed the charts of deployment.
Mr Wooward




So you determined deployment by crowd flow that was expected?




Chief Supt Mole




Yes .




There then arose a discussion about the filling up of the North Stand in

relation to which turnstiles were used.




DCC




Can I answer this.   We only used turnstiles at Leppings Lane and this

may have contributed to the build up.     This could be an important

fa ct or .




Mr Woodward




Why was that?




Chief Supt Mole




To prevent clashes amongst fans.




Chief Superintendent Mole then went on to address the figures of the

actual deployment to explain why those figures were decided upon.      To

explain what the reasons why behind reducing the manpower in relation to
the 1988 Semi-Final, and Mr Mole also emphasized at this point the North

and South divide for the purposes of segregation.    In other words

Liverpool fans would have the North and West side of the ground and in

the main Nottingham Forest would have the East Spion Kop side.




Chief Superintendent Wain then referred to transport arrangements as a

result of this segregation.    Stations at Wadsley Bridge and Station in

town with bussing arrangements.   He, as well,picked upon this reduction

in manpower and reinforced the view that reduction was merely at the

peripheral points.    Chief Superintendent Wain also addressed the

turnstile flow at this stage i.e. that Nottingham Forest and Liverpool

fans arriving would enter by different turnstiles separated from each

other and therefore segregation was ensured.




Chief Supt Mole




I would also like to pick up on the   fD ' Division Operational Order.

'D ' Division is our City Centre Division and officers from fD ' Division

would meet Nottingham Forest fans at the Railway Station in the City and

would travel with the fans on buses and on arriving at the ground would

remain as a reserve at the ground until the end of the match when they

would return on the buses to the Station with the Nottingham Forest

fans.   Therefore this increases the number of officers that are shown on

these charts as being available for duty at the ground. . I should also

like to pick up on the earlier point of reduction in manpower.     We found

last year that our CID officers and others at the peripheray were under­

employed.   We had an excess of Sergeants and so when it came to planning

for this year we whittled those figures down yet maintained the 1988
figures in respect of the ground itself and the major points that were

considered to be important in successfully policing the operation.             The

over-estimation in 1988 was due to the nature of policing operations at

Sheffield Wednesday.      The normal First Division Football Games are

policed in p h a s e s , therefore officers are moved from phase 1 to phase 2

for example to ether d u t i e s .   On a football match   on the   scale of the

FA Cup Semi-Final all these officers would remain          at their single point,

therefore several officers were found to be unemployed at their single

point in 1 9 8 8 , and the reduction only took place on the peripheral

areas .




Mr Woodward




Tell me was there anything unusual about this match,         was    there anything

that had changed from last year?




Chief Supt Mole




I did the first bit of planning for the football match,         but I was

replaced 3 weeks before the match-and my successor therefore was a

change of Commander from last year.




Other changes that may or may not be significant are trains.           There

weren't so many this year.       In 1987 we had 10 trains,   in 1988 3 trains

and this year only 1 special train of Liverpool supporters.          Now we

wouldn't have that information until the very last minute because the

only thing we know for sure is that special trains can and do arrive at

Wadsley Bridge Station.      We wouldn't know until probably the morning of
the game how many trains were travelling.         Now this poses problems

because with 10 trains at 550 fans each it means that I know that 5,500

fans are arriving at one point at the same time and can be handled by

police officers meeting them from the train and accompanying them to the

ground.   Similarly in 1988 I had 3 trains arrive therefore 1,650 fans

could be received by police officers ana whisked straignt into the

ground.   Now this year only 1 train arrived with 450 fans on therefore

the other fans were arriving by alternative means and couldn't be so

easily controlled.     You ought to note that its the fans decision about

travelling and that this decision apparently made by several hundred

fans precluded the police from controlling the time of their arrival at

the ground.   Another change from last year was that tickets were printed

in various colours to denote the areas to which the fans were allocated.

This made it easier for the fans andyin a d d i t i o n _the tickets were

overprinted with the name of the Football Club to whom that particular

section of the ground had been allocated.         It made it easier for the

turnstile operators because all they had to do was check the colour of

the ticket, the name of the Club allocated to the section of the ground

and take one piece off the ticket and let the customer through.




DCC




What about people coming late .     That was a c h a n g e .




Chief Supt Mole




1987 Leeds    v   Coventry,   supporters arrived late at that match,      to such

an extent that it was necessary to delay the match.            I delayed the match
by 15 minutes.    In 1988 there was no problem,   the match kicked-off at

3 00pm therefore it was anticipated that it would be similarly trouble-

free this year.    In 1989 there is evidence to suggest that the fans were

here but they weren't at the ground.    Eg. the Traffic Division notes

show that the roads were clear in other words there weren't queues of

traffic waiting to get into the City.    The conclusion is that the fans

were here, the Liverpool fans in particular, but they had not made their

way to the ground.




Chief Supt Wain then referred to 14 40 time on Part IV of the Report

which confirms Mr Mole's statement.




DDC




Now there were other changes and I think this is what Mr Woodward wants.

People tell me for example,that they had never seen at other similar

football matches to this one so many non-ticket holders arriving, so

much alcohol brought to the football matchs,r and therefore having to be

consumed or disposed of at the turnstiles.    So much obduracy of fans, eg

mounted officers report that fans, were crawling through horses legs.

Mounted officers are usually able to clear an area without any

difficulty.   They report that this year for some reason they met

opposition from the Liverpool fans whom they were trying to control.        A

further change from last year is the problems that were encountered at

turnstiles.   People were trying to bribe their way into the match.

(Reference is then made to the observations section of bundle 5 which

begins at paragraph 5-53)
ACC (Staff Services)




I think its fair to say that the Liverpool fans because they were here

last year were quite familiar with the organization of the South

Yorkshire Police eg there was an incident at Stocksbridge which has been

related to me by a policewoman there.      The van was stopped and searched

and a crate of beer was discovered and underneath the crate was a note

saying we've beat     you this year your not getting our beer from us.     This

implies that they     knew the arrangements for gaining entry to the ground

and .the fact that alcohol would be taken from them and that they had

come prepared to consume their alcohol elsewhere and then get into the

ground untroubled by the South Yorkshire Police operation.




Chief Supt Wain




There is also the     story told to me by a police officer of a public    house

near to the ground,    I think its   called The Owl, where the Licensee   is

reported to have said "the fans came and drunk more beer in 2 hours

before the start of the game than I sold all last New Years Eve".




ACC (Staff Services)




On that theme there was an add; I understand^placed in the Liverpool Echo

by a Sheffield Licensee who stated "Liverpool fans you can come to my

pub this year and we'll not run out of beer".
Discussion then moved on to the bundle of documents prepared for this

meeting with Counsel.      The index was taken account of.         The first

document,   the map w a s .explained by Chief Superintendent Mole.




Chief Superintendent Wain then spoke to the history of South Yorkshire

Police and pointed out that as the report progressed it focussed more

and more on   'F ' Division and on the     'F ' Division Officers.




ACC (Staff Services)




There is a reference here to Chief Superintendent Duckenfield.               It ought

to be pointed out in addition to what is written here that he has

policed many football matches in his duties as Superintendent - City

C e n t r e , he has policed pop concerts and the l i k e .   He is a very

experienced chap.




Mr Woodward




Yes I would like to develop the background of Chief Superintendent

Duckenfield and we may like to know more about South Yorkshire's

experience in policing major events.




Chief Supt Mole




I will be covering that as far as Hillsborough ig concerned in my

historical account.
Mr Woodward




Yes I see here at paragraph 1.9 that South Yorkshire is widely

experienced at handling major events.




DCC




Perhaps we can supplement that with details of the policing of Orgreave

and of the steel strike etc.       (This was resolved,to develop profiles for

each-of the    'F ' Division Management Team and to supplement information

about South Yorkshire handling of major events with appendices

rel ating ).




Mr Wain then spoke to Part II of the document bundle, which related to a

simple description of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and its

facilities at Hillsborough Stadium.      The album of photographs which

accompany this description was introduced and the photographs were

referred to at length.




Mr Woodward




What I don't want you to do is disturb what you've already done.       This

is magnificant.     I just want you to add supplements as we go through and

raise anything e l s e .   I would suggest at the end 01 the day that it all

be indexed, but for this stage is it already on word processor?




Chief Superintendent Wain continued with his review of Part II.
I want to draw your attention particularly to paragraph 2.25.   You must

be_aware of talking about the centre pens etc.   They are referred to

here as pens 1 and 2 , but you'll notice on the maps that in order to

avoid confusion with the escape gates which are also numbered these pens

have been described by their geographical location.   Eg North West,

North, Centre North, Centre South and South.




Mr Woodward




Wag;-has caused the alteration that I note here to the CCTV arrangements?




Chief Supt Mole




Well the building of the roof on the Kop caused cameras to be moved.     We

found that when the roof was on the original cameras wouldn't give us

the p ic tu res.




Mr Mole then went on to address the Control Room and what's contained

therein.




Continue speech.




Superintendent Murray would be in that box, all the equipment which is

listed here at 2.29 is available to him.
DCC




I think it fair to say at this juncture that we did experience some

communication p r o b l e m s .




Chief Supt Wain




We are going to develop that later in this briefing.




Chief Supt Mole




Sheffield Wednesday Football Club have always kept the ground up to date

because they have wanted to keep the privilege of holding Semi-Finals

and the like.      Whenever       a recommendation has been made Sheffield

Wednesday Football Club           have complied with that.   When the green guide

raised the question of additional communications etc.           they put them in.




Mr Woodward




What monitoring of the turnstiles .is available?




Chief Supt Mole




The Controller can tell how many have come through the turnstiles by

computer print-out.        This computer flashes when it reaches a thousand

below capacity.       Now we      have a print-out for 3 00pm that day and   it will

show that 12,500 had gone through that still left            a capacity for a

further 2,000 to come through the turnstiles.
But hundreds ...no- , perhaps thousands^of people have come through the

gates .




Mr Woodward




At what time?




DCC




I have a note that at 2 53 pm Gate C was opened.    The point is that

there were more in the ground than those that were counted by compute




Mr Limb




Are there cameras trained on the turnstiles?




Chief Supt Mole




Yes.   Stands up and'points same out on map.




Mr Woodward




Someone may say for example if you have those cameras upon what basis

did you make your decision.   The computer or the cameras.
Chief Supt Mole




That camera would be trained on the turnstiles at all times and would be

available to the Commander on the day.




DCC




The Commander could have access to the computer and the camera pictures .




Mr Woodward




Is there an interplay at all? c-
the Club monitors}- the Police monitors.

Chief Superintendent Mole

We have a PC liaison man in the Club control room, we also have telephone links

with the police control room.

Chief Superintendent Wain then went on to talk of the equipment      that was

available in both control rooms and the means of communication between the two.




Moving on




Chief Superintendent Wain turns to Paper 3.     M r .Limb could I just make

reference to the Safety of Sports Ground Act which is mentioned in Part 3.        I

remember signs in a station that7on certain trains alcohol would not be

allowed,    there are therefore these dry trains which may deter fans from

travelling on them.    This may account for the problems you referred to earlier

as the reasons for fans deciding not to travel by trains this year.

Chief Superintendent Mole

Yes, you could be right.    There's also the problem of dealing with fans who

bring alcohol in box vans and the like, we have powers to deal with fans

bringing alcohol in buses, even mini-buses,   but not in the back of furniture

vans or transit vans etc.

Mr. Woodward

I think we may leave Part 3 now, I've just quickly gone through it,     there's

some useful information in there and it is very helpfully prepared but it may

reward further reading.
Mr. Woodward

Is there a copy of the Short report.

Chief Superintendent Mole

No, we didn't have a copy of the Snort report although it is referred to in

several sections.

DCC

Flag the fact that a short report is required,    and indeed all reports referred

to in Part 3.

Mr. Woodward

Can I go on from there, any piece of paper that is referred to throughout and

that we may refer to at the Committee of Inquiry should be produced in full,

it's no good us having the two pages to which you refer if some clever dick

wants to refer to the whole section.

Chief Superintendent Mole then introduced Part 4 of the bundle and spoke to it.

DCC referred everyone's attention to the synopsis that had been prepared of the

vital elements.

Chief Superintendent Mole talked about the selection of his management    team and

the background of these officers,    particularly with regard to their experience

in policing semi-final football matches and also mentioned the fact at this

stage that his replacement was not prejudicial to the operational efficiency of

the semi-final football operation as officers were at hand who had wide

experience themselves.

Mr .   M etcalf

Yes,    I think it would be very helpful to have some sort of curriculum vitae of

the senior officers attached as an appendix.

Mr. Woodward

Can I      turn      now t o         H arris        v Sheffield             U nited.           It    talks     in    there    about      the

the     nature       of    the       policing         operations              at    footb all         grounds.         Ca n y o u      tell    me

mo r e a b o u t     that?

Chief Superintendent Mole

Yes,     we d e t e r m i n e d          certain      policy          arising           from    that       case     and do    hold      regular

in?

M r . Woodward

It     seems    to    me       that       that      year       is    the    relevant           one    that     follow ed      the      case.

Chief Superintendent Mole

I could        get    hold          of    m intues        of    m eetings          in    other       years     and    in   this       year

DCC

Bu t    this    match          is    out       of   that       contractual              arrangement.

Deputy C h i e f          C onstable            th e n went          on t o      explain        how t h e      contract       works.

Chief Superintendent Mole

There       is    no        negotiation           goes      on o v e r    this       match.

M r . Woodward

Let    me r e a d           this.        He r e a d s      from a    section          of    H arris      v S heffield            U nited.

This    section              contained          the     phrase,      d iscu sses           needs       for    the       season    a n d Mr.

manpower l e v e l s                we d o n ' t ,    we    tell    them.

DCC

It    seems       to        be a n o t i o n a l      calculation             for    the    benefit          of    club       finances.        We

assess       matches              o n a n A,      B or      C category,             thus    we    categorise             these    matches          in

liaison          w ith       the      clubs     so    the    clubs       would       know how many m a t c h e s                were    category

A,    B or       C etc.           and    therefore          would    have       a rough          idea    of       the    manpower       that       would

be c o m m i t t e d         to     p olicing        such    a match.

League m atches               are        generally         more       predictable            because      the    biggest          proportion        of

fans     are       local    and          tend    to     do th e       same     things        week a f t e r     week.

Mr . Wo o d wa r d

Yes.

ACC ( S S )

On t h a t    point     we h a v e         learned            that    we     can a v o i d      problems      by recommending              Sunday

matches       or     by recommending                    kick -off      tim es      in    the    morning       before     pubs        are   open.
Now, significant to this whole enquiry is the opening of the gates.        I

understand that these gates have been opened before without any t r o u b l e .

M r . Woodward

Yes,    that's back to my earlier point.    What is the difference this year with

other games.

Chief Superintendent Mole

In the seven years that I have been at the Division,       I haven't known that the

gates have       been opened.

DCC

Well,    let me ask you about   this.   Superintendent Freeman is alleged to have had

a contingency to block off that tunnel in the event of a build-up of fans in

the enclosures.

Chief Superintendent Mole

So did I.    We have blocked them off.     The fans always go for the area behind

the goal.    We can put a cordon there and send them around.

M r . Woodward

So it seems there are two identifiables here.        1, the gate was opened,   2, no

cordon was placed.

Chief Superintendent Wain

Did this happen at league games?

Chief Superintendent Mole




It was just a contingency,      It may never have happened.
Points        to     the    gates       betweeen        the     enclosures              "It       seems        that       there       are    a lot      of

questions           around        there.

Chief Superintendent Mole

WE o f t e n       find     that    everybody           is    standing            at    the       back of           the     pens      and    so   we    keep

the     gates       between        the    pens        locked    until          we      find       that        the    enclosures             are   fillin g

at     the    front        and    then    the     gates       can    be opened               to    relieve           the    pressure.             The

Inspector           who h a s      a duty        in    that    area       of    the      ground          may d e c i d e         to   open one          or

both     gates        and he       can d e c id e       when.        I must            stress       that        on    this       match       everything

was     opened        before       hand.




There        are    also     gates       here     he    points       to     the        tunnel       area        on    the    map.

I understand               they    have       been c lo s e d       in    the       past.

Chief Superintendent Mole

T h a t 's r i g h t .

DCC

And a n o t h e r      thing,       people        get    packed          up a t        the    back       of    the        terrace      and on        this

occasion           people w i l l        have     entered,          tried       to     get        into    the        centre      sections,         found

it    packed w ith           people       at    the     b a ck and        therefore               have    shoved           all   the    more      to    get

into    the        sections        (point       left).

Chief Superintendent Mole

C gate       is     not    used    as     a    through        passage          for     spectators              at     any    time.
M r . Woodward

Are you saying that the gate was opened.

Chief Superintendent Mole

No, but police can get through by knocking.     It's used for taking out arrested

people or bringing in people arrested outside the ground.

DCC

So it is frequently used for official purposes.

Chief Superintendent Mole

Then there is this sterile area between C Gate and the tunnel, we often close

this area off to keep it a sterile area and to prevent       fans from moving between

the sections.

ACC (Staff Services)

What about this tunnel then, do we hold these k e y s .

No one answered this question.   (Flag for enquiry)

Chief Superintendent Mole shows the meeting a photograph from the album of

photographs looking from Gate C towards the tunnel,       "If you look at the next

photo you will see that there is a separation barrier there to split the crowd

comming through the tunnel into the two enclosures.

DCC

Let me see if I can expand this matter a little,      there is nothing in the

operational order to talk about this contingency that we are referring to, nor

I understand is it referred to at the briefing and it wasn't referred to at the

briefing given by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield,       so this   'contingency'   is

not officially documented and just for completness on this point it's worthy of

note that Chief Superintendent   Duckenfield used his own notes at the briefing
                                                                                      - /,




which he has since handed over to the West Midlands team,      therefore, we cannot

refer to those at this stage to see just what was said about       that.


Mr. Metcalf

Wouldn't we expect stewards to be checking the enclosures.

Chief Superintendent Mole

Yes, and they were briefed on that day by four Inspectors, where they were to


go, what they were to do etc.

Mr. Metcalf

Would you expect the call to come through the club.

Chief Superintendent Mole

Yes, they have done that in the past and incidentally the man in charge of

stewards at the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club is Doug Lock, who was formerly

Superintendent at   'F ’ Division,   and so has a wide knowledge of the policing

arrangements for matches held at Hillsoorough.


 DCC

 Would there be stewards on the tunnel entrance?

 Chief Superintendent Mole

 I can't answer that.

 DCC

 Let's pick up on Mr. Metcalf's point, can we clarify whether the call has come

 in the past through club stewards to move people from one pen to another

 because now you appear to be saying something different.

 Chief Superintedent Mole

 I have known then come through on a problem but not specifically on the type of

 problem that you refer to here.      But yes,   I would have expected it.
DCC

It seems then that there is no positive responsibility (to Mr. Metcalf).

Mr. Metcalf

That's fine I wanted to know in practice regardless of any formal arrangements.

DCC

I think we ought to have an Appendix on stewards       (Flag for action).

Mr. Woodward

Yes, just a thumb nail note please,       how many were there, where were they, what

were they expected to do, what were       they asked to do, what did   they do etc.

Now do the police consider it their responsibility for noting that the

enclosures are getting full.

Chief Superintendent Mole

I would always look for that type of situation arising,       I know   that I've got

some leeway in the safety figures I can always fit more in when the         computer   is

telling me it's full, but if I decided it was full then I would just send a

message to close the turnstiles and that would be i t .

M r . Woodward

I understand you would take the necessary steps but, is it your responsibility.

Chief Superintendent Mole

I think it would fall upon us on the basis of protecting public safety.

ACC (SS)

The computer flags the capacity,       surely the club would be looking for that.

Chief Superintendent Mole
                 11 -   .~ C V - - t

Yes, Graham Mackrell would be telling me that. .

Mr. Woodward
Let's say he states that he wishes to close one stand or let fewer people in

one stand than it would hold, what would you do, whose responsibility is it to

ensure the safety of spectators if he did that.

Chief Superintendent Mole

Graham would say, in fact he has said in the past,      that I ve got problems

fitting spectators in to a particular stand can X open the North stand which is

membership only, and I've agreed to put them in there even though thep* were-'*'

members,   thereby lifting the membership arrangements.

M r . Woodward

This goes back to the crucial Question why are you there at a 1 1 .

DCC

If I was asking about apportionment of fans when the centre sections are full ,

who makes the decision.       I am sure the Club are going to say the Police always

do that but whose responsibility is i t ?

Chief Superintendent Mole

I don't think he will,     I see me as an adviser to him to allow him to steward

the ground.

M r . Woodward

This goes back to my original question,      "What were you doing there in the first

place?"    (Point left).

M r . Limb (Counsel's No 2)

Going back,      there was talk a couple of days after this incident about similar

problems that arose at Barnsley v Everton,      I think that is on your ground

(question posed of Chief Superintendent Mole).

Chief Superintendent Mole
Yes, my new ground.   Mr. Simpson my Superintendent at Barnsley I understand

opened the gates to allow people in,   the Club have thus refused to pay for the

policing of that football ground in that we broke the agreement    that we had

with the Club.   It flies in the face of a decision that was made at a meeting

which was attended by chairmen of the football clubs    (Flag for acquisition of

minutes of that meeting).

Mr. Woodward

It seems then that this is parallel near miss according to the media.       You know

to which match we refer,    I think we ought to have a look at it because someone

will definitely ask (Flag for action).

Mr.Limb

My second question is the numbered gates that are at the front of the

enclosures, what are they used for?

Chief Superintendent Mole

Ingress and egress in an emergency.     We often open those gates to relieve

pressure or to allow someone in difficulties,    such as young fans,    to move out

of that enclosure into another enclosure.     They are there for the safety of

spectators.

M r . Limb

Just one more question.     Was any direct contact made with the F.A.

Chief Superintendent Mole

No, it was telephone contact from Graham Ma.ckrell of the Club who asked if we

could police the semi-final on a particular date.     I confirmed that there was

no change from last year and if that remained the case then we would be able to

 go ahead, he asked if we could change the ends,   I said No.   He came back to me
and said O.K. we'll go for the same arrangements that we had last year.

M r . Woodward

What do you mean by changing ends?

Chief Superintendent Mole

They wanted the Spion Kop end for the Liverpool supporters but this raised the

problem of segregation.

Mr.Limb

Were terms ever written down as a result of these arrangements?

Chief Superintendent Mole

No.

Mr.Limb

Page 10 of this document which deals with turnstiles flow, on the best estimate

you could get them all in in one hour.

Chief Superintendent Mole

Yes, all tickets.     1000 per hour, we had 15 turnstiles so could cope with 15,000

in one hour.      The capacity for that end of the ground is 14,500.   Turnstiles

opened at 12 noon, we expect to get 30/40% of the spectators in before 2.00 pm

and in planning terms I know that they can all be accommodated even if all

15,000 came at once in one hour.

Chief Superintendent Wain

We are going to produce that page 10 as a separate schedule (Flag for action).




DCC

I think 1 -      10 turnstiles served the North stand on this occasion (None of the

members of the meeting were sure).      (Flag to check).

                        What the Anna Cappa people have is notes from these

                        the video,    etc.

DCC then explains    the Anna Cappa system in full.

CH. SUPT. WAIN          So what we hope to do is get statements to v a l i ­

                        date all that.

DCC                     I think the point is that the bundle you have is

                        the best information we have to hand.

MR. WOODWARD            Fine .

CH. SUPT. WAIN          I think we need to go through the whole of this

                        section.

Ch. S u p t . WAIN begins       review Section 5-

MR. WOODWARD            Was there a failure of communications?

CH. SUPT. WAIN          I think we will need to investigate the report of

                        failure that we h a v e .

DCC                     I have some information in this regard.       Some

                        people report a ticking, others report clipped

                        messages, which made them undecipherable.          A

                        Commuaications PC goes and changes the set and

                        reports that communications are then OK, but this

                        morning,    Supt. Marshall and others report that at

                        about 2 .30pm they had problems with communications.

                        Yet others say that they couldn't hear the radio

                        because of the cacophony of noise with which

                        they were surrounded.       (Action recquired to

                        establish the nature of this problem)

MR. WOODWARD            Was there anything in the vicinity that would

                        Interfere with the cc~~,unicaticns , sucn as C3,

                        etc .
CH. SUPT. MOLE   There have been reports of some local radio stations

                 transmitting close by, and interfering with

                 communications, but they are ac oesr u n c o m i r m e d .

                 When I attended after the incident had taken place

                 the communications were still d o w n .    They were

                 having to deal with matters on tr.e 'taiK tn r ou gn '

                 facility    (Mr. Mole explains    'talk through'

                 f ac 1111 y )

DCC              Let me add the significance of this.        Supt.

                 Marshall radioed a message to Control that because

                 of the problems that he has had with communi­

                 cations , he imagines that he is not being received

                 at Control.     The Controller will say, on the other

                 hand,   that they were deliberating on his questions

                 when the gates were opened prior to their response.

CH. SUPT MOLE    I know one officer will say he heard Supt. Marshall

                 asking for the gates to be opened, but he wasn't

                 answered.

DCC              I'm told that    'talk through'   is the normal mode

                 of transmission at football matches.

CH. SUPT. WAIN   We'll clear that up in the investigation acout the

                 communications pro o l em s.

MR. WOODWARD     This paragraph 5(15) what do we mean oy         ceccmes

                 critic al '?

DCC              I think that reflects a feeling from tne oificer

                 on the ground that he has lost control of the ^

                 situation.
MR.   WOODWARD     Does it mean they have lost control or that there

                   is some iminent danger to person or persons?            You

                   can see the difference,     this is important.

CH.   SUPT.WAIN    i think that's answered later in that paragraph

                   where it talks of heavy congestion and people

                   being tightly packed.       Let me go back to where

                   officers were sri.ven orders to s h o d   ses.rcning.

DCC                Some of the witnesses at de-briefing suggest that

                   the searches weren't blocking the flow at all,

                    they were merely withdrawn because of the tignt

                   packing,   thev were isolated within the crowd c.nd

                    there was very little they could do with the

                   pronerty once they had searcned and decided to

                    confiscate anything.     I think we may find that

                    the throttling of the through-put arose because

                    the^e were peooie there at the turns L,^les wno hdd

                    other intentions than to pass immediately through

                    and into the ground.

CH. SUPT. WAIN ;    Let me refer to paragraph 5(16) which talks about

                    the steward opening Gate     1B 1 and thereby causing

                    a greater problem.

DCC                 There is some ambiguity about the position with

                    regard to the stewards.      A number oi stewards

                    from Liverpool,   on the   'old boys' network,    appear

                    to have attended with tickets, shown them to a

                    gate steward, pointed out they were stewaras from

                    Liverpool,   and gained access without going

                    thrcuch the turnstiles.      A Police    Inspector ispo.
DCC                    having had to stop this activity because        stewards

                       were then handling tickets back to, the crowd

                       waiting outside.

MR. WOODWARD           How could this be?

No-one at the meeting was able to answer.         (Flagged for enquiry)

MR. WOODWARD           Is it likely to have added significantly        to the

                       numbers going through,      the significance,   I suppose,

                       was more to do with the impression that this would

                       create amongst those that were left outside.

DCC                    Now I recall^the word was that 50 came in, 50

                       stewards from Liverpool,      one of them gathered their

                       tickets    together, went outside and handed 49 tickets

                       to people waiting outside,      and 50 came back in

                       again.

ACC                ;   We do know that bartering was going on at the
STAFF SERVICES
                       turnstiles,    and there were other attempts to gain

                       entry,    for example,   there were reports of fans

                       keeping turnstile operators occupied whilst other

                       people crawled through their legs , over the turn­

                       stiles and into the ground.

CH. SUPT. WAIN         This remains speculation at this stage, until we

                       gather our evidence.

MR.   WOODWARD         Message clearly understood.

CH.   SUPT. WAIN       Turning to paragraph 5(19), I interpret that,         for

                       example,   that they had lost communications.

DCC                    At some point there is a life-threatening problem

                       in this area (points to a section on the map

                                                •ates) so a decision is made
DCC                to open   'C' gate, with the intention of relieving

                   that pressure by enabling some of the people to

                   come out of the area, round the corner and into

                   'C ' Gate.

HR. LIMB           To what extent was Gate      'B ' opened?

CH. SUPT.   WAIN   Not at all at that time.

DCC                Gate   'B' was opened at 2 . 3 0 p m , to relieve the

                   pressure, but closed almost imm eGiately.         1 have

                   heard different figures of 50 to 500 mentioned as

                   having gone through without passing through the

                   turnstiles.     (Ch. Supt. Mole reviewing photograph

                   bundle,   confirms that Gates    1-10 were serving on

                   that day as means of entering the North Stand).

HR. WOODWARD       Let's get back to this pressure situation.

CH. SUPT. WAIN     There is talk in here about a g a t e ,supposedly

                   Gate   'B ' 'dancing'.   Moving on to paragraph 5(24)

                   we have got to check on that information.

DCC                Perhaps I can help again.       Mr. Marshall,    as I unde:

                   stand.-it, asked for 2 things - one a tannoy

                   announcement,    and two, a Lanarover with a public

                   address system,    to tell the f sn s in that area to

                   stay calm and not to push.       As I understand it,

                   (2 ) was acted upon, but no.response was gained to

                   his first request.

HR. WOODWARD       Who opened that gate?

DCC                We don't know yet.       No policeman has ac cually come

                   forward tc say tlicit h ~   ooened tns srats -     *
                                                                      ■

                   Ma” cra:5 's aim was to emoty that area (points
DCC            again to area between Gate    'S' and Gate    'C 1) to

               save lives.     He requested Gate   'C 1 be opened

               specifically.     It happened like this, Inspector

               Purdy, who was at that area,    tried to make contact

               with Supt. Marshall, who was standing out on

               Lercings Lar.e , on the bridge which crosses the

               river, he couldn't get through on the radio and

               was therefore obliged to walk to where Mr. Marshall

               was standing,   and Inspector Purdy told Supt.

               Marshall,   "If you don't open those gates, people

               will be killed."    Supt. Marshall specifically

               requested that Gate    'C' be opened, his aim being

               to relieve the pressure within that area, Ground

               Control is still apparently considering the

               request, when the decision is taken away from them

               by the gate being opened, and we don't know yet

               who actually opened that gate, but it could be

               that every officer was picking up Supt. Marshall's

               request-for the gate to be opened.

MR. WOODWARD   What would Ground Control have done, given time

               to make its decision?

DCC            Another relevant factor is that a Sergeant (Ch.

               Supt. Mole interjects - Sergeant 1066) makes a

               retort; from here, as Gate   'A' , at about 2.53-

               His report goes something like this, "If the gates

               aren't opened, people will die."      The message he

               got back from Ground Control was, "If that's the

               case, then open the gate."
CH. SUPT. WAIN       Gate 'C 1 was only opened between 14.48 and 14.50.

DCC                  The Mounted officers then move into that area and

                     shove the crowd back, to clear the problem.

MR. WOODWARD         Clarify the 'shove back', where were they shoved

                     back to?

CH. SUPT. MOLE       Well aefinately towards Leppings Lane, not back

                     into the area towards the turnsiiles.

CH. SUPT. WAIN       You will see at paragraph 5(32) that Gate 'C' is

                     opened again, and Gates     'A' and 'B' are also opened

                     at that time.

MR. LIMB             Where does the close circuit television on the

                     South West corner cover?

DCC                  I've seen the film, see along here (points along

                     the back of the West Stand).     We could see fans

                     moving between this area (points     to wall which runs

                     alongside Gate    'B ') , but I could not see through

                     to Gate 1B 1.    I did see fans streaming through.

MR. WOODWARD         Are these films annotated with time?

DCC                  Yes, thejLiu time elapse.

Ch. Supt. WAIN Continues reviewing the Paper 5-

DCC brings   meeting back to the point about Inspector Purdy's concern,

and points   tothetnap where Inspector Purdy was.    There then   arose

some ambiguity ^out which fence was the fence in question

Ch. Supt. WAIN then continued reviewing the Paper.

When Mr. WAIN r^ched paragraph 5(35) ~

CH. SUPT. MOLE       This is significant, because that's when the

                     players came out on the pitch.

DCC                   So they would be met with a roaring crowd andthat
DCC               is when the rush started.      (Check to see if times

                  co incide)

DCC               However,    the video at this time appeared to m a l ­

                  function,    the fans appeared to be rushing,   but that

                  might be my perception,     and may not be what what

                  actually happening, because the film appeared to be

                  running on faster than in previous parts of the

                  video.

MR. WOODWARD      Was it out of syna?

DCC               Yes, somebody has mentioned that fact, other people

                  have mentioned other factors, such as pressing a

                  wrong button,     or moving it frame by frame in time

                  elapse,    etc.

                  However, when these gates were opened, within

                  seconds there was no problem outside,     it was

                  reported that within seconds the whole mass of

                  people that were outside the ground had disappeared.

ACC               Was the North Stand full at that time?      Could we
STAFF SERVICES
                  tell by- looking at the video of the crowd around

                  that time or by the turnstile computer?

CH. SUPT. MOLE    Yes, we'll have a figure on the print-out.

MR. METCALFE      Could fans going through those turnstiles have got

                  over into the West Stand?

CH. SUPT. MOLE:   No, not without difficulty,     they could have climbed

                  over, etc.

DCC               But this situation here at turnstiles     1-10 meant

                  that the fans coming through the turnstiles were
DCC                    only met with a barrier about waist high,      it appears

                        therefore that they were able to gain access into

                        the West Stand, but there is no evidence to suggest

                        how many did that.

Ch. Supt. WAIN moved on to paragraph 5(40).

MR.   WOODWARD         What does this phrase   mean,   "indications to suggest”?

DCC                    People coming through   in such numbers and that

                        gates other than Gate 'C' were now open.

CH.   SUPT.WAIN        The film at this time   shows that there was plenty

                        of room in the wings, they were just packed in the

                        centre.

Moving away from Part 5, Ch. Supt. Wain quickly reviewed Part 6 .

Ch. Supt. MOLE introduced Part 7 and highlighted several factors,            e.g.

the evacuation procedures and the fact that they had been tested twice

this season.      (Action - Find Evacuation Procedures reports)

MR. WOODWARD            Can I move on to the following points -

                        The reports by Chief Constables to Police

                        Authorities, as required by the Police Act of 1964,

                        surely .-these must have a reference to the policing

                        of football matches and major events.

CH. SUPT. WAIN          Yes, only short references     (Action required to

                        obtain Annual Reports 1980-1988 and pick out

                        references to policing operations at football

                        matches and major events)

MR. WOODWARD            Now, what about the club's Safety Certificate?

CH. SUPT. MOLE          We've got that, but it's odd it that it's not been

                        handed over to the Local Authority from the South

                        Yorkshire County Council yet.
DCC                   Our Chief Superintendent Denton tells me that we

                      wrote to the new Sheffield City Council about this

                      Safety Certificate.    We received a reply and Mr.

                      Denton referred them to a specimen of the

                      certificate that they may wish to use in drawing

                      up their new certificate.     However, he received a

                      certificate which had been diluted in many areas,

                      including the section which deals with the policing

                      of the ground.

CH. SUPT. MOLE           seems that we have been ruled out of the safety

                      considerations.

MR. WOODWARD         What is the date of this certificate that we do

                      have?

CH. SUPT. MOLE       1 9 7 0 f but we are still on that old one.

DCC                  But we have tried our best to modernise it.

                      (Obtain correspondence between Force and Local

                      Council on this matter)

M R . WOODWARD       Moving on, what about Section 13 Collaboration

                      Notices?

DCC                  N o , we only have informal mutual aid.

Ch. Supt, WAIN   referred back to the question of ground safety.

MR. METCALFE         Is there any correspondence between you and    the

                     Council?    (See previous flagging)

MR. WOODWARD         Were there any discussions, etc. since 1979    on the

                     Ground Safety Certificate?

CH. SUPT. MOLE       Only annual meetings.

DCC                  We'd better pull together details of those

                     meetings.   (Flagged for action)
MR. WOODWARD         Have the services that police provide outside the

                     ground been categorised as      'special services'    as

                     per the Police Act?

DCC                  No,    inside the ground is   'special services',    out­

                     side isn't.

MR. WOODWARD         Thus,   the problems are outside the ground,    there­

                     fore you are there nor on      'special services'    but

                     as what?

CH. SUPT. MOLE       What they are paying for at the club are people

                     inside the ground.

MR. WOODWARD         They're paying for a service, not for men?

CH. SUPT. MOLE       Yes,    I can't say that this 4 and 40 officers are

                     being paid for.     (Flag this point - not resolved

                     during discussions.     Is there a concern here that

                     the club may suggest that the police were providing

                     a 'special service'    that had been paid for and

                     specifically requested at the Leppings Lane turn­

                     stiles?     This needs to be resolved).

DCC & MR. WOODWARD   It doesn't matter,    for they're paying for a service
simultaneously
                     and would still be paying for that service even if

                     we (point left)

MR. METCALFE         I can't see how the West Midlands team can periorm

                     their task and be ready to go’ on the 15.May.         This

                     will have to be sorted on Friday,if we are to call

                     evidence we need some idea oi the time scale

                     involved.     I also wonder as well (addressing Mr.

                     Woodward) if you need to be there throughout the
MR. WOODWARD   It may help if we look upon ourselves as          'the

               accused', we need now to gather as much information

               as we can, in the time that is available,          there­

               fore I ask you gentlemen to continue from the

               point that you have already reached, which is n o ’

               mean, feat in tne time that was a v a n a o i e   to ycu,

               I ask you to cast ycur net as widely as you can,

               gather what you think myself or Mr. Metcalfe,            in

               our most perverse mood may require of you,          and get

               it together for whenever you can.

DCC            As to the scope of the enquiry, we focussed on a

               time up to about 3-15 or 3 -3 0 , do we need at this

               stage to focus on consequences?

MR. WOODWARD   Yes, I think so, why did somebody not do something

               might be a question?     Why did someone die when

               they needn't have done?      It's those sorts of

               questions that we need to be aware of.

DCC            A s ’an example then, Ch. Supt. Duckenfield would

               need to- relate his account from the time of coming

               on duty up to the time that he eventually left

               duty,   is that right?   (From Ch. Supt. Wain -

               reinforce this point at briefings)

MR. WOODWARD   Yes.

DCC            So we need all of this that has already been pre­

               pared, plus a summary of what happened thereafter?

MR. WOODWARD   Because there are these writs expected, we ought to

               have the information that is available now,         to

               answer those in the long term.
CH.   SUPT. MOLE   But when does the incident finish?

M R . WOODWARD     I would suggest that your account,       for    example,

                    should be the time you attended the ground to the

                    time you actually go home.        That would act as a

                    core for us to work from.        We would choose what we

                    wane to leave in and what we want to leave out,            ana

                    where the emphasis should lie.

CH. SUPT. MOLE      But time scales go out of the window,         I was there

                    all that time and can't remember what I was doing

                    at any given time.

DCC                You can only really do what you can do.

M R . WOODWARD     Yes,   that     doesn't matter,   do the best you    can.

                    Identification,    for example, may not be relevant,

                    but put it- in, and get one or two others who may

                    want to put all their thoughts and experiences of

                    that day down on paper, as a sort of catharsis^ to

                    do the same.

DCC                So     who should be interview?      For example, there are

                   Specials,     there were thousands of officers on duty

                    in total.    What we have done so far is ask for

                   accounts from all Inspectors and above who were on

                   duty that day, and also those officers of those

                   ranks who attended in response to Operations

                   Support (Action this)      Then for the PC's and

                   Ser geants, we have only actioned those who were at

                   the Leppings Lane end of the ground.

MR. WOODWARD       Yes,   that's fine, we have to be sensible.
The main players in this are doing their own accounts is that O.K. or

would you rather someone take their statement.




Mr Woodward




It c o u l d n’t be better.   They can put all the things in that they want

and we will sort them out.




DCC




So as far as the       aftermath is concerned a few of the major players

involved if they       provided full accounts that would suffice?




Mr Metcalfe




Yes.      That would   be fine.




There then followed a discussion about       the trading of minutes with

Miss Nortcliffe.       This was agreed.




Mr Woodward




What are the terms of reference for the tribunal?




Mr M e t c a l f e




I know but I ha v e n ’t got them with me.
Chief Supt Wain




What about a deadline for this inquiry?




Mr Woodward




Your heading in the right direction.   Don't let up now.




Mr Metcalfe




We could be asked to submit papers by the 5 May.




Mr Woodward




Lets see what happens on Friday.   If I said the 10 May what would you

say?




Chief Supt Wain




We would have to work to the 10 May.




Mr Woodward




Right lets go for the 10 May, dependant on what happens on Friday.   I

would rather have the matter conducted properly rather than quickly, and

this will be stressed at the preliminary hearing on Friday.
Mr Metcalfe




Even if a couple of officers could give an account of afterwards that

would be something to work on.




Chief Supt Wain




Is there any special format for presenting the information?




Mr Woodward




As is this is more than acceptable.




DCC




What about indexing?




Mr Woodward




Don't worry about indexing yet.   It would help however if this was

transposed onto a word processor so that the thing could be moved

ar ou nd .




Chief Sapt Wain




It will be going onto the computer from tomorrow so we can do anything

we want with it then.
 Mr Woodward




As a final point I would like it to be passed to your officers that

 anyone can tell Mr Metcalfe in confidence anything they want.      Any

observations on how or why the incident happened.      They can place this

 information in a sealed envelope and send it to Mr Metcalfe or sent it

 through you or telephone Mr Metcalfe and tell him.     (Raise at

bri efings).




DCC




'And is this privileged information?




Mr Woodward




Yes, I wouldn't want to inhibit officers from feeling able to answer the

question of how and why the event occurred so confidentiality is a vital

ingredient.




Mr Metcalfe




We must start then with self served statements and I can follow up 011

any questions that I have that arise as a result of those.




The meeting closed with exchanged compliments at 6 30 pm.

Appendices    1-21   except for Appendix 16 were then handed to

Miss Nortcliffe (A second set and the outstanding Appendices are to

be copied on the 27 April 1989 and passed to Solicitors.

Chief Constable:     I'm not in the business of questioning decisions,
                     questioning graphics, I know that everything that was done
                     was done in the proper spirit and proper attitude of
                     dealing with a very very difficult situation but it is the
                     chronology of events which it seems to me are essential
                     for me to get in my mind.  I thought the best way we could
                     do this is to go through the events as I understand*them
                     and to get the individuals who can comment on those events
                     as I understand them to say so,   Don't be concerned about
                     disagreeing with me and If you disagree with my
                     understanding of what 1 think happened say so but It's
                     really an ability to grasp the overall picture,     I think
                     I've got a good Idea of it now bjut there will be detail.
                     Each of you will have in your mind the detail of events
                     you witnessed and we know the parameters of what you
                     see are very narrow when tired and therefore d o n ’t try and
                     adjust your mind to what someone else is saying.     Stick to
                     what you know, stick to what you saw and don't attempt to
                     add explanations of it or try and make logic of it because
                     there are so many Illogical aspects.   So we open the gates
                     as 12.00 noon and by 2,30 pm the Nottingham section of the
                     ground was fairly full but at that time I think i t ’s true
                     that the control in the ground realised that there were a
                     lot of gaps and a lot of areas to              the. .
                     Liverpool stand.  That's at 2,30 pm. -       ything happen
                     before 2.30 pm that anybody sees %s' significant?



Cii Supt            I looked out at 2,30 pm.   The Nottingham fans had got into
Duckenfield:        the Spion Kop and as far as I was concerned it was pretty
                     full, they were In the other areas on the south stand and
                     it was remarkable as far as I was concerned that the north
                      stand was almost empty' and also the Leppings Lane stand-;"*
                      particularly on the terracing.



Chief Con stab le:   Can anyone give an explanation as to why they w e r e n ’t
                     there ?



Supt Marshall;       Because they were drinking outside off-licences.


Cnief Constable:     Is this personal percsotion?



Supt Marshall:       No it's not perception sir I ’ve actually seen it, we have
                      seen it, its Iac c , Trie Gateway supermarket in. Kilner Wav
                     were selling four packs and bottles of wine through a
                     hole In the door.    There were hoards of people on the
                     grass outsiae Haitoras near Halifax Road drinking.       The
                      same applies there were 200 punters outside the     ?
                     public house drinking. Every off-licence that was open
                     was doing a roaring t r a d e .



msp   Sykes:         Can I try and put It into perspective.   At 2,30 pm the
                     mas3 o:' people outside was such that I discussed with Suot
                     Marsnaux ana we c.osea tne road to vehicular traffic that
                     was tne sneer weight of numbers out there at that time.


Supt Marshall:       I have in my notes that at 2.15 pm Leppings Lane was full
                     or ians ana m Doth airections and were drinking and we
                     had to close tne road but there was a delay in that
                     because of the fact that service buses were still coning
                     :rorn tne roan a own into tne ueppings Lane terrace.


Chief Constable:     So we've got a picture of people from Liverpool In the
                     vicinity of the ground.      'time we got any evidence .that
                     there was a delay in traffic that resulted In'the
                     Liverpool f a n s ’ arrival at the ground being as late as it




         Result:     Mo sir, I can tell you that as far as Penistone Road and
                     Ha Li fax Road and Laiigsett Road that they were cornnletely
                     sterile of football traffic, It was amazing, certainly by
                     v.yv/v.dt P;t i travelled ail the way from the city centre,
                     all the way through to Halifax Road.



Cniet Constable:     So there is no evidence whatsoever of the delay in transit
                     of the fans.  The fans arrived at the ground vicinity
                     early enough to go in the ground but instead went
                     drinking.     THIS WAS AGREED.
Insp Sykes:            There were fans there who said there had been delay.      I ’•ve
                       no idea whether they came by car, coach, or tra n .



Chief Constable:       Can we just check on that aspect on the network of points
                       and covers to make sure whether or not there is any delay
                       anywhere.  It's simply to get ...



                       Sir, the special was in early it was due at l':02 ana that
                       was in at about I .:o p-i and that was the only train In
                       which Is contributory as well ...



Chief Constable:       What about the buses?



Insp Hand-Davies:      Mo real problems as far as   .,,



Ch Supt Hesbit:        No sir, you could travel - at 2,30 pm I drove from along
                       Penistone Road past the ground to Halifax Road and there
                       was no traffic whatsoever.



Chief Constable:       Alright, well lets use as a basis for that then if there
                       was delay It was Individual delay, It wasn't mass delay
                       and there wasn't any holdups that added to tne frustration
                       of people coming to the mat on. That seems to be straight
                           .......~


                       Now, clearly at 2.30 pm we'd got problems i n that area.
                       We'd got the road close;!, w e ’d got the sheer mass of
                       people, would anyone like to "■give me and , . . we've used at
                       figure of 3/^ thousand for about ten to three, that was
                       the sore of broad figure that was given to me.      Now was
                       there a build up between 2.30/2,13 ptm     So what numbers
                       are we talking about at 2.30 pm?



Coot McKay:            In excess of 3,000 and from what I could see    ...



Chile f Constable:     At 2.30 pm?



                       Yes aad increasing.   Can I take you back, It ’s worth
                       mentioning the history and this of course Is a repeat of
                       last year's semi-final.   I was at that gats Leppings bane
                       last year, the fans were certainly not there in those
                       numbers at that particular time last year and the Increase
                       came at 2.35 P“i when all the drunken louts appeared and
                       wanted entrance then.



Chief   Cons table :   But we'd got problem:: before   2.55 pm.
Supt McKay:                 We had,   they w e r e ■arriving   ...



Chief Constable:            Don't let's go/run on ahead and that's what I'm anxious to
                            do.  Erie focus of this enquiry will be on the period tine­
                            as 1 see it from about 2.30 pm to about 3-10 pm. After
                            that it's just a question of how we dealt with it after
                            that .


Supt; McKay:                The picture Is one of congestion at 2,30 pm increasing
                            continually throughout because of the inability of the few
                            turnstiles to process the people as fast as they arrived.
                            They were arriving faster and the situation deteriorated
                            from 2.30 pm and never Improved.



Chief Constable:           Wliat resources were deployed in that area at that time,
                          alias it in hindsight enough.  lAMfrfe the resources that we've
                          ''allocated there deployed in that area.     THIS WAS AGREED,



(Mr Wright then scans room for Insp Purdy - who was not present but at that
       w ording   s j-ScwiicTc /



Uniei eras                  Because as 1 understand it Roger, Mr Purdy was very much
                            involved.



                            Yes he was because by 2 .1’ era there was an enormous press
                            of fans pushing ..,


                            Guay, but:   before ve geeso 2 . g pm, has anyone     any suing   to
                            say about    the period between 2. 30/2 ,^5 prn?



 tee   Marshal;             That was the period when the mounted officers and foot
                            offisers were actually rounding up fans to get triers into
                            trie ground. We were busy trying to shepherd fans towards
                            the gate.


                            fo and to teat, at 2.30 prn there was a huge presence that
                            we csuld see on the cameras outside the lappings lane
                            turnstiles hue that number that were there should have
                            gone into the ground by 3-00 pm.



Chief Constable:            Arid shouldn't have been      any problem,   AGREED - NONE.

                            Can you tell me what the general picture was, how many
                            arrests were taking place?  Were there any arrests taking
                            place?  AGREED - KGKE,
Insp Sykes:         Virtually impossible, the people who were arriving had -—
                    been drinking and the sheer mass of numbers of people with
                    drink and .. .



Chief Constable:    And if we'd started making arrests we would hat's , , ,



                    Tell me about the radio.              There was some fault/problem
                          cris r'acic              c-.i.„


Sups Hurray:        At that time reports were coming in into the control room
                    from officers outside.



Chief Constable:    Were you in'control?



Supt Hurray:        Yes sir, that there were radio problems that messages were
                    breaking up and they w e r e n ’t receiving control. We have a
                    civilian communications officer on stand-by and before we
                    could contact him he actually came round to the control
                    room ana said 'the radios are breaking up I've come to see
                    what I can do'.  Ke did replace the pack set.



Chief Canstable:    Can anybody say whether that caused anything other than
                    irritation.  Did it in any way contribute to the events
                    which followed?



Cure Hart nail:     Yes. 1 thins it did.  I was trying to pass a message about
                    the gate ana I could not get through on the ratio and 1
                    eventually changed cnanneb on my set to Hammerton Road to
                    tala about the problem of the gate.   I would say that time
                    was a little bit later than a .30 pm because tne problems
                    surrounding the gate were about 2 R R pm.



Chief Cane table:   You see now, you've got to be very careful here because we
                    are talking about the gate and the gates.  You are fcMkiitg
                    about how many gates?



Cant Marshall:      7 V/-U..O t :\: i ^ 3,cout trite r"      3.1 cris sia-ie ci   zr,o Lcppin^3
                    Lane turnscile.



(Mr Hayes clarifi as and points on the plan to the gate spoken of).



Chief Cone table:   That's gate ’C',   There's another gats, gate *B'.  That
                    feature it seems to me, I'm anxious to get this particular
                    astect...   You were talking about relieving the press in
                    front of the thing and the press was caused by everybody
                    Cram.at to get in the ground within a short period of time.
                   When the message was passed that you wanted the gate
                   opened it wasn't received in the first instance.           Is that
                   right?  I've made a statement ...



Sunt Marshall:     That is right.     Eventually I was able   ...



Chief Constable:   That tins Roger,   what time are we talking about?



Supt Marshall:     Probably about 2 .;i5 .



Chief Constable:   About 2.45 pm when you first decided,      in conjunction with
                   Mr Purdy as well.



Supt Marshall:     The situation became untenable outside and Mr Purdy was          in
                   extremis at that stage and was beg-ging for me to do
                   something to relieve the problem.



Cnief Constable:   when he was talking about the gate which gate was he
                   talking about?



Supt Marshall:     He's   talking about the gate at the side,   gate   'CM.



                   Mould it help If I Indicated the ... at this point because
                   the gate 'C ' was never under any pressure at that point,
                   it was not a point of entry and it was just ignored.



Chief Constable:   People were not trying to go down the road they were
                   trying to get through the turnstiles.  THIS MAS AGRPED.

                   Can anybody describe the nature of the events outside
                   those turnstiles?



Ch Supt            Can I give you a view as I saw It from the control room
Ouecenfie1J:       sir?   limes are difficult Cut at some stage we caul have
                   this radio difficulty and I've got it in my mend that the
                   situation couldn't be assessed and developed because of a
                   man in the control room changing radios and there was a
                   delay.    Mr Marshall was asking for help and the gate to be
                   opened and for one or two reasons he didn't get It, either
                   firstly because we d i d n ’t receive the message from the
                   radio or secondly 1 know at one stage that I was delaying
                   the situation becausc of assessing what the consequences
                   would be when the gates opened.      The situation was this
                   about 2M>p and I'll come back to the gate as I saw it.      At
                   2.45 tnere was a crisis and a decision had to be made
                   whether or not to support Mr Marshall and for me to make
                   that emcision to support Mr Marshall.      On trie outside
                   there ■.■.•ere 1,110 3 ,100 fans. As I saw the situation in
                                         _   7    -



                    the ground there were spaces at either end of Leppings
                    Lane,  Behind thac west stand there 'is a concourse area
                    that will easily accommodate if I've got ... right: the
                    crowd outside.      The inside was full.   Quite a large area,
                    So on thac b a s i s , then the other consideration was right
                    we delay the kick off but sadly before I could consider
                    delaying the kick off the players ran out onto che pitch
                    which must; be I presume 2.-0 and chat decision was taken
                    away.  Hr Marshall then came across or somebody did and
                    the message came in to the control room 'if you don't open
                    this gate scon someone is going to get killed outside
                    here'.   And I could see. the developing situation.



Miief Constable:    And you don't know who said that?


Ch Supt             I don't know who said that, I know that somebody said on
Duckenfiela:        the radio in a very distressed state, quite properly it
                    wasn't panic it was a case of for" God's sake help us here
                    because there are people who are going to be injured and
                    killed.



Supt Marshall:


Ch Suot             Now 1 think the people in the control room will say what
Ducuenfield:        we beard.  Mr Murray turned to me and said 'Mr Ducsenfield
                     be want's tke gates opened what's your decisions.



Chief Constable:    Let's pursue that.            We didn't know which gate              ...



Ch Suot             Weil no but the thing is I can take it a little bit
Duckenf ie ld:      further.   Now we get a situation where I can see on. the
                     video and. I think it's the gate on the entrance from the
                     south stand,   1 -don't know che number of it but I. went to
                     it last night.



(Mr Hayes identified and pointed to the gate on the plan).


up C;:Er            Riyht, now, there's a video sequence that's running that
Duckenfield:        snows chat at that point fans were climbing over a wall,
                     fans were not only climbing over a wall they were
                     harassing a horse and. a horseman was having extreme
                     difficulty.   Now I know that I've heard someone say it
                     lifted but certainly that nan was in great difficulty,
                     that horseman, and the situation                      that
                     that gate had. burst open.  Now I don't know the truth of
                     tha t,



Cnief   Constabie    tf   anybody   opened   it       it   should   be   obvious   on   the    video.
Ch Supt             Well it should, if you look for that corner where I was'
Ducksnfieid:        watching it, that gate o pened...



Chief Constable :   -t'kcouldn't be opened from outside could it?                   AGREED NO



Chief ;upc          ^hat gate opened and it was shut again and then Ik';; not
Duekenf ie I d :    not sure but I think it v/as opened again,    But the
                     situation v/as then that from recollection that oeoole who
                     cane in from there didn't appear on the video to be
                     causing major problems and also not only could I watch the
                     video 1 could watch the terracing and loosing at tne
                     terracing m e r e was strut plenty of space around the sides
                    and considering the video and the terracing the situation
                    didn't look difficult at that stage,



Chief Constable;    Coupled with the large area Inside the turnstiles



(Mr Hayes Identified and pointed on the clan, the large area which exists
between the rear of the west stand and the turnstiles leading to beoDlnvs

Insp Delaney;       oir,    it was no problem because          I went through there.

                    Pre-match.  My serial was directed to assist with the
                    situation at 1.10 pm.  We went; round to the back of the
                    turnstiles because people were causing disorder at the
                    o a c ic,

In.s p Delaney:     And they were saying that If something was net cone
                    someone was going to get hilled out there.  I heard a
                    message come over the radio ‘open the gates at toe back, of
                    Leppings Lane terracing'. The gate was opened and I went
                    through that gate...


Chief Constable:    Any idea who authorised thac?       That was at twenty--to?


Inst Delaney:       I don't know who authorised it.  No that was after sir
                    because I was there for a few minutes be f o r e . ..1 went
                    through that gate and saw Hr Purdy and I was then engaged,
                    in pulling people off the turnstiles because they were
                    getting crushed.  I was pulling them out to get through
                    the gate.


Chief Constable:    Can I just get that clear In my mind.  when you were
                    directed in response to hr Marshall's plea for help in the
                    area voa took your serial...



rnsD Delaney:       No, I went 1 was cn my own at that time.  My serial was at
                    tee back of the first gate which was gate 'A',



{Mr Hayes then pointed to gate   Ml1 cn tne p...an;


ln.se Delaney:      My serial was there.   In response to that message I went
                    through round to gate 'C' to see what the problem was and
                    the gates were opened.   I went round the back.



(Mr Haves then identified which gate Mr Delaney was referring          to (gate   'Cl' ) on
tee plan)


                    I vent through that gate and the gates were then opened,
                    M;y gate was opened and I went through the gate.



 Taief Constable:   When you say it was opened-who openec


 rn3n Delaney:      I don't know who opened it. the gate was opened, well.

Insp Delaney:              Well there must have been stewards on that gate.


Supt McKay:                that gate, was opened a number of times.        1 was by that
                           gate for some 20 minutes.


L - n 6 1 uons'Cc.oi.s t   Is it a gate that's normally used for people to go- in ana
                           out?



Supt McKay:                That's right and in fact it had to be opened to allow
                           injured persons in.  There were several injured persons
                           went through In a period of 20 minutes and it was opening
                           and shutting all the time but it w a s never under the
                           pressure t h a t ...



Sgt Gutcher:               My serial v/as b e t w e e n / o n the turnstiles one to 16 sir and
                           1 can support there were some very distressed people
                           coming through there.            You could see the crush through the
                           turnstiles and I told the man to just put his foot on the
                           pedal and let the people through to try to relieve some of
                           the crushing, forget tickets at that stage, I was dragging
                           people over the top of the wheel and eventually went out
                           there, it was horrific out there.



Chief Constable:           Well fine, what we'd got is a real problem outside the
                           tumstx-LcS m LiCppmgs Lane.         Wo douot aoout that.  j,ne
                           opening of the gate, now can we talk about what happened
                           when that gate was opened because there were a number of
                           things, one is Mr Duckenfield saying that there didn't
                           seem to be a problem and that the film just shows people
                           coming through the gate and Into that area and going into
                           the ground and the other one Is that there is a rush of
                           p e o p l e ,coming through and did anybody see a rush of people
                           coming through that gate?



Supt Marshall:             There was a movement of people who had been queuing in the
                           turnstiles, who ducted under the b a r rier, it's a sort of a
                           it's a ? barrier, they ducted under there and went,into
                           that g a t e . It was my impression and I 've agonised over
                           this that there w e r e n ’t that many people went 'through who
                           did t h a t . It wasn't an enormous crush on the g a t e .



Chief Constable:           When we talk about opening the gate, i t 's a concertina
                           gate.      •                 '



Supt Marshall:             I t 's a concertina gate but It was only opened for about
                           four foot of its eight or nine foot...



Chief Constable:           ■‘Mow w a s 'there a police horse there as well?    AGREED - YES:

Sup't Murray:      Yes sir.   Can I give you my perception from the control"*
                   room point of view.   We were getting messages in the
                   control room to open the gates and considering the
                   consequences of that and before we'd made the decision to
                   open the gate- the gate v/as opened or burst or whatever and
                   a number of people got into the ground, whoever was round
                   there.   That gate was not the one that was getting all the
                   pressure, the pressure was near the turnstiles.    Gate 'A'
                   was open.   I'm talking about gate ’C '.



Chief Constable:   That's right but when you said the pressure was on the
                   turnstiles.on the gate f8' basically, that one, it makes
                   se n s e ...



Supt Murray:       We couldn't see the gates sir on the video all you could
                   see was the mass but certainly the gate ' C there was not
                   the tremendous amount of pressure on it.     So gate 'C '
                   opened sir, now I thought and i was only looking at it on
                   the video because you c a n 't see it visually, I thought a
                   gate had burst open.   It may well be someone had opened it
                   but that was before the decision from the control room
                   came to open the gate.   A mounted officer recovered that
                   situation and put his horse outside and the gate then
                   closed.



Mnief Constabl-                           entering into here is a situation
                                         ited the gate opened and there was no

                     » actual opening of the                         iSlSiilSisiiS
                              chain of action.



Sunt Murray:       You've got demands from the ground commander wanting the
                   gate open, the decision is being considered the
                   consequences from the control room and the gate is then
                   opened or b u r s t I t 's then recovered by mounted officers
                   and shut and the requests are,still coming, in from the
                   ground to 'open the gate open the gate' and getting more
                   demanding and so the decision was taken to open the gate
                   again.  That time from my recollection was a large' number
                   of people came in but again a mounted officer was acting
                   as a sort of a wedge and allowing ...



Chief Constable:   And we will in fact see the number of people who came in
                   on the v i d e o .                            '       :



Supt Murray:       After that I think the numbers swelled and I Just can't
                   recall exactly what numbers came in.



Ensp Sykes:        The pressure on all those gates was tremendous and at
                   stages all the gates ’A ’, ’B' and ’C were all opened.
                   Not -just gate ’C all the gates were opened.
Supt Marshall      I asked for the gate to t&e north stand to be opened.


Chief Constable:   You were talking about gate       'C'?



Supt Marshall:     That's the one, yes. (ABTUALLif MEANT GATE ’A* ) .There was a
                   crush...” asked for z haz one to be opened at a later stage
                   because that gate was being attacked but that would have
                   had no effect cn the terrace because there is no access
                   between...



Chief Constable:                ion          hatibec;
                                                    a;

                   WAS A G R E E D . Now can we put any time on the conjunction
                   o f , is that a wall? (pointing to the plan)



Ch Supt Nesbit:    It's a fence, a steel fence.



Chief Constable:   So anyone going through there Is of no concern because
                   they are going to the nortn stand.

                   Now anyone who comes through here (pointing to the plan)
                   can get through there as well.  AGREED.  Can we put a
                   conjunction on those gates at all?



Insp W h i t e :   Yes sir.  My attention was drawn to the people coming
                   through gate 'C* I was in the area marked one to 16.       I
                   could see through the gap in the wall the gate had
                   obviously opened.   I h a d n ’t heard an order for it to be
                   opened but bearing in mind the noise that is
                   understandable. I fought my way out to see what was
                   haDoenine because obviously there was a tremendous press
                   of people out there and I feared people were going to be
                   crushed against _turnstiles a. to g. and I went outside
                   there...



Chief Constable:   How did you get outside there?

                                                 .


                   I went out of gate 'C', it was o p e n . I went ou t there and
                   ae started, physically pulling people out of the crowd to
                   release that press and it seemed about a minute but it was
                   probably four or f i v e , suddenly the press just- s^mprf to
                   ease I realised gate 'B ' then had been opened. .



Chief Constable:   Was the end product of all that that all this pressure
                   that was here went through?



Insp White:        Yes. the whole pressure was released. But can I say one
                   thing from my experience of six years of working that end -
                   that if they burst through or went in a deluge through
                   gaze '3' the normal place for them to go into the north
                   steps z z the west stand which there would be enough
                   stewards on there to prevent them, the normal way they
                   would go through would be to go round the corner to the
                   elevated section which is on the north end of the terrace
                   the elevated one, they would really have to turn to come
                   through that'gate and then go through.



Chief Constable:   Are you in a position to give us a time for the release of
                   the pressure?  Is the time you took ycur prisoner out
                   th.6r*s?


Inso White:        I came back from the prisoner and noticed the time when I
                   was in the police room was 2.45.       I came straight back
                   because you could hear there v/as exciting things on the
                   radio but couldn't make out what they were and I 'd be back
                   aabout 2.50 when I realised that someone had opened gate
                   'C ' and y o u r 're probably talking another two/three minutes
                   before gate 'B ' happens.



Chief Constable;   Now all that was pre-kick o f f . AGREED Y E S . And so fete
                              opening the gates took place and the pressure
                                  ifore the match started.



                   * i.CL^ C3                       wasn u sonic'Dnxn.gj "CActw
                   happened in a minute the release of that pressur e. It was
                   like a boiler bursting and they went through the gates but
                   the surge of people from the road outside would take
                   several minutes to put all those people through that gate
                   and whilst,. that v/as going on there was a cheer went up
                   inside the ground and that added urgency to the flowrof
                   people inside the gate and I'm convinced that the cheer
                   from the ground whether the players were out or whether
                   the match had started was the catalyst that gave them that
                   extra spur to get into the ground through the g a t e .



Chief Constable    Again, I'm asking virtually the impossible.. The situation
                   is that we have got ticket holders and non-ticket holders..
                   If the people-who were there were ticket holders and got
                   inside the ground they were intended to.
                   perception of the number of people who we
                   'ticket' holders outside Leppings Lane?



Suot Marshall:     Must have been at* least 200/250 probably more.



Chief Constable:   But really w e ’re talking about 3,000/4,000 of, whom - if
                   you've got a ticket y o u ’re not in the queue are you.? .
Insp Sykes;         T h e r e 're milling around the area where the queues are. "Kt
                    one stage- I put a cordon of police horses across there to
                    release the pressure on the actual turnstiles.



Chief Constable:    So we're putting a number cn It which Is only a perception
                    it's only something we're trying to quantify.  I know its
                    hew many people of that 3,000 who have got tickets is not
                    perhaps a real question but it's going to be a major




Insp Kand-Davies:    1 was on duty In that area and I think there are things
                     which need to be said that are crucial to the e
                    ■.■would say there were more non-ticket holders
                     nearer a 1,OOS’-knd that would be typical for Liverpool.
                     They are opportunists, they look for opportunities to
                     pinch a ticket, to rob a ticket, to get through a
                     turnstile but the press in there was something I 've never
                     experienced,before. This feeling -that they push the
                     person in front to get in quicker and to go back 20/30/100
                     rows had to be seen to be believed and we were working
                     very hard to say 'look, get back' but they don't seem to
                     listen, they d o n :t seem to have any response, they're not
                     normal in that respect.     I think that we must make the
                     point that drink played a big part.



Chief Constable:    If drink played a big part that will emerge.                  When the
                    'OG-.ics c.czicriS Wc Tc   centra-   a n ilssus x i K s       un_s    "cris.
                    thing we want to be seen to be doing is trying to blame
                    someone else and I think let other people find that o u t .
                    I accept that completely.  Everybody's, saying it.and it'.s
                    true but It Is really a question of how that's used.



Insp Kand-Davies:   I appreciate that's difficult now, but if you police a
                    coronation with 100,000 people a police horse ’would go in
                    and they would move for him and respond to the request.
                    These people weren't responding to any requests or
                    directions they were just intent on getting through those
                    turnstiles as quick as they could.            . . .



Insp Sykes:         Khan I put the cordon of police horses across there to
                    relieve the pressure...                  -   ,



Chief Constable:    What time did you cordon Mr Sykes?             ,          .    .. .



Insp Sykes:         Across turnstiles one to 16 (shows area on plan), and they
                    were even diving under stomachs of police horses.



Chief Constable:     How many people when you put the cordon across what sort
                     of numbers were in Leppings Lane itself.        ••  • .• -,/
(At this point someone said possibly 1,000,   500 at least)



Lnso byses:         More', probably more, because we closed it off to traffic
                    to reduce the mass of people.       It was virtually like when
                    the ground e mptie s. y o u ’d got a mass of people ■£*hQ    f’
                    least 7 ,000/ 8 ,000.



                    Dees iu nSiD to estimate how many non-ticket holders were
                    outside Leppings Lane when we lock at the actual numbers
                    who have gone through the computerised system which
                    indicated something in the region of 12,000/12,500 people,


Chief Constable:    So about 1,500...



Ch Suot" Nesbit:    Precisely, so we're talking in terms i would suggest if
                    there's 3,000 people outside and there's still 1,500
                    people coming in we are looking p ossibly...



Chief Constable:    Mind you, how many of those would be for the north stand.
                    We're talking about 14,000 for the west stand, we don't
                    know how many in that group will be for the north stand do
                    we.



Ch Supt -iesbit:    Again, I think they can tell you how many people have gone
                    into the north stand but also there is a dual access...



Chief Constable:    I think what we need to - this is a mathematical thing we
                     need to look at but the real situation is you have got
                     people legitimately trying to gain entry in grave danger
                     of their lives and injury and action was taken to release
                     that and clearly it's obvious there was need that there
                     was need for action and all we're trying to assess now is
                     the other forces that that allowed into p l a y .



Ch Supt      .     . 1 can give you a figure for the north stand - 9,800 and
Duckenfield:        Mr Beal's print-out from Sheffield...



Chief Constable:    So there's another 1,300 there who could have been trying
                     to get in there. Give me a little more so that I. can.;.. . ,

                    W e ’ve spoken about people being inju                            -
                    Lane can anyoocly give me any idea of how many were
                    injured/ whether anybody was seriously injured?



Ch Insp Creaser:    The situation outside the section of the Leppings Lane ,
                     terraces standing area, the inspector there spoke to me
                     and 1 told him to withdraw his officers who were stationed
                     two to a turnstile to search people coming through.  Those

                   officers were at serious risk of injury.    Shortly after
                   they were withdrawn there were six,-'seven people passed
                   bodily over ground who hadn't fainted but who had nearly
                   fainted if that gives some idea of what the situation was
                   like.. 1 didn't see anyone having ambulance treatment but
                   there were a couple of 13/l4s being passed over the heads
                   who were suffering from crush-type...

                   and you have a ticket once you're in all you're looking
                   for is your place to go.     If you haven't got a ticket
                   you're looking for a place to hide.      Did anybody see
                   anything that happened through the tunnel?



Supt Greenwood:    I went round the inside of the ground and the timescale I
                   can put on it is that I went to the area of the Leppings
                   Lane terraces, walked round on the perimeter track and
                   when i got to the Spion Kop it was nearly kick-off time
                   and I went to the players' tunnel.           So the timespan it
                   took me to do that I can now relate to what the situation
                   was in Leppings Lane terracing.         It was a carnival
                   atmosphere. in fact there were p e o p l e , there was no
                   problem with that crowd at that t i m e , there were people
                   who were pushing a little bit in the normal way of things
                   and they were having a game with a lightweight beach ball
                   which was being flipped between supporters.                  Timescale
                   wise I started round at the Leppings Lane terracing, saw
                   v m s , n c w p y vi.'D.n    , n o p r o o ^ c n i s , ws.«lksq i t o u n g
                   into the north stand t o .the Spion Kop w e ’d had a problem
                   there, couldn't stop because it was nearly kick-off time,
                   walked round to the players tunnel and shortly after that
                   the players came out.



Chief Constable:   So now when you got back to the west stand the atmosphere
                   was still as you described it.                                                .



Supt Greenwood:    Well, yes, that's prior to the kick-off.    When I went to
                   the .players tunnel we had this, problem it was. the strategy      . .
                   that was arranged and we knew there was going to .be .this          .
                   problems with the press and Brian Clough in terms of his
                   seat and the arrangement was. that he would come out after
                   the referee and linesmen that's after the players had gone .
                   onto the field and indeed after the trainers .what have
                   you.   He came out after the match had kicked-off,. in .fact        : :
                   we had to clear the press photographers the r e ./ X turned       ; :;
                   to one of them and said 'what are you waiting forV a n d :he      ..
                   said 'you know damn well what I'm waiting f o r , w e 're all     .
                   waiting for Brian Clough* but by that time the game had
                   kicked-off, we had to clear them off, Clough took his seat.            ...
                   just behind the dug-out and I went back into the entrance                 :
                   of the tunnel, looked to my left and at that stage.-! saw     .  .. ...... ..
                   people climbing over the fence in that central pen.       I                  ’
                   immediately then went round to the scene at •that stage. '      .V'.y/C\y,
                   There was, it was difficult to clearly relate in, terms' of .. \.'';'

                   time scale but my distinct impression is that the tunnel 'a:
                   the ,back of the terracing v/as not-full in other words one

Supt; Greenwood:   Exactly.



Chief Constable:   1 c a n ’t understand, I've looked at how that pressure can
                   build up to so many deaths.



Supt Greenwood:    Seen it before, If I can comment on that first if 1 may.
                   In fact if I can comment on tne Liverpool supporters, I
                   think this has got to be very relevant and the problems
                   and the way my serials and inspectors are being talked on
                   ir. terms of the Liverpool supporters.      In 1980/81 we had a
                   similar problem.      That was the FA cup match with Wolves
                   -v~ Spurs.   Spurs had the Leppings Lane end and some Spurs
                   succorcsrs £.CDw3.i?cCi on ins opi.cn ^op ior wns.’
                                                                     Ccvsr* irss.son
                   they were transferred to the Leppings Lane end and as you
                   know we have the FI community constables who sit on the
                   front of those pens and it was necessary on that day for
                   us to open a g a t e .



Chief Constable:      »w many times during the course of a season.



Supt Greenwood:              the only time I've known it.



Ch Supt            No, in 1979 sir.                   It's happened before in that area.
Duckenfield:



Sgt Goddard:       We have done that before sir with Liverpool and Man U .and
                   they are about the only two teams.  Not necessarily FA cup
                   normal matches.                       .        '. ...



Chief Constable:   And the reason we've opened the gate is for the self same
                   problem?



Sgt Goddard:       No, when we're talking about transferring people a c r o s s .

Supt Greenwood:   Che 1980/81 is Interesting, it certainly is from rr.y point
                  of view because tragically it went one stage further
                  yesterday than in lf#0/8l.  Certainly in 1980/81 the same

                  had come early, they opened the gates and on that occasion
                  we managed to get them out but it was again pressure from
                  the back and I want to.make that..point quite clearly that
                  i t ’s an experience that I have seen before but not to this
                  extent, j-ju relation to tne wiverpooi supporters my
                  inspectors were briefed on the basis of this. ‘ Liverpool
                  supporters from ray experience of them if everything is
                  going well then there really i s n ’t much problem.   Sut if
                  things are against them they turn, they are nasty, and
                  they have and this was experienced during the miners'
                  strike where there was trouble outside the Leppings Lane
                  area a Land Rover almost went over on that particular
                  occasion, and that was when some people I think were being
                  ttransferred on that     day from the  Spion Kop again and they
                  were not Liverpool supporters     put in another pen, until we

                  had rival supporters near to them was something you had to
                  witness and it was necessary to get the staffs out on that
                  occasion.  So my people were briefed on that b a s i s .
                  They're okay when everything is going for them.     Now I
                  made a specific comment to say that if the game goes
                  against them it will be interesting.  1 also said to them

                  much more interest in Liverpool because of how things were
                  going with their particular league run.   And we were
                  looking and we had a   plan and it was working well on the
                  Spion Kop because we   expected and did indeed get Liverpool
                  supporters on the Spion Kop and had a segregated area at
                  the top.  Now I expected that there would be more of them
                  appearing on the Spion Kop than actually appeared.. . That
                  happened last year, on that particular occasion again
                  there was a thin blue line and the only way that was
                  actually sorted out was when the officers got their staffs
                  out.  So I want to set it against that background of the
                  supporters and what have you.

                  I, cn reflection now,. .1 canhot.understand, .1 can't come .to
                  terms with the fact that there must have been so many
                  people that we took out of there.    I cannot come ..to terms
                  with the fact that there were people that were dead in . .
                  there pressed against the fencing.    It was not evident at
                  the first arrival.    What was certainly.evident on the          :
                  first arrival was that people were against that fencing-         1
                  and that there was pressure from the.-back.    The •officer on
                  there, the community constable, had the gate open at that
                  stage when I got there.    There were people coming over the
                  top as well.   They did try and assist us those people as
                  well.  Setting this i n .the arena of, it was total mayhem. ...
                  Even with an ear-piece and I was wearing o n e ,,one could       •
                  not hear anything it was absolutely bananas if you like-;in;
                  that sense.  Iv'hat was clear was that the pressure' was : ...•■•
                  coming from the back.    So there were 2/3 officers dc;wn. ;:by/,.;

                   the gate who were trying to get people out.              They could
                   not get then out the pressure was so tight,             it v/as
                   different than '80/'81.  So the only way we             could approach
                   it was to try and get that pressure off the             back and 1
                   went up onto the fencing, I climbed up onto             the fencing

                   absolutely no response, absolutely none.  People should
                   have realised that there was something seriously wrong and
                   the people at the front were in trouble but there was no
                   reaction to that at all.



Chief Constable:        » question of putting Liverpool at Leppings L a n e .
                   we involved in that decision?  AGREED - YES.



Supt Murray:       Yes.  This was discussed with Chief Supt Mole before Mr
                   Duckenfield came and the main reasons are obviously
                   Liverpool come from the north and west and Nottingham
                   people from the south and they head for those areas of the
                   ground.  I asked Mr Mole if we could, if there was any

                   We looked at it again, we looked very carefully because we
                   were getting pressure not only from Liverpool Football
                   Club but from British Rail who wanted to bring special
                   trains from Nottingham into the Wadsley Bridge station
                   rather than Liverpool because there were more passengers
                                      “'IS.l.r w ’^c'c2,6*r   WS "

                   two sides of the.ground.        We were of the opinion that -if
                   we tried to change it round, even got over the logistical
                   problems of changing it r o u n d , the people would come to
                   exactly the same place as last y e a r , park in the same
                   p l a c e s , head for the same p u b s , and we would have had too
                   much...



Chief Constable:   We were involved in the decision and the reason that went
                   behind it is the reason just put forward.  AGREED - YES.


                   R i g h t , I think. I've got enough of a feel of the thing to.
                   be able to talk it through.        Is there a nyt h i n g ,anybody
                   wants to say about it? . .



Ch Supt Nesbit:    I '
                   Greenwood
                   and Sergeant Morton had to physically climb over bodies,
                   they were four or five deep against the fence ana the only
                   way we got the pressure off was because they went to the
                   back and started to pull bodies from the back and then ’
                   they eventually started to make a chain of .people and were .
                   passing policemen bodies to each one and- through to get ' -
                   them off.                               -     -      ' ••
Chief Constable:        many bodies were in pen four.



(The Chief Constable then refers to the plan and points to the-pen which had
    "t^'0 pccn du 2.2.0 c1 it and   coi^ts    c^~ v'^ i 'n ^as   d.a“’"s.~” to ~

go left or right is immaterial because the fence is smack in the middle)


Chief Constable:    Do we know...



Sgt Morton:        Tl» first five rows in three were dead.



Supt Greenwood:    I t ’s difficult to put this again into perspective.
                    Certainly when 1 got there I'm sure there were people who
                    were dead.    I'm sure of that on reflection but we'd no
                    impact of that at all.    1 had no impact, n o . I think in
                    terms of that there were clearly potential deaths ana I'm
                    satisfied now that they must have been dead.     I've seen
                    that horrible photograph in the green paper that's been
                    printed in one of the Sunday paper's today.     I'm convinced
                    at that stage because the actual requests, going there
                    when they were actually were dead but it wasn't until and
                    again timescale is difficult but an officer turned round
                    to me and said 'these people at the front are d e a d ' and I
                    looked at th em. they'd got the grey look and they were
                    dsad. suandins: ud    Evsn so vcu s*cii2. can* z rv0j,atg ir in
                    terms of numbers because there must have been people who
                    were actually underneath.  Well they were standing up but
                    there must have been people who were cn the floor as well
                    but even then the fact that we'd created a funnel and w e ’d
                    got them out I can't relate to that total ... I saw in the
                    gymnasium.



Chief Constable:   Nor can I.  Looking at the nature and the size of the
                    enclosure 1 just can... and    were r.':n;re deaths in four?


Insp Bullas:       -A lot of dead people being passed to the back of the
                    terracing.  I was in the stand looking down and ..I think it
                    ties in what was said at the front.  At the kick-off there
                    was definitely a consolidated push to the front. .It came
                    straight down looking at them, saw the crowd, could, see
                    the people screaming at the front. I ran to the back,
                    took some officers down the back and when I. got" to. that   .
                    tunnel...                                     '.. :



Chief Constable:    Through the tunnel?                             .      .


Insp Bullas:       To the tunnel at the back, in contradiction of what Mr
                    Greenwood has said that tunnel'was packed and we were
                                                   - 21 -


Chief Constable:      l\&s-'there anybody dead and injured in the tunnel?


inso Bullas:          They were starting to pass the dead people back, there was
                      s,      nurnccir ex cssic. pcODis .


 lief Constable:      But really then we have a position where the terraces are
                      full and there is still a tunnel full of people trying to
                      get out.   AGREED - YES.



(Chief Constable then refers to plan regarding fence in pens three/four and
the fact that he recollects fence being same size)


Chief Constable:       Were there any dead bodies in four?.:When you come down
                        the tunnel in the centre of the passageway the re’s an iron
                        fence with a similar size g a t e , i t 's in half,
                        impressions I gathered up to now is that all the dead were
                     ,211
                      yin three where the barrier went.


  ;t Greenwood:       I can't tell you that.   All I can say to you is that there
                      was certainly three v/as where the major problem was.
                      There were officers at four and clearly there were people
                      being taken out of four. Somehow they managed to get that

Chief Constable       Which fence?



Supt Greenwood:       The link fence.



Supt McKay:           One point which may be significant is some of the bodies
                      still had all three sections of their tickets which would
                      indicate that they were the people who went through the
                           - M i t ’s unlikely I would have thought
                                of that crush having gone i n .



Det Ch Supt Addis:    Albeit that quite a few of the injuries, facial injuries
                      indicate that these people have been walked on.



(There is general discussion here about Mr Ad d i s ’ comment)



Ch Supt               Picking up what Mr Greenwood said and people in the:
Duckenfield:          control room might add to i t , it was not evident that
                      there was a problem in three at the kick-off.    There.was
                      no evidence as far as I see, when you see a situation
                      developing, any crowd problems, pushing, but it wasn't
                      evident from there and I have a recollection of thinking
                      why have they let that officer opened those gates onto the
                      track? l\hy have we got people going onto the track?
                   onto the track s i r , because I went in through t w o , the
                   gate into pen two was open and 1 went in through that gate
                   into pen two and I must have taken between 10/20 people


                   in mind I ’d taken that;'many people cut over* there, pushing
                   them over dragging them the top, by that time when it had
                   cleared a little bit you could see 1 had a vision of a
                   woman's face in a pile of people and she was purple,     I

                   of the first'officers who leapt into pen three.       At that
                   time the gate still wasn't open.



Insp Delaney:      My impression sir when I got on the pitch when I heard the
                   request for assistance was not a problem with the pens I
                   thought it was   a pitch invasion.



Insp White:              3 what I was told      when I went on the pitch, itwas a
                          invasion. t h a t ’s what we wsnt onto the t?itch for.



Sgt Gutcher:       When I got into pen three sir and I was trying to give
                   first aid what ever I could do and there was just no way
                   to get people out.  There were officers up on the fence
                   dragging people over the top but the gate w a s n ’t open, you
                   just had nowhere tc take these people.



Chief Constable:   Well why w a s n ’t the gate open, does anybody know why the
                   gate was open. .'-Who’s got the means of opening it?



Ch Supt            The gate is spring loaded, you press it down and it flies
Duckenf ield:      open, easy.     Maybe it caught on the hoardings restricting
                   it, I d o n ’t know T'*m just throwing that it, I mean that's
                   off the t o p .



Chief Constable:   -Well y o u 've had a terrible time yesterday and certainly
                    thinking about      it over the night to be involved in
                    something like      that is the main difficulty you've got is
                    the feeling of not being able to do anything about it.
                    I t ’s just happening.



Supt Greenwood:    I'd like to say sir if I may t h a t , and I told quite a few
                   afterwards, I think when the officers who acted there in
                   clearly extremely harrowing circumstances I was proud of
                   them. They really worked hard.



Chief Constable:   S o , where- do we go from here now. We've got the Prime
                   .Minister coming at lunchtime together with Douglas •Hurd,.
                   that's immaterial that's how they see i t . This is the
                   biggest disaster in a football ground outside Peru.    It's;... . .
                       - 23 -


 likely I think there will be some form of judicial
 enquiry,  Ive've nothing to fear at all in a sense. We
 have taken decisions, we've done things on the basis of
 what we saw and what circumstances presented themselves to
 us.  Ahan 1 want is, let's have it as in's been up to now.

 it is thatithe .drunken marauding fans, and I thoughx; of "
 this last night, contributed to this let .somebody-else say
*fli&t. Don't let's be in-a position where we are trying to
 be seen to be shedding any responsibility.                   We carried our

 in order to'deal with the situation and the knock-on
 effect is      fate in a sense and we don't need to harrow
 ourselves      over it. At the same time w e 've got to be
 professional in the way that we pull together this
 evidence and again w e 've got to think about that and we're
 here, we are central to the issues which emerged yesterday
 and w e 've got to be very careful about whether we're seen
 to be central in pulling the conclusions of this together.
 Now at the present time, you've answered the questions

level of pressure that was there and the nature and scale
of pe op l e . It may be that when we get a little closer to
people who were in the areas marked one to 16 and a. to g.
we'll get      some real idea of the movement down that tunnel
into those two sections.        I don't see that there's much we

 opened.    We know gate 'B' had been opened, we know from Mr
 White and Hr Sykes that gate 'A' was opened as w e l l , so
 there's .no mystery about it the real issue is the timing
 and the effect of those actions.       We've got the enquiry.up
 to n o w . I'm just a little bit doubtful about whether we
 should pursue it and that simply is a question of trying
 to stand back from it see what other people might think of
 it later.    We have got the C oroner's enquiry which he has
 got to pursue. The question of all the aspects w e ’ve
 talked about today are matters for. the Coroner ought to
 know about so at this stage we will continue with the
 enquiry as we would be conducting a Coroner's enquiry and
'simply gathering all the evidence together instead of
 pursuing priorities and aspects where the              ;
 responsibility/blame lies.       It will be with us for a long
 time. The most distressing and harrowing .of situations             .

 and I can still     see a presence to an extent today, and
 that's as it should be.       We cannot accept these.things .... ..      ..
 lightly.    There 're not easy, they are terribly hard. and. ..
 the events which follow on...       I think we're over the          . .

 and w e 've tried to be as open as. possible yet at the same          ...
 time not give too much away. I don't think there's .much-            . . .
 else we can pursue at this stage but you did a good job .
 and I feel for you in terms of what you have to deal with., ■
 But it's events which are forced on us rather than sort - . -

                   % P 4 those operational decisions' are questionable. What
                   wte've got is a situation which was properly responded to.
                   The mounted branch knowledge'of events, your knowledge of
                   events and what happened before.     We've been on that
                   Lsppings Lane end for years and seen the things that go on
                   so d o n ’t lets get too introspective about it let's deal
                   with it as the professional people we are and give our
                   response in the professional way that is expected of us.
                   That'.s- not to say that we don't give a true impression of
                   what we saw there that it something we've got to do.     What

                   responsible'way, not hide it, but in terms of projecting
                   it publicly I d o n 't think that we would be right now to
                   be talking about the animalistic behaviour of f a n s , the
                   level of drink.    Whoever is looking at it overall will
                   find that without any problem.

                    DEPLOYED AT LEPPINGS LANE ON 15 APRIL 1989

                   ■HELD IN LECTURE THEATRE, POLICE HEADQUARTERS
                 BETWEEN 4.00 PM/8.40 PM WEDNESDAY 19 APRIL 1989




Present :

Deputy Chief Constable (Chairman)
Superintendent Greenwood
Chief Inspectors Creaser and Waring
Inspectors Bennett, Bullas, Darling, Delaney, Ha n d-Davis, Purdy and Sykes
Sergeants Booth, B u r m a n , B u r n s , Crawford, Higgins, Morgan, Payne, Proctor,
  Thomas and Whitlam




The below is a precis of the notes taken.




TUNNEL CONTROL

It Is possible that a spectators' rush through the tunnel Impacted into the
back of densely packed standing spectators and caused a surge which resulted
in the disaster.

One police witness (Sgt B u r m a n ) says that pens three and four were filled by
2.00 pm.  Another witness (Supt G»fenwood) says that            pens at this time
were not tightly:, packed and refers' to        a spectator climioing intothe West Stand
and then out again into the crowd.

One officer (Insp Bullas) in the West Stand looking down over pens three and
four saw a crowd surging in both pens which went forward but didn't come back
and remembers hearing about this time the    whistle blown and aroar of the
crowd to indicate the start of the g a m e .

Within minutes of the tragedy the turinel was clear.               .ave never been
found in the tunnel but casualties were evacuated this way.         The same police
witness (Sgt M o r g a n ) who after the tradegy moved from the track through the
tunnel found that spectators t h e r e , including police o f ficers, were completely
unaware of w h a t .had occurred.

There is nothing in the operational order nor at the briefings          about
contingency for police protection, of the tunnel to restrict or         prevent
spectator entry.  Officers remembered (particularly Chief Insp          C r e a s e r ) that
in previous years the above has been done by the use of horses          and static
police lines (referred to as Supt Freeman's policy).



COMMUNICATIONS

There was general comment that because of crowd noise on occasions it was
impossible to use the radio even with ear pieces.

There was further comment that the normal mode on these occasions is             'talk
through' which can soon overload the system.
There was specific CQHBttent by more than one officer that circa 2.00 pm
t#'anstolssion became impossible :ffce to loud interference.

Loud hailers were used inside the ground to effectively appeal for calm.
Greater use of these as a contingency should be considered.



MOUNTED

Deployment

Five deployed at 11.00 am (under control of Sgt Thomas).      Eight more arrived
with the train spectators at circa 2.15 pm making a total of 13.      Around
2 . 3 0 pm following a request for assistance more (number unknown) wfere deployed.,
from behind the South Stand.     (Insp Hand-Davis in charge7 from 2,15 pm).

General Comment

The crowd refused to respond to the persons on horses ( u n ique). From 2.15 pm
onwards the crowd was so densely packed that the Kdrsis "'Ead c!ifficulty or
could not get in and those in became so jammed that the riders feared any
movement would cause injury and one horse was physically lifted by the crowd
(uni q u e ).

Mounted o f f i c e rs 1 opinion is to effectively deal with that situation it would
have required possibly 10 times the deployment of horses used.




TURNSTILES

Normally entry to the North Stand is through turnstiles one to six and from
Penistone Road.  On this occasion Ferdotone Road turnstiles were closed and
Leppings Lane turnstiles one to nine fed this area.

Normally entry to the Ittst Stand seating and terracing is through turnstiles
seven to 16 and 'A' to !G !. Or this occasion only turnstiles 10 to 16 and 'A'



There was general feeling that far too few turnstiles were used to feed these
areas when crowd capacity was this high.

Ticket touts were seen near Vere Road s'elling tickets for other entrances -
purchasers using these at Leppings Lane entrances.

From 11.30 am onwards a crowd amassed outside the turnstiles composed of
non-ticket and ticket holders who were not wishing to enter the ground at that
time and mounted officers had to clear away.

Selected turnstiles opened at 11.30 am.    By 12.30 pm all the turnstiles had
opened and orderly queues 'formed' - these soon extended back as far as Leppings
L a n e . No significant p r o blems.

Circa 2.15 pm - around the time the train contingent arrived -    les are
lost, the spectators merge and become solidly packed outside the turnstiles.
Queues never re-formed. :

     A point may have been reached towards the end with turnstiles being

MATCH DELAY

If spectators had\.Tp$en-;lhf^^                                            may have
reduced their ..frustration.

One officer (Chief Insp Crease                                          nested,
            - be given to delaying




MANPOWER (FOOT;

Manpower deployed at the ground from circa 11.00 am:-

     a.   outside the turnstiles and into Leppings Lane - four
          serials and supervisors;

     b.   -inside the turnstiiles - 2'i serials initially, reinforced
           by a further serialal (Insp Delaney/Sgt Higgins) circa
           2 A 5 pm at Gate 'Aa * .

Plus 13 mounted officers      (see   'Mounted1 section).




CROWD. BEHAVIOUR

The crowd started entering the ground at 11.00 am.  By 12.30 pm queue.in­     -   w
forming but were orderly.  The queues over time extended all the          -       to
Leppings Lane but no problems experienced.

By 2.15 pm the queues were lost and spectators were now packed outside .the
turnstiles in large numbers extending back to the perimeter gates in a sol
mass.   The train contingent arrived and spectators were ent«

  lf-: 2.30 pm the situation is worsening - 3,000/4,O l p ^ r d w d (some officers sees
  this as low figure).    Despite the continuous entering of spectators into the
  ground the crowd outside the turnstile area increases as fans in large numbers
  continue to arrive from along Leppings Lane in both directions.

  One officer's (Chief Insp Creaser) description "...like a video of fans
  leaving the ground played backwards...".

  The above situation continued more or less up to the start of the game at
  3.00 pm, relieved at times when gate opened.       The crowd pressure is such that
  turnstile 'G ' is distorted and bacame inoperable . Also believe wall adjacent

  Large scale drunkenness is evident.  Spectators are attempting to take alcohol
  into the ground in large quantities.

  The crowd at times is very frustrated, hostile, and           are thrown at the
  piilce.- Many spectators completely ignoring police directions (unique). On
  one occasion when one perimeter gate was closed and a 'line of horses were
  across the road the spectators forced their way between horses legs.




  SEQUENCE OF OPENING OF THE GATES

  One officer (Xtisp Bennett) states  that he arrived at gate 'A ' inside the
  ground and the stewards were making sure the gate was secure. He <       ed
  the scene as chaotic with officers being urged to get people through the
  turnstiles as quickly as possible.                                 .. .

  That same officer then climbed onto the roof of the turnstiles and saw the
  crowd was tightly p a c k e d , no-one could move and people were being crushed.

  Sgt Morgan said he went through gate '0' with Insp White and started to pull
  people out who were pushed up against the metal barrier leading to the South
  Stand.  A        people were resisting any attempts to rescue them because
  they would lose their place in the 'queues'.

  Sgt Morgan also said gate 'C' was the first to open and it was opened at least
  twi ce . He.. said on the occasion when the gate was first opened, just before it
  was opened he saw Insp Bennett in      the area behind the turnstiles and. .whenhe :-
  got outside Insp Bennett was on the turnstile roof.

   Insp Delaney said about 2.40 pm he was at the area between the Spion Kop and
   the North Stand with his serial when he received a message to go to Leppings
   L a n e . He deployed the serial at gate 'A', went to gate     and t h a t 's when he
-- heard a radio message to open the g at e s . He went round and saw gate 'C':open.
   He assisted to pull people through, A number of people entered the ground
   before the gate was closed.     He then looked across and gate '8 ' opened.

  Sgt Burns said that gate 'B* was opened by two uniformed officers, there was a
  massive rush and the gates were then closed. .;                          ... .

  Insp Bennett thought it was about 2.45 pm when he climbed onto tf'
  turnstiles.                                                  . . .             . ..   .

  Insp Purdy said he saw Insp Bennett climb         onto the roof and gate 'B'      opened
  five to 10 minutes after t h a t .

Sgt Higgins was the sergeant in charge of Insp Delaney’s serial deployed
inside gate 'A' and it was definitely 2.40 pm when he got there.   Insp Bennett
was not on the turnstiles roof. §&£ Higgins was at gate 'A' about 10/15
minutes taking abuse from people about the crowd outside.  He looked into the
turnstiles and three people were stuck in the area whera one. should pass
tWdugh,   That was like that for some considerable time and this was because
the pressure was so great one person could not enter the turnstile alone.

Iflsp Sykes said it was about .2.50/2.35 pm when he was outside .and .gate .'A1.
pp.en.ed and hundreds went through.

Chief Xnsp Waring said he was there about 2.50/2.55 and that the opening, of
that gate ( 'A') appeared to make a terrific difference in releasing the
pressure outside.

Sgt Higgins said that at 2.50/2.55 pm he radioed and said "if the gate isn't
opened there is going to be serious injuries and possibly loss o      j" and
received a reply to the effect that "if that is the case open the gate".
First of all the steward would not open the gate and after a few more minutes
his officers assisted in opening that gate. He added that during the
preceding 10/15 minutes the gate had been bouncing and it looked as it if was
going to come off the wall.

Insp Sykes went through that gate.

It was agreed that it was a negative rush through gate 'A' in terms of the
happenings on the West Stand terracing.

Sgt Thomas was at the perimeter fence further up Leppings Lane. He did not
see gate 'A' open and there were still many supporters outside turnstiles 'A '
to 'G'.

Insp Purdy said that gate 1C 1 was opened a second time but was unable to
supply an exact time or sequence in relation to the opening of the other
gates.

      Morgan believes that the numbers 'going through gate ?C       were not massive.

Towards the end it seems Highly likely all three gates were opened,           This
have resulted from the message from force...




RECOMMENDATIONS RE. PUBLIC SAFETY

 1.    Consideration should be given                  use of loud haliers.

 2.    Suggestion made that all the turnstiles be1 knocked down and r e p l a c e d with
       a semi-circle of new ones. There are gaps in the area where the
       turnstiles are currently and this is where people are getting crushed and
       trapped.                                                      .

       At normal matches entry to the North Stand i
       six and also access via Penistone Road.
       turnstiles were closed and only turnstiles one to nine used.                        .   :
       insufficient.                                          .                   :.           ....
                                            - 6 -



 4.     At normal matches entry to the West Stand is by way of turnstiles seven
        to 16 and 'A' to 'G'. On 15-4,89 only turnstiles 10/16 and 'A' to 'G'
        used. Again this is insufficient.

 5.     Poor siting and insufficient: numbers of indicator boards showing the
        routes to the stands and terraces.

 6.     Design of %j£ekets very poor - they were all the same type of print and
         would have .benefited from being colour coded :'to Match the indicator
         boards (at 5 • above).

 7.     Many of the supporters en-route to the West Stand tended to go via the
        tunnel. Suggestion was made that as an alternative in future the tunnel
        be closed thereby making supporters g o r o u n d to the Stand via both sides
        fend easing congestion in the tunnel.

 8.     No incentive for crowd :,to.ge,t, to-.ground       pre-match entertainment
        could be provided.

 9.     More horses to be deployed at big capacity games than on 15.4.89.

10.     R e . timing of the match - would have been good idea to hold game on
        Sunday morning thereby pubs/off licences being used less by supporters
        before start of game.

11.     Suggestion made that pubs near to the ground should have been closed
        prior to the match on 15-4.89 but general feeling re. this was that if
        near-by pubs had been closed supporters would simply visit licenced
        premises further afield.

12.     Suggestion made that there is no need for the fencing on the terracing
        which forms the actual pens.

13.     Suggestion made r e . the removal of the wall which leads from the rffat* of
                 Stand to the rear of-the turnstiles allowing greater freedom -in
        the area of the West Stand terracing.

14'”.   Suggestion made that in futu      tttation of queues would benefit from
        being like those used in Post Offices.                       .          .•

15-     Suggestion made that lay-out of the ground is not conduci
        crowd, therefore we have always had problems with people securing entry
         into the ground.  Because of .this the police have had to do too much
         stawarding re. which turnstiles supporters go through,.

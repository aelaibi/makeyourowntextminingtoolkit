            pay at turnstiles.              These    fans were    turned away by me at

            the turnstile.           Fans    g radually      pushing and swarming ar ou nd

            turnstiles,        no orderly queues.             I saw several      fans    begin

            stood on screening and began                playing to the        crowd below.            He

            ignored Police           request    to   climb down and he was then joined

            by other Liverpool           fans who      climbed onto the screening                from

            the L ep pings Lane         terrace side.          These    fans then    climbed from

            the top of the           screening and over         the turnstiles       wall.        I

            noted that        1 empty milk       bottle was      thrown and this         smashed

     1 began ass is ti ng          tana    from the L ep pings Lane               t e r r a c e who

     had   climbed onto        the    pitch.        A few minutes         later                    I was

     r e-deployed to stand            in line on the            centre    line of the                       pitch

     facing    the Leppi ngs Lane            g o a l.     S h or t ly after       I was

     r e-depioyed a gai n and             I went    through the        players                 tunnel

     with several          other    officers,       through the        building and then

     aro u nd the     back    of the entrance^t-fcfnnel which gives access                                       to

     the   pen area of the Le p^                                   r e terrace.                     Together

     with PC       1171 H o rs e fi e ld we began to move fans back                                 through

     tunnel?       I saw that many were             injured      in the tunnel a r e a y '                        I

     then m oved      into    the    pen area and saw a crush bar                                                1ed
                                                                           — —     -—   I II 'I—       -



     and dis to rt ed and about 7 or S steps                     down 1 saw a p p r ox i ma t el y

     20 or so bodies,          )jindyt&rTlop        of each other,         I noted that

     there was       not much blixffd about             these    bodies and their                          faces

     and   lips were       blue.      Whilst       I was a ssisting        one fan who had

     d if f i cu lt y breathing,          and whilst       I was    placing         him              in the

     recovery       position,       near to the          collapsed     crush barrier,                        I

     noted that       1 empty       brown beer          bottle was thrown down from

     above the West Stand.                This     bottle     narrowly missed the

     injured male Liverpool                fan's    head.       Many of the spectators

     from above       the West Stand were                c on tinuously shouting                       out

     abuse,    d i re ct ed at the Police               officers,     whilst            I carried                one

     y outh with a leg         injury and a s s i st e d by 3 fans through the

     tunnel,       I was    kicked on the shins and ankles                       by bystanders

     in the    tunnel      who also yelled abuse at me.                    I did not

     sustain any        injury other         than minor         bruising         to the               shins.

     Later    I wo rk ed     in the ambulance             reception area behind

     Leppings       L a n e near    to the     canal      fencing.       The re J f saw

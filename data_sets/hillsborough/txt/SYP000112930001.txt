    GLYN KQJIALD MARSH
    SUPERItoNDEHT
    OPEJtoON DIVISION
    FORGE HEADQUARTERS



    I took up my present posting on 27 March 1989 . My responsibilities
    include the Mounted Section, the Dog Section, the Underwater Search
    Unit and the Force Operations Room, all of which have a part to play
    in the policing of major events. I am also required to attend many
    meetings throughout the year in respect of matters related to football.

    On taking up my new post I was aware that a FA Cup semi final was to be
    played at Hillsborough on 15.4.89 between Liverpool and Nottingham
    Forest. I was also aware that officers from Merseyside, Nottinghamshire and
    West Yorkshire would be working with members of my Mounted and Dog Sections.

    Due to the fact that the majority of rpy staff were working on 15.4.89
    I considered it correct that I should join them and offer my support. Also
    it would give me the opportunity of welcoming officers from other forces
    and equally as important it would give me experience at first hand of
    policing a major football match thus enabling me to speak with some
    authority when attending conferences.

    I contacted Chief Superintendent Duckenfield requesting his permission
    to work sis above, he was in full agreement and asked if, on his behalf,
    I would de-brief Mounted and Dog Officers at the conclusion of the match.
    I,of course was only too happy to oblige.

    During the afternoon of Monday 3 I’d April 1989 I visited Hillsborough
    Football Ground in order to familiarise myself with the surroundings.

    During the week immediately preceding the match I was given a Dog Section
    Operational Order by Inspector Phenix. (Appendix A). This order was
    prepared in conjunction with the F Divisional Operational Order but whereas
    the latter referred to the number of dogs in specific locations, the
    Section Order identified respective officers and itemised all their
    individual duties. I noted that all officers working on mutual aid were
    to be accompanied by a South Yorkshire Officer and that all points       : -c
    requiring cover as outlined in the F Divisional Order had been catered for
    by the section.

    Also during the week preceding the match I received a list of officers
    who would be working on the Mounted Section from Inspector Hand-Davis
    but being aware that only four locations required cover then detailed
    information was not necessary at this stage.(Appendix C).

    During the morning of Friday 14 April 1989 I was required to attend at
    Ring Farm and welcome the Mayor of Doncaster and Senior Council officials
    to the Mounted Section. I was therefore unable to attend the Officers
    Briefing at Hillsborough in relation to the semi final. In reality this was
    no detriment as I was not included on the Operational Order as such and had
    more of a watching brief, in other words the match was to be a learning
    exercise for myself. My deputy, Chief Inspector Waring,the Inspectors in
    charge of Mounted and Dogs, Hand-Davis and Phenix, all attended this briefing.

On Saturday 15th April 1989 I commenced duty at 8.30am at Mounted and
Dog Section premises at Niagara. During the course of the next hour officers
arrived from Nottinghamshire, Merseyside and West Yorkshire.

I attended the briefing of all Dog Section Officers in the Club at Niagara
at 9 •30 am. I opened the briefing by introducing myself and welcoming all
officers to the semi final. I then handed over to Inspector Phenix who
had actually prepared thatOperational Order. On doing a roll-call it was
necessary to make minor amendments in officers deployment and these
adjustments are identified at Appendix B which is the revised list. Inspector
Phenix then conducted a very good briefing. As he allocated the duties to
officers they stood up and identified themselves to the partner with whom
they would be working and they both then received their specific duties as per
the Operational Order and in fact were each handed a laminated copy of their
specific duties. Having done this Inspector Phenix then referred to the
F Divisional Operational Order and outlined the salient points of the order
to all the officers. Items covered included colour codes of tickets,
where prisoners should be taken, how to deal with property, train times,
alcohol, the transportation of supporters from the City Centre to the Ground,
the fact that he expected a professional performance from each and every
officer and that no one should stand down until after the de-briefing at
the Niagara Club at the conclusion of the proceedings. He gave the opportunity
for questions and it was apparent at the conclusion of the briefing that
every officer kn©w exactly what he was doing and what was expected of him.
Each officer was then given a packed meal and was very quickly away and
carrying out their duties.

At 10.30am I attended the briefing of the Mounted Officers again in the
Niagara Club. Due to the sickness of one of the horses, which should have
been ridden by PC Henwood, slight adjustment was necessary as no replacement
was avaiable. The revised list of officers is at Appendix D. I again opened
the briefing by welcoming all officers to the semi final, the fact I hoped they
would all have a good day and that I would see them all before they left.
I then handed the briefing to Inspector Hand Davies who had prepared specific
duties. He deployed the officers as geEL&pgendix E. It will be seen that the
basic principle was that Merseyside officers would work with South Yorkshire
Officers in policing the Liverpool supporters and that Nottinghamshire Officers
would work with other South Yorkshire Officers in policing the Nottingham
Forest supporters. Both the visiting sergeants, 1952 Smith of Merseyside and
1710 Watson of Nottinghamshire had done identical duties the previous year.

The full deployment was as follows:-

It will be seen that this is in slight variance with the F Division Operational
Order in that:-

i) Due to the sickness of a police horse there were initially five horses
deployed to Leppings Lane.

ii) The F Division Order, made no provision for the Mounted Section to cover
the South Stand. It was considered that this was necessary and therefore
the Halifax Road and Herries Road patrols were reduced from fmir toftw® thus
allowing four horses to be in the vicinity of the South Stand. Superintendent
Chapman was aware of this.

It should be noted that the reason to take the sick horse out of the Leppings
Lane contigent was because six officers were deployed on escort duty which
was anticipated to conclude at 2pm after which they would then be deployed
in Leppings Lane.

Inspector Hand-Davis gave a good briefing each officer identifying himself with
his/her partner(s) and all being aware of what was expected of them. The
Inspector covered the salient points from the F divisional Order, these included
communications, where prisoners should be taken, clour coded tickets and that the
gates would be opened at 12 noon, train times, coach and transit areas and that
the Nottinghamshire Trains would be arriving at the Sheffield Midland Station.
Inspector Hand Davis 'concluded his briefing by telling all the officers that
                            k




they were all experienced in the policing of football matches, their
duty was crowd control and a high standard was expected from everyone.
Again packed meals were distributed and the officers were soon out on patrol.

It is perhaps pertinent to mention at this stage that it is necessary to
utilise horses and dogs from other forces on such occasions as the FA Cup
semi-final as South Yorkshire is unable to fulfil the requirement. This is
common practice for all major events and football matches, for example South
Yorkshire Mounted Officers regularly assist Derbyshire Constabulary, who
do not have a mounted Section,in the policing of Derby County and Chesterfield
football grounds. The practice is for the Division staging the event to
identify the need and the numbers required and the Operations Division will
then raise and supply the requirement. On this occasion F Division required
36 horses, there being only sixteen available in South Yorkshire on 15.4.89
it was necessary to borrow twelve from Merseyside and eight from Nottinghamshire
under what is known as Mutual Aid. It should also be noted that on this
particular day a further two horses were borrowed from Humberside to assisl'in
the policing of the Barnsley/Birmingham City football match.Similarly the
Division required a total of forty dogs (the Inspector does not have a dog, hence
the reason for 41 officers), the Operations Division were only able to supply
20 and therefore borrowed 12 from West Yorkshire and 8 from Nottinghamshire.
It should be noted that these figures were the ones used in the pre-planning and
do not take account of the slight adjustments on the day. The appropriate
correspondence in relation to mutual aid is attached at Appendix H. Copies
of both sets of duties in relation to Mounted and Dogs were supplied to the
Ground Control. ■■
                                                                      A
In relation to deviations from these duties I have made enquiries and
ascertained in relation to the Dog Handlers there was only one deviation.
Herries Road Coach Park was busy and PC's 2699 Allen and 3228 Erby, having
concluded their Railway Station duties were subsequently despatched to Herries
Road. Other than this all the Dog Handlers were deployed as per the Operational
Order.

So far as the Mounted Officers are concerned there ware two reasonably major
deviations, both initiated by Inspector Hand-Davis. About 2pm it was
apparent that cover on Penistone Road. was more than adequate and PC's 156
Wain and 2316 Scott left that detail and joined the Escort detail under the
command of Inspector Hand-Davis. Having completed the escort of the supporters
arriving by train this entire detail remained at Leppings Lane. The train
arrived at 1.55pm so it can be assessed that from about 2.20pm there would be
a total of thirteen horses at Leppings Lane. About 2.40pm it was apparent that
problems were being encountered at Leppings Lane and the four mounted officers
on the South Stand detail also went to'Leppings Lane. Therefore at 2.40pm there
were a total of seventeen horses at the Leppings Lane end of the ground. (See
Appendix E and Appendix F, E being the state at 2pm and F being the state
at 2.40pm. These horses remained in this vicinity certainly until the majority
of the crowd had entered the ground bfej whatever means.

For my own part, having attended the briefings and being satisfied that all
my officers were aware of what was required of them, I played no further part
in the policing of the match, not being included in the Operational Order
I had a 'watching brief'. At 11.00am I was joined by PC Rosevear who had an
in-depth knowledge of Hillsborough stadium. We patrolled the entire perimeter
of the Hillsborough stadium where I noticed that all officers appeared to
be in position. I was given a demonstration of security in the club control
room by Mr. Douglas Lock, the Security Officer, and I also visited the police
• •

      control room and made Superintendent Murray aware of my presence. I also
      spoke to Superintendent Greenwood about the general policing of Hillsborough
      Stadium. About 2.00pm I had a meal in the gymnasium at the ground. It was
      during this period that I noticed the reflation on my radio was almost
      unreadable and I formed the opinion that the battery had gone flat.

      At the conclusion of my meal I took up a position on the disabled stand at
      the corner between the North Stand and the Spion Kop, this being an ideal
      vantage point for observing develbpments in the ground. About 2.40pm I
      noticed that my radio was receiving' normally, however I was not in possession
      of an earpiece and%-being situated between opposing fans, deciphering
      messages and call signs was not easy. At this time I noticed that the two
      centre pens of the West Stand were full but that there was plenty of room
      in the two end pens. Similarly I noticed there was still a certain amount
      of room at the front of the Spion Kop and I remember remarking to PC Rosevear
      about the whereabouts of all the fans, particularly at Leppings Lane, it was
      apparent that there were still plenty to come in. About 2.45pm I started
      picking up messages from officers outside Leppings Lane and Ground Control.
      Because of the noise it was not possible to identify all the officers or to read
      all the messages. What was apparent was that they were having problems outside
      the ground. I certainly heard someone mention the figure 3000 and I certainly
      heard someone ask if it would be possible for the kick off to be delayed. I
      noticed that at this time neither of the teams were on the pitch. I did not
      hear the response to this request. At some stage I heard Superintendent Marshall
       on the radio, it was apparent that the problems outside the ground had escalated
       and I heard him say something about wanting the gates open. I did not hear any
       immediate response to this message but within' a very short space of time
       I heard Superintendent Marshall say that there would be a catastrophe if the
       gates were not opened iiuBife&iately. There was an almost immediate response from
      Ground Control saying 'Open the gates'. My observations continued and it was
       apparent that the gates had been opened as the pens started to fill up. I would
       say it was about this time when the teams came on to the pitch. Due to the
       deafening noise I could not hear the radio but as kick off came I could see
       both centre pens were packed. The game kicked off and within a couple of
       minutes I saw what appeared to be police officers helping supporters over
       the perimeter fence onto the track. Icould see more and more people coming
       onto the track and I also saw people in the stands lifting people off the terrace*

      It was unclear to me what was happening but certainly a pitch invasion seeme£
      the most likely, however no one was coming onto the pitch and my theory was
      dispelled. I soon realised it was a crowd problem and I saw an officer, I
      believe Superintendent Greenwood,run on to the pitch and the game was stopped.
      More and more people were coming onto the pitch and I took up a position
      on the track between the North Stand and the Spion Kop and deployed officers
      to the vicinity of the West Stand. It was apparent at that particular end of the
      ground that the fans did not realise what was happening and the atmosphere was
      somewhat hostile. Together with Superintendent Chapman we then deployed further
      officers in front of the Spion Kop and North Stand to prevent any pitch invasion.

      Whilst all this was taking place a young girl from the St. Johns Ammbulance
      Service ran up to me saying there were some dead bodies at the other end of the
      ground and that wire cutters were required. Someone mentioned a C & V van
      and someone said they would send for the fire service. I then heard over my
      radio that a number of people were dead and that we had a major incident
      on our hands. On seeing all. the activity the hostility went out of the crowd
      and I went to see what assistance I could give to the injured that were
      being brought across the ground to where I was stood. This was also the-
                                                                      I   2 T 'L

Ambulance arrival point and it was soon obvious that the initial response
was unable to cope with all the injured. Someone had used their initiative
and both injured and dead were taken to the gymnasium. I remained in
the gymnasium until about 4.00pm when I spoke to Chief Inspector Waring and we
agreed that we ought to fulfil our Operations Role and return to Force
Headquarters which we did.

           have been provisionally arranged as follows

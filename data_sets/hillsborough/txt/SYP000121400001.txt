               together on the right hand pavement when facing towards!the football

               humoured and there was no trouble encountered whilst walking them to

               the ground.            We arrived at the ground at the Lappings Lane               t,urns tiles

               at around S.0 5 pm (1405).

               A t that ti m e a 1a r ge crow d was at t h e tu r n s t i1e s b u t a g ain t fie re wa s

               no trouble and people were entering the ground in an orderly manner.
However      a large        number        of suppo r t e r s were         s tood ar o u n d      in large

groups     talking and            drinking        from       cans of beer and bottles                 of wine and

spirits.           Approximately           100 to       130 s u p p o r t e r s were       stood     in a group

leaning      on the stone           bridge        d i r e c t l y ac r o s s    the    road from the

t urns t i l e s    and a n o t h e r     g roup were         on the     railway banking at               the    rear

of the     bridge,         many    of these were              drinking         taut again were        gen e r a l l y

c o nducting        themselves          in an orde r l y manner.                 After about         ten minutes

stood at        the t u r n s t i l e s    I was a p p r o a c h e d     by a senior          officer      who    1

did not      know,      he o r d e r e d me       to start        encouraging           the suppo r t e r s      stood

round to make            thei r w a y      into       the    turnstiles™          I approached, a group of

about     forty       supporters          stood across          the     road from me,           I began taking

cans of beer           from them and             throwing       them     into the side           of the      road,      I

kept a s k i n g      them to make          their way          into the grounds,              saying      things

such as      "Come       on lads,         lets    have yo u       inside,        we    can* t all     be getting

in at     the      last minute".            I went          behind    them and began e ncour aging

them to      cross       the   road       to the turnstiles,               some       did but    others      simply

c o n t i n u e d talking      to other groups an d asking                       them to enter         the ground

in a similar m a n n e r .              Some     did as       requested         but others       a gain

d i s p e r s e d along     the Lane.            At    this    time     I saw two M o u n t e d       officers

approach        the    large      g roup of supporters                leaning against            the stone

bridge,      the M o u n t e d o f f i c e r s        rode their        horses along          the    back of the

group forcing           them      into     the    roadway and           I could hear          them    constantly

asking      people       to enter         the    ground.        T hey    refused        to do so and         simply

walked around            the   police       horses          and as    fast as         the M o u n t e d were

c.1e a r i n g t h & w a 11 t h e supporter* s w e r e g o i n g b e h i n d t h e m a n d a g a i n

standing a l o n g s i d e        the     bridge wall.

Throughout          this    time    traffic was              still    trying      to get      thro u g h Leppings

Lane and was           hindered         by fans        still    arriving         and walk i n g      in the

r o a d w a y , I therefore         began        clearing       fans     off     of the      road to allow            the
                                                                                                                                                  PAGE

traffic         through.                    More        fans       were       arriving              and     this       began          to    prove        an

impossible               task.              I heard           another             officer           nearby           that    the       road       was

being      closed             to       traffic           and       we    were       to        let    the        supporters             have       the

roadway.             I       therefore                 went    back          to    the        front        of    the    turnstiles.                    At

that      time       1 was             approached              by       Inspector              Sykes,           he    was    accompanied                 by

a    young      man          pushing              another          young          rnan    in    a wheelchair,                    he    asked        me      to

try      and    clear             a    way        through          the       edge        of    the     crowd          for    the       wheelchair

and      get    the          lad       into        a    gate       which          was     in    the        left       hand       corner        of      the

turnstiles               where             the     facing          wall       meets           the    end        wall    of       the       shops       on

L e p p i ngs       Lane.              1    recruited              the       assistance               of    PC       2910    Cammock           in      this

and      together             we       got        the    wheelchair                through            the       crowd       who       readily-

allowed         us       access             to     the       gate       in    a    very        good        humoured          manner.              The

gate      was       opened             on     our       request          and       the        wheelchair              was    allowed           through

.before        it    was          again           closed.           1 then           turned          and        started          to    make       my     way

back      to    the          roadway              and    the       rear       of    the        crowd.

At this time the whole mood of the crowd appeared to change                                                                                 in an

instant,            there was a great pushing from the rear and the people

around me began to get pushed onto the turnstiles and into the corner

of the two walls,                           people began to panic and try to push back but                                                             it

wa.s impossi b I & I o d a so .

After      only          a    few          minutes           several          Police           horses           were    ridden             into     the

crowd,         nose          to       tail        in a       line       effectively                 separating              the       crowd       into

two      halves,             those          already           within          the        gates       near        to    the       turnstiles              and

those      nea re s t             to       t he    r oa dw ay .          The       h o rs e s       fae g a n    pu s h in g      the       c row d

.back     towards             the          road        but    all       the       time        supporters              were       running          in

between         the          horses          and        underneath                their        legs.            1 stood          between          the

rear      of    one          horse          arid       the    head       of       another           horse        which       1    remember             was

being      ridden             by       a Police              inspector,             I     continually                 tried       to       push

people         back          as       they        tried       to    climb          between           and        underneath             the    two

horses         immediately                    i ri f r o n t       of    me.        We        must     have          relieved          the

pressure              from          the       crowd       for    a    short          while       because              I was         then       grabbed

from        behind          and          turned          around       by    a    man       who       was        in    the      crowd          nearest

to        the    turnstiles.                    He       was    obviously             very       distressed                   and    was       very

abusive              and    aggressive,                   it    was    obvious             that          his       aggression              was      n ot

from        anger          but          from    fear       and       panic,          he    was       shouting              that      people             were

going           to    be    killed             and       that    he    had       been       at       Heysel           and      the       same       was

going           to    happen             again.           He    got    hold          of    both          my    arms        and      was       shaking

rne s h o u t i n g         "For          fuck       sake       do    something*                do       something,                people          are

going           to    foe k i l l e d " .            I tried          to    explain             to       him       that       we    were       doing

all        that       we    could             but    he    would       not       listen,                 1 eventually                told          him

that        if       he    did          not    calm       down       and    stop          swearing              1 would            have       to    arrest

him        as    he       was       winding          up    other       people             around          us.         As      I was        saying

this        to       him    we          were    approached             by       another          man,          he     said         'that      he    was

this        m a n ’s s o l i c i t o r              and    that       the       man       had    been           at    Heysel         and       his

behaviour                 was       just       fear.           I asked          this       man       to       look       after       the       man       who

was        upset          and       he    took       him       away    from          me.        The       man        who      approached                me

and        said       that          he    had            been    at    Heysel             was    about             40 years         of    a g e , he      had

a    mop        of    untidy             dark            hair    that       fell          forward             onto his         face.           He was

wearing              very       thick          dark       rimmed       glasses             and       a    very        loud         checked          jacket

At        that       time       the       pushing          started          a g a i n»      the          horses          in    front          of    me

appeared              to    be          pushed       sideways          and       back       into          the        crowd          near       to t he

turnstiles,                     I       could        not       push    back          and    could             feel m y s e l f       being

car r i e d          a 1ong         with       the       crowd,       there          was    a    lot          of     shouting            and

confusion                 and       a    very       strong       smell          of    alcohol             in       the     air      around          me.

Near        the       turnstiles                I    could       see       other          officers             pulling             people          up    on

another              supervisory                officer          stood          on    the       wall          immediately                to    my       left

were       very       frightened                and       I began             to    about          to    the       officer             stood          on       t he

wall       to    open       the       gate,          I    clearly             remember             doing          this.           After          a    few

more       minutes          the       pressure             appeared                to    go       immediately                and       I was          thrown

against          the       fencing            at     the       opposite             side          of    the       turnstiles                to       which         i

had       started.              The      crowd           had    gone          and       only       a    small          number          of    people

were       left       mill!ng            around.

As       1 began       to       come       round          and       regain          my       composure             a message                came          over

the       radio       for       all      officers              to    attend             in    the       ground          at       the    Lappings

Lane       end       immediately-                    I did          not       know       what          was       happening             on    the

ground          but    ran       into         the        stadium          through             a    gate,          around          the       back          of

the       seated       stand          and       down       through             a    gangway             onto       the       pitch.              As       I

reached          the       pitch         the       Leppings              Lane       stand          was       immediately                to       my       lef t ,

Police          officers           were         stood          on    the       wall          leaning             over       the       safety

fence.           As    I got          to      the        back       of    the        goal         mouth          1 began          to    climb             onto

the       wall*       as    I did          so      1 saw        a    man       strike             out    from          the       crowd       and          hi t

could          see    that        people           were        being          pushed          up       against          the       fence          in       a

distressed             condition                and       it    became             obvious             that       what       was       happening

was       not    a    pitch        invasion               as    I had          at       first          thought.              Before.         I       could

•facing            towards          Leppings           Lane,          they      appeared            to    be    fighting             each       other

and       1    ran       over       and        separated          them,         I tried            to    get    them          off    of       the

gate          no.    1    to       prevent           any    more       people           coming          onto    the       field          and    adding

I felt             blows       to       the     back       of    my    head        and       shoulders,             I turned             round        and

two       men       were       lashing           out       at    me,     1    tried          to    rest rain         them       and       was

gate          no.    1 to          my     left       had    again        been        opened         and       more       people          were       coming

out       and       so    in       order        to    prevent          anymore           people          coming          onto       the       pitch

and       adding          to       the     confusion             I went         back         to    gate       one    and       closed          it

once          again.           1    remained           at       the    gate        to    prevent          anyone          else       opening             it

push          through          the        gate,       there       was        plenty          of    room       inside          that       part       of

assisted             by    other           supporters             in     the       stand          who    were       pulling          them       back

and       trying          to       calm        them    down.           I became              the    subject          of       verbal          abuse

and       spitting             from        these       people          but      to      have       let    them       onto       the       pitch

would          have       led       to    more        confusion.                I did         let       onto    the       field          anyone

appeared             to    me       that        the    decent          people           in    the       crowd       were       realising              the

scale          of    what          had     been       taking          place        and       remained          in    the       stand,          t he

ones     who       were       trying          to    get* o n t o      the    pitch         were     the       people           who    were

drunk      and       for      some       unknown          reason          wanted      to     be    part       of     what       was

ha p p e n i n g .

Throughout            this         time       I could          see    more       people       being         pulled         over       the

fence      and       onto         the    pitch.           The       Nottingham          Forest          fans       did     not       appear

to    know      what         was    happening             or    appreciate            the     gravity          of     the

situation,,              I    could          clearly       hear       them       chanting          “L e t     ’e m    die,          let       ’e m

d i e r let        *em       die"       and    this       obviously          incensed             the    Liverpool

supporters            who         continued          shoving          forward         and     then       began        throwing

coins      at      people          on    the       pitch       who    were       trying       to    help.            Everyone             was

very     emotional                and    upset       but       I could       not      understand              this        behaviour,,

The    young         boy      who       had    been       pulled          from    the      crowd        eventually              started

breathing            again         and       was    laid       in    the    recovery          position.

I then        saw     another            man       brought          from    the     crowd         and    laid        at    the       side        of

this     young        boy,         the       man    who    was       about       thi r t y - f i v e     years        of       age    with

dark     hair        and      a    full       beard       was       obviously         dead.         A    few       minutes           later,

two    young         girls         -from      the    St-       Johns       Ambulance          were       at    his        side       and

trying        to     revive         him,       they       were       upset       themselves             and    it     was       obvious

t h a i t Itey w e r e w a s t :i.ng               their       t im e .

I    tried      to    go      and       help       them    and       to    tell     them      so,       but    every           time       I

left     the       gate       someone          would       open       it    allowing          supporters              onto          the       pitch

E v e n t u a l 'iy a n o t h e r        man       cams    over       to    the     two      girls       and       took        them       away

covering           the       man's       head       with       his    jumper,

I was      annoyed            and       disgusted          at       the    way    the      drunken          element            in    the

crowd      behaved,               their       conduct          prevented          myself          and    others           to    help

those      who       had      been       injured.              The    majority          of    the       people        in       the    stand

area     on     that         side       of    Leppings          Lane       were     decent         and      helpful            but    the

minority           who       were       drunk,       violent,             abusive       and       aggressive              did       nothing

to    help      the      situation.

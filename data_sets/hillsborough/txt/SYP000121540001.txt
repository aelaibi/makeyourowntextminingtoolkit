CHRISTOPHER ANTHONY O'BRIEN



Detective Constable 146

Ecclesfield Police Station




At    9*00 a.m.   on Saturday 15 April 1989 I commenced duty at Ecclesfield Police

Station    and    was         at   this   time     in    casual civilian    attire.         Following   my

commencement      ofduty       I   was    transported      to    Hillsborough    together     with   other

officers where we were             firstly briefed by Chief Superintendent                Duckenfield and

then by our Sector Commander, Detective Inspector Scaife.

Following briefing I commenced                  foot    patrol   in Middlewood Road in company with

Police Constable 2302 Powell.               Our designated duty was to patrol along that road

from the Middlewood Tavern towards Hillsborough Centre in order to spot potential

trouble spots and/or street crime (thefts from vehicles, pickpockets etc).                           I did

note that during this period whilst in Middlewood Road (Oughtibridge side) that

numerous   Liverpool       supporters       were drinking alcoholic beverages which they had

brought with them or purchased near to the ground from off-licences. A number of

these   supporters       had obviously          travelled by private       vehicles    and by this time

some of their numberswere heavily intoxicated with drink.                       I would     estimate that

this would have been approximately 11.00 am/11.30 am.

I recall later on, approximately 12 noon, walking into the centre of Hillsborough

shopping precinct and again Liverpool supporters appeared to be purchasing liquor

(beer/cider & lager)           in large     quantities       from off-licences.       These were in the

form of cans and bottles.

Approximately 1.00 pm I attended at Parkside Section Station together with Police

Constable Powell in order for a short break.                     Whilst inside the Section Station I

heard   noises    on    the    roof.       On    going    outside   to -investigate    I saw   four/five

Liverpool supporters on the roof of the building,' all of whom were urinating onto

the   floor below.      Together with other officers, we managed to move them on but




           m
even during this time other supporters were walking round the building in order

to relieve themselves.             All these youths mentioned were heavily intoxicated and

showed the usual signs of drunkenness.                    I recall watching one youth who was about

19/20    years   of   age    standing      near    to     the    section    station.           I    saw    him   drink

approximately i of a bottle of vodka in the space of a matter of minutes. After

finishing the bottle he simply walked away to the ground or rather in the general

direction of it.

Approximately 2.45 pm following foot patrol in Middlewood Road I attended at the

gym for refreshments. We remained for but a few minutes due to the large number

of people milling around, before returning to Middlewood Road via Leppings Lane.

It was obvious to myself at this time, having worked numerous football matches at

Hillsborough,      mostly     in    uniform,'     that    the    large    influx    of people            outside   the

entrance ways      to the Leppings Lane enclosure was unusual for that time of day.

There is usually a heavy influx of supporters going into the ground at this time

but on this particular day this was well above normal.                            I also recall supporters

standing on walls above the turnstiles. From Leppings Lane we made our way into

Hillsborough Park with the intention of making this a short cut up to Middlewood

Road.

Whilst in the park, and I can only hazard a guess at 3-10 pm/3.15 pm, I recall

hearing urgent messages over our personal radio.                          It appeared to me at this time

that    supporters    were    fighting         within     the    Leppings    Lane    enclosure/turnstiles.

After what seemed only a matter of minutes I then heard that a temporary mortuary

was being set up in the gymnasium and we therefore immediately made our way to

the ground,      going in through the Penistone Road entrance.                            On getting inside I

saw as what      I can only describe             as numerous people being carried in by other

supporters on placards/billboards. Some of these were obviously injured/dead.                                        I

rendered    assistance       to    one   man     who     was    already    dead     and    I       saw    that   other

bodies/injured persons            were   being    taken into       the    gym.    After directing someone

into the gym with the body I went into the gym via the rear entrance.                                        I there
saw bodies      scattered all         across the     floor,       all obviously dead.        Other injured

parties were at the far side.of the gym where first aid was being rendered by

police/ambulance and supporters from both factions.

I then left the gym and made my way down the ramp between the Spion Kop and North

Stand.     On getting onto the pitch it appeared as though there had been a pitch

invasion although realising the enormity of the situation quickly realised it was

not.     I recall seeing three bodies laid out and covered up in front of the Spion

Kop.     I then assisted a young probationer constable to render heart massage to a

man in his twenties who by his appearance was already dead.                           I instructed him to

remove    the    body    to   the    gym which      he    did having    been   assisted by       supporters.

There    were numerous        bodies strewn around in front of the North Stand and both

police officers and supporters were rendering assistance.

I saw at this time that bodies were still being transported across the pitch by

both police and supporters alike on makeshift stretchers.                            I made my way across

the pitch towards the Leppings Lane enclosure and saw bodies being pulled through

an open part of fencing,               this fencing had obviously been cut open to allow fans

to escape.      At   this     timerival      supporters     began chanting towards           the    Liverpool

supporters      and a large          number who had        already spilled     out    onto   the pitch ran

towards the Spion Kop.              I was unable to render assistance due to the large amount

of' people in front of the fencing, sci^I ran back across the pitch and through a

cordon    of    police   who    were    by   this   time    across    the   centre    line   to stop rival

factions meeting from either end of the ground.

After passing through the cordon I assisted with both relatives/friends and the

like    enquiring    after     injured parties           directing   them towards      the gymnasium.        I

myself    returned       to    the      gym a   short      time    later    after    assisting      and   then

transporting a body back               with a uniform PC.          By this time the gym was         cluttered

with bodies of the deceased and also relatives enquiring after them.

After some      semblence      of order was restored I was instructed to assist uniform

P C ’s with the searching, identification and documentation of bodies.                             I did this
■*   *   *



                                                                   - 4 -



             with two bodies.

             After    this   had been done with, all,           or should I say nearly all,                 together with

             others I was transported up to Hammerton Road Police Station in order to obtain

             missing     person    reports     from relatives/friends who had accumulated outside                       the

             station.

             A number of reports were taken by myself although I would not like to hazard a

             guess as to how many.

             Later that night,        I do not know what time, I was transported back to the gym at

             the   ground.        I there    assisted    with      relatives   and   the       like   re    identification

             (formal) and the completion of documentation.

             At    one   period    after     the   temporary       mortuary    had   closed      down,      I   transported

             relatives to the Medico Legal Centre for the formal identification of a body.                                I

             recall      going    into   the   rear     of   the    mortuary    where      I    saw   numerous      bodies,

             approximately 15/20 in number, which had had to be laid out on the floor due to

             shortage     of space.        Following the identification I returned to the gym where,

             together with other officers, went formally off duty at 6.00 am.                              I then returned

             to Ecclesfield leaving at 7-00 am on Sunday 16 April 1989*

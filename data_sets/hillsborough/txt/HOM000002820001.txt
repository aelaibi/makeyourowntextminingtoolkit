I refer to your recent telephone conversation w i t h my Staff
Officer concerning the visit to Liverpool on Friday, 21et April,

I am enclosing a programme for the day which has been agreed by
Lord Justice TAYLOR, who will be accompanied by the Secretary to
the Enquiry, Mr. R. NHALLET, his assistants Messrs. TURKEY and
SWEET, and his Press Officer, Mr. R. SOUTHERWOOD.           In addition,
Lord Justice TAYLOR has requested that Mr. G. DEAR, Chief Constable
of the West Midlands Police, who i3 enquiring into the role of the
Police (and who will be accompanied by hi3 Assistant Chief Constable,
Mr. M. JONES, and his own Police Assessor, Mr. B. JOHNSON, Chief
C o n s t a b l e , Lancashire Constabulary, should also be present).  Further,
I understand an invitation has also been extended to the Chairperson
of the Liverpool City Council, Councillor Mrs. D. GAVIN, and she also

I have arranged for Lord Justice TAYLOR to be accompanied throughout
the day by my Assistant Chief Constable, Mr. Richard ADAMS, and
clearly it goes without saying that if I or any members of my staff
can be of any further assistance, please do not hesitate to get in
touch.

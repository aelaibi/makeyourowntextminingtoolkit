2 0 th April 1989                                Cheshire



                                                 Telephone No



On Saturday, 1 5 th April, 1989, I arrived at the Leppings Lane
end of Hillsborough at 2 . 2 5 p.m.     I had considered that 35
minutes before the kick-off would have been plenty of time
because I had a ticket for the North Stand (which I still have
in my possession).


The scenes of chaos that greeted me were unbelievable.          There
was no police on duty at the gates - only two mounted police
trying to get some order, but in my opinion they were only
making matters worse.    There was also a Land Rover with
policemen in it, but they did not appear to be doing much
either.


I tried to make my way to entrance .’A ’, to the left of the
gates but after about 10 minutes all forward movement stopped
and the pressure began to build up, and some people were
clearly suffering.   We could hear the game kick off and all of
a sudden the blue exit doors were opened and the crowd spilled
through.   At no time did I see drunken fans, ticketless fans
or fans fighting.


In thirty years of watching football, all over England and
Europe, I have never witnessed such lack of control.        I have
also been to three previous semi finals at Hillsborough
without any problems, but to say that on this occasion the
police abdicated responsibility is putting it mildly.


I have tried to be brief in this statement and could go into
more detail.   I would also be prepared to go to any sort of
hearing, enquiry etc., anywhere in the country at my own
expense to set the record straight.
I hope this statement can be of help.       Good luck!

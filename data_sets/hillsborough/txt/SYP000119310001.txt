pitch.           The    de-brief            t oo k     place       and we          were      told        we      had   done        a good

j ob .

During       the       briefing           it     was       mentioned          that     the        start          would       not    be

delayed          and    that       we     should           not    get    involved            in    the        atmosphere            but

be    detached.              It was         to be          Policed       fairly        and        if n e c e s s a r y ,          firmly

but    within          the    l aw      and      that       no    complaints             were      wanted.

It was       surprising                t ha t    hot       meals       were    being         taken          immediately             prior

to k i c k - o f f      as    usually            if    hot       meals       are    provided,               they       are    taken

f ir s t    or    certainly             not      prior       to    kick-off.

I feel       there          was    no     atmosphere              at    the    Leppings            Lane          end    prior       to

the    match       which          is u n u s u a l         and    could       be    accounted               for by       the       few

numbers          having       entered            the       ground       earlier.             I ha d         mentioned             earlier

in    the    day       to    Police         Constable             Illingworth               that       to     prevent         people

climbing          over       the       f e nce    between          pens,       it     would         be      an    idea       to    have

gates       at    the       bottom        as     at    the       top,    which        could        be       locked       open       on

l a r ge    matches.              If     th ese       had    been       there,        casualties                 may    have       been

less,       but    I personally                  would       never       have       expected             the      consequences

that       have    e n sued.            During         the       tragedy       I can         recall           seeing         fans     from

the    rear       of    the       terraces            being       lifted       into          the       stand       above. This

is    a common          practice            and       on     this       occasion            there        appeared            to be no

reason       for       it    as    to     the     best       of my       recollection,                   the      tunnel

entrance          was       clear.          On    reflection,                I cannot            see     any      connection

between          the    gates          being      opened          at    the    rear         of    the       Leppings          Lane

Stand       and    the       crush        in     the       terraces.           There         never          appeared          any

blockage          in    the       tunnel         entrance/exit.                    I formed            the       impression          when

trying       to    get       people         out       of     the       gate    that t here             were       people

underneath             the    ones        I could            see.        Whilst        getting              people       out       of the

g a t es    a barrier             from      the       terrace          was    thrown         over        the      perimeter

fence.           It was       at       this      time       I realised             t h at    a barrier             had       given

way.        I was       completely               unaware          of    where       it      had     come         from.        The
                                                                                                PAGE 8
                                                                                                R292


fencing       mesh      ha d    bulged       outwards       whilst      the   fans    were      against    it

an d   I later          saw    that    the    barrier       was   situated         directly      behind     gate

3 and     the     perimeter           fencing       had    been   forced      to   the     perimeter      w al l

and    b uc k l e d .     At    no    time    did    the re   appear      to be      any    great      influx      of

supporters          i nt o     the    pens.     The       crush   at    the   front       had   been

considerably            lightened        by    the    time    the      barrier      was    thrown.

                           say as f o l l o w s :

1 re s id e a t                                                           Liverpool


I am aoed I           [ears my date of b i r t h bemq                        1969.
I am s i n g l e .
1 am emDloyed as a p r o d u c t i o n Worker a t


1 went t o Hillsborough t o watch tne r.A . Cud Semi Final between
Liverpool and Nottinqham Forest.
1 t r a v e l led with           and                      and                   We had hired
a car f o r th e day.


We a r r iv e d outside the f o o t b a l l a ro u n d a t about 11 .30 a.m.              I had been
to HilisDorough tne orevious year to the s e m i-fin a l and on t h a t occasion
the p o lic e had not allowed anyone to wait outside the ground but had made
them qo i n s id e .
ih is year I wanted to move away froTi the crowd so as not t o be forced to
go in t o i t but in f a c t th e Police were allowinq supporters to wait outside
and were           not making them go m sioe the ground.


Another d i f f e r e n c e t h i s year was tnat l a s t year the Police had set ud
a road b lo tk and had prevented suDporters without t i c k e t s t r a v e l l i n g to the
ground.              So f a r as 1 am aware tnere were no such road blocks, or checks
t h i s y e a r.

We got i n t o th e ground a t about 2.50 p.m.                   A r te r passing through th e entrance
we were faced with 3 tu nne ls . Everyone was ooing to the middle tunnel and
we followed i t .         There were no stewards or any otner d i r e c t o r s to d i r e c t
supporters i n t o the other side tunnels.


When we a r r iv e d on the t e r r a c e ,         i t was packed, and we th e r e f o r e
decided to work our way t o the fr o n t tn in k in q t n a t we could walk alona the
f r o n t by the fence, as you can m most grounds, to somewhere with more space.
We managed t o qet near t h e f r o n t end we found ourselves trapped.
I here was no p a r t i c u l a r surge so f a r as 1 am aware but over a period of
ten minutes i t was q e ttin g t i q h t e r and t i g h t e r and reached the stage where
1 could not move.            I had a few blackouts.
We were in f r o n t of tne b a r r i e r , which collapsed causing everyone in
the f r o n t to r a i l over.         1 oo not remember any of t h i s presumably because
I had a blackout and the next thing i remember was standing                              on top of/Detween
fans who had f a i l e n over.
I was s t a n d i n g behind where the b a r r i e r had c o l l a p s e d and p resu m ab ly 1 had
c la m b e re d over peoDle to get to t h a t p o s i t i o n .



I could see my f r ie n d                             in f r o n t of me near to the fence
, co u ld   see him because a gaD hao f 0r*ea because tne fans in f r o n t of me wer£
s till   lying on the Ground. I called to                wno turned round and saw me
ana ran towards me sna out of the ground. I tnen saw                               c lilN n g over

the rence ana 1 then looKea f o r my other fr ie n d
1 saw him ly in g on to p of other rans          M t n his legs trapped underneath some fans.
1 nelped p u ll      him o u t .


We then walked out o f the grouna            anc in tne tunnel    leading out I heard
an announcement over the fannoy                 asking   f o r any Doctors in the grouna e t c .
1 l a t e r found out t h a t t h i s announcement was maae a t 3 .lit). Wnen we got outside
tne ground we saw trTat— wo -caw a number of oolicement standing around
apparently not knowing what was goina on.


1 suffered       b ru is in g to my chest because of tne crush. Tne only protection
we had was t o hold one's arms in f r o n t cf you to p ro tect your r i b cage,
l received tre a tm e n t a t C a n t n l f-arm H e a lth Centre and was o f f work u n t i l th e 2nd
May.
the f i r s L   12 flays a f t e r the dis as te r l was unable t o sleep artdJso 1 went to
the Doctor t o r some sleeping ta b le ts which 1 took f o r a couple of days.

                                                              i       «



A fte r the d i s a s t e r   I went t o the Vernon Sanaster Drop In Centre and they
have b een out to see me a couple of times.

When on th e t e r r a c e we*were looking from behind the goal t o the r i g h t side
of the g o a l .    There was a gate in the fencing immediately behind the goal
and before I s ta r t e d oiacklng out I noticed t h a t a Poliveman who was stationed
th e r e opened th e g a te .        A couple of fens managed t o get out but i t was
then immediately closed again . I noticea t h a t 4 p o lic e o f f i c e r s went over
from the no rtn stand as soon as the gate was opened and                  when they a rriv e d
they then pusned i t          shut


                                Signed .

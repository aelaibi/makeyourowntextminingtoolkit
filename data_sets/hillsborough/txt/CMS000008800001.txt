           Dear

           Thank you for your recent letter.             I apologise for the delay
           in replying to you.


           You express your concern that the recommendations contained in
           the Final Report of Lord Justice Taylor's inquiry into the
           Hillsborough Stadium disaster should not be applied to sports
           other than football and in particular Rugby League.

           The Report states that "crowd problems are directly related to
           the nature of the event and the numbers attending it." In
           circulating the Report to local authorities the Home Office
           advised that it would be consistent with the Report's findings
           for local authorities to take proper account of these factors
           when applying the recommendations to individual grounds.

                                                                          Yours sincerely




                                                                          MR S BILBE
                                                                          (Fire and Emergency
                                                                          Planning Department)

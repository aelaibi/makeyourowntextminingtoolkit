HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - COMPENSATION PAYMENTS
Thank you for your letter of 28 February. As Mr Addison's letter
of 6 November 1989 indicated, the current special payment
arrangements do not apply to compensation payments. The normal
grant arrangements apply, as explained in my letter, to costs not
met from your insurance.

Any request for a special payment to meet compensation payments
would have to be made separately, with supporting information as
to the amounts involved and the reasons why the authority was not
able to meet these from within its resources. Also we would need
to know how far the amounts claimed fell to be met by your
insurers.




                                    (MS) P RANSFORD

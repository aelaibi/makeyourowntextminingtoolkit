R M Whalley Esq
Secretary
Inquiry into the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster
50 Queen Anne's Gate
LONDON SW1H 9AT                          3 October 1989




Thank you for
          â– Prvr* your letter of 26 September. I am grateful
for the courtesy, and the wholly unnecessary apology.

I have no comment on your choice of date and match (there
is some apprehension in the Press here whether the contest
will be an even one). We will let our Minister know that
Lord Justice Taylor is coming, so let me know if he changes
his mind, please. And if you have any difficulty with the
WRU, which is not a very happy organisation at the moment,
we may be able to help.

           A.    I on instructed on behalf of Trent Regional Health Authority
                  (TKHA) which la reaponalble for the Management of South
                 Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service (SYMAS) In

                 commence on 15th May 1989.


           B.    i am Instructed that Lord Juatlce Taylor has                                requested
                 written arguments in support of this application.                            For eaae
                 of reference I propose to deal in turn with each of the
                 points in my Instructing Solicitors' letter of 3rd May 1989.
                  In so doing I shall adopt the numbering of the letter:

                      Senior Officer (now with another service), and of two

                      more detail.

             and fro* SYMA8 control and transcripts of those
             messages.     These are relevant to the tinning of events
             as they unfolded and to the n n r         In which the poll*
             and others in authority reacted.        A number of messages

       (g)   Evidence      of difficulties encountered by SYMAS
             ambulances on approaching the ground - in particular
             the fact that some vehicles, including the SYMAS Major
             Incident Vehicle, were directed in error by police to
             the Loppings Lane end of the ground. The Control Action
             Plan and instructions given to the drivers of          those
             vehicles required that they should report to the
             entrance next to           the gymnasium on Penlstone Road
             North,


2. FQ1WA10 PLAMMIWO


The statements,         documents and tapes together reveal the
considerable extent of SYMAS' involvement in the planning for and
reaction to the disaster at Hillsborough.          1 understand that West
Midlands Police have been asked to investigate the role played by
tha emergency services.                That In itself in my respectful
submission mekes it desirable that SYMAS its officers and staff
should be       represented, not least because in view of the high
SENT BY:DIBB LUPTON BRQOMHEGD ; 8- 5-89   ll:43ftM           0532426656-J               :n 5




        degree o f public criticism of the police to date it is essential
        that the evidence of the sibulanca                       service    should   be
        independently presented to the inquiry,


        3.     CRITICISM OF SIMM


        Criticism of SYMAS by a Community Physician and a G.P. who were
        present at the disaster were widely reported in the press in the
        days immediately after the disaster,               in particular the Community
        Physician      is reported to have said there was a lack of control
        incompetence and lack of overall plan and the G.P. is reported to
        have said that there was a lack of life saving equipment and in
        particular defibrillators.                   Similar complaints continue to
        receive mention in the press.


        SYMAS wish to be legally represented throughout the inquiry in
        order to be in a position to assist in responding to the issues
        raised and, further be able to refute any such allegations
        against SYMAS.       I understand that the Community Physician has
        published in the British Medical Journal of 29th April 1989 a
        request for "medical accounts of the Hillsborough disaster”
        which he says will be "collated and presented to the Inquiry into
        the disaster". Given the criticisms which he has already made, it
        is highly probable that evidence if presented will be critical of
        SYMAS.    The Ambulance Servloe should have legal representation to
        enable It to refute any such criticism,                       and give it the

      opportunity to tsttbllsh the accurate poaition through all

       relevant witnesses.


       4. A W « a WMK1WS


                 (a)      it i® difficult to anticipate precisely whan adverse
                          comments or criticism will be mads during the course of
                          ■uoh an inquiry, enfl thus adequate «df»nci notice may
                          not always be possible.               However it is often the case
                          that such criticism cen be anticipated by Counsel from
                          the cross examination of the other witnesses by other
                          Counsel and it is very often the case that the nature
                          of such criticism is                suoh that Counsel can establish
                          facts refuting that critioism fro* other witnesses
                          before the critical witnesses themselves are called.


                  (b)     West Midlands Police have requested statements from
                          SYMAS some of whioh especially that of the Chief
                          Ambulance Officer and other officers ere                  critical of
                          Sheffield Wednesday Football Club’s management.
                          Pursuant to Lord Justice Taylor fs direction and the
                          usual practice, advance notice of those criticisms will
                          be given to the people concerned.                 Inevitably they will
                          give evidence anticipating suoh criticism and will seek
                          to answer defleot or refute this and may well in so
                          doing          attack the author of these criticisms,         it would

              Thi« paragraph nay be more ralavant to tha second part of tha
              Inquiry but SYMAS will be in a position to make *or® cogant
              rsprasantations if it has had the opportunity to participate              in
     J1I      the Inquiry by full legal representation. Moreover, by taking a
              full part in the Inquiry, SYMAS ia inevitably in a better
              position to put forward tactical submissions on the second part
              of the inquiry.         Involvement throughout         the Inquiry will save
              duplication.      Furthermore        the questions which SYMAS will wish to
              put, so as to establish its recommendations as to what should
              happen in the future, will not greatly lengthen the proceedings,
              but will if put in the first part of the Inquiry, make it
              unnecessary for such witnesses to return.                There will therefore
              be a saving of expense, but, in more human terms, witnesses will
              be spared the ordeal of reliving the event twioe over.


              7. SIMM CONTROL ACTION PLUM


              I have referred to the SYMAS Control Action Plan and Major
              Incident Plan above.             I have also referred to the difficulties

            the    officers end staff wish to be legally represented if they

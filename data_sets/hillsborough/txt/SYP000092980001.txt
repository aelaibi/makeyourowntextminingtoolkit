            Further to the questionnaire that I have completed I would like to

            clarify the following          point-

            Although J. am normally employed as a turnstile ope ra tor , on the 13.4»

            89 <150489)          X was a few minutes    late arriving.        Eleven turnstiles had

            been closed and consequently eleven of us never had a job*

            I was instructed by                the Chief Steward for the N orth Stand to

            help out on *A* gate a          ’A' Gate gives access to the seats in the North

            Standi         Initially I was standing by the Concertina gate            *A* checking

            tickets and directing          people to their sea ts „

            At the end of the metal          railings7 at the back of the turnstile?          there

            is an iron gate which had been left open to facilitate the use of more

            of the turnstiles for the North Stand-                  A small temporary barrier had

            been utilised to allow this extra access.                    At about 12*30 pm (1230)
                                                                                      PAGE
                                                                                      S3724

              the Chief Steward asked me and           I don't know his full name to

              stand at this te mporary barrier and make sure that no one entered the

              seating area from the    standing enclosure without the correct ticket.

              I would estimate that,   about   10D fans were allowed through to the Nort

              Stand who had come through the wrong turnstiles.        They all had the

              proper tickets for the North Stand.      Vice versa a similar number of

              fans came through the    other   turnstiles with the wrong ticket and were

              ushered through the barrier into the standing enclosure.

              With the exception of maybe one or two, everyone who came through had

              the   correct ticket for where they were allowed to go.       I d i d n ’t see

              Gate A open or clo se.

              I became aware of the problem inside the Leppings Lane end at about 3

              05 pm (1303) when I saw people streaming out the back of the stand.

              After a few           I walked around the back of the North Stand with

                                   and onto the pitch.       L could see that there were

              hundreds of^jjgx>-ffle on the pitch and there was obviously a serious

              problem.    I could see people   lying on the pitch and being tended to.

              It was obvious that some of them were dead.

              Me and         helped a policeman with a youth who was by the corner
3 ) C i <0f
              flag to the right of the Liverpool     goal.     I can’t describe the youth

              but I think he was dead.    We carried him over to the opposite side

              (South Stand) where an ambulance man took him off us

              Then me and          picked up another youth, again I can't remember

              anything about his description,     he had hurt his leg and couldn’t walk

              We helped carry him to the first aid room.

              After this I made myself useful where      I could like carrying jugs of

              water and that I left the ground with

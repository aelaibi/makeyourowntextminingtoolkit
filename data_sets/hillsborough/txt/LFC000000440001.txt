         CLUB BOARD ROOM ON TUESDAY 3rd OCTOBER 1989


The Hillsborough Disaster Appeal

A letter received from the Trustees of the HDF, stating that the Appeal Fund
now exceeds Â£10,000,000 was considered. The Chairman Mr Ensor and the
General Secretary reported that they had recently met 2 of the Trustees of the
Scheme, along with the Trust Fund Manager, who had explained to them their
proposed programme for allocating the proceeds of the Fund to all the various
parties concerned. The Trustees had also stated that they are prepared to
consider allocating a sum of money to build a suitable permanent memorial at
the Anfield Ground to the deceased. A discussion took place on what form of
memorial might be suitable, without any definite decision being reached.

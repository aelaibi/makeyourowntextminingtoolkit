Dear Sir,

Re: Anthony David Bland, deceased

Thank you for your letter of the 20th December, to which the Coroner has asked me to
reply.

The Coroner feels that it would be more beneficial for you to have a copy of the transcript
of evidence taken at the inquest, which would include a copy of the post mortem report.
We are currently in the process of preparing the transcript and as soon as this is available
I will write again to let you know the statutory fee for providing the copy.

Yours faithfully,




Administrative Officer

Dear Sir,

                      Re:      Inquest into the death of Mr A Bland

As you will of course be aware Mr Bland's death followed the
granting of declarations by the Law Lords and directions for
procedures to be followed in similar cases in future.       It is
estimated that 1000 to 1500 individuals suffering from Mr Bland's
condition might be affected.

The death of Mr Bland was one of the reasons for the setting up
of a House of Lords Select Committee to examine the question of
euthanasia and related issues.   This Society, having submitted
written evidence to the Committee was summoned to give oral
evidence last month.  In addition, the Handicap Division of the
Society submitted its own evidence, and was likewise called to
give oral evidence.

The Courts, the Law Lords, the Lords' Select Committee, the BMA,
religious groups, and the medical and lay press and media have
made the case one of the most widely discussed matters in medical
ethics in recent years.    The issues involved are felt by many
people, including ourselves, to be a matter of the weightiest
import to the public interest.

I am writing to request that as a matter of public interest you
would release   copies  of the post mortem report and any
specialised pathology reports in the above case.


Yours faithfully.

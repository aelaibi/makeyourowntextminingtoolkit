TRAINS

1.   NOTTINGHAM FOREST

Five special trains carrying Nottingham Forest supporters will arrive at Midland
Station; the tines     will not be available untilthe week of the      semi-final and
therefore will be given at briefing.

Each train has a capacity of 550.

The fare for these       special trains is inclusiveof the busfare to theground.

SYT will run buses     from the Station to the ground using aroute along     PenistoneRoad
and unloading in Herries Road South; these buses will be under motor cycle escort.

After the natch a similar operation will take place to return Nottingham Forest
supporters to the railway station , loading in Penistone Road North opposite the
ground and using an identical route back to the station.

Departure times will be given at the briefing.

There is the facility to delay the trains in the event of extra tire being played.



2. LIVERPOOL

 3 special trains carrying Liverpool supporters will arrive at Wads ley Bridge
Station at times yet to be arranged; these will be nade available at briefing.

Each train has a capacity of 550.

Departure times will also be given at the briefing.

Again there is a facility to delay the trains in the event of extra time being
played.

As the support for Liverpool is widespread, it is anticipated that supporters will
travel by service train from all parts of the country to Midland Railway Station.
Arrangements have therefore been made for those arriving at Midland Station to be
transported by SYT buses to the ground by a route separate from that used by Nottingham
Forest supporters, travelling along l^ingsett Road, Middlewood Road and arriving at
lappings Lane vrfiere they will unload.

At the end of the game, SYT buses will be available to return any person arriving in
this manner back to the Midland Railway Station. These buses will be located in
Penistone Road North cm the 'to city' carriageway outside Beeley Wood Special School.

                                    OCftCHES


LIVERPOOL


    1       All Liverpool coaches should leave the Ml Motorway at Eklt 36
             flankersley) and travel via the A61 to designated parkirc areas.

    2       The geographical location of Liverpool, coupled with the countrywide
             s-jpport enjoyed by the Club, suggests that coaches coulc well approach
             the stadium by other routes, particularly the A616. If ttis is the
             case, then they must be brought to the designated coach parking area.

    3       Tire serials engaged on duty at Tankersley and Oughtibridae will
             operate selective stop and search procedures to ensure (- passengers
             herve tickets, (b) they are not in possession of alcohol sd (c)
             they are not drunk. When this has been done, each coach will have
             an adhesive sticker placed on the nearside of the windscreen and it
             will be allowed to proceed to the designated parking aFez.

    4       All coaches will be allowed to travel to the ground withrct specific
            escort, although members of the Road Traffic Motor Cycle King will
            be providing overall mobile supervision. All coaches will be directed
            to the traffic island at Leppings lane where in the first instance,
            they will park in Claywheels Lane. Once this area is full then
            coaches will be directed to park cm the 'out lane' of th= dual
            carriageway in Halifax Road, parking to commence at the trsp of the
            ci^al carriageway and then work towards the stadium.

    5       All coaches will park before being permitted to set dowr. passengers
            thereby ensuring that the occupants know exactly where t: return to
            or. conpletion of the football match.

    6    V£-»ere it is discovered that passengers on a coach are ncc in possession
          of tickets, or are in breach of legislation concerning alcohol at
          Sporting Events, then Ground Control will be informed far consideration
          as to returning such vehicles out of the Force area under escort.

    7    Where individual passengers only are involved who have consumed alcohol
          in such amounts that they are drunk, or are in possessicr of alcohol,
          then they should be arrested and detained pending transport.
NOTi'JiOflM P3REST

    8    Nottingham Forest supporters who travel by coach will be encouraged to
          use the Ml motorway leaving at Exit 34 (Tinsley). This aspect of the
          operation will be dealt with by 'D' Division Officers ani is the
          subject of a separate order.

   9     These coaches will be parked in the South Yorkshire Tran~?crt Garage,
          Herries Road South and, if necessary, Rawson Spring Road.

       TRANSIT VANS - LIVERPOOL




Transit vans, etc. carrying Liverpool supporters v i l l
be encouraged to travel via the M62 and Ml motor^Evs
leaving the latter at Junction 36 (Tankersley).
However, it is envisaged that such vehicles will also
approach the stadium from the Flouch (A616).


Such vehicles will be stopped and thoroughly
searched to ensure that they are not carrying
alcohol and the passengers have not consumed the
same to an extent where they are drunk.


All passengers will be checked to ensure that th=y
are in possession of tickets.


Hie vehicles will then proceed to the designated
parking area in Wardsend Road North where passengers
will alight and walk to the ground.


It is not feasible to atterrpt to channel such
vehicles through one 'checkpoint' and therefore
it will be the duty of all serials on duties outside
the stadivrr to monitor and check such vehicles arc
their occupants.


Should any vehicle arrive, wittout having been
checked or. the outskirts, which is found to be
carrying passengers without tickets or in breach cf
the legislation relating to the carriage and
consunptior. of alcohol en route to sporting everts,
then Ground Control will be informed for consideration
as to returning the vehicle to the motorway for escort.
If necessary, the driver and passengers will be dealt
with for breach of the relevant legislation by ley
of sumnons or arrest, dependant on their indivirsj=l
condition.

9          The Club reserves the right for its servants andagents

            and Regulations of the Football Association and The Football
            League or whose presence on the Ground is or could
            reasonably be construed as constituting a source of
           danger, nuisance or annoyance to other spectators.


HJlEi     Item 8 above outlines the contractual agreement between the
focrtball supporter and the Club. It does not create a power to search
and any search must be with the consent of the individual supporter.
Refusal is merely a bar to entering the ground and not a criminal offence.
Wiere a search is conducted with consent, it is a search within the
nesting of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. Section 3(i) of the
Act requires an officerto make a record of the search in writing unless
it is not practicable to do so and large scale searches such as those at
focrrball matches fall within this sectier.. There is not therefore a
requirement to complete a Form PACE/ 1.

         280. HAMILTON ACADEMICAL F.C.

              Following consideration of their application in respect of a former
         railway siding having been adapted for car parking, Mr. Sturgeon undertook to
         enquire of the Club:-

              a)   what was their legal standing on the land in question?
              b)   How did they distinguish between safety and improvement?
              c)   Why did they consider that they were entitled to any preferential
                   treatment?

         281. NOTTINGHAM FOREST F.C.

              It was decided to refuse the application in respect of improvements to
         a bus parking area, as it did not appear to the Trustees that the work fell
         within the provisions of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act. It was, of course,
         open to the club to refute this view, if they felt that they had the supporting
         evidence.
                           -   3   -




282. NEWPORT COUNTY F.C.

     It was decided to accept a claim of £14,156.44 (60% = £8,494) in respect
of stand seating.

283. NOTTS. COUNTY F.C.

     It was decided to refuse claims in respect of two items of abortive work.

284. BRISTOL CITY F.C.

     A letter from John Leader & Co., Chartered Accountants, was considered.
The firm felt that there might be a possible and admissable claim by the Club,
but were unwilling to undertake the research necessary in order to substantiate
it unless there was a reasonable prospect of the claim being accepted.   The
Club’s Associate Membership of the Football League was in the process of being
transferred to a new public limited company.

     As the Trustees were not as. well informed, in fact, as the letter writer
assumed, Mr. Davidson undertook to enquire of the accountants a) what the nature
of the possible claim was and b) their suggestions as to how the Trustees might
process it without any breach of their obligations.

285. A.F.C. BOURNEMOUTH

     It was reported that the contractors were willing to underwrite any
costs, in respect of a safety project, that the club could not meet. The Trustees
raised no objection in principle, provided that the club were legally relieved
of any obligations for payment. It was left to George Corderoy & Co. to put
the Architects in question in touch with the Chairman should there be any
procedural difficulty.

286. CHESTERFIELD F.C.

     Following earlier rejections by the Trustees of certain claims made by
the Club, Mr. Taylor reported on a meeting with the Club Chairmanandread to
the Trustees a supporting document from the Police.

     (Mr. Cliff Lloyd joined the meeting at this point).

     It was decided to approve the application for grant in respect of
£15,924.72 (60% = £9,555) for the replacement of the roofing.

287. FOOTBALL TRUST

     Various matters relating to the activities of the Football Trust were discussed.
Copies of the Accounts to 31st December 1981 were received and noted. The
Chairman requested guidance on the level of co-operation that was desirable with
the Representative of Scottish Football on the Trust.

                                               It was decided to meet the Scottish Football League Management Committee
:
                                          around the end of April 1983, the date to be arranged early in the New Year.

                                               It was felt that at that Meeting the Trust might usefully reciprocate
                                          the excellent hospitality that was extended to those Trustees present.

292. NEW PROCEDURES

     WEST HAM UNITED F.C.

     It was decided to allow George Corderoy & Co. a certain amount of
discretion on claims when clubs did not put the building contract out to
competitive tender. However, the Secretary should write to such clubs, in
this instance, West Ham United, enquiring why the stipulated procedures were
not complied with.

293. POLICY

     Following consideration of George Corderoy & Co.'s paper and the
Chairman's notes thereon it was decided that, for work carried out after
the1st June 1981, the following will apply:-

1.The anomalies    created by the application of differing percentages shall
cease and that one percentage only shall apply to all League Clubs - 60%, and
one for International Grounds - 50%.

2.   The maximum ceiling on which that percentage is calculated shall be:-

           a)   For Designated Clubs - raised from £400,000 to £600,000
           b)   For Non-Designated Clubs - the same at £400,000.


     In both cases expenditure for floodlighting is included within these
limits and will remain limited to a maximum of £50,000.

     The Secretary was instructed to draft a circular letter for consideration
by the Trustees and Corderoy & Co.   The Chairman would then complete the final
draft for circulation to the Clubs.

     It was decided not to proceed with the Chairman’s draft letter of reminder
to those clubs who had not replied to the circular requesting anticipated
safety expenditure.

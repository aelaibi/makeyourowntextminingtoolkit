Officers           were       urged       to    look      at    collages             of    offenders           and weapons          used

on    specially            prepared            boards       near      the P o l i c e           Room,

ensure          compliance           with       the    order.

All    officers            went      to    see     not i ce b o a r d           re    past       offenders           and weapons

At    about       2.50        pm    (1430)       1 heard a            radio m e s s a g e             saying       there     were

very many           people          outside       the L e p p i n g s           Lane       end and a           request       was    made

for    the       kick      off      to    be    delayed         until       3.13          pm    (1315).         Moments        later

this       request         was      denied.

At 3       pm    (1500)         moments         l a ter     the M e r r i e s         R oad area was               clear     and    no

late       c om e r s    were       apparent.             To    all    intents             and    purposes           Phase     1 for

our    sector           had     been      successful.

We    started           to m u s t e r     near       Penistone            Road       in o r d e r      to m o v e     as    a Group

Soon       after        3 pm       (1300)       I heard a frantic                     appeal          for    all     officers

available           to     go      onto    the    track.

minimal        about         13/20       seconds.,

We    ran to       the       North Stand Gate                   *0'       where         2 stewards alone                    were

manning        the      gate       and       straight          onto       the        tr a ck .       I sa w a         large      number

of    officers          on    the       f e n c e at      the    goal           en d    (West S t a n d ) .            Several

civilians          were       on      the     track.           The     main          area      of    concern          seemed       to    be

to    the    right       of      the     goal       ~ very       quickly               indeed        very many          officers

fence       with       faces       and       bodies       jammed          up a g a i n s t          the    fence       s o me    with

vomit       on t h e i r      clothing,             some were             blue         in the        fa c e a n d     were

extremely          distressed,                some       appeared           beyond           any     help.        There         was

nothing        I could           do     to    get    into       th e      pen        to g i ve       immediate          relief.

1 was       speaking          to      one     male       who    was       pleading             for    help and          appeared          to

die    as    I spoke          to      him.         I climbed           onto          the     fence        and    saw m an y        people

in a sea          of    confusion             immediately              behind           the      West      Stand      goal       in the

standing          enclosure.

Chief       S u p t . Nesbit            was       standing       close           to me         on the       hoardings            behind

the    goal.

1 directed             several          officers          into       the        enclosure            adjacent          to    the      9p e n ’

they were          trying          to    encourage             people           to     go    backwards           to   the       entrance

or    climb       the    fence          to    the w i n g       which           wa s    sparse        with       supporters,

finay of       the      f an s     were       in a s t a t e         of     panic           a n d w e r e n ’t r e s p o n d i n g       to

advice       and       directions             given       by    policemen.                    I saw       several       fans       being

pulled       up f r o m       the       ’pen'       into       the     upper           section.            The    area       was

swarming          with       people and many                   officers              a r r i v e d at      the    top       end.

I ascertained                officers             were    at    th e      rear         of    the W e s t        Stand and were

trying       to    get       people          back    into       the       open area              near      the    turnstiles.

I went       out       around         the     back       to a s c e r t a i n          this was           correct.           It wa s

then    I saw          several          bodies       on the          grassbank               and many           officers         present

in t h is a r ea.             I went          back       on to       th e       field and            sa w m a n y      people         being

brought        out      onto       the       grass       by    police           officers.             Several          people         were

being       transported               by h o a r d i n g      boards          carrried          by    civilians.              I saw

several         stewards          and       Sheffield             Wednesday             apprentices          in       blue    track

suits       on the         field       they were             tending          to    the       injured and             trying          to

clear       the      pitch.           Many       p h o t o g r a p h e rs w e r e        on the       field       as w e r e

Liverpool            fans.        I sa w         very many,             the    vast          majority were             under          the

influence            of    intoxicants                displaying           the      usual       symptoms          - eyes          glased,

breath         smelling          of    beer,          slurred       speech,             so m e w e r e   very         aggressive             in

their       manner.

It was         obvious       the       task       of    helping           people         out    of    the    s tand was               well

in hand.             Many    officers             were       at    th e    scene         of    the    crushing          and       it was

a    case      of    'too m a n y          cooks,*           I then        saw m a n y         officers          forming          up on

the    halfway            line    to       prevent       Liverpool             fans          encroaching          into       the

opposite            half.        Due       to    the    lack       of     information             by t a n n o y / v i d e o          board

the    fans         appeared          to    be    becoming          impatient,

I was       approached            by a s t e w a r d w h o              t o l d me       several         people        were       being

threatened            by    distraught                Liverpool           fans      in the a r e a          of    the    players

t u n n e 1.

I went         there       and    sa w Sgt.            Chapman          trying          to    contain       the       situation.              I

there       saw Bert         McGee          a n d F.A.        Rep.        Graham         Kelly       being       lobbied          by m a n y

irate       fans      blaming          them       for    the       disaster             by    poor    planning          and       bad

ticket         distribution.

We    saw      several       farts h a d g o n e             up    the     tunnel            and were       trespassing

looking         for       trouble          after       several          minutes          we    cleared       them away

however         very many were                   at    the    entrance             to    the    tun ne 1 repeating                    their

statements            blaming          the F.A.          for       the     disaster.

The    t e n s i o n was         very apparent                and       several          officers        were         called          to

support         us    in the          containment             of    t h is     a r ea.         l't a p p e a r e d     to me          the

Liverpool            fans    were          building          up    near       the       half    way      line     1 feared an

attack         at    the K o p        end where          the F o r e s t           fans w e r e       located          and    I            -------

             Tannoy      appeal          for    calm.           I wa s   asked    by K e l l y    to    do      this    and    both

             managers         agreed       to    do       so ~ a n d     were    taken    by me        to    the P o l i c e    room.

             Shortly afterwards                  the       referee was          taken    to   the      s am e    location       to    see

             Chief      S upt,      Duckenfield.

             I was      approached             by the D e p u t y        Chief    Constable         of M e r s e y s i d e     who

             asked      a n d wa s       taken       to    the P o l i c e   r o o m a n d was      introduced           to Mr,

             Jackson,

             I   did    not    handle          any    b o dies.

             When      the    scale       of    the       disaster       became    apparent         I feared a           riot    by    the

             Liverpool         f a ns    who     were       in the m a i n       drunk    and     aggressive            and    without

             discipline.             In m y      opinion          the    police    officers         behaved with              great

             courage         and    discipline             to    keep    order    and    sa v e   life w h e r e        possible

             they were         hindered          by t h e s e m i n d l e s s     people      many      too      drunk    to

             comprehend            the    scale       of    the    incident.

             It w a s    clear       the       fenced       area     prevented many           people         from      being    r e s c u ed .

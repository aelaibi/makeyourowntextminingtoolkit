                     SHOCK/HILLSBOROUGH
The shock I faced was the death of my brother just a few short weeks ago. I have never experienced this
kind of shock before in my life and I never want again. Words cannot describe the feelings I had or still
have as it changes all the time, never the same emotions. .
Liverpool versus Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough (the ground of Sheffield Wednesday), was an ordi­
nary football match where 95 people innocently died for he sake of SPORT. One of those 95 was my
brother Colin.
Colin was just 19, a shy and hard-working lad. He had never been to an away match before because of his
job as a barman in the Dockers Club. Colin left the Dockers club because it was only a weekend job, and
he had been promoted in his day job (TSB -bank clerk). He was to celebrate leaving the dockers on
Thursday but he never did because of the disaster.
On the Friday night before he died, whilst he was out girls fought over him, so I left and said”Bye, see
you tomorrow,” I went home and left him to carry on enjoying the last night of his life. Whose last words
“Bye, see you tomorrow,” will always stay in my heart but as the saying goes “Tomorrow never comes”.
At 3.06 pm on the 15th April 1989, the football match was stopped, but it wasn’t until 3.45 am on the
 16th April 1989, that the tragic news came to us via my brother Ian. Ian is my only brother now, but he
 has suffered the worst because he was more like.a friend to Colin than a brother. Those twelve hours or so
 in between I felt numb. People have said before that they felt like this, but I did not know what they
 meant until now, for there was little I could do except hope and pray Colin would come back. Those
 hours were filled with sorrow and grief. I cried with pain, I cried with helplessness, but I also remembered
 all the time we had together.
 Colin did return, but not until Thursday 20th April 1989, and this was in a wooden box known as a coffin.
 Still the numbers never went. He had said the day before I’ll come back home tomorrow and either get
 drunk with happiness if they win or with sorrow if they loose. Neither happened. The pain and sorrow the
 players felt at that moment (three zero six pm) was practically the same as mine. They were not allowed
 to help, nor was I, they were not aware of what was going on, nor was I. There was little I could do, but
 much to hope for.

    * That Colin would come back;

    * That Colin would drive up in his car,

    * That my mum and dad would comfort each other and release their grief;

    * That Ian would express his anger in some way;

    * That the other families who lost someone would comfort each other and manage;

    * That everyone in Liverpool would just be okay, it didn’t matter what I felt as long as they were fine;

 I am beginning to experience a lot of emotions like hurt from the tragedy, but unlike my family I cry in
 secret, just as Colin would have, I wouldn’t want to hurt anyone, just as Colin never did, I don’t want to
 attract attention, as this was not Colin’s style.
 Now my family are starting a fresh life, and trying to carry on from before the 15th April 1989, because
 Colin has only died in body but will never in soul, he will always be in our thoughts and in our hearts.
 “Our” means family and friends because of the love, support, and affection from everyone we know.
 SO REMEMBER “Live today as if it were your last” for who knows it might just be. Colin didn’t know
 that the party he was at the night before was going to be his last.
 GOD always takes the best 1st and there couldn’t have been anyone better than our Col.
                                                                         - Lisa, Age 16, Liverpool

 The group’s foundations lie in the immediate aftermath of that appalling day at
Hillsborough that cost 95 irreplaceable lives. Broken families were brought together
 by events sue!’ as the Memorial Service at Livctpool Cathedral or by more casual,
 meetings at Anfield and elsewhere.
 Our grief frustration, anger, disbelief, melancholy - even despair, all became a little
easier to understand when shared or just “aired” with someone else - thrown into the
same emotional whirlpool by events of April 15th. S trangers, o f all ages, from differing

The sad “statistics” of Hillsborough; 95 dead, hundreds physically iniured, some very
sciiously and permanently, hundreds more psychologically atlectcd, are tragic eno sign, but when one remembers that those involved
were predominantly young (for example 77 or 81% o f the 95
deceased were less than 30 years old, with 38 of them or 40 % iJtraX

graph showed a fan who had helped to pull people out, and a
note was left with it, asking the fan concerned to contact the
leaver of the photograph. No contact was made at that time,
however, the fan concerncd would now like to make contact
if this is still required. If you can give any information about
this please contact;- SYLVIA BERRY, SOCIAL WORKER

decided      to find a pub to have a few drinks                              before     going    to the

match.       We went       into    the      large    pub after          the^ pub       called    "The New

we   ente r e d we were met            by a     large      crowd of          people who        had   literally

As we     got     nearer     to the        turnstiles       it became          tighter and tighter.

          through.          There was          no one      there a^sking f or t i ckets .

          As wa went           in we    could see          the    tunnel    e n t rance and at            the far end the

          pitch*         E v e r y o n e was    heading      towards       the m o u t h of the           tunnel.      We were

          walking        quic k l y as we         e ritered the        tunnel .     We were all able            to walk

          freely a long          the t u n n e l , I       was walking        down the          lefthami side and

          emerged        into the       pen on my          left.

          There were a l r e a d y a lot              of    people      inside     the     pen but we       could still

          ma n a g e    to work       our way      thro u g h them to w h e r e we              intended to go.          I

          to get my bearings.                   This was about p . 50             pm.

          We    star t e d making        our way        to the      left and       then     it became       tighter      and

          tighter        until    we    couldn't move.              I was     still       by the two A n d e r s o n s at

          this     time.        Jack A n d e r s o n was a couple             of feet       to my     left and B rian

          A n d e r s o n was another           couple      of feet      on his         left.     I saw Jack A n d e r s o n

            r ima c i nq and I tried to m a ke my way towards him to see if I could

          m a k e s o m e s pa c e f o r h inr*.

          I felt m y s e l f       pushed       from behind.            I lost     my balance        and     I was

          carried forward              by t h e    crowd,.       The    surge    took       me    forward literally to

          I was        packed    in    very tightly          I had my arms          up      against       my chest and I

          was    finding        it d i f ficult       to breath.           My head        began    to slump forward

          avid I began to             cry out      that     I couldn't       breath.            Someone    from benind

          told me        to K e e p my head         up and        i actually       f e x t someone        grab t h e    oack

          of my head and              puli     it back.          I remained      like that         for a few moments,

          I then        lost    consciousness.              Whe n   I came      round      I realised       that     I had

          f allen      on the     floor.          I couldn't move my head because                      someone was

          actually        standing       on one       end of my scarf w h i c h             I had w r a p p e d ar o u n d

          my    neck.       1 couldn't move my neck                    because    the      scarf was       restricting al

movement        and        I began to           panic.        I managed        to work        one hand under

the     scarf and           pulled        it over my head.               When      I was able          to    look     up I

couldn't        see a n y t h i n g apart              from    peoples      bodies all           aro u n d me.-        I

could not            see   daylight.             I realised          that    someone         else was        also on        the

floor     because          he was         lying    on my       legs.

I could       breath wit h d i f f i c u l t y and                  I began     punching         out    at    the forest

of    legs a r o u n d me          to     let    people       know that        I was    there.          1 was

s h o uting     and scr e a m i n g         out as well.              We a t t r a c t e d    the a t t e n t i o n of

the     people ar o u n d us who m a n a g e d to                    create some        space and both of us

were     pulled up.               W hen    1 regained my feet                the    crush had eased somewhat

and     I was able           to    push my way through and back                        towards         the    rear of th

right.        I said         I couldn't           go    through another             crush.        He    said hang

on.      He a t t r a c t e d      the a t t e n t i o n of 2         lads who were            standing        in the

Whe n    I looked towards                  the    pitch       I could see          people      being        carried on

the adve rt i s i ng h o a r d ! n g s and                realised       that      people      had been        injured.

1 became        c o ncerned for             the    safety of my             cousin so         I went        out of     the

called      off      so    I wa l k e d     off and out of             the ground.             This was about               3.2

I made my way              to where         we had        parked      the    car.      I found         the    car     but

d i d n ’t see any of the                 others.          Other      people were            getting        into their

cars and on s w i tching                   the    radio       on    I heard     that 3 people               had died,

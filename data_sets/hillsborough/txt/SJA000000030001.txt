We arrived to attend the duty at Hi ll s b or o ugh at 1.45pm on 15th April. There
were four of us that arri v e d at that time,
        arid myself. We went to the first aid room and signed in.                                 and I
went to have a look-r o un d the ground to see how many fans had a r r i v e d . N o t t i n g h a m
Forest had the Kop arid the s ou t h stands arid L i ve rpool had Leppirigs Larie arid the
north stand. There were riot many Liverpool fans iri Leppirigs Lane. We went back
to the first aid room arid w a i t e d there until 2.30pm.                 It was about that time that
we went to our corner. We w e re at the Leppiriqs Larie end. There was
Philip Saxtori,
            ]and myself.              | arid I went to the toilets arid came back at 2.50pm.
The players were already ori the pitch war mi n g up. We walked past the Liverpool
supporters, it was then that we noticed s o m et h i n g was wrong. The fans at the front
were being crushed against the fence. They we r e s c re aming at us that they couldn't
breath or move, they w an t e d us to open the gates to let them out. There wasn't
anything that we could do. We went back to the co rn e r arid I told Philip Saxtori
what we had just seen arid that there could be some trouble. In the mean t im e the
players were ready to kick off. Then I not i ce d that some of the fans were trying
to climb over the p e r imeter fence, but the p o li c e w e re pushing the fans back into
the c r o w d , thinking that they were going to invade the pitch. Philip then called
to me arid             to go with him.        I went runn i ng across arid already there were
people laying ori the side of the pitch, the game was still going on.                         The police
must have realised what was g o i ng on arid they were help i ng the fans to climb over
the fence. The people who we were helping were laid on the pitch arid were holding
their chests arid crying. We told them to take deep breaths arid tried to calm them
down. A lad, about 22 years old, got hold of me arid told me to open the gates
because people were dying back there. I looked round arid saw that the police had
already opened it arid were d r a gging people out. By this time the match had been
stopped. I had lost                   iri the crowd arid coul d n' t see her near me. I saw
a policeman sat next to a ma n who was u n c o n sc i ou s but h e ‘was breathing. I had
noticed that the po l i c e m a n h ad attempted to put the man into the recovery position,
but one of his arms was u n d e r n e a t h him, r es t r i c t i n g his breathing. I told this to
the policeman arid we put him into the recovery position. I kept with the man to
keep ari eye ori him, when a w o m a n came up to me arid told me she was a nurse, could
she do anything to help. I told her to keep ari eye on his breathing arid if it
altered iri any way to shout some o ne over. I n o t i ce d that the St. Johns Ambulance
was making it's way towards the Liverpool goal.                   I saw a p ol i ceman giving mouth-to-
mouth ori a man, I ran over to him arid helped him. I was doing the mouth-to-mouth
arid he was doing heart compressions. I am riot sure how long we were doing this,
but after a while the p o l i c e m a n took his coat off w h i l e I checked to see if I could
find a pulse. I c o u l d n ’t find one arid the p o l i c e m a n covered him up. The fans were
pulling down the a d v e r t i sing boards arid using them as stretchers to carry off the
injured. I saw              ~| arid a policeman gi vi n g m o ut h - t o - m o u t h to someone, I went
over arid the policeman saw me arid I took over from him. We were giving mouth-to-
mouth for about ten minutes.          I kept chec k in g for a pulse but couldn't find one.
After a few more attempts of m o ut h -t o - mo u th we got his heart beating, but he still
wasn't breathing, we kept c h a n g i n g over, I not i ce d that the casu a lt y was going
blue. The policeman said that he was dead. After that                                   arid I kept
together, we helped three L iv e r po o l supporters carry one of their fans ori an
advertising board, to the o t h e r end of the pitch. We came back arid saw that the
fire services had arrived w i t h the oxygen tanks. They had also used wire cutters
to cut down part of the p e r i m e t e r fence . We n o ti c ed that there was a
stretcher still c o v e re d up, so we took it arid saw that some fans were trying to
lift a casualty ori to a board. They were pick i n g him up by his arms arid legs and
dragging him onto the board. We showed them w h er e to hold onto the casualty
without causing any more d a m a g e arid we lifted him on to the stretcher. There was
a steward with us arid he told us to take the c a s u a l ty through the south stand exit.
There were three Liverpool s u p p o r te r s arid                   c a r ry i ng the stretcher, I was
making sure that he was alright. They e a r n e d him up the steps, there wasn't
enough room for me to walk next to him, so some Notting h am Forest support e rs put
the seats down so that I c o u l d climb onto them.
We took him straight to ari ambulance and wa i t e d for them to take over. We went
back down ori to the p i t c h and saw a woman sat ori the pitch, she was h av i n g
difficulty iri breathing.       I told her to try arid relax and take deep breaths. We
told her that we w o u l d t ak e her to the ambulance . We went thr o ug h the south
stand again arid took her to the ambulance, w h e r e she was g i v en some oxygen. When
we went back to the pitch, we saw a little boy covered up and a cou p le of policemen
came arid carried him off. By this time most of the injured had been c a r r i e d off,
but there were still some fans wandering around, some were s t i l l l o o k i n g shocked,
others were looking for their friends arid relatives. \                arid I went back to
the first aid room, w here there was a lad who had broken his nose arid som eo n e who
had lost his friend.                   came up to us arid asked u s if we w er e alright.
We were then joined by                                            told us that we could
go home. We left at 4 . 4 5 p m

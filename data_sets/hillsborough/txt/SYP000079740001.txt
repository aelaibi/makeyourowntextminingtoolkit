We t r a v e l l e d along the M63,             then M62 a n d onto the A 616 and were                          not

s u b j e c t e d to a n y traffic          delays.        We s t o p p e d a p p r o x i m a t e l y    one mile

before St o c k b r i d g e at a roadside                snack bar to have               something to eat.

We then continued              into Stocbraridge, a r r i v i n g at a public house there

called the F r i e n d s h i p        Inn,    at a p p r o x i m a t e ly 12.00 noon            (1200?.         We

went    into the        pub where we           later met wit h a p p r o x i m a t e l y fifteen other

Liverpool          supporters,        who    I knew.        Apart       f r o m ,our group of about

twe n t y five       I didn't see a n y other               obvious Liverpool               supporte rs at

this    pub.        We all     had a couple           of drinks a n d event u a l l y             left the       pub

at a bout 2 . 0 0 p m       (1400) a n d headed for S h e f f i e l d               in the      cars.         Whilst

on route        between S t o c k b r i d g e and Sheffield,                I saw the usual Police

stop    check       point,     where      they were        stopping mini            buses full           of

Liverpool          fans a n d checking          for alcohol.             We were       not d i r e c t e d at all

to the ground,            but we knew the way as                  I have      been to the ground before

a n d most of our group went                   to the same semi-final                  last year.

We a r r i v e d    in S h e f f i e l d at a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2 . 2 0 p m   (1420)      and parked the

cars    in a side         road off Langsett Rd»                   All    nine of us then w a l k e d to

the ground.            Whilst walk i n g        there a p p e a r e d to be the usual                    numbers      of

fans making          their way to the ground.                     I d i d n ’t see anyone               dri nking or

who a p p e a r e d drunk        nor did I see anyone                fighting        or being disorderly.

G e n e r a l l y everyone was well             behaved and the a t m o s p h e r e was very good.

I saw P olice          dotted at various              intervals whilst              on route.

We a r r i v e d outside       the L e p pings Ln synd of the ground at 2 . 3 0 p m                  (1430)

We had previously a r r a n g e d to mee^r an elde r l y man outside,                         who had

p o s s e s s i o n of a L e p p i n g s Ln standing ticket.                 My brother w a n t e d to

had a ticket          for one of the stands             so he split           from us.      The    remaining

eight of us then made              our way towards turnstile B our entry                          point   into

the ground.           Outside     the t u r n s t i l e s / t h e r e were    no orderly queues,          just

masses       of    people all     s q u a s h e d up/atgainst each other stretching                  right

ac r o s s   the turnstiles a n d out almost as far as the                         large    blue

perimeter gates.              We all     joined the       crowd and a t t e m p t e d to get to the

turnstiles.           Almost     immedi a t e l y we were e n g u l f e d       in the mass        of people

and    I had no control           over where        I was going.             I was then split from my

friends,          but m a n a g e d to stay next to my brother                        ,    I saw one

P o l i c e m a n on horseback just to the              right of turnstile B as you                  look at

the ground fn^am L e p p i n g s Ln,          he was just         beyond the        crowd a long      the

side     of the ground.           I then found myself             to the       right of turnstile B,

w h e n s u d denly the P o l i c e m a n on h o rseback          star t e d to ride thro ugh the

crowd.        This    caused a lot of panic amongst                  the      people who were        trying

to a v o i d being t r a m p l e d by the horse.               At one stage the horse was

actually          lifted off     its feet      because      of the swell          of people a r o u n d     it.

I then saw a barrier              next    to me w h i c h I s c r a m b l e d under        into the

turnstile area,             to a v o i d the horse.        At this       time              was still with

me,    but soon       I lost sight of him also.                 At one stage          I found myself

standing          next to                              , but was       soon to lose sight of him

also.        I only noticed one other P o l i c e m a n /ho was standing amon g s t                         the

mass     of people.          He a p p e a r e d to be a ser)/or officer as he was wear i n g

a flat       cap and had pips on his shoulders.                      E v e n t u a l l y I found myself

outside a turnstile and made my way thro u g h it.                              This was a c t u a l l y the

turnstile          to the furthest        left of the block B .                I handed my ticket           in

         turnstile      I saw quite a number             of Police         on foot,        who seemed to be

         m a i n l y trying      to stop the fans who were             climbing           over the top of the

         turnstiles.

         I a c t u a l l y got    inside    the ground at about 2 . 5 0 p m               (1450)    an d w a i t e d for

         m y friends.         I was soon joined by                                  and                            and we

         s tood a r o u n d waiting        for the    rest as     I was      e s p e c i a l l y w o r r i e d about my

         brother.       We w a i t e d for a p p r o x i m a t e l y five minutes,           but none of them

         appeared.      The n as      I looked back at the t u rnstiles                    I s u d d e n l y saw

         crowds of people entering               the ground from my             left.        I then saw that

    C_   the   large blue         c o ncertina gate was open to a bout                    three quarters           of   its

         width.      I didn't" j^ee a n y Police          or stewards         standing           next to the gate,

         but this was         probably due to the           large mass        of     people who were           coming

         through     it blocking my view.                                    a nd    I m o v e d out of the way

         of the    crowds        coming    through,    who were ma k i n g          their way d i r e c t l y to

         the tunnel      u n d e r n e a t h the stand,     which    leads     to the terraces.                I

    J    a s s u m e d that this was the only means               of entry to the terraces,                    as I

         d i d n ’t see any sjt'qns giving a n y other directions.                          The mass        of people

         going    past us c o n tinued for about 2 to 3 minutes,                           but then died down

         so that     only a few s tragglers were going                     past us.         F rom where we were

         now standing         I could not       see the     c o ncertina gate,             but    I assumed        it had

         been closed as the flow of people had stopped.

         We d e c i d e d that     it w o u l d be now v i r t u a l l y    impossible to find the                  rest
V
         of my friends &P my brother,                 so we decided to go onto the terraces.

         We w a l k e d al^ng the tunnel           quite freely and a l t h o u g h there were quite

         a few fans also making              their w a y down       it there was            no real     problem.

         There was      no d i s o r d e r l y behaviour     by the fans            inside the gr o u n d a n d           I

         d i d n ’t see anyone       drinking alcohol.            There were          no Police        or

         stewards     outside the tunnel             or inside      it.

         We made     our way       into tj?fe right hand side of the terrace w h i c h                        I now

         know to be pen 3.             We then made        our wa y down the terrace                 to a position

                 (Exh          ).     This   is what we w o u l d n o r m a l l y do at matches and up to

                 this     point all     three of us were still               together.     I know that this

                 w o u l d have been a p p r o x i m a t e l y one mi n u t e   before    kick off as     I could

                 see the     players kicking the           practice         balls off the    pitch.     Suddenly       I

                 became     very u n c o m f o r t a b l e as the    crowd a r o u n d me star t e d to crush up

                 against me.          I had the feeling that we were               in a press w h i c h was      being         ,

                 q u i c k l y tightened.

                 I then saw a girl           standing     next to me,         just to my    right and     in front.

                 She had been forced a r o u n d because of the ma s s e s                 of people so that        she

                 was a c t u a l l y facing me as       I looked out onto the             pitch.    The girl was

                 saying,     "I can't        breathe, I can't breath."

                 I w o u l d describe   the girl as a white girl, a g e d a p p r o x i m a t e l y la t e

                 peeling skin on her face as though she had recently been under a sun

                 r olled up halfway up her forearm.                    She was wear i n g    black t r o u s e r s , but

                 I can't     remember        what   she was wearing under the jacket an d               I didn't

                 see her footwear.              I took hold of the girl w i t h both my hands               under

                 her a r m p i t s to stop her falling              down.     I could see she was very close                   i

                 to passing out as her eyes               started to roll an d she was gasping                for

      •          breath.       I tried to encourage her an d comfort her to hold on and
                                                                                                                               i

                 s lap p e d her face to stop her from fainting.                    I had hold of her for

                 a bout    three     to four m i n u t e s and during this time            I could see     people

                 climbing      over the front        perimeter fencing and also going thro u g h the

                 narrow gate spilling            onto   the   pitch.         At first the gate was only

                 opened to allow a few people a*ft an d was then                     closed again.         I saw a

                 P o l i c e m a n on top of the     perimeter fencing           trying    to bend back the

                 spikes so that         people 'scou/d climb over more             easily.      I remember the
                                                                                                 PAGE             6

m a t c h still      being    in progress at this              time.     I still    had hold of the

girl,        but by now,      a l t h o u g h she was still        conscious,      she was very,       very

close to fainting.

Suddenly         I realised that         there was a large opening                in the    crowd to my           ...

right.         There was a large            clearing an d       in the middle       of this    I could

see    that      o n e of the      crash barriers had c o l l a p s e d .         I do not have any

r e c o l l e c t i o n of the girl      I had been holding from this                point    on and     I

did not see her again.                  The barrier was al m o s t         flat on the floor

having        been forced forward.             There were        people    still    crushed up

against        the front      fence just       in front of the barrier an d some                people

were almost falling                over behind the barrier              because    of the    cl earing       in       ,

front,        but for some strange            reason       I seemed to have        room to move an d          I „

f o u n d myself      in the middle         of the        clearing     right next to the barrier.

I could see          people on the floor             in front      of the barrier a n d       I remember

seeing a tangle             of arms a n d     legs u n d e r n e a t h the barrier.              was

still w i t h me at this time and together we                          pulled two young       lads out

from u n d e r n e a t h the barrier.              I cannot give a n y d e s c r iptions at all            of

these        lads,   but    I do    remember       that    they were well      enough to walk        off

up to the back of the terrace.                       I have no rec o l l e c t i o n of seeing

an y o n e    uncons c i o u s u n d e r n e a t h the barrier,        but e verything      is quite

hazy for that           period of time.             The    people behind the barrier           on the

edge     of the      clearing were          standing as though they were              on the edge of

a cliff,        ter r i f i e d of falling forward.              Those    in front of the barrier

were     pressed      like sardines         facing        towards the     pitch at what a p p e a r e d

to be a n angle of 43 degrees                  leaning forward.            I knew that s o m ething

terrible was taking                place,    but    I really did not        c o mprehend that       people

were    dying.

St r a i g h t after       picking the two young             lads out from u n d e r n e a t h the

crash barrier,             I w a lked over to the           partition fencing        s eparat ing    pens

    s q u a s h e d up together all ar o u n d there was still                     this   clearing      in the

    middle,      I leant on the fence for a moment                         to catch m y breath,          then

    t urned a r o u n d and w a l k e d a couple of            paces       back towards the           crash

    barrier whe n                called over to me to help him from across                            the other

    side    of the    clearing.         As    I a p p r o a c h e d him    I saw a pile of bodies from

    the front fence         back to position 2 on the diag r a m of pen 3 shown to

    me.     I saw one m a n      lying on the terracing                   just behind this        pile of

    bodies.     He a p p e a r e d to me to be o b v i o u s l y dead.               He was    lying on his

    back wit h his head nearest                the back      of the        pen.     He was a white ma n           in

    his thirties,        of stocky build,            but    I can't        remember a n y t h i n g    else

    about    him or his       clothing.         His face was a purple blue                  colour a n d I

    think he was        clean shaven.            I only     looked at him for a very short

    time.I    then saw a m a n        lying on top of other bodies                    in position 2,

    face    down.     I then saw a St Johns a m b u l a n c e m a n               inside the    pen and

    toget h e r we drag g e d the ma n off the bodies                      onto the t e rracing behind.

    The man was un c o n s c i o u s an d was          having great diffi c u l t y           in breathing.

    I put my finger         in his m o u t h to make           sure that          he didn't swal l o w his

    tongue and turned his head to the side.                          The St Johns a m b u l a n c e m a n

    then a s k e d me    if I knew what           I was doing and            left me to go and help

    others.      I stayed w i t h the man a n d throu g h o u t the time                    I was w i t h him

    he con t i n u e d to breathe,           though this was very heavy a n d                 d i f ficult    for

    him.     T he man was a white male                in his     late t w e n t i e s,    very large      build,

    about    18 stone,      6'    tall,      wearing a white   tee shirt a n d grey trousers.
                                                                               -------------
    He had very very short              hair,      fairish to brown in colour, almo st as

"   short as a skinh e a d cut.               I c a n ’t remember          his footwear and           I remember .

    he was    clean shaven.            All a r o u n d me     people were giving m o u t h to m o u t h

    r e s c u s i t a t i o n to others an d everyone was             running a r o u n d trying         to

    help.     G r a d u a l l y the   pen started to clear as more and more                       people got

    out onto the        pitch.        Bodies were being            carried out by the fans a n d

                  carry this man out onto the                 pitch,    where     by now the ambul a n c e s           had

                  arrived.        We then got the help of another St Johns a m b u l a n c e m a n a n d a

                  P o l i c e m a n or fireman an d together we           carried the m a n out of the

                  terrace and       laid him on the floor              just behind the g o a l.             We had

                  c arried the m a n face down a n d we               lay him on his stomach an d were

                  i m m e d iately joined by the medics               from the ambulances,              who we     left the

                  m a n with.      We w a l k e d a w a y to the edge of the            18 yard box an d I d i d n ’t

                  see what      happe n e d to the m a n from then on.                We there met up w i t h ______

                  and all     three of us broke             down   in tears     because      of the s e v e r i t y of the

                  incident and we sat on the                 pitch for a mi n u t e       or so.

                  We then decided that we w o u l d go back a n d see                     if we       could hel p anyone

                  else.     We w a l k e d towards      the goal and        I saw a young             lad lying      on his

                  back,    just    on the six yar d area.              He was unconscious,             m o t i o n l e s s an d

                  was   ob v i o u s l y dead,   although      I didn't     check for a pulse as he w a s n ’t

                   ound a Police        nylon      coat on the        pitch nearby and placed this over the

                  young    lads face.                a nd    I were    still    together,       but we had lost

                          again.      We then w a l k e d away towards the                right hand side of the

                  18 y a r d box, as you face the stand.                  I did not see the young                  lad again,

                  On the edge of the             18 yar d box on this side             I saw anot h e r young man

                  who was o b v iously dead.           There were a few people                 standing a r o u n d him,

                  but none were trying             to revive him as he was obv i o u s l y dead.                    He was a

                  a blue V necked         "Slaaenger type" thin nylon pullover and blue jeans.

                  I think he had a shirt on also,                  though      I c a n ’t remember what            type or

                  colour.       His face was        s l i ghtly blue and his           lips were dark           blue.        I

                  pulled his       pullover       up so that       it covered his face.               There was. an

                  advertisement        hoarding      just     nearby on the         pitch so ______ a n d        I and

three or four other me n placed him on this and carried him acr o s s                                 the

pitch an d out        into the a r e a between the S o u t h S t a n d and S p i o n H o p and

eventually         into the g y m n a s i u m by the first door we            came to.        Inside

the g y m n a s i u m we were       i mmediately told to        lay the man out by a m a n               in

a suit who was         carrying a       radio.     I remember       that there were           three or

four    bodies      already    laid out       in the gym at this time a n d we               put him

down on the         end of the       line,    laid from head to toe.             We then made our                  ;

w a y to the doors to get out to see                if we    could help anyone            else a n d we            ;

could not       leave for a few minutes            because      of the stream of          people

carrying      dead bodies       in.     Whe n we finally got outside              the gym n a s i u m

more    b o d i e s were    being    carried ar o u n d so we helped to carry one or

p o s sibly two more         into the gym.        I cannot      remember any d e s c r i p t i o n s      of

these further         bodies    that    I helped to carry as everything was

h a p p e n i n g so fast.

We then w a l k e d back out onto the             pitch a n d    I saw a number of Liverpool j

fans    running towards the N o t t i n g h a m F o r r e s t     fans end,       but his was

stop p e d w hen a cordon of Police was formed across                       the pitch.         We then

w a l k e d back to the goal are a at the L e p p i n g s Ln end to see                    if we    could

help anyone         else,    but everyone was       being a t t e n d e d to.                a n d I then          ,

w a l k e d onto    the terracing,          w hich by now was      vir t u a l l y empty     and stood             H

there for five or ten minutes.                   We were    then joined by                            and

        , and                          called to us from the West S tand above.                      The

five of us g a t h e r e d together           just outside      the ground       in L e p p i n g s Ln

where    I saw Police a n d fire engines and ambulances.                         We w a i t e d for a

few minutes         to see    if any of our other friends w o u l d turn up.                     They

d i d n ’t so we made our wa y back to the              cars where we found that                 they

had been waiting.             All    nine of us were safe.            We had left the ground

of our own acc o r d and a r r i v e d back at the              cars at a p p r o x i m a t e l y 5. 0 0 p m

(1700).       We then drove          back    to Liverpool.

W h e n I was at the m a t c h        I was wearing a red round necked plain T-~

               shirt,       s t o n e w a s h e d blue jeans,   black New Bala n c e   training   shoes.        I am

              a white man,            5 ’10 tall,     dark    brown straight   h a i r, wit h a side     parting,

               cut above        the    collar,    of me d i u m build.

               I feel       that the Police an d em e r g e n c y services were          very slow to r e a ct

              to the tragedy and even w h e n they did try to help there was                        no

              organisation,            just   complete       chaos.   Also man y of the Police      inside       the

              ground did not even atte m p t                 to help the injured or dead even w h e n the

              s e v e r i t y of the     incident was apparent.

               I also       believe     that the d e c i ^ f o n to open the    concertina gates was the

               correct one.            However,     i^r Is obvious     to me that w h e n this was done          the

              tunnel        should have       men     blocked by Police an d the fans should have

              been sent to the side               terraces.

                                                                                                         SI G N E D

                  Furt he r    to my stateprent made            on 11th June              1989    (110689),,      as    previously

                  stated.      I took^tfp my m atch viewing                position         in pen number          three at
S - O d .
                  about    one minute       to t h ree       (1439).     The    players were             still    having a kick

                  about    on the      pitch    prior    to the kick off.                 I have again ma rk ed this

                  p osition on the separate              scaled drawing              of    pens    three and four,              using

                  the -Figure one.         A l t h o u g h my position was               close    to a crush barrier,                 I

                  was    not aware that         there was a crush barrier                       there when       I took       up my

                  position,         due to the amount          of   people      packed          into the area.          1 had no

                  sooner      taken up this       position,         when     I a ss i s t e d a girl        standing          by me,

                  as detailed         in my previous          statement.         I a ss i s t e d this girl            for

                  somethin g        like three    to four minutes.              At       this    time,    I was    still

                  s ubjected to an excessive                 crush.    S ud d e n l y the        pressure    eased off me

                  and    I was able to move again.
                                                                                                                     PAGE
                                                                                                                     S2400A



            I i m m e d i a t e l y became aware           of a clearing           in the    crowd behind my          right

            shoulder.         Upon seeing          this    clearing          I ushered the girl        towards       it,    as

            there was more             room.      The   clearing was a half moon shape,                    stretching

            back about          seven to eight            feet.    This       clearing would have          been behind

            the      crush barrier          to my right.          To    the best      of my r ec ollection the

            time at that            point woul/S have been about                   five minutes       past    three

            (1505).         I cannot       posi ti ve ly    remember          if the game was still           in progress

            or n o ^ * I mmediately after                 seeing       the    clearing     in the   crowd,     1 saw a

6   P\£-p   p ii e   of     p e o p l e / u n de rn ea th a collapsed          crush b a r r i e r . The   people were

            pi led(on th^r terraces.                There was          nobody else       between myself and the

            b a r r i eV—       that    point.      The    left    hand s ta ntion of the           crush barrier had

            come      c ompletely out of the ground and the                         left    hand horizontal          bar

            had broken away from the                    stantion,        having     been bent forwards          from the

            extreme         left.    1 cannot       comment a c c u r a t e l y     on the    central      barrier     but

            as best         I remember the          central       barrier       had broken away from the

            s ta ntion as well.                I feel      that    by nature        of the shape       of the

            clearing         in the     crowd that         both sections           of the    crush barrier,

            left      hand and       central,       w o ul d have       broken awa y at       the same       time,    which

            tothe     best      of my knowledge w ould have been five                        or six minutes          past

            three      (1505-1506).               I cannot    be more accurate about the exact                       time.

            I do not         remember       the game       being stopped,           neither    do   I recall     the

            m oment        that Peter B E A R D S L E Y hit the              crossbar.       Having    seen this

            c ollapsed        barrier       I. saw two      lads who         had their      Legs tangled up in

            the stan tion           that    had    come awa y from t.hp nround                   I immediately

            went     to their assistance,                 together with                          and others and we

            m a n a ge d    to untangle        their      legs and tr^ey act up and walked away.

            Fol lo wi ng      this     I wa lk ed across          to the dividing           fence   between     pen

            three and          pen two for a rest and get my breath back.                              Whilst    by the

            fence      I remember          looking      onto the        pitch.       The game was stop pe d by
                                                                                             PAGE
                                                                                             S240QA

             then        and the    players were    off the   pitch.   I w ould estimate   the   time

             at this       point    to be maybe    ten or twelve minutes   past three   (1510-

             1512)   .

•First coach           c h e c ke d.    As we were an official                Supp or te rs Clu b the

Po l i c e seemed s a t isfied that we were                      genuine      supporters,       and    let us

through.          The only other              delay was a slow moving              line of t raff i c

approaching            Sheffield.



We saw some            supporters        drinking        o u t s i d j-/a pub near to the ground.

Others        were drinking            in the vac>qity/of               the turnstiles      but   nobody was

cir u n k .



I d o n ’t know exactly where we                       parked,    but     I can remember        it was    near

to a Police Stat i o n and                shops,       large     stores     like Halfords and Gateway:

I also         remember      there was a dual              c arriageway and walking             under a

railway         bridge     to the       ground.



There were            plenty of Police about                but we knew the way to the ground

and d i d n ’t need any directions.                       There was        no fighting      or disorder

just     general        high spirits.



We a r r i v e d at       the entrance           to the g r o y f r n at 2.3 0     pm ( 14-30) , there were

no queues         there      just a mass          of    people    from the turnst i1es to the

gates.          I didn't       see or     receive any directions                 from Police      or Stewards

outside         the turnstiles.               We e p e r i e n c e 6.     eat diff i c u lt y   in finding an

entry         point    to the turnsti les                                      began to suffer          from an

                           and he was          shouting        for my help.        He said he couldn't

br e a t h and        repeating        that    he had to get            out of here.      We shouted          to a

m o u n t e d P o l i c e m an to help,          e ventually he made           some   room for us to take

              to the    r i ght-hand side           of the turnstiles,            wpere   there was a

          back and saw the gates                  being    closed again.            I wasn't asked for my

          ground      I knew where          to go and wasn't            looking        for any d i re ci to n signs.

          I used the tunnel              last year and went             straight        to    it.     There ware      no

          S t e w a r d s or Police at           this    point./The         tunnel      was    quite    free of

          people.          We   pushed our way Xse a place K1                   on your       grid.     The   players

          were     on the       pitch wa r/lni ngy'u p .     i4e were trying            to keep our feet when

          there was a surge and we were                     pushed      right      down to the front           of Pen

               We s i gnalled to                to    come and help us with                peopie      coming       out   of Pen

                'hree w hich he did.



               The    first few        people       out   of the Pen were            exhausted,        and   lay on the

               grass      on the side         of the      goals.       The      lad who was      in front          of

               earlier,       was     being    crushed up against                the fence.       We    climbed the fence

               to try and           reach him but         c o u l d n ’t.     We went    back to the gate to help

               the Pols.ce pull          people       out    of the Pen until            other    officers arrived.



               We    began helping           ip-J^red people          by carrying        them    in our arms            to the

               St,    J o h n ’s A m bulance        people     for    treatment.

               w hite     top and denim Jfeajprls,            His     face was white.            There was          no m ov ement

               in him at all and he was                   just    left on the ground.



               H oa rding     board began appearing,                  so we split        up to help the             injured

               onto       the makeshift        stretchers and began                carrying      p eople, with other

               supporters           across    the    pitch to the far             corner   Detween the N S tand and

               Spion K o p ,         Police    had formed a line across                  the    pitch which made               it

               difficult       to get through w ith the                      injured.    Other Police          in front of

               the    line were getting              in the way as they didn't                  seem to know what was

               going on.



               We made       many trips across              the field with the             injured,      lifted them off

others we re d e a d .           We   cleared some boar ds at                   the Leppings L.N! e n d , to

make way for am am bu la nc e                 that was trying             tovfjet through.             At   no t ime

was John McBR I E N with us,                  nor did we see him                in the ground.



There was a loudspeaker anno u nc em en t                     telling           people    that    the game had

been a b a nd o n e d and w ould they/leave                  the ground quietly.



We had a walk ar o u n d the g r o u n d                to find our friends and event ua ll y

The queues at the              phone        boxes were     terrible,            so we saw some          fans

knocking          on doors asking            residents     if they         could use their             phones.        We

deci d e d    to do the same.                I was with                                  at this stage.

T hey were         terraced houses            near to the        railway        bridge.      At the second

house a girl asked us                 if we wanted to use                 the    phone w hich we accepted.

1 m a n a g e d to phone         through to a friend who                   lives    close to my home             to

tell   my mother           I was alright,          as    I got      no    reply from our          phone      number.

       rang an aunt            to say he was alright.



We finally got            back    to the bus about 5. "10 pm.                    (1710)    John M c B R I E N was

 At      1.45      pm a p p r o x i m a t e l y ,             I went        back        out     onto      the     pitch       and     I was

 'i m m e d i a t e l y     aware          that         there        was    already           a good        number       of    people           in

  the     ground          and        the    day*s          work       had      begun.

  At £ . 0 0       pm a S t e w a r d               pointed          out    to me        a group          of 3 or 4 L i v e r p o o l

  supporters              that        were          seated          in the       front        of    the S o u t h       Stand.            I,knew

  that     with        it    being          a       capacity          crowd       that        there       w as    no    chance        of

  transferring               them          into         another           part    of     the       ground,        so    I decided            to

  speak       to    them         and       found         that        they were           from Northern                 Ireland        and

  seemed         decent          lads.              I advised             them    to     take       off     their       Liverpool

  scarves          and      told       them          very       firmly         t ha t    should        Liverpool             score,        not

  for    them       to      jump       up       cheering             as    this    would           cause     problems          and        I would

  have      to     eject         t h em.            I   continued           walking           up a n d      down my          beat     and       as

  such     striking              up    several             short          conversations              with        people       on    the      first

group        of P o l i c e        officers          moved          up     into     South          Stand         to    remove         some

that        I could        smell         was    alcohol-,            people         were         not      and     sweating            heavily,

clearly a            lot      of    th e       supporters                were    drunk        and         i n t e n t on     violence.

water,        giving          people           a drink         from         p a p e r cups.

Stanley James Croot, Police Constable 1079,

Headquarters Training Department, Ecclesfield.



At 9.15am, Saturday, 15 April 1989, I arrived at Sheffield Wednesday Foothill

Club, Hillsborough, to perform uniform duties in connection with the semi-final

between Liverpool and Nottingham.    I had been pre-wamed that I was on Serial

I, which is a duty performed on the running track of the pitch, under the

supervision of Police Sergeant Chapman ('F1 Division Plain Clohtes) and Inspector

Darling.   I had performed this duty on a number of previous occasions and was

familiar with the overall plan and general 'set up1 at Hillsborough.

Due to the large number of Officers on duty that day, I got a warm drink and took

my place in the North Stand in preparation for the briefing.    I quickly identified

other members of my Serial, and Police Sergeant Chapman was checking people off.

At ^45am, all Officers were briefed by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and a

number of other senior Officers, followed by an Intelligence briefing by Detective

Sergeant Charlesworth.    After the briefing we were all supplied with a light packed

meal and instructed that all Officers should be on their points by no later than

II.15am, a point that was emphasised.

At 11.00am I took up position on the pitch midway between the player's tunnel

and the E Stand Spion Kop.    I don't recall the exact time but I remember thinking

that the spectators were entering early, and I took this as a good sign that the

turnstiles were open early, rather than the often hurried hunt up of turnstile

operators to open ip and get people off of the streets.   I remained in this position

doing a general patrol between player's tunnel and E Stand.    During that time

I saw several V.I.P. guests arrive and talked generally with the cameramen/press/

sports personalities/T.V. people.

Between 1.20pm and approximately 1.45pm, I had a cooked meal in the gymnasium

behind the North Stand.

At 1.45pm approximately, I went back out onto the pitch and I was immediately

aware that there was already a good number of people in the ground and the day's
                                      - 2 -


work had begun.

At 2.00pm, a Steward pointed out to me a group of 3 or 4 Liverpool supporters

that were seated in the front of the South Stand.     I knew that with it being a

capacity crowd that there was no chance of transferring them into another part

of the ground, so I decided to speak to them and found that they were frcm Northern

Ireland and seemed decent lads.     I advised them to take off their Liverpool scarves

and told them very firmly that should Liverpool score, not for them to jump up

cheering as this would cause problems and I would have to eject them.     I continued

walking up and down my beat and as such striking up several short conversations

with people on the first few rows.     This was a policy that Chief Superintendent

Mole had encouraged that I think he rightly believed set the atmosphere on what

should have been an enjoyable pleasure activity for the fans.     I remsmber asking

one young man who told me he was frcm London what he had paid for his ticket,

he said £50.00 and I believed him, although I said something to him like, 'You

must be mad.'     I quickly spotted a good number of Liverpool supporters in the

South Stand and I tried to get round them all, advising them about cheering.

They all seemed to understand, but it was at the back of my mind that this could

cause problems, but I knew that cross transfer was inpossible.

At 2.30pm I remember looking at my watch to see how the numbers were going.        I

was surprised to see both the Kop and the South Stand apparently full, but Liverpool

accommodation only half full.     The centre pen on Leppings Lane was three quarters

full (plus) but lots of room in the stands and the wings.

Just after 2.30pm, I noticed that the upper level of the elevated terrace (NW)

was getting quite full and they had started with the pushing wave.     I thought

how stupid they were and how easily it was for someone to get seriously hurt.

It's a problem that we have with all of the big clubs that visit us, but fortunately

a problem we managed to overcane with our own supporters. It started when the

new Kop was opened and at that time I was employed on Video Camera duties in the

Police Control.    We spent a long time trying to identify.the culprits that were

starting the wave, and we dealt with it by putting several Officers at the back,
                                     - 3 -


which resulted in many ejections and arrests.    We seemed to have cracked that

problem within a few heme games and the same went for obscene chanting.    We seemed

to be lucky as far as racist chants go, even though we have had black players,

but we have always had a policy of 'firm but fair1.

Just after that time (still just after 2.30pm), I remember thinking that the

Liverpool train must be late or something, because of the lack of numbers in the

Liverpool end.    I walked down to Police Constable Holmes, who I saw had a radio.

He said that there had been loads of bother outside the ground, I think he said

that they had wrecked a pub somewhere.

By this time the supporters were baiting one another from one end to the other

and the atmosphere wasn't good, some people seemed particularly bitter when chanting.

I said to quite a few, 'Do that again and you're out.'     I considered taking one

out as an example to see if it would settle them down, but every time I had strong

words with one, his mates would plead with me that they would look after him.

I had to speak very firmly to seme Notts lads in the South Stand, the noise was

so great now that I was having to shout at the top of nty voice. They were using

obscene chants and baiting the Liverpool fans.    Seme were starting to put their

legs over the wall as if to get to the Liverpool end and I thought that if these

identify the Liverpool supporters in this stand there will be seme big problems.

The atmosphere was getting tense in all areas now and I thought that the game

had better get started soon or we will have a problem.     It was then it went through

nty mind that there should be seme pre-match entertainment on the pitch.   All these

people encapsulated here and nothing for them to do.     I was surprised that the

big advertising people didn't lay something on, but I thought that the pitch quality

was more important to the game.    I wasn't sure, but I feel as I always have that

if you allow the crowd in early you need to entertain them.

At 3.00pm, sometime about kick-off time (it could have been just before) I saw

Liverpool fans walking on the running track behind West Stand goal and across

to the North Stand seating.   They were jumping over the wall, but they then started

to come back.    I immediately thought that there was going to be a pitch invasion.
                                                                                       '-iO'L.
                                      - 4 -


I hadn't a radio so I couldn't monitor what was going off.       I saw more of them

behind the goal but there was quite a few Police Officers there, no-one seemed

to be hurrying with anything, I just couldn't work out what was going off.         I

remember feeling quite angry, thinking, 'What the bloody hell is going off, get

them arrested or get them back in the terraces.'       I thought shall I go up and

see what's the matter, but by this time the crowd behind me had seen the fans

invading the pitch.     The Notts fans were seething and all I could hear was, 'We'll

never get back into fucking Europe.'     'Those cunts again, fucking Heysell again.'

The Notts fans were shouting to me directly now, 'Stop the bastards.'       They were

pointing to the goal.    None of us, including the fans, had any idea what was going

off.   I thought if I move from here these fans will be across the wall and then

we have got the Birmingham situation all over again, but I think that this one

has got the potential to be a lot worse.       I knew I was only one man, but I seemed

to be holding them back, I was pleading with the fans to sit down and calm down.

Somewhere in the middle of this I saw a senior Officer run on to the pitch and

stop the match.   I thought it will take ages to get this lot sorted out.      I remember

feeling the most frightened I have     ever felt in my Police Service.    I envisaged

several thousand people caning out onto the pitch and there being one almighty

massive public disorder situation which would clearly lead to the loss of life.

I thought it was only a matter of time before they were caning over the wall.

A few Liverpool supporters ran down my side of the running track baiting my stand.

I went between them and persuaded them to turn back, it was going against the

grain not to have arrested them but I thought if I do, my stand will be over.

I probably used foul language in my attempt to turn them back.

It seems petty now but I have this thought of curbing my language when I remembered

seeing a sound boon from one of the T.V. cameras.

A Sergeant and Police Constable walked past me from the Leppings Lane end and

I asked, 'What's going off up at the top end?'      One of them said, 'I don't know

but there's loads of bobbies up there.'       I wish now that I had relied on my

instincts and gone and looked for myself.      I have this awful feeling that I may
                                      - 5 -


have been able to have helped.     I have this feeling that I am one of the Officers

that the press have mentioned 'standing about doing nothing'.

I remember seeing the players looking confused and hanging around on the pitch.

One of the linesmen or the referee rounded them up and steered them into the tunnel.

I remember one of them examining sane scratches on his arm, I thought that one

of the supporters must have attacked him.     I reflected what animals we were dealing

with.

At 3.05pm/3.10pm approximately, I saw several fans caning over the Leppings Lane

end fences and start to walk across the pitch, one or two make a run.     I can't

understand why the Police Constables aren't stopping them moving forward.     My

first idea of the problem (gross understatement) was when an ambulance rushes

onto the pitch and pulls up behind the goal.     I then see people climbing onto

the top of it, which was only confirming my views of the animals we were dealing

with.    Shortly after that I saw soneone being carried on one of the advertising

boards across to the ramp near to the 0 gate. Several bpbbies were now caning

onto the pitch and in a very orderly file walking along the track of the North

Stand.

Still my thoughts are focused intently on a massive pitch invasion and have we

enough Officers to deal with it.    Several Officers are now caning onto the pitch,

but they are all going up to the far end.     I think they want more even spreading.

Sane fans rush down towards me shouting, 'Murdering Bastards, you've killed my

fucking brother.'   I say sanething like, 'What are you talking about' and I am

told then that there must be a dozen people dead.    Saneone shouts to clear the

running track for the ambulances.    The photographers have dumped all their gear

on the track and I start to pick it up to make way for the ambulance, but the

first one drives straight across the pitch, so I just throw the rest to the side,

thinking how stupid I was thinking about these blokes' equipment when it now looked

as if life really had been lost.

Several groups were now caning forward towards the Notts fans, baiting them, shouting

at Police Officers, 'Murdering Bastards, Murdering Bastards.'    I pleaded with
                                      - 6 -


them to turn back, most did, but I have never seen such anger on such a large

scale before.   I tried to appeal to the Notts fans, telling them that the situation

was very serious, people had lost their lives.     All I can remember is people shouting

back, 'The Bastards deserve to die, good fucking riddance.'     One Liverpool supporter

ran right up to the goal (Spion Kop end), he had no shirt on, a supporters, scarf

around his wrist, I think he had a flat cap on.     My crowd were shouting to me

directly, 'Get him, get him.     You'd better fucking get him before we do.'   I was

glad no Police Officer ran onto the pitch and chased him, that's just what the

crowd wanted.   When he was caught there was a massive cheer from the crowd.

Liverpool supporters were now rushing round the ground, pulling off advertising

boards and this was really winding the crowd up.     I tried to explain, I thought

it would calm them down.     I again heard something like, 'Another fucking Heysell,

them cunts.'

The Notts supporters saw the Liverpool supporters swing on the goal cross bar,

it looked as if they were trying to smash it.     Then they saw the nets being taken

down.   We all, including me, thought that they were being stolen, but it seemed

so unimportant now, but the Notts supporters were insensed.     I heard, 'They all

ought to fucking die.'     Many shout, 'We'll never get back in Europe.'   'What time

will the game start?'    I couldn't believe that people were asking such pathetic

questions.

Seme Police Officers started to form a cordon across the pitch, it was very thin

at first, a bit one sided.     I joined it on the left flank but more Officers joined

it and it started to look like the real thing.     Chief Inspector Price appeared

from somewhere on my left and he got the cordon shaped up, looking something like,

and we started to move forward sweeping the Liverpool supporters back to their

own half, who were by then intent on causing serious bother with the Notts

supporters. We were careful not to link up just in case we had to defend ourselves

against the supporters rushing at us.

The Liverpool supporters (some of them) I could see were in shock and had lost

all control, they were baiting the crowd and didn't appreciate the overwhelming
                                      - 7 -


numbers that could descend upon them.     A group of Police Officers moved up into

South Stand to remove sane Notts supporters who were shouting abuse at Liverpool

fans.     All that I could smell was alcohol, people were hot and sweating heavily,

clearly a lot of the supporters     were drunk and intent     on violence.

A lot of the ones in shock were     sitting on the floor,     they lookedharmlessand

we left them.     People were rushing about with buckets of water, giving people

a drink fron paper cups.

By this time I had got close to the goal and I could see the size of the problem,

bodies were laid about everywhere but saneone seemed to be helping everyone, Doctors,

Police Constables or ambulance with each.     I could hear the Public Address System

but it was irrpossible to hear what was caning over, the noise was immense.

Our cordon broke up as an announcement went over to clear the ground, I can't

be sure I heard this or saneone     just passed it along.

Chief Inspector Price sent two or three Police Constables to find drinking water

for the Police Officers.     I remember him saying these Police Constables are in

shock as well, they are going to need water soon and plenty of it.       How right

he was.

I can't remember the scene at the fence too well at all, even though I was there

for some time.     All I can remember is people were vindictive to the Police.      People

started to leave the ground slowly, their heads half turned back like ghouls wanting

to have that last look.     My thoughts weren't very charitable towards them.

I was taking the opportunity to snatch a drink myself now as I looked around to

see if I could help anywhere.     I spotted my own Inspector from the Training

Department, Inspector Purdy.     He had lost his cap, he looked dishevelled, he was

tired out I could see that.     I asked him how he was, as he did me.

I heard the radio shouting for Officers to clear Leppings Lane, there was fighting

outside.     Inspector Purdy quickly got three Serials together, I don't think that

the Officers belonged to that Serial, they just formed in to help.      They were

instructed to move the Liverpool fans back out into Halifax Road.       I stayed with

Inspector Purdy trying to clear the fans out of the back of Leppings Lane terracing.
                                      - 8 -


They were bitter and very angry towards us.     I remember one saying to us, 'I'm

a Liverpool P.C., you want to learn about crowd control.'     I didn't say anything

to him I just tried to avoid him, I put it down to shock.     Although I did think

what idiot would go and stand in that lot on a day off, he can't be right in the

first place.

We met one Police Constable, tall, slim bloke with a black moustache (I don't

know him).     He was openly crying, really distraught, all he would say was, 'Why

wouldn't they move back?'    A Doctor cane up to us and said this man was in shock,

he shouldn't be left alone, can't saneone stop with him.     The Doctor was in a

similar state himself, but he was still managing to keep going.    A Police Officer

joined the distraught Police Constable and we saw them walk back in the direction

of the gymnasium.     I was in something of a daze myself by this time and I made

my way back to the gymnasium.

I heard radio messages to the effect that there was fighting in Hillsborough Park

but many units responded and no further assistance was ordered.     I went back to

the North Stand to re-group, as we anticipated being used for many other duties

that day.

I can recall sitting around for quite sane time in the North Stand and eventually

bewing briefed, I think by Chief Inspector Beal.    Chief Superintendent Mole came

across the pitch towards us and I think I heard him say to get these men off hone,

they have done their bit for today.    I was only too glad to go, but because I

was very familiar with the football ground and its duties I went round to the

gymnasium to see if I could help, but things looked very organised and considering

the enormity of the situation I considered it looked a very professional set up.

I retired fron duty at approximately 6.45pm.

If I look back on the situation now, I can only believe that even when the Police

were faced with a tradgedy of such enormity, that it was only the professionalism

of the Force that prevented the deaths of further persons, the obvious consequences

of a massive pitch invasion.

The following day I was engaged on relative reception at Forbes Road Church Hall,
                                                                                     1

and Coroners Enquiries under the supervision of Superintendent Sleath.

Question 8:

I have attended football matches at Hillsborough for the past six years and I

have been engaged on all duties, but in the main I have performed duties as Video

Camera Operator in the Control Box, and Serial 1 on the pitch.   During my time

as Camera Operator, I have been on duty at previous semi-finals and large games

and although I have not had the opportunity to view these videos I could make

a comparison if required to do so in respect of crowd behaviour at Leppings Lane.

Addendum:

For information:   I have since been back to Hillsborough Police Station Box and

given advice to Lord Justice Taylor and Mr Deer, Chief Constable of West Midlands

Constabulary, as to the equipment controls at that location.

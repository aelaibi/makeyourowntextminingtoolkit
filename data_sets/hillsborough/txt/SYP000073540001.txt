friends,                         ! and                                                 I travelled              by     car      to

Sheffield         to    see     th e F . A C u p        semi-final            between Liverpool                      and

Not t i ng h a m Forest             at    the H i l l s b o r o u g h G r o u n d .           My    t i c k e t had           been

obtained         direct       from A n f i e l d a nd was                 for J m e      Lappings Lane                terrace and

cost     six     p o u nds-         The     only      travel        delays       we    encountered              en     route         to

Sheffield         Were       du e    to a m o t o r          cytcLe a c c i d e n t      on the ii.62 a n d                   for    about

six    mi lent    just       off     the M. 1 j u n c t i o n           there was          slow moving               traf f i c .

The    only      t i m e we     stopped was             for a d r i n k          and     f o o d at a          pub

approximately            three           miles     frorrj^hi^kdersfield.




As we w e r e      driving           into S h e f f i e l d w e           saw a       l a r ge     'home       m a d e ’ sign

indicating         a    parking           a r e a w h i c h was a l l e g e d l y          five m inut es             walk          from

the    ground.          This        was    w h e r e we       parked       our    vehicle,            the      time       then       being

1. 45 p m .      I do    not        know where           the      car     park w a s       located            but    instead          of

five     minutes        walk        it t o o k     a good        three      quarters             of a n       hour    to       reach

the    g r o u n d as we        w a l k e d we        s aw    two     further         large        s i g ns    on the          dual

carriageway            car    parking          that     was      a l 1e g e d l e y    five m in ut e s             walk       to    the

ground.          I would        estimate           that       the     location where                we    parked          our       car

was    not     less     than        one a n d a h a l f          miles      from       the a c t u a l         ground.




A s we    neared        the     ground         I could          see     supporters            congregated             outside

importance            and    compared           to    the    number            of O f f i c e r s     I had       seen       some

distance           away     from      the      ground.           The      mounted/dffieers                  were     attempting

to     repine         the    pressure           on    the    people            at/Xhe        front     of    the     c r o w d as

more     and       more     people         were      becoming           d w r e tr e s s e d .     I wa s a w a r e      that           more

people        were     joing       the      crowd         behind m e .




As     the     pressure       kept         building         im/some             people        were     climbing          up o n t o

number        of     people      Qut^fae            the    turnstiles             to    be       in the     region       of     two          to

three        t h o u s a n d^flmd m o r e       were arriving                  all     the    time.         I did       not     see a n y

near     to     the    turnstiles              to w i t n e s s    any         stewards.            The     nearest          I got           to

them was           someway       to     the     right       of    the      gate        marked       *C * on       the    plan.               My

People        a r o u n d me w e r e        coming more            and more             distressed.               Whilst        I am

used     to     large       crowds         I have         never    before            experienced            one    s u c h as       this.

It w a s      at     about    this         time      t h at ^ / M o u n t e d        Officer        signalled           us    to        go

th e   Mounted Officer,                    /would           estimate            that     we w e r e       probably amongst

the     first        fifty    people           to    go t h r o u g h       the      gate.




We w e r e n ’t p u s h e d        or      forced         through        th e     gate       but    one     could       sense           th e

mass     moving        towards          the     gate,       which         of    course           enabled     those       without

tickets         to    get    into       th e    ground,          and     those         with      tickets        d i d n ’t h a v e           to

As     s o o n as       we    got       passed          the      gate        I could              see     the      t u n n e l a n d JLh e n         the

pitch        became          visible           through           it.         We w e n t           towards          the./urn/ ty b e c a u s e

the     terrace.              We w a l k e d          towards           th e    tunnel             so as          not    to     get     seperated

but     I was a war e              that        the     number           behind were                  increasing               and      the     pace       of

th e    crowd was             starting            to       quicken.             One          or    tw o      people       overtook             us at a

slow      run to get               to     the     tunnel             sooner.




I cannot           say       how m a n y        of     th e      people who                  came       through          th e    gate        did     not

have     tickets             but       people         were asking               for          spare        t i c k e t as        far     b ac k as

the     car       park w h e r e          we    ha d       left       the      car.




We     had    free       passage            through             the     tunnel           as       we w e r e       amongst          the      first        to

reach        that       point.            There        were          no s t e w a r d s           or P o l i c e        Officers          in

evidence .              The       crowd was            still          fairly            good       h u m o u r e d at         th i s    time.

there        was    no       fighting,            drinking,                or a n y t h i n g           of    that       nature         apparent

going        to    see       the       game     owing           to    the      numbers             of     people         in the Pen.                 My

first        im pr e ss io n was               that        there        wa s    no w a y we               could         get     in as        it was

packed        solid.              However,            we m a n a g e d         to       push       our w a y        in to        th e     left

about        three       or       four      yards          but       you     could           hardly          stand       upright.              You

c o u l d n ’t m o v e .           I remember               seeing           the        players           on th e        pitch and             I

noticed           that       A la n H a n s a n was              playing            for L i v e r p o o l           and       I pointed             that

fact      out      to                                  who       replied,               "I    cannot          e v e n see        the      pitch!"

It w a s      then       that          I saw that               he w a s       facing             towards          me a n d a w a y          from        the

tlven at        that        time      people        were       in d i f f i c u l t i e s      and    I remember             two     or

three      people           being       passed        over      ou r    heads       to    the     front,         and    then        over

t he    fe nc e .          I assumed         that       they      had      fainted        or    passed       out.         The       crush

was     the w o r s t        I h av e       ever      experienced.                 It wa s      like     being         pushed        into

a    brick      w a l l,     and      still        more    people were              tring       to    get    into       the Pen.                A

couple         of mi n u t a s        later,        maybe       not     even       that,       t h e r e w as     a massive

surge      from        bjmind         by the        t u n n e l and        I ended        up a b o u t      two     thirds          of    the

way    down         th e    terracing.              I c o u l d n ’t do a n y t h i n g           about      it.        It w a s         just

a massive            force and             I h a d to      go w h e r e v e r       it    t o o k me.        It w a s        useless

to     resist.             Where      I ended         up y o u       c o u l d n ’t m o v e .        You were          just     stuck.

The    only way             I ca n d e s c r i b e        it    is to       liken        it to       cement       setting.               The

pressure            never      c e ased.           T h e r e wa s      no m o b i l i t y      in the       crowd       like        one

normally            experiences.               Y o u ’ re u s e d       to a s u r g e         but    then       it e a s e s       and

you     ca n    regain your                orginal        position,           but    this       never       eased.           Th e

pressure            kept     building          up a n d        up.




It w a s       during        t hi s     time       that    I rece                        injuries.           I did        not       go    to

Hospital            in S h e f f i e l d




It w a s       at    this      t i me      that     I saw       people        passing          out    and    others          in g r e a t

distress.              There       wa s     a small        man       next    to me,         I would         describe          h i m as

were     taller            t h a n him.        He     kept a sk i ng          to    take my arm             off     his      head and

I remember             saying,          “ I c a n ’t.          I c a n ’t m o v e        my arm,"           He    started           biting

then went            motionless,           he    d i d n ’t fall          down,        he      c o u l d n ’t as w e w e r e

packed        so t i g h t l y .        About        two    or    three         m i n u t e s later           I       saw       t h a t his

lips       h ad    gone     blue       through        asphxiation.                 I c o u l d n ’t do                anything

because           I c o u l d n ’t m o v e      to    help       him.




I was       conscious           of     people        being       passed         over      my       h e a d all        the       t i me.        I

was    aware         of a n o t h e r    surge        and     I wa s      pushed another                      couple         of y a r d

further           forward.           I d i d n ’t see         that       man again.




I remember            somebody          b e h i n d me,       roughly about                 where         I ha d           been

standing,           avid he w a s        saying        t h at     somebody was                 dead       o n th e          floor.             The

only       thing      I can       remember           about       that     m a n ’s c l o t h i n g            wa s     that       he w a s

wearing           a dark     coloured           sweatshirt              and    denims.              All       this         time     people

were       still      being       passed        overhead          or     climbing           the      fence.




I was       finding         the a c t      of    breathing              difficult           and      I remember                 thinking

that       I must        remain        calm an d        eventually             the     pressure               would         ease.          I

d o n ’t    remember         passing          out,      but      th e    pressu^            never             eased and             I began

to    panic,          Wher^l^came             t o , I was         by a w a l l         at      ~    ^     h       t    h    e       stand,

outside           the^/^Junt 1 on the                turnstile           side,       near          to th e         staircase              to    the

stand       seati ng area.               When        I came       to     it wa s       as      though             I ’d b e e n a s l e e p

for a       couple        of m i n u t e s      and     had      been woken            up      suddenly.                   I was     aware

of    people         walking         around      and       than     I sa w a         number          of       people         on t h e

ground        being       resuscitated.                 I would          estimate           that        there          were about               six

people        initially           being       attended           to,     but     the      number          g r e w as         more         people

were       brought        out     of    the     tunnel.           T h e y w e r e n ’t c a r r i e d               out      but     rather

dragged           out.      The      numbers         of P o l i c e      Officers           grew and               they         started

giving        first aid           treatment,            but      I d o n ’t r e c a l l            seeing any               of St.

               were    doing.




               I tried           to     resuscitate               two    p e o p l e , the          one     I remember             was    a young          lad

               in his        te e n s ,      probably             fourteen         or    f^jeen                years      of a g e       a n d wa s       slim.

               He    h ad    quite          long       reddish          hair.        He w a s        wearing          denims        but     I d o n ’t

               remember           what       top       he    had      on.      He w a s       still         wearing         his     scarf.

                                             I continued                to a t t e m p t      to     resuscitate              h i m for a b o u t          five

               minutes           u n t il    someone           confirmed what                 I already             k n ew,       that    it w a s

               too    late.




               I helped another,                       a girl,          aged      seventeen            or      e i g h t e e n.     I remember             she

               was    c o n s c i o us       ta k e n a w a y         by a m b u l a n c e .         As     far as       th e      supporters             were

               concerned              e v e r y b o d y wa s       pre~occupied with                      helping         others         and    I did       not

               se e a n y o n e        taking          property          or    commit a ny             criminal          acts.           I eventually

               left    the        ground          of m y       o w n a c c o r d at        approximately                 4.30       pm a f t e r

               nothing           e ls e     that       I could          do.




               Before        I lost          consciousness                  I remember             seeing         the     match      being       halted

               and    th e       two      teams        being       t a k e n off        the       p i tc h .      This      was     because          of    the

               numbers           of    people          who     ha d     got    onto      the        pitch       either        by    climbing          the

               fence        or    going          out    through          the      gates.           A Policeman,               whom       I can

               describe,              was    performing               heroics        pulling           people         out     through          the    gate

               at    the     front          of    the       terrace         but    shortly after                  that      I must        have       passed

               out.

distance          from       the      ground.            There     was     no       segregation             by th e P o l i c e ,

fans    with          no    tickets        were       a l l o w e d g e t            right         up to     the     entrance           to

swell       the       numbers         th e r e .      Thg^ f t e w a r d i n g       arrangements                were     non-

ex i s t a n t , as         far as        I c a j / r e c a l 1 I d o n ’t r e m e m b e r               seeing      one.         The

signposting                was   very j p a a r       in the       ground and               th e    only     visible         point          of

entry       to    the       ter/fjrees wa s           v i a the        t u n n e l , and       the       number      of    the

turnstiles             seemed         insufficient               for    t he    number         of     people att ending                 and

with     people            both sitting              and    standing           having        to     go     through        th e    same

entrance          to       the   ground         to    get    to    the     turnstiles.




I cannot          understand why                   the     pubs    near        to    th e    ground were             allowed           to

o p e n as       it    is a w e l l        known         fact     that w he n         these         pubs a r e       open,

supporters             stop      to     have a drink              and     then arrive               at     the    ground         late.

If    it h a d        been ann oun ced               that    the       kick     off     had        been delayed,            that        may

have    h e l p e d as           people      would         not    have     been        pressured            into     getting           into

the    ground          so    quickly.              This     decision appeared                      to h a v e     been     due     to

lack    of       communication               on      behalf       of    everyone            in a u t h o r i t y .        Obviously

the    authorities                inside        the      ground were            not a w a r e         of    the    situation

outside          the       ground.         If      they     been aware              of w h a t      w as    happening            the

incident          could,          I feel,          have     been managed              effectively.                 As     far a s       the

Police       were          concerned,           I do       not    recall        seeing         any       senior      Officer

taking       overall             command.



The    key       factors         which       I personally               believe         contributed               substantially

to    the    scale          of   the     disaster           are    as     fallows!-

                  Further     to my statement         dated 29th May           1989(290389)             in w h ic h   I

                  d escribe    dealing wit h two d ec eased at the                    rear    of Leppings Ln

                  Terraces.



                    he/first youth          I dealt with     I des cr ib ed as          being         fourteen to fifteen,
                    /
                  svi im , with     long    reddish hair,        wearing denims and a scarf.



                            today viewed M or t u a r y Ph ot o^ /a ph s             of the      people       that    lost      their
OvT
                  lives at Hillsborough,             of these Jths most              likely      is    (Ref           )

£a/ iEf£ a ICi£. (E x h        ) a Photograph          of JoMi McBR IE N         (68)         I have also            viewed a

                  Photograph        of his    clothing,    as worn on 13th April                      1989(150489),
 ioo'i
                  (Ref NA 68)        (Exh           ) and this      closely      resembles            the   clothing        I

                  recall    including        the scarf.
The    second        body    I dealt      with   I rec al l    as   being   a white       male   of   thin

build,       black     hair and a thin moustache,                    I remember     the body

bare     chested,          there may have been a coat or jacket with or near

to the body but              c er tainly not being worn.



I have a gain viewed M o r t u a r y Ph ot og ra ph s and the most                    likely      is Carl

I have a gain viewed a P h o t o g r a p h of the                   clothing worn by RIMMER            on

15th April           1989(150439)         (Ref N A    15)    (Exh         ) the    clothing      is

similar,       except        for the track          suit    top w hich   I d o n ’t recall



B o t h of these           identifi ca ti on s are made         to my best        recollection

and    I cannot        be certain         that they are        correct.



I m e n t i o n a third        person      in my orginal        statement,        a man who was

stood next           to me    in the Pen.           I have viewed Video Footage and

Photographs           but am unable to           identify him.           I cannot    be    certain

that    he    di d    in fact      die.

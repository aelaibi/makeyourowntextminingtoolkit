                  I could see Supt Ma rs ha ll                standing        on the bridge at that                 location.           He

                  was     stood on the wall             of the bridge and s ee me d to be trying                        to get a

                  view of the exterior                of the ground.            U p o n a rr ival        our   Inspector

m o u n t e d officer.         At this       point     there were a number            of fans m il l in g

a b ou t    near    the ground.            S eco nd s a ft er    this we were        d ir e ct e d by Supt

M ar s ha ll    to go into the ground,.                 Although       I did not have a radio               I

s to od with PS H u n t all               the time a nd did not hear any                call     over    the

radio       stating what          had o c c u rr ed    in the ground.             Due to this      both

m y se l f and the m embers               of my serial        thou gh t    that    there was a serious

public order          p roblem       in the ground.             As we a p p r o a c h e d the exit      gate

f ro m the L eppings Lane                 end,   I saw an a m b u l a n c e.       L a i d at the side of

the a m b u l a n c e were        two bodies,         who were      being a t t e n d e d to by P ol ic e

O f f i c e r s a nd A m b u l a n c e    officers.         We then e n te r e d t hr ou gh the gate.

We then a p p r o a c h e d       the entrance         to the tunnel         leading to the

terraces.           At this       en tr an ce    there were n um e ro u s         bodies   laid on the

f l o o r , a number        of P ol i c e O fficer s were           there and numerous L i ve rp oo l

fans,       most    of w ho m were         s tood quietly,         but a small       number were        hurling

a b us e at the P olice and some were s ta t in g a w i s h to go back onto                                 the

t er races      but were       being       p reven te d from doing          so by P ol ic e O fficers.

At this        point we were             still   not a w a re of what        had h a p p e ne d and we went

d ow n the t u n n el.         I went       to the     left of the d i vi di ng         railings a nd met

a colleague          from F2,       I told him there were                 bodies    o ut side    the tunnel

to w h i c h he said there were                  bodies      down on the       terrace.         U p o n hearing

this       I went    down the terrace and m a n g e d to get onto the                       perimeter

track.         At this      point        I r eali se d there had been some sort                  of d i sa st er

but    I thought        it must          have been over.          However,        1 looked to my right

to w he re an a m b u l a n c e was           parked a nd saw o f fi ce rs          pulling      bodies     out

pf the ter race           t hrough        the gate.         U p o n seei ng this     I went      to a ss is t

an d w i th other o f f i ce rs            pulled out 3 to 4 bodies.                 I checked the

bodies       for    signs    of    life but        it was     obvious      they were dead.           S o m e t im e

later       I turned to look onto the                  pitch     in front      of the goal and saw

body after          body laid out           near    to a nd a r o u n d    the touchline.          Of f i ce r s

w h om    I do not know and two fans a s s i s t e d me to garry a body off                                       the

p it ch a nd        round to the gym.              The fans were            trying        to run.      I d o n ’t

think       they realised that              the    person we were             carrying was           dead.        At

the      entr an ce       to the gym       it was       chaos.       Fans were           trying    to get      into

the gym,           most were       hysterical .          O ff i ce r s a s s i s t e d    in gett in g the body

t h r o u g h the door           to the gym a nd         I then      r et ur ne d to the t e r r a c e .            I

m a n a g e d to locate my sergeant.                     It was      still     chaos.        Fans were         j ee ring

at    us,    blaming        us for what          had h a p p e n e d .The re were          no d i r e ct i on s     over

the      radio      so we s tood there.                T hen a senior        officer,         I do not know

not moved.               At this we were          then a b u s e d more        by fans.           T he n an

I n sp ec tor       came to us seconds             later a nd o r de r e d us out of the                    terraces.

I d o n ’t know how              long we stood the re on that                  pitch b ut e v e n t u a l l y           the

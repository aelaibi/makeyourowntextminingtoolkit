1.1     the police deliberately lied about the quality and availability o f video pictures from
        camera 5. The video material which has now been seen is clear and would have changed                     "
        the inquest jury’s view.
1.2     the evidence o f Dr Walker undermines the cut off time for evidence which the coroner
        imposed o f 15.15




2       The Video Evidence:
2.1     The basic complaint here is that there are videos o f what camera 5 showed o f the
        Leppings Lane Terraces (into which the crowd pressed after gate C was opened at 2.52).
        These videos are clear and would have revealed to the police at the time that the pens
        were full. The police, it is alleged supressed evidence o f these tapes, and, at the inquest
        dishonestly suggested that the pictures from camera 5 were unclear.

2.2     The vital times are 2.30pm when the build up outside the ground gathers pace; 2.52pm
        when Gate C is opened letting the build up outside the ground have access to pens 2 and
        3 which were, by then full. At 3.04pm a surge in pen 3 caused barrier 124A to break.
        Between 3:04pm and 3:06pm the police sought to prevent people overflowing onto the
        pitch. By 3.15, all the deceased were found by the coroner to have died.

2.3     There are four relevant tapes:
2.3.1   TB1
2.3.2   TB2
2.3.3   C539
2.3.4   Compilation Tape

2.4     TB1 contains no material from camera 5 before 14.59, and then 5 minutes from 14.59 to
        15.04 [para. 6.5] TB1 was not shown to the jury.
2.5     TB2 switches between four police cameras, including camera 5, at 60 sec. intervals,
        between 11.59 and 15.35 [para. 6.6]. There appears to be no foorage o f the Leppings
        Lane Terraces between 14:23 and 15:02. TB2 was not shown to the jury
2.6     The compilation tape was edited from other footage including TB1 and TB2. It included
        little o f TB1 and TB2. “None o f the TB2 footage from camera 5 after 15.04 was shown
        on it. This compilation was also seen by the jury.” [para. 6.7]
2.7     C539 was prepared by PC Killock and contains most o f the camera 5 footage between
        15.03 and 15.25 [para. 6.12]. This tape was seen by the jury [para. 6.9].


2.8     The basic complaint on the videos appears to be that the police said there perception was
        that the pictures o f the pens from camera 5 were poor whereas in fact they were o f OK
        quality, and the jury were not shown them.The jury were plainly shown some videos
        from camera 5. The reviewing officer suggests that the videos from camera 5 are
        reasonably clear but that the position and angle o f the view from the camera makes any
        assessment o f the overcrowding in the pens difficult if not impossible, [para. 6.10].
2.9    Whether the jury were aware that some o f the shots they saw on the two compilation
       types were from camera 5 is unclear. Only if they were aware o f the fact that they were
       from camera 5 were they in a position to use their view o f the videos to assess the
       evidence o f the police that the quality from camera 5 was such that they disregarded it.
       If the reviewing officers’ evidence is correct, then whilst the quality may have been OK,
       if no view could be formed about overcrowding, understandable that police disregarded
       it.

2.10   On the basis o f the present material, there appears to be no basis for saying evidence was
       suppressed. The heart o f HFSG’s complaint appears to be the material from camera 5
       was deliberately kept from the jury. Whilst not all the camera 5 material was shown to
       the jury, they saw some o f it, and if the reviewing officer is correct it would not have
       been o f great assistance to the police at the time in assessing crowd position in pens 3 and
       4. They should have been told they were seeing some camera 5 material but if it is as
       unhelpful as reviewing officer says, then no basis for saying it would have changed
       anybody’s view.

Dr Walkers’ Evidence:
2.11   This evidence suggests that one o f the victims dies after 15:15. This evidence is contrary
      to all the other evidence given at the time, [see para.8.17] I think there is nothing in the
      new material.


Handling:
2.12 I don’t think the position on the video is quite as clear cut as DPP’s letter suggests, but
       I do agree that there is no adequate evidence o f any police suppression o f the video
       evidence. I think the critical question is: is there video evidence o f the quality o f the
       material from camera 5, which, if the jury had been told about it, might have assisted
       them in a material way in reaching a conclusion about whether police should have known
       o f the overcrowding in the pens.

2.13   I do not think that question necessitates further investigation. It may be that the only rela
       question it raises is: should there be a new inquest, rather than further investigation by
       the CPS.

2.14    I think, if Law Officers are to form a view about new inquest - and nobody has asked
       them yet - they should see TB1 and TB2 to see whether the fact that the jury were not
       told that they were watching camera 5 material (if in fact they were not told, as to which
       inquiries should be made) so vitiates the inquest as to justify a new one. I would o f
       thought it probably did not, but we probably should see the video.

2.15   We should wait HS’s decision on new public inquiry. If he decides not, then view video
       and form a view. If he decided to have a new enquiry, await outcome o f that. If he delays
       a decison, we should wait.

2.16   Once we have made decision, I share DPP’s view that our three offices (HO, CPS and
       Law Officers) should meet the relatives. We probably will not persuade them. But they
will have had an opportunity to put their case, and the case is so awful that a sense they
had not been able to see someone they felt might help might simply prolong their sense
o f grievance. Level at which we see them can be discussed.

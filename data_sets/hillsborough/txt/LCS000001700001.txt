   Seek no one man for the theft
   Of our treasure trove
   As the song says no one man
   Should ever walk alone
   Trust in the Lord Jesus Christ
   To apportion the blame
   For the theft of our jewels
   That where there to watch a game
   The most precious jewels
   On this Earth
   Are not silver, gold or stone
   They are the loved ones

The terror shook my mind.                                                        the beautiful people
People dying, injured,                           Lonely Night
Gasping for breath they could not              Words of Sadness
                               find.
The memories of those 95,                 What is this place called
Are always in my mind.                    Where trees are green
The prayers I utter from my lips,         And lights are bright
are words I cannot find,                  and wonderous
And as I sing ‘Abide with Me’             and never ending.
I sit and cry at home.                    Are the flowers always blooming
But one thought for the victims,          and the sun forever shining

                                          Shall we meet again                    When the Lord decided to take you
Two years since, one April day,           and hold each other close once                                   all away
Memories still won’t fade away,           as before.
Memories fresh and oh so clear,          And all those things left unsaid        So rest in his arms now
Of people suffering oh so near,           Can now be spoken                      As our lives carry on

Even after all this time,                 Let me know                            To sing and to cheer
To be alive seems such a crime,           If this is so,                         Our Liverpool lads and our club
But without some hope, that we           And if there is a thing called                                     so dear

        Dear Reader,


       As you will see there is a questionnaire enclosed with this
       edition of Hillsborough Interlink. The questionnaire has been
       designed by the National Institute for Social Work who have been
       given a grant by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation to study the
       effectiveness of the services set up after the disaster.

       The aim of the study is to find out the views of people who have
       been affected by Hillsborough. It will try to identify the
       difficulties people experienced, the help they received from
       whatever source, and whether the services offered were able to
       meet their needs. Your contribution to this study will help to
       ensure that Social Services and other organisations may have a
       better understanding of people's needs following such an event.

       Most of the questions can be answered by ticking a box or
       circling a number. Please answer all the questions, even though
       some may seem more relevant than others. Please return the
       questionnaire in the attached prepaid envelope.

       A n y i n f o r m a t i o n y o u g i v e w i l l of c o u r s e be t r e a t e d
       confidentially. There is no method of identifying individuals
       from the questionnaire, and no information will be published
       which could be traced back to an individual.

       This research is entirely independent of Interlink. We agreed to
       help circulate the questionnaire, as this seemed the most
       effective method of reaching those affected by the disaster. We
       feel that it is important that as many lessons are learnt from
       what happened at Hillsborough as possible. We do hope therefore
       that you will feel able to respond to the researcher's request to
       complete the questionnaire.


       With thanks

        you give will be treated completely confidentially.

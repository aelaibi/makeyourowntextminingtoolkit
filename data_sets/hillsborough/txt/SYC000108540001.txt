             EIGHTH DAY'S PROCEEDINGS

          WEDNESDAY,   28th NOVEMBER 1990

      THE CORONER:  We are about to set off, as you
know.   I hope the coaches are somewhere!  You are
going in one with Mr. Griffiths, and there will be a
driver as well, of course.   There is a second coach
which will take whoever else wants to come, and then
there will be a car which Mr. Beechey will be driving
and I will follow along behind, so to speak.

     What we are going to do is a little tour first of
all.  We are going to set off from here and we are
going to drive past, but we will not stop - I do not
want to stop and get out on the tour - most of the
pubs that have been mentioned.  The point about it is
not so that you can inspect in detail what those
individual pubs look like, but so that you have got
some idea of (a) where they are in relation to the
ground and (b) you can gauge their size, and so on,
just by looking at them.  But we have not asked any of
the licencees whether we could go in, so I do not
think it would be right that we should just descend on
them with a view to going in.  Secondly, I am not even
sure perhaps whether it would be the right thing to
do.

     So we will be going to, I think it is, 5 or 6
pubs, I cannot remember.  A route has been worked out
and hopefully the drivers will find it.  When we have
done that we will come back and we will stop at
Leppings Lane entrance and you will get out.  With any
luck the doors will have been unlocked. I am sure
they will have been because I think somebody has just
been on the phone to find out what time we will be
arriving.

     Then I would like you to stay together as a
group, but I have told Mr. Griffiths to be 20 or 30
yards from you so that he is far enough away from you
not to be able to hear, but close enough to you if you
want to say, "We have had enough, we want to go back
to the coach", and he is also there as a sort of
shield between you and everybody else.

     I have asked him to say as little as possible on
the journey because he cannot give evidence, he must
not give evidence, and it is better if he says as
little as possible.  He will probably say, "This is
The Owl".  You will probably know it anyway.  The
chances are you will tell him, but do not do that
either because you will remember I said to you talk
about the price of pink elephants, I think I said,
because your deliberations are your deliberations and
it is no business of his to hear what you are talking
about.  So on the coach particularly, where you are in
a confined place, just remember that - all right?

     Then you can have as long as you like in the
ground and, if Mr. Catehpole does not mind my saying
this, you can do whatever you like in the ground.    The
object is that you should look at it from whatever
angle.  This time you will have enough time, and if
you want to walk in and onto the central terraces and
then out again and try the ends if you want to, look
at it from the pitch side, if you want to do it two or
three times it does not matter.    Just do whatever you
want to do.  Try and do it as a group, that is the
only thing I am asking you to d o . When you are all
satisfied that, as far as you can, you have taken it
in, then we will bring you back here and whatever time^
that is, we will have lunch, or whatever you wish to
do, and we will meet again at 2 o ’clock.

     There are one or two other things I want to say.
You will notice that not all the lawyers are here.
This visit is intended for you. You must not, under
any circumstances, draw any conclusion, "Oh, he h a s n ’t
come, so that means something".  It does not mean
anything because, first of all, for all you know they
have already been round to the ground 100 times, and
probably have been round the ground several times.     I
do not know myself, but it would not surprise me at
all.

     Secondly, it does not matter because they are not
doing the view.   The view is the view of the Jury, so
they are perfectly entitled to say, "We don't want to
come" and, in fact, I need not have made arrangements
for them to come.   I could just have said, "Jury
only", full-stop.   In fact, I think that is what I
said last time.   But this time I thought we would have
the facility, so that if they wished to see what you
were doing they could, but it makes no difference and
you must not draw any conclusions, either favourable
or unfavourable because somebody comes and somebody
does not.   It does not matter.

     I have got to come because it is necessary, but I
come apart and separate from you and you may see me,
but hopefully only at a distance.

     I think we are also intending to stop at or drive
past the railway station.  Again the chances are you
know it, and the object, as I say, is to give you some
impression of distances and which public houses were
called at.  There are loads of them.  You will hear
later on when we do call the evidence how many there
are.  There are dozens of pubs, as you, of course,
know.  We cannot visit every one, so I have just
picked a few.

     Is that entirely   clear to you? Is there  anything
that I have forgotten   that I should have said to the
Jury that you want to   say?  I take it itis all
entirely clear to you   as well.

     If you do come and you get close to the Jury, I
am sure you would not do it, but can you just step
back because it could happen, particularly at the
ground, groups might meet.   So if you do, remember
that you are totally distinct groupings.   I am sure
you will all do that anyway.   It is just that I want
to be sure we have done everything what I would call
decently and in order.  That is the only reason why I
say that.

     Was your colleague wanting to say something?

     THE FOREMAN OF THE JURY: He just wanted to know
are we allowed to go anywhere in the ground once we
are in?

     THE CORONER:   Anywhere in the ground.

     THE FOREMAN OF THE JURY:    As long as we are
together?

     THE CORONER:  Yes, that is right.  I do not
suppose we would expect you to go into the private
offices because obviously those have nothing whatever
to do with it, but within reason anywhere within the
ground. Would that be fair, Mr. Catchpole?

     MR. CATCHPOLE:  If there are any problems,
perhaps the Foreman could mention It to Mr. Griffiths
and he can arrange it.

     THE CORONER:  If there is something you want to
see and it appears that you cannot get at it, call Mr.
Griffiths over and he will come and just say that you
want to see that, and then we will try and make the
appropriate arrangements.  The object is that you
should see as much of the ground as you wish.

     I think that is all, but perhaps I could just say
one thing to the lawyers and I will repeat it this
afternoon.  This afternoon we are only going to ask
Stephanie Jones to come, but tomorrow we have got five
people on our list - Colin Gillam, Kevin Carroll,
Robert Knowles, David Lackey and Matthew Gould.   The
' last one will be fairly quick actually.  Those are the
  five whom we intend for tomorrow if we succeed.

      We will rise and Mr. Griffiths will guide you to
 the coach.  We have got to fetch the car and then as
 soon as we have got behind the coaches we will set
 off.

      (The Inquests were adjourned until 2 o'clock)
                                                   S. L. JONES

     MR. PAYNE:   Before you resume, sir, the lawyers
present would like to thank you for the courtesy in
arranging transport this morning.  Thank you very much.

     THE CORONER:   Before I say anything else I would like
to thank Mr. Catchpole and, through Mr. Catchpole, the Club
for making it available, having everything unlocked, having
people there and being more than helpful.  I am most
grateful to you.  I think, although I have seen it before,
it was helpful to see it again.  You must remember that it
has changed a little bit.  You will have noticed that.  I
do not have to point out to you that there were no
perimeter fences and so on but one learns a lot, does one
not?

     MR. KING:   Before Miss Jones starts her evidence,
sir, can I tell you something that I have been asked on her
behalf to tell you?

      THE CORONER:    Yes, please.

     MR. KING:   She has identified herself on one of the
photographs which has already been produced to the Inquest
which is C.295.

     THE CORONER:     Yes, we will put it up at a convenient
point.

     MR. KING:   I know she wanted you to know that from
the beginning, sir.

                  STEPHANIE LINDA JONES Sworn

                        Bv THE CORONER:

Q. You are Stephanie Linda Jones, is that right? - A.
   Yes.

Q.                    Allerton, Liverpool in Merseyside,
     that is right, is it not? - A. Yes.

Q. Is it mum and dad who are here? - A. Yes.

Q. You are I think a receptionist? - A. Yes.

Q. Or you were at that time? - A. Yes.

Q. You are in fact the sister of Richard Jones, are you
   not, who unfortunately lost his life at Hillsborough?
   - A. Yes.
                                                         S. L. JONES

    Q. Of course/ technically you were not related to Tracey
       but she was Richard's girlfriend, was she not, and
       she unfortunately lost her life which is very sad
       obviously? - A. Yes.
B
    Q. I want you to tell me as much as you can and as much
       as you feel able.  X will ask you questions like I
       did with all the other witnesses and we will see how
       we get on.  Okay? - A. Yes.

    Q. Richard was a season ticket holder I think? - A. Yes,
       that is correct.

    Q. Initially he got two tickets because I think it was
       just him and you who were going to go to the match?
       A. Yes, that is right.

    Q. I think that Tracey decided she would like to come as
       well, is that right? - A. Yes.

    Q= He got another ticket? - A. Yes.
D   Q. In fact he asked you to get a ticket for Tracey? ~ A.
       Yes.
    Q. He was actually living in Sheffield, was he not*
       Richard? - A. Yes.

    Q. It was easier for you to go to the club than for him?
       - A. Yes.

    Q. You got the £12 ticket I think for Tracey which is
       for the stand? - A. Yes, my father got it from the
       ground.

    Q. Somebody in the family went to the ground? ~ A. Yes.

    Q . As it happens your mum came home that day and she had
        another one and so you finished up with four? “ A.
        Yes, that is right.

     Q.   Hers was a £14 ticket for   the stands? - A. Yes.

     Q.   You took them.  Did you have all four or did you have
          just these two and Richard have the other two? -* A. I
          had three and Richard had his own.

     Q.   You looked after them and on the 14th April, the day
          before the Friday, in the evening you came to
          Sheffield by train? - A. Yes.

                                                      S. L. JONES

Q. Because you had somewhere to stay, that is right, is
   it not? - A. Yes.

Q.   Tracey had also come or she may have been here
     already? - A. She lived in Sheffield as well-    They
     both went to university there.

Q. You all went out that evening.  Where did you go as a
   matter of interest? - A. The Broom Hill Tavern pub
   just at the bottom of the road for just one drink.

Q.   You had a nice time? - A. Yes.

Q.    Looking forward to the match I expect at that time? -
     A. Yes.

Q. In the morning of the 15th you had an extra ticket at
   that point, did you not? - A. We had to swap one of
   them because otherwise Tracey would not be with us.

Q. You wanted her with you? - A. Yes.

Q. So Richard had his breakfast and he went off and
   exchanged the £12 ticket with a friend, is that
   right? - A. Yes.

Q. This was really a private arrangement? - A. Yes.      His
   friend obviously wanted to sit down.

Q. He was getting a good deal, was he not? — A. The more
   expensive ticket.

Q. It seems to me the sensible thing to have done.  He
   then came back and so you had three tickets for the
   terraces? - A. Yes.

Q. What happened*to the fourth one? - A. Before we went
   to the ground we went and apparently Richard knew
   some friend who wanted the other ticket and he was
   going to sell them the tickets.

Q. He knew somebody, did he? - A. It was a friend of a
   friend.

Q. Again it was a private arrangement? - A. Yes, it was
   just to get rid of the ticket rather than sell it at
   the ground,

Q. Then I think you had something to each for lunch.
   You had a light lunch. - A. Yes.
                                                               8




                                                       S. L. JONES

    Q. At about 1.15 or so did you set off for the ground? -
       A. No, I think we had lunch about that time.

    Q. I am sorry?   - A. We had lunch atthat time.   It was
B      after that.    Just after two some time.

    Q. Just after two? - A. Yes.

    Q. Did you walk or drive? - A. No, we drove.

    Q. Because it was too far? - A. Yes.

    Q. How long did it take you to drive to wherever you
       parked? - A. We drove to meet somebody at a pub to
       give them the tickets which was on the other side of
       the ground.

    Q. I am sorry? - A. It was to the other side of the
       ground, the public house. I am not sure of   the name.

    Q. You do not know which pub it was,   do you? -A. No.
D   Q. Did you then park in that car park of the pub or did
       you park somewhere else? - A, No, we parked in the
       car park.

    Q. When you say the other side of the ground, are you
       saying he was at the Nottingham Forest side? - A. No,
       it was right over the other end of the city really.

    Q. It was a long way away? - A. Yes.

    Q. Were there supporters in that pub? - A. No, it was
       very empty.

    Q. Richard's friend's friend was there and you got the
       tickets? - A. Yes.

    Q. Did you stop for a quick drink? - A. Yes, we had one
       drink.

    Q. What did Richard have? ~ A. He had a pint of beer.

    Q. That is all he had? - A. That is all.

    Q. What time was it when you got to that pub? - A. I am
       not really sure.  It was only about fifteen minutes
       away from the house.

    Q. From home and you left about two I think you said? —
       A. Yes.

                                                S. L. JONES
✓
So we will say you left about quarter past.  We do
not have to be to the second.  Then I think you
stayed at the pub for about another fifteen minutes
or so? - A. Yes.

So in round terms that would be about 2.30, would
that be fair? - A. About.

We are not pinning you down to a minute or two or
anything like.

How did you then get from this pub to the ground? -
A. It was Tracey's car and she drove to the ground.
She doesn't drink at all really.

How long did it take to drive to the ground would you
say? - A. About fifteen, ten or fifteen minutes.

Then you had to park? - A. Yes, in Far Lane.

Which is quite close to the ground? - A. Yes, not far
away.

You were fortunate then to find a space? - A. Yes.

From where you parked you then walked to the ground,
is that right? - A. Yes, that is true.

That would have taken you how many more minutes? - A.
About ten minutes.

Again if we add it all up we get   to about ten to
three? - A. Yes.

Would that be about right? - A. That would seem about
right.

Would you agree?  If you do not agree please say
so? - A. Something like that.  I am not sure but
something like that.

I am just adding up the times with ten minutes here
and ten minutes there. Did you see lots of fans
first of all on your drive to Farndale Road? - A. No,
not on the way to Far Lane, no.

When you parked and got out? - A. The nearer we got
to the ground the more fans.

                              S. L. JONES


Q.   Are you a football supporter yourself, generally
      speaking? - A. Not on a regular basis.  I have only
     been to Anfield maybe 4 or 5 times, and not away at
     all.

Q.   So you are not really an experienced football
      attender? - A. No.

Q.   You had not been to Hillsborough before, had you? - A.
     No.

Q.   So you were not there in 1988? - A.     No, Richard   had.

Q.   Richard had but you had not? - A.     No.

Q.   As you were walking towards the ground you were
      walking down Leppings Lane, or up Leppings Lane, I am
      told, is that right? - A. Yes.

Q.   Firstly, I want to make sure we have got the right
      road. What is the map number? Is it 284? Yes,
      C.284.  Just put it up.  I will just make sure I have
      not misremembered the road - Farndale. - A.  Far Lane.

Q.   I thought perhaps I was getting it wrong.  Do you know
     where it is on that map? - A.  I didn't know at the
     time.  It was only afterwards I found out where it
     was.

Q.   It is Far Lane - F-A-R did you say? - A. I think it is
     double RR - F-A-R-R, is it?

Q. In that case, I was thinking of the wrong road.   I was
    thinking of Farndale.  I do not know where Far Lane is
    either.  Is it off the map?

          MR. HALE:   I can show it to you, sir.

          THE CORONER:  Mr. Hale, thank you very much.  I
     see.  It is what I would call below Wadsley Lane, not
     that far from the ground, you are right, but not the
     one I had in mind anyway.
Q.   You are saying that you walked from that road all the
     way to the ground? - A. Yes.

Q.   I do not suppose for a minute you can remember the
     names of the roads you walked down? - A. No, I cannot.

Q.   I .will have to go over the ground again. Were you on
     your own when you were walking there, or were there
      other supporters walking with you? - A. To begin with
      there wasn't many at all.
                                                                11




                                  S. L. JONES


Q. ' At one point did you start picking up other
     supporters? - A. I d o n ’t know. After 5 minutes we
     started seeing a few and then it just got more and
     mo r e .

Q.   They were all walking down towards the ground as far
     as you were concerned? - A. Yes.

Q.   What was their behaviour like? - A. Happy;     they were
      singing.  It was just normal. I did think   there was
      an awful lot of people but it was justnormal.

Q.   Just as a matter of interest, did you see people
     carrying any cans? - A. No, Ididn't.

Q.   None at all?    - A.   No, none.

Q.   You have told me they were singing and other people
     have described that I think as jolly.  Would you use
      that word or not? - A. Yes.

Q.   But you were not frightened in any way? — A. No.  I
      did think there was an awful lot of people but I
     hadn't been to that many matches so I just assumed it
     was normal.

Q.   Nobody did anything to you.  I do not mean in the
     sense of hitting you, but did people swear at you, or
     anything like that? - A. No, there was no problem at
     all.

Q.   Good.   Then you approached the ground - right? - A.
      Yes.

Q.   As you got towards the turnstiles, which you had not
      seen before, this was the first time? - A. I didn't
      see them at all.

Q.   You did not see them at     all? - A. The whole   time.

Q.   Tell me what you saw? - A.Nothing, just a         mass of
      people as they went towards the ground,

Q.   I see, so the nearer you got, the thicker the crowd?            -
      A. Yes.

Q.   And right at     the ground it   was an absolute mass of
      people? ~ A.   Yes.

Q.   Did you see any police officers, just as a matter of
      interest? - A. I had noticed I had hardly seen any,
      and then like once I got near the ground I saw one
      officer directing traffic, that was all, and then
      nearer the ground, or once we were in the mass, I saw

     / one policeman on horseback and then further back there
       were two more on horseback amongst the crowd.

Q.    So what you are saying   is as far as you remember you
       saw one officer who was directing traffic? - A.   Yes.

Q.     Was it near a traffic light, a little bit higher up? -
     ■ A. Yes.

Q.    Then as you got nearer    to the. ground your recollection
       is of a police officer   on horseback? - A. Yes.

Q.     Where was he? - A. That was more when we gotright
       into the crowd, right near the gates.

Q.     Then a little bit further in there were another two? -
       A.No, there were two quite far out, out of the crowd.

Q.    Do you mean towards the roadway, that is what I am
       trying to find out? - A.  On the outside of the crowd,
       where the bulk of the crowd was.

Q.     I see. When you saw all this crowd of people there
       what did you think? - A.  I just wondered why there
       were so many people there really.

Q.     Was the crowd at that point moving, as far as you can
       remember? - A.  Sort of shuffling.  They didn't seem
       to be going in any sort of direction.

Q. When happened?       Did you, Richard and Tracy join   in at
    the back? - A.     Yes, there seemed no other place   to go.

Q.     Did other people join you behind? - A. Yes.

Q.     I think that as the people joined you behind, you
       started feeling a push forward, is that right? - A.
       The pressure of people, yes.

Q.     So there was pressure behind you? - A. Yes.

Q.     Which was tending to make you go forward? - A.     Yes.

Q.     That presumably meant that you were getting closer and
       closer to people ahead of you all the time, is that
       right? - A. Yes.

Q.     You and Tracy and Richard were trying to hold hands
       because you wanted to stay together but people tended
        to separate you, is that right? - A. Yes.

Q.     How did that happen? Just tell me how that happened.
        Did they push between you, or what happened? - A.   It
        is just normal.  People are just moving along.  You
                                                                  13

         ' can't seem to stay in a whole bunch together,        It is
           just impossible.  That always happens.

    Q.    When this was happening, can you remember - you may
B         not be able to remember - at the ground the outer
          perimeter gates, the sort of blue gates with railings
          on them? Can you remember those at all? - A. No, I
          can't remember going through those.  I did go through
          them but I can't remember.

          What I am trying to find out is when you are saying
          you were being pushed, do you think that you had gone
          through these outer gates, or had you not reached them
          yet? - A.  I think I had probably gone through them by
          then.

    Q.    Okay. Were you going through on the right-hand side?
          - A. Yes.

    Q.    Was that because Richard said, "That's the turnstiles
          that we need", or what? - A.  I didn't see the
          turnstiles at all.  It was just the movement.  That
D         was the only way sort of thing.

          But he had been before so               you were
          to a certain extent upon his             , were you not?
          - A. I suppose so.

          Yes.   At some point I think you saw some blue metal
          gates.   Can you remember that? - A. Yes.

    Q.    What sort of gates were they? - A.      Large like.

    Q.    We have called them concertina gates       - A.   Yes, that
          is right.

          I will just show you a picture of one. I am not
          saying this is the gate you saw because we have not
          yet established which gate you saw, but I think it is
          259.  I think there are two of them on.   No, it has
          only got one of them on.  This is probably not the one
          that you went through, but that sort of gate, is that
          right? - A.  I would say so, yes.

          If you look   at 261, that is a close-up of   this sort of
          gate - yes?   - A.  I think so.

    Q.    Something of that sort? - A.    Yes.

    Q.    I mean that type of gate.  It was not a gate with
          railings or anything like that? - A. There was such
                                                         su   a
          mass of a crowd, you couldn't really see.
                           s.   L. JONES


- Okay.  At this gate was there a policeman? - A.   Not
  that I saw.

 You did see a policeman on horseback, I think, did you
 not? - A. He was in the middle of the crowd, yes.

 He was not at this gate; he was further away from you
 then? - A. No, I think he was towards the second
 gate, y e s .

                  Q.   Which second gate ......
                                                                     15

0. Which second   gate are we talking about? - A. Gate C.

Q. Gate C? - A.   Yes.

Q. That is that gate over, the re, in fact? - A. Yes.

Q. what was he trying to do as far as you could'''tell ? :' - 7 A-.'
   He was trying to split the-crowd.

0. Was he having any success? - .A. Mo.

Q. Is that because nobody took any notice of .hia? - A. No,
   it was just the sheer'amount of people there was.   He
   just had no chance on his own, and there was just
   nobody else around.   It was just it was an impossible
   task for his to perforin.

Q. So the only way he could have succeeded would have been
   if everybody had obeyed him instantly? - A. Bo, I think
   if he had had more manpower it would have helped;
   rather than if everyone had obeyed him.

Q. I agree with you there, obviously the aore people you
   have the easier a task becomes, but are you saying that
   if people had obeyed him he would still not have had
   any success? - A. I can't really answer that.   I mean,
   I tried to get over to the right because you don *t wan t
   the horse trampling on you, but the sheer aaount of
   people you couldn't move that far across anyway.

Q. In fact, did the crowd pressure, if anything, become
   even stronger at that point? - A. Yes, it did.

Q. Did you feel uncomfortable at that point? - A. Yes.

Q. viere you a bit worried about yourself? - A. Yes, I got
   pushed right up against the gate and ray', arm was
   trapped.

0. So really you were in quite a difficult position then,
   weren't you? - A. Yes.

Q. Tracey was still near you and so was Richard,           is that
   right? - A . Yes.

Q. And I take it they were in the same sort of condition
   as you were? - A. Yes.

0. There were another two Police Officers, weren't there,
   whom you mentioned?  'Where were they? - A. They were
   out of the crowd towards the back, I did notice.

Q. Could you see what they were trying to do? - A. Ho, I
   couldn't see.
                                                                 16



                                                    S. L. J O S E S




Q. You might not have been able to see because of them
   being too far away or because of the crowd, but you
   just saw them because they were elevated, is that
   right? - A. Yes.  I just noticed because this one was,
   the first one, was right in the middle of the melee of
   the crowd, but the other two were right outside where
   the crowd was.

Q. While you were approaching this gate, before you had
   actually got hard onto it, had it opened at all? - A.
   It was opened once.  I saw it open once.

Q.   You saw it open once? - A. Yes.

Q.   On that opening you didn't get through on that
     occasion, did you? - A. Mo.

Q. That is presumably because you were too far away front
   it, is that right? - A. Hell, yes.

Q.    And also was that opening - it didn't last   very long,
     did it? - A. Ho, only a couple of seconds.

Q. On that occasion, just help me on this because I am
   just trying to fix the openings, did people come
   through, did people actually go through the gate? - A.
   I think three or four, perhaps, people went through -
   not many though.

Q. Some did - it wasn't opened wide at that tine? - A. No.

0. And I think having got up against this gate, I think
   Richard said, "If it opens again we are going in?" - A.
   We had no choice, otherwise it would have been a lot
   worse.

Q. In fact, a little while later that is exactly what
   happened, it opened? - A. Yes.

Q. But it opened wide out, is that right? - A. It opened
   right across.

Q. And you could see that it was a Policeiaan who was
   opening the gate? - A. Yes.

Q. Certainly it was an official person? - A. Yes.

Q. Did he open it all .the way by himself or did he begin
   to open it and did fans then assist to open it
   further?- A. The fans helped because everyone had been
   screaming for hioi to open it because we could see
   something was going to happen outside if he didn't,
   because everyone was screaming for him to open it.
So what you are saying is that the gate began to open
and you could see it was a Policecian, and then the fans
started opening i t .with -hip? - A. The fans on the
inside - tnere was fans on the inside.

In fact, what happened then with regard to the fans and
that gate? - A. They pulled it wide open and we forced
ourselves sort of to the side and in, and got into the
clearing, then I think a whole load came right through
all together with the force.

There was initially quite a rush in, because people had
been squashed tight against it, would that be right? -
A. Yes.  It was like taking a cork out of a bottle,
sort of thing.

Anyway, you managed to get into what is called the
concourse area and it was a bit better in there, wasn't
it? - A. Yes, it wasn't packed at all.

Because there was a lot of space, relatively speaking?
- A. Yes.

What happened then? - A. Me and    Richard had both gone
through together because he had    been just in front of
ine, and we got through together   and then we just waited
for Tracey and she came through    just in a matter of
minutes, and joined us.

Where did you go then? - A. ¥e just - I could only sea,
well, we could all only see the tunnel, and Richard
said to just go down the tunnel, so we just stood there
for a ainute or so, and I thought everything was okay
then because it was pretty clear in there, and then we
just started to walk down the tunnel.

So by the tiiae you went down the tunnel, you are saying
it was reasonably clear, is that right? - A. Yes, it
was.

     MISS ADDLEMAN:   Sir, we are having difficulty in
hearing the witness at this end.

     THE CORONER:      He or the witness?

     MISS ADDLEMAH :    The witness,   sir.

      THE CORONER:   Can you sit a little bit further
forward?   You have got to get quite close to these
otikes.  You were saying that when you went into the
tunnel it was reasonably clear? - A. Yes, it w a s .

But there were people walking down? - A. Yes, normally.
                                                                   18

Q.    A noriaal walk? - A. Yes.

Q.    In fact, you did actually sea one or two people, not
     .that m a n y , who were passing water down the side of the-,
      tunnel, is that right? - A. Yes.

Q.   That wasn't something which you would have necessarily
     approved of but you weren't too concerned at that
     point? - A. I wasn't surprised.

Q. Can you remeraber - you say not be able to remember but
   were you walking down the tunnel in the middle, the
   left side or the right side? - A. I can't really
   renieaber. We were probably spread right out.   We were
   probably walking together.

0.    Yes, because there were three of you? - A. Yes.

Q.    When you got to the end of the tunnel, the tunnel goes
     along and then it has got a dip, hasn t it,   and you can
     see the pitch, when you got just to exit of   the tunnel,
     was that part of the tunnel clear of people? - A. Yes,
     it was.

Q. So you were able to get onto the terrace without any
   particular obstruction at that point? - A. Yes.

Q. Tell me, because obviously you were interested in the
   snatch, what was happening on the field at that point? -
   A. I d i d n ’t look.  We were just going to try and get a
   place and then look.      As far as I was concerned the
   match h a d n ’t started.

Q. You don't think it had started? - A. Ho.

Q. Can you recollect whether any players were on the
   field? - A. Ho, I didn't look at the pitch.

Q. So you don't really know? - A. No.

Q. You then went on the terraces. I think you can't
   actually remember which terrace you went onto, that is
   right, isn't it? - A. That's right.

Q.   But I think I am right in saying that on the
     photographs you found Richard in Pen 3? - A. Fen       3,
     that's right.

Q.    And you can say that you were with him? - A. Yes.

Q.   I mean, you entered the same pen as he did, that       is.
     right, isn't it? - A. Yes.
                                                             19



                                                S.   L . JONES




Q. So it is a reasonable supposition that that is the pen
   you entered, isn't it? - A. Yes.

0. You said to rae just a aonient ago that the tunnel was
   clear, the exit of the tunnel was clear, you managed to
   get onto the terrace and you were going into the right
   hand pen.  Did you take up a viewing position? — A. No.

Q. So what happened? - A. We just started to walk down and
   then there just saeraed like an awful lot of people came
   behind us and we started to get slowly moved forward
   then, sort of stumbling down the steps sort of thing.

Q. So when you initially went onto the terrace, it sounds
   to me from what you are saying that at that point you
   were not apprehensive.   You ware saying, "I want to
   find a viewing position**, and you were walking down
   looking for soae convenient spot? - A. Yes.

Q. That's right, and at that point how crowded would you
   say it was?   Can you say anything about that? - A. Just
   a nornial amount really.  I wasn't really worried.  My
   worries had gone after we came off the clearing.

Q. Sorry? - A. My worries had gone when we came out into
   the clear part, and the tunnel, because I was
   frightened outside.

Q. It was outside that you were scared? - A. I was worried
   that it was going to be the same inside but I didn't
   think it was.

0. So once you got on the terrace you were relieved? - A.
   Yes.

Q. It looked better than it had been outside the gate,
   that's right? - A. It did.

Q. And then you say -•— was there some crowd that came
   from behind and pushed you, a sudden push, or what was
   it? - A. First of all it was a gradual movement, sort
   of thing, just taoving down as though there was a lot of
   people coming in behind us.




               /C. Behind, yes
                                                               20


                                          S. L. JONES


     /
Q. Behind, yes. - A. Yes, and then it started to get more
   and more surges, sort of thing.

0. In your statement you have put it a little more
   graphically.   You said:

          "Then I was suddenly shoved from behind and I was
          thrown forward down the steps."

     I haven't said this to you, but I have said it to one or
     two of the witnesses, it doesn't actually matter what
     happened.   All I am trying to find out is as far as you
     can remember what happened and you tell me now so the
     jury can get the picture of what you can recollect.    Can
     we just go over that again?   I am interested to know
     whether this was, as you put it, a sudden shove, that you
     were shoved from behind, or whether it was just a very
     gradual pressure? - A. To begin with it started off
     gradually and then a shove came.

Q. How far down the terrace were you moved, if that is the
   right word, can you say? - A. I have got n o idea really,
   probably three-quarters.   I really don't know.

Q. I think this particular surge actually stopped at that
   point and there was a little bit of relief is that right?
   - A. Yes.   Well, Tracey had fell down behind me and
   there was a gap where she had fallen.    A lot of
   supporters picked her up but she had lost her shoe.

Q.   She had lost her shoe at that point? - A. Her   shoe, yes.

Q.   Can you remember what was going on on thefield at that
     point? - A. No, I was turned round looking  at her.   I
     really hadn't paid any attention.

Q. Did you look at the field at all at around that time? -
   A. No.

Q.   So you can't help me at all on that? - A. No.

Q.   In fact somebody picked her shoe up, is that right?   -   A.
     Yes.   I couldn't reach it so they picked it up.

Q.   But somebody managed to get down and give it to her and
     so she was pleased about that at the time? - A. Yes.

Q. Then what happened after that? - A. Really big surges
   came.   I didn't see Richard or Tracey again after that.
   In fact I don't even know whether she put her shoe on.

Q. You just managed to get it and then there was another big
   surge? - A. Y e s .
                                                              21


                                            S. L. JONES


Q. That surge split you from Tracey and Richard, of course?
   - A. Yes.

Q.   You never saw them again after that until much later    of
     course.   Were you pushed against any barriers? - A.    No,
     not at all.

Q. Where did you eventually finish up, you yourself? - A .
   Right at the very front, turned round facing the back.

Q. Facing the wrong way,    so to speak? - A. Facing the wrong
   way, yes.

Q. When you got down there can you remember what was^
   happening with the match?   You may think I am being
   cruel in keep asking that, but it is a convenient way of
   timing things, you see, that is why I am asking you. - A.
   No, I can't because I was turned round the wrong way.    I
   have no idea.

Q.   So really you never saw anything at   all of what happened
     on the pitch? - A. No.

Q. If you did you can't remember any of it? - A. Well, until
   I got out.

Q. At that point you were pretty squashed, is that right? -
   A. Yes.

Q. Were you calling out at all?      Were you able to call out?
   - A. Yes.

0. Can you remember more or less what you said? - A. "I've
   got to get out."

Q. Was this in a loud voice or in a little gentle voice?      -
   A. Yes, I was screaming.

Q.   Were you able to repeat it? - A. Yes, a few times.

Q.   How did you get out? - A. There is a bit of confusion.      I
     am not really sure.      I was faced the wrong way.   I was
     literally face to face with another boy, like nose to
     nose.      I couldn't see anything.   I thought I was ^oing
     to faint and I just heard somebody say at my side, "Here
     you are, love," and I sort of stepped on to the pitch, or
     somebody pulled me.      It is not been found exactly how I
     got o u t .

Q.   So your recollection is that you just stepped out? - A.
     That is what it felt like to me but I think somebody must
     have pulled me.

Q. In fact I think we have seen you on the video? - A. Yes.
                                     S. L. JONES


Standing near the perimeter fence.   Do you remember
seeing this young lady?   Having got out did you look at
the pitch at all? - A. Yes, I was facing the pitch then.

What was going on at that point? - A. They were playing.

So all this you have described happened before the match,
and including your exiting out of...   You weren't pulled
over the top? - A. No, out of the gates.

Definitely out of the gates before the match ended, or
was stopped, rather? - A. Well, it had probably just
started as I was getting out.

You don't know that, of course? - A. Well, all I can
assume is that it had already started because as I got
out of the gates I turned round and I was facing the
television camera and the match was playing.

Was the television camera looking at the match or at the
stand? - A. No, it was turned round to me.

It was already taking pictures of what was going on?   - A.
I just looked and it was just right on me.

That is why we have got it, of course.   - A. Yes.

So that shot of you which is on the television was taken
almost immediately after you got out, is that right? - A.
Well, immediately, yes.

That shot is timed so we will be able to look at it
again.   I can't remember what time is on it but we will
be able to time what time that was, but do you remember
from your impression how long the game carried on after
that? - A. Maybe five minutes at the most.

A short period? - A. Yes.

I don't want to go into this in great detail, but when
you were standing outside did you notice some fans come
past you and go into another part of the ground? - A,
Yes, that's right.

Which pen did they go into? - A. The corner one on the
right.

Is it the one underneath the police control box?   If you
were standing with your back to the fence, did they come
past you towards the right or towards the left? - A. They
were walking past me from the right.   I think they came
out of the gate after me because I think I was...
                                     S. L. JONES


Hi-gh up, and they were coming past you going to the south
stand side, would that be right? - A. Well, I am not sure
of the layout of the ground, but the corner.

Can we put the plan of the ground up for a moment.    It
is not that important but I am just interested.   (C.274)
Mr. Griffiths could you just point to enclosure 3?    That
is gate 3?    That is the one where you... - A. Came out,
yes.

Then point to pen 4.   That is pen 4.  Are you saying
they came from that part and were walking past you
down...  Is that right? - A. I don't think they were
coming out of pen 4.

No, but there were people who were walking past you in
that direction? - A. They were coming out just behind me,
out of the gate I came out of.

Oh, I see.    I understand you now.  You are saying there
were people coming out... - A. Yes, because I think I was
the first or second person out of the gate and then a few
more followed and then the police were taking them across
to. the corner.

I just want to go back one moment.   You know the big
gates that opened when you came outside the ground, the
concertina gates.   Can you recollect whether you were
one of the first people to come through on that occasion?
— A. Through the gates?

Yes, through that big gate. - A. No, not the first
person.

No, I didn't mean the first.   What I meant was were you
in what I would call the first group of people who came
through do you think? - A. Yes, possibly.

You then waited for a little while because Tracey had to
join you, is that right? - A. Yes.

You don't know how long you waited? - A. It was only a
few seconds really.   She just didn't get in with our
surge, sort of thing.

There wasn't any delay.   You didn't go to the loo or
anything like that? - A. No.

As far as you were concerned, we know what time that gate
opened, the big concertina gate, you had a fairly rapid
passage right through that? - A. Yes.
                                                                      24



                                                  S . L . JONES


Q. Irv fact there was a very nice man who came up to you at
   some point and comforted you and tried to help and look
   after you? - A. Yes.

Q. Are you still in touch with him? - A. Sometimes, yes.

Q. He was a supporter?         - A. Yes, a Liverpool supporter.

Q. Shall we give his name, do you think? - A. If you want.

Q. Was he Phil Bickley? - A. Yes.

Q. We are not calling him as a witness but it is nice to
   acknowledge what he was doing.   Now what is the number
   o f ...

             MR. KING:      C.295,   sir.

        THE CORONER:   Can we put C.295 up?   Now this is
   the photograph you are on and we will just show it to
   you.

        MR. KING:   Sir,         if it helps,    the time of this
   photograph is 14.54.

             THE CORONER:      That does help:

0. Are you able to see yourself on that projection? - A.
   Yes.

Q. Go and show us where you are. - A. That's me,             that's
   Tracey and that's Richard.

Q. So you are in fact in line.    You have just heard - in
   fact you can read the time on the bottom ofit, that is
   six minutes to three, or possibly five.

        THE CORONER:           Is it one    minute wrong?    Which way
   is the minute?

        MR. KING:   Sir, the actual time is 14.54.                Printed
   on the photograph is a minute too long, sir.

        THE CORONER:           So it is 14.54 - six minutes before
   the...:

Q. At that point you were still outside, weren't you? - A.
   Yes.

Q. The gate I can tell you was opening because people were
   coming through and presumably this is when you were
   following them in, is that right? - A. It seems so.

Q. If you look at that photograph you can see it.  That
   is exactly the same photograph and it saves you
   turning round every few moments.  That gate I will
   tell you.had been opened at 14:48 for a moment or two
   for just a short moment and then it had been
   closed? - A. Yes.

Q. Then it had been fully opened at 14:52.  That is two
   minutes before this photograph is taken.  The
   question I want to ask you is this;  looking at that
   photograph and thinking about what you told me you
   said that you were pushed hard up against the gate
   when it was shut.  You are sure about that, are
   you? - A. Yes, I was sure.

Q. There was another opening of this gate.  This gate
   was shut at three minutes to three.  Do you remember
   we had a schedule.  14:57:40.  At 14:57 this gate was
   shut again and then it was re-opened at about 14:59,
   in other words just a minute or so before kick-off.
   What I want to establish is which opening you went
   through? - A. Yes.

Q. Because if that is where you are on that photograph
   you could not have been right up afaAnst the gate at
   14:52 because you did not walk back, did you? - A.
   No.  That is right, yes.

Q. So in fact your movement throughout was forward,   is
   that right? - A. Yes.

Q. It was not that you got up against the gate, didn't
   like it, walked away and then re-approached it.  I
   just want to be quite clear? - A. We carried on
   forward, yes.

Q. It was opened for the last time at 14:59:12
   approximately.  Of course you did not look at your
   watch? - A. No.

Q. The reason I ask you this is that by the time you got
   out of the gate at the front the match was still in
   progress? - A. That is right.

Q. If you in fact came through   at 14:59, which you might
   have done because you might   have come through the
   last occasion from what you   tell me, your progress
   would have been even faster   than I would have
   expected? - A. I would have   thought, yes.

Q. Did you get the impression you went through the
   ground, if I can-put it like this, in minutes or did
                                                  S. L. JONES

  you have the impression that it took any length of
  time? - A. It seemed like forever but I think it was
  fast.
     MR. MAXWELL:  I have not got any questions, sir, but
on behalf of all of us, that is all the parties and all
those concerned in investigating this appalling tragedy, I
express our sympathy.

     THE CORONER:   Thank you very much indeed.   That is
very kind of you.
                Cross-Examined bv MR. PAYNE:

Q. Stephanie, can I just follow up the questions which
   the Coroner was asking you about the timing of this
   photograph to see if we can get any further? You see
   in the bottom right hand corner of the photograph in
   red there is the time printed at which it is said
   that photograph was taken which reads 55 and we are
   told that is one minute wrong and it should be 54? -
   A. Right.

Q. We are also told that the gate which on the
   photograph is just off to the right where the people
   seem to be heading as they go off the photograph do
   you see that? - A. Yes.

Q. We are told that gate was opened at 14:52:06 which is
   just two minutes before the time of the photograph,
   do you see that? - A. Yes.

Q. We are told that that gate was then kept open until
   14:57, that is to say another three minutes after
   that photograph was taken? - A. Right.

Q. So it appears those are the times.  I am not
   criticising you at all? - A. I can only presume that
   I went through when it was opened the next time at 59
   because I know I definitely went through and it was
   closed at first and I was pushed against it.  So it
   must have been the 59 time that I went through a t .
   It is not a great deal of time in between, is it?    It
   is only four or five minutes?

Q. Yes, but it would not take you three minutes to walk
   from where you are in the photograph to the gate? —
   A. I know, but there was a huge amount of supporters
   there and it took some time to get to the gate.

      MR. PAYNE:    Sir, I do not honestly think that can be
 taken any further.

     THE CORONER:   Perhaps Mr. King will be able to take
it further but I do not know whether he will or not.

     MR. PAYNE:       Mr. King may have some ingenious method
of doing it.

     MR. KING:   Sir, I have a theory which I will put to
the test in a mome n t.

       THE CORONER:     It is an interesting matter, is it not?

Q.        MR. PAYNE: While that photograph is on the
     screen, you have told the Coroner from what you saw
     you actually only saw a total of three mounted
     Policemen, did you? - A. Yes, that is correct.

Q. There is obviously a lot more to be seen on that
   photograph? - A. That is right.

Q. But you did not see them? - A. No.

Q. I want you to look at another document please, and
   that is the map, 284, and I think you will find it
   further on in your bundle.  I appreciate you do not
   probably know the roads and so on yourself but I just
   want to see how far we can get.  First of all, can
   you find Par Lane where you parked the car and if you
   can find No. 2 which is in the black circle? - A.
   Yes.

Q. You parked your car there and then you walked from
   there in the direction of the ground, did you? - A.
   Yes, that is correct.

Q. On the map that would take you down to the junction
   of what we can see is Wadsley Lane? - A. I have got
   it.

Q. That is going in the direction of the ground and so
   that is probably the way you walked, is it? - A. I
   cannot honestly say.  I have got no idea.

Q. Whichever way you went it would then take you on to
   Middlewood Road, that is the big road with the black
   writing, above the No. 2 I have pointed out? .-'.A*
   Yes.

Q. A little way down Middlewood Road you then cross over
   Catch Bar Lane? - A. Yes.
                                                             28




                                                    S. L. JONES

Q. Then you are into Leppings Lane and over the bridge.
   You can see the river just passing under the e of
   Leppings Lane, do you see that? - A. Yes.

Q. And turn right into the ground.      Do you think you
   probably did go down Middlewood Road and over Catch
   Bar Lane? - A. I really w oul d n ’t like to say.  I am
   absolutely hopeless at directions and I have got no
   idea.

Q. I am just trying to put you on the map before I ask
   you about the crowds because you have said you
   thought there were an awful lot of people? - A. Yes.

Q. What I want you to help the Jury about is this;
   about how far back from the ground was it when you
   first started to notice?  I am not asking you to be
   exact but just give us an idea of about how far away
   you were from the ground? - A. Maybe two roads away,
   one road.

Q. That was an awful lot of people all walking in the
   same direction as you? - A. Yes.

Q•        THE CORONER:   I am sorry, I missed the answer.
     What did you say?- A. About two roads away.

Q.        MR. PAYNE:  For instance, when you cross over
     Catch Bar Lane that is quite a big junction.  You
     must have crossed over somewhere about there from the
     direction you came. So when you crossed over what
     was the scene like? Put the Jury in the picture as
     to what the scene was like as you crossed over that
     big road? - A. There was just a mass of people at the
     ground.  You could not see the turnstiles or anything
     like that.

Q. X am trying to get you a little bit further back from
   the ground.  Were there people walking on the
   pavement as you approached the ground? - A. Yes.

Q. Were they walking in the roads as well? - A. I c a n ’t
   recall.

Q. That is as far as I can take that.  The next thing
   was that when you got into the ground and were going
   down the tunnel there were some people passing water
   on the sides of the tunnel? - A. Yes.

Q. You said you were not surprised at that? - A. No.
                                                   S. L. JONES
✓
Why is that? - A. Because I have been to Anfield
Football Ground before and it happens all the time.

There was nothing special about the occasion? - A. Oh
no.  You just don't look.  You just look away.




             Cross-Examined bv MR. MANNING:

I have got a theory too.  I wonder if we can look
back at the photograph we had up before, C295, and I
wonder whether the gates that you remember being
pressed up against were the blue gates?  If you look
behind you there are two or three chaps have got red
sweaters or shirts on. You can see some blue gates
behind them.- I wonder if those were the gates you
were pressed up against? - A. I don't think so.

You do not think so? - A. No.

Having got through there your way was free to come
through this gate when it was open? ~ A. No.

Theory exploded!  Let me take you back to the
beginning.  You say you have been to Anfield and
obviously you are used to large crowds at football
matches? - A. Fairly used to them, yes.

This was to be a very large crowd.  I think you knew
it was an all-ticket match? - A. Yes.

I do not think there is any secret about the fact
that a lot more people would have liked to have gone
to the match than there were tickets available? ~ A.
Probably.

Were you not a little concerned about the time you
were actually going to be arriving at the ground? -
A . Richard did n't seemed concerned and so I w a s n 't .

Did it not seem to you to be cutting it fine to be
getting there at ten to three or five to three or
thereabouts? - A. I really don't know.

But you were surprised by the numbers of people who
were still outside the ground at that time? - A. Yes.

Were you aware at all of a Police Land Rover parked
outside the ground? - A. No.

                                                 fi. L. JONES

Q. Did you hear any announcements on a PA system of
   somebody saying not to push because everybody would
   get in? - A. No, I didn't.

Q. Did any of the Police Officers that you saw try to
   indicate either by what they were saying or by what
   they were doing that they did not want people to
   push? - A. Not really.  The only thing was the one
   Police Officer on horseback who was telling everyone
   to get to the right and that was it.

Q. That was some effort although you thought that was
   doomed to failure because there was only one of them.
   ~ A. Yes.
Q. I do not imagine for a moment at all that you were
   doing any pushing? - A. Probably the person in front
   of me thought I was pushing but I wasn't.  It was
   just the sheer pressure.

Q. Because you were being pressed from behind? - A. Yes.

Q. When you came up on to the back of the queue there
   was a moment when, if you like, you were the last
   person in the queue? * A. I don't think so.  There
   was always someone behind me.

Q . Was there a moment that you stopped and thought *
    "That is as far as we can go at the moment” as the
    shuffling forward continued? * A. Yes, sometimes you
    were just in a bunch and it wasn't moving but there
    was always people all around you, behind you, in
    front of you.
Q. The pressure at that time was coming from behind you?
   - A. Yes-
 Q. That was the pressure of people trying to get closer
    to the entrance points? - A. I presume so.

 Q. After that when you got into the ground itself from
    thereon into the tunnel, through the tunnel and on to
    the terrace, all of that is something that you would
    put under the word "normal". What you saw in the
    tunnel, although it is pretty despicable, was
    something you had seen before at football matches.
    A. I wouldn't call it despicable really.
                           S. L. JONES


/You have seen   it before and you were not surprised   to
 see it again? - A. No.

When you got onto the terrace itself, it seemed to you
that that was a normal scene that you were seeing in
front of you?    - A. To begin with.

Until the pushing started? - A. Well, until the crowd
came up.

            Cross-Examined by MR. KING

Miss Jones, I was interested in your answer that the
person in front of you might have thought you were
pushing, but you weren't;  it was because of the
pressure behind you? - A. Yes.

I want you, if you can, to give some idea to the Jury
of what it is like being in a crowd.   I am sure we
have all had that experience, but you had that
particular experience that day.   Do you know what I
mean by an involuntary movement? I will explain what
I mean by that.  That is a movement of somebody who
hasn't said to himself, 'I'm going to make a
movement', but somebody who is carried along by the
momentum of everyone else around them.   Do you
understand? - A. Yes.

Is that what you were trying to explain to us of being
in that crowd, that that crowd had a momentum and you
were being carried along with it? - A. That is right.
You have got no choice of where you are going. It is
just the way the movement carries you.   If you want to
go one way and the crowd is going the other way, you
have got no chance of going that way.

If somebody had put the finger on you and said, "Miss
Jones, wait a minute, what do you think you are doing
pushing forward?" what would you have said to them? -
A. "I'm not pushing".

What was happening to you? - A.  It is just everyone
behind me, and it is just the sheer pressure of the
amount of people.

You described the police officer on the horseback, and
you were asked very properly by the Coroner about
obeying what he was trying to do, and.you gave this
answer, that you yourself tried to get over to the
right, but couldn't.  Why was it that you couldn't? -
A. Because of all the people on the right and all the
people on the left, and just can't move like that.
You would very much lilce to if it means getting out of
the way, and also the horses coming near you.   You
                            S. L. JONES


'don't want to be trampled on but you haven't got much
 choice.

 At that stage when the man on the horseback was there,
 what was the depth of the crowd around the horse?
 What was it like around the horse? - A.  There was
 just no room at all.  The horse was just enveloped.

 Have you been yourself to a football match, perhaps at
 Anfield, when you have seen a mounted police officer
 putting people into queues? - A. Yes, there are
 always mounted police at Anfield.

 On those occasions is there space for the people to
 move into? - A.    Yes, the   queues.

 So on this occasion - I am not criticising the
 officer, he was    doing his best, I am sure - that
 officer on that    horse was in the middle ofa mass of
 people? - A. Y e s .

 Do you think that one police officer on that horse
 could really do anything about what was happening
 around him? - A. No, he couldn't have done anything,
 he couldn't.

 At that stage when you were there, you are in this
 crowd with its momentum.  I just want to pursue the
 same theory as Mr. Manning about the gates.  I just
 want to show you, if I may, 258 which is in the
 bundle, C258.

       THE CORONER:   Can you find it? - A.   Yes, I have
 it.

      MR. KING:  Do you see, Stephanie, that before you
 get into the area in front of the turnstiles you have
 to go through what we call blue perimeter gates, do
 you see that? - A. Yes.

 Do you   seethey have gateposts? - A. That is right.

 Do you   seethere is a sort of wall or   fence on the
 left which seems to cut the turnstile    area into two,
 do you   seethat? - A. Yes.

 When you were describing before - and I know you have
 described on another occasion what was happening to
 you at the time, and this is the statement which you
 gave to the Police not long afterwards and, in fact,
 you have been very good, you know, you have said
 almost word for word what was in your statement so it
 is not a question of anybody saying that you have not
 been getting it right, you have been doing very well

    indeed after this length of time.  But I was
    interested in something you said you could see.

         MR. KING:  Can I just remind you, sir, it is on
    page 3 of her statement.
    This is before you had got through the blue gates, and
    you say this:

         "I could see some fans sitting on top of the wall
         behind the gates inside the ground."

    Do you remember seeing fans sitting on the wall inside
    the ground? - A. Yes.

    Which wall do you think you were referring to? - A. I
    really don't know.

    If you go back to the photograph which is up and have
    a look at that, and then let us go back to the one
    which has you on it, C.295, do you see that behind you
    are those blue gates I have been pointing out to you?
    - A. Yes.

    People are coming through, and do you see to the
    right, as you look at the photograph, a lot of people
    sitting on that dividing wall or fence which is .
    between the two halves of the turnstile area, the one
    I pointed out to you when we were outside the
    perimeter gates on that first photograph? Do you
    think those are the fans you could see inside the
    ground sitting on the wall? - A. Possibly.

    To help you, there is no mystery, so that the Coroner
    knows, there was a time on the evidence when those
    perimeter gates were also closed for a short time.

         THE CORONER:   Yes, we know that.

         MR. KING:  Then they were opened and people came
    through.
    I wondered whether you were one of those who was in
    that group immediately pressed against the perimeter
    gates which had been closed at a certain stage and
    then you had got through? - A.  But the tunnel is not
    right in front of those perimeter gates, is it?

    No.  - A. That is why I am sure it must be the other
    gate, because when we came out of the’other gates the
    tunnel was right in front.  That is the only way I can
    think of it because I am not sure of the layout.

         THE CORONER:  So be it, that is right. It is very
    firm in her recollection.
                           S. L. JONES


     MR. KING:  Indeed.
Let me just go back slightly in time, so again we can
get the picture when you arrive, because you are
talking about choices the whole time, about the choice
of someone arriving at-the ground.  In your original
description, again I say it is so very close to what
you have told us today, you have said this on the
second page:

      "We got to the ground together and I think the
      ground was on our right-hand side."

That would be correct because you were coming from the
direction Mr. Payne was talking about.  You said:

      "We turned into the entrance to the ground and I
      was quite surprised to see such a large crowd of
      people standing at the front of the ground".
A.   Yes.

Was that the impression you had, that you were coming
so that the ground was on your right and you turned
into the entrance? - A. Yes.

Because if we look on our model, you would be coming,
with the help of our friend with the pointer, not from
Leppings Lane, but from the opposite direction.  The
ground would be on your right and you would turn into
the entrance, would you not? - A. Yes.

You probably came over a bridge but you probably would
not remember that. - A. Right.

Because, as the Jury will know, you could come from
two directions.  There were people coming down
Leppings Lane from one direction and people were
coming from your direction and everybody converging
from two directions to the entrance to the turnstiles,
do you see? - A. Yes.

When you arrived, was the picture of a great mass of
people? - A. Yes, just as we came down, yes.

The moment you joined it, from that moment onwards did
you really find that events had really taken over from
you after that? - A. Yes, because we d i d n ’t give our
tickets in, we didn't go through any turnstiles.

No, and you have already described the police officers
you had seen, which to you were few in number at that
stage? - A. Yes.

"    Now     let me take you     through onto   the concourse, an
    you got through the big gate and you are relieved and
    you see the tunnel? - A. Yes.

    Did you on that concourse area, that is the large area
    behind the turnstiles when you got through, see
    anybody, be it a policeman or a steward, directing you
    in any way? - A. No, I didn't see anyone of that
    nature.

    Did you see any signs indicating where you should go?
    - A. No.

    So you made    for the tunnel as the natural   way togo?   -
    A. That was    the only way Icould see.

    I am just finally interested in this.  When you got
    through the tunnel, and you are someone who has been
    to many crowds by the sound of it, were those terraces
    to you empty-looking, the terraces you were going
    into? - A. No, they weren't empty-looking.   They just
    looked as they normally do.

    In a normal crowd we have heard that there is swaying.
    You know what I mean by swaying, don't you? *■* A. Yes.

    You go back and you go forward, back and forward? - A*
    Yes.

    You have described to us a number of what you have
    described as surges? - A. Yes.

    Am I right in saying that that is not a sway? A surge
    is when the crowd goes forward and does not go back
    again? - A. -Just gradually forward all the time.

    Because you talked about first it was a gradual
    movement of people coming on from behind, and then
    more and more surges? - A. Yes.

    And the surges are the movement of people forward and
    then stopping? - A. Yes.

    And you were being propelled forward from the pressure
    from behind, and that is what was happening more and
    more to you as you were on the terraces? - A. That is
    right, yes.

           MR. KING:   I have no further questions,   thank
    you.

Miss Jones, please understand I am not at all
suggesting there is anything wrong with your evidence.
I think I speak for all of us that we are
exceptionally impressed with the way you have given
your evidence, today. I just want to focus on that
photograph that is behind you.

     THE CORONER:   It is the one, I think, in front of
you as we l l .

     MR. CATCHPOLE:  Do you remember that there was a
Preliminary Inquest into Richard and Tracy's death,
and I believe the family may have viewed some video
evidence and some photographic evidence, and you
identified yourself on that photograph, and then
Richard was identified inside the ground on a video?
Do you have any recollection of that? - A. No.   I am
not quite sure which one you are talking about. We
saw that many photographs and videos looking for them.

If I could just read you a passage from the evidence
that was given by Inspector Layton at Richard's
Inquest.   For your note, sir, it is page 1,150, and it
just says:

     "On a BBC video tape, reference MAPI, timed at
     14.56, 3104, Richard was shown alive in Enclosure
     No.3", that is inside the ground at 4 minutes to


Do you have any recollection of that? - A.   Not
really, no.

It does not matter, but if that is right, you would
agree with me, I presume that whatever gate you were
up against, it looks likely that you were in the
ground along with Richard at 4 minutes to 3, if that
video reference is right, do you agree? - A. I don't
think it can be, because we were seen outside at 4
minutes to 3, weren't we?

No, that is 6 minutes to 3.   So it looks as if it took
2 minutes from when we see you on that photograph for
you to get down into the tunnel onto the terraces, or
at least it took Richard that long, and we presume
that you were with him throughout that time? - A.
Well, I would presume so.

                         Q.   Please understand
                                                  S. L. .JONES




Please understand, everyone here has seen enough
witnesses to know that things get very confused,
particularly when you go through s o m e t h i n g 'like that.
There is absolutely no criticisa at all - we all know
you are trying to help us as    best you can, but it does
seem that iUchard was inside the ground, and I am right
in understanding that as far as you remember you were
with him right the way into the terraces? - A. Yes.

Thank you.  Just one other small point that I should
raise with you.   Can I remind you of the evidence you
gave in answer to.the Coroner on the question of once
you were inside the ground?   You actually said you
could only see the tunnel, and that Richard said, "Just
go down the tunnel", and you went down and it was
reasonably clear.. Is that, in fact,, shat happened?. -
A. Yes.

Thank you very much.

          • Cross-Examined by     HRS.McBRIEH    .

Stephanie, I am trying to unravel this mystery about
when you actually went in there, and this is how I see
it.  You say when you were in the crowd, when there
were a lot of people around you, that you did see a
large metal gate, a concertina gate? — A. Yes.

So there is no confusion about the perimeter gates and
that gate, that does seem to be the concertina gate.
h o w , when you were there you saw it opening once, you
said, and you were too far away at the time to go
through it, but you did mention that it wasn't opened
very wide at the time? - A. No, it wasn't.

Just a few feet? - A. Just a few inches really.

     MRS. McBRIEN:    Frora evidence that we have it
seems ^to me that it was the 2.48 opening, t n a t , because
I don t think the other openings, it was opened wide
the next time, wasn't it, sir?

    _THE CORONER:   You are quite right.   2.48 was a
partial opening, sore than a few inches but it wasn't
opened very wide, and then at 2..52 it was opened
widely. You are quite correct in your recollection.

     MRS. McBRIEN:   So it seems to iae that that was
tne first opening that you sail. Now, when you saw that
you said that Richard said, "If it opens again we'.re
going in , that is correct, isn't it? - A. Yes.

And of course it was opened like you said, and you do
remember going through it with the crowd.  From what I
                                                S. L. JONES




can work out it seems that you went through on the
second opening, and maybe the photograph has got the
wrong time on it.

     HRS. McBRIEN:   That is the only thing I can think
of, if you don't mind my saying so.  I think Stephanie
has given very good evidence, absolutely - — it is so
clear, and yet we have got this mystery here.  That is
the only way I can work it out.

     THE CORONER:'  Well, Stephanie can't answer that
question.  In fact, I can't answer it either.

     MRS. McBRIEN:   It is just a real puzzle.
Everything seemed so clear, sir, apart from that.

      THE COROWER:   It is highly unlikely actually that
the times are wrong except for this siinute, because
there is a photograph, and that is why one knows the
tirae, where the time is printed on it and the clock is
on^it as well, so you can time it twice by the number
printed and by the clock face, and it is a wiinute out,
that is where this minute is corning frota. It is an
interesting thought, I agree, but I don't think it
works.

     MRS. McBRIEN:    I think it is a mystery because
Stephanie did say that when she went down the tunnel
and got to the terrace end of the tunnel it wasn't
crowded.   If she had gone in the final time it would
have been.   It is not really adding up properly.

     TilE CORONER:.  I think that we can't take it any
further.   I can see that there is a problem here.

     MRS. McBRIEN t    Thank you very much, Stephanie.

     THE   CORONER:   Yes, Mr. Hale.

     MR. HALE:   Iam sorry, a crucial point, which
this witness has to bear because it has been put to
her, and I would like to ask her about the crowd
pressure.

           Further Cross-Examined by MR. HALE

It has been put to you that with crowd pressure you had
no choice, that is right, isn't it? - A. That is right.

But is it right that a crowd like that is not like a
river, is it?  A river only goes one way, doesn't it?
If you were in a river in those circumstances, a strong
current, you could only go the way the river takes you,
tnat is right, isn't it? - A. Yes.
                                                                         39


                                                        S.    L. JONES




    3.   But that crowd was made up of individuals like
         yourself, that is right? - A. Yes.
B Q.     All having a thinking brain, is that     right? - A. Yes.

    Q.    Suppose fire had suddenly broken out in front of you,
         which way do you think the crowd would have gone then?
         - A. It is difficult to say, because the people at the
         front who are by the fire are going to want to go back,
         but the people at the back who rsaybe can't sea the fire
         •• • •

    Q.    No, the people at the back can see the fire, sea the
         danger. - A. Well, you are all going to go theother
         way if everyone can see the fire.

     . You are all    going to go the other way, that's right.
       So the way    in which a crowd moves depends upon the
       individual    will of the people who make it up? - A. It
       depends on    everyone if it is a large crowd.
D    . That's right, but if everybody in the crowd .... - A.
       You can't have half and half though.

     . Well if you had half and half you might have a
       staleEiate, neither going forward nor going backward? -
       A. Exactly.

     . That is right. - A. And with the large amount         of people
       you find you are having problems.

     . In the circumstances there were more people wanting to
       continue pressing forward than there were who were
       afraid for their lives like you, and would have liked
       to stand still or hold back a bit, is that right? - A.
       Everyone was there for the one reason, to go and see a
       match, so everyone wants to go forward.

     . Yes, but some of you were getting rather concerned ....
       - A. At tnat tiiae I was slightly worried but I didn't
       think that anyone was going to get killed.

     . Yes.  He have heard froaa other witnesses who would have
       liked to have stopped and to have got out but they
       couldn't. - A. Yes.

    Q.   That is because there were more wanting to     go forward
         than were wanting to stop and cone back? -     A. Yes.

                         Further by THE COROHER

    Q. The problem it is not that anybody is disbelieving you
       - on the contrary everybody is believing you. - A. It's
       okay.



H
But everybody is fitting the account to the times.    You
can see what I aia saying? - A. Yes.

Because if   it is right that Richard    was seen on the
terrace at   14.56 then it is impossible for you to have
entered at   14.59, isn't it, because    that is three
minutes earlier? - A. I think that must be wrong, the
picture, to be honest with you.   I think the picture
must be wrong.

Which picture? - A. Of Richard on the terraces.

     THE CORONER:   That is something that I think ---
we will have to get the family to review that bit of
evidence because it would obviously be helpful.     Ladies
and gentlemen, Mr. Catchpole knows this because he was
there, and indeed Mrs. McBrien was - t h e 'problem of
identification is a very major problem.     It isn't half
as easy as we think and I know that many families spent
hours and hours and hours trying to       do    it, and
sometimes they succeeded, sometimes       they have done an
identification and then soeietisnes they have reviewed it
at a later date.  In fact, I think Mr. Traynor was
mentioned on the first day - we haven't yet corrected
that - so it is a difficult problem.

Don't worry.  The fact that one has to look atit again
is neither here nor there, all I am concerned about and
interested in, if you like, is to try and get the facts
as near as we can.  What you are saying is you are sure
that you were pressed against the concertina gate,
right? - A. Well, yes.

And you based it, because you know that once you got
through that gate you were in the concourse area? - A.
Yes, the tunnel was in front.

The tunnel was in front of you, and not 20 or 30 yards
away and negotiate another huge crowd, that is rignt,
isn't it?  - A. Yes.  I agree about the fans on the
wall, it may have been by the pariraeter gate, but I can
only assume that I meant that before, about seeing the
fans oh the wall.

That was, in fact, how I read your statement, that
there was pressure before, that you saw the fans, that
you then moved in - and in fact, I asked you this, "Did
you see the gate open'', and Richard then said, "i’ext
time it opens we are going in"? - A. Yes.

And you gradually got nearer to the gate and then it
opened and you went through, that is right, isn't it? -
A. Yes.
                                                                            41

    ). Sorry, I haven t quite finished.   There is something
       else I wanted to ask.  Mr. Hale to a certain extent has
       dealt with the point, but it is right, isn't it,
B      Stephanie, you have explained to cae that you couldn't
       do anything about it because people were pressing
       behind? - A. No, you couldn't.

    3* That is right, but you would accept, wouldn't you, taat
       a crowd is made up of individuals, isn't it? - A. Yes.

      And if each individual person had stood still - if, I
      aia not saying that they did - if they had stood still
      outside the gates, you too would not have been pushed
      forward, that is right, isn't it? - A. Yes, but that is
      just not going to happen, is it?

    Q. Okay, that is fair enough, but I ani just asking you
       whether that is correct? - A. Yes.

       This is a question which we haven't broached yet and I
       just want to ask you this, did you know, and would it
       have Gtade any difference to you if you had known, that
       the ground had a licence to hold football matches? - A.
       Had a ...?

       A licence, that it had been licensed for football
       matches. - A. It w o u l d n 't have made any difference.

    Q. You didn't know it? - A. What do you mean?

     . That is all right, you have answered ray question.  I as
       trying to find out - this ground was licensed, there is
       a procedure for licensing football grounds, and what I
       ara trying to find out from a few of the fans is whether
       the fans knew this, and I haven't found one yet who
       did, and you didn't know it either? - A. No.

              THE CORONER:      Mr. King, yes.

            MR. KING:        Might I ask a question arising out of
       your question?

              THE CORONER: Which one, the     moaientura   one?  Yes.
       I am    not trying to  undermine you, Mr. King,     at all.

            MR. KING:    No, no.   It is an important, not only
       interesting but an   important point on crowd behaviour
       and expectations.

       answer, "It is just not going to happen".  Could you
       explain why you say that? - A. When you want to go
       somewhere you are not going to get anywhere if you
B      stand still, are you?        —

       Yes.  You have been to many football matches.   How
       realistic is it, from your experience, to put forward
       the proposition that a football crowd going into a
       game, shortly before kick-off, it is all suddenly going
       to stop still?   How realistic does that seem to you? -
       A. It is stupid.   It is not going to happen.

            THE CQKGIiER:  Mr. King, I will just follow it up
       with another one and I will give you an opportunity
       because it is actually very convenient because
       Stephanie is (a) a good witness, if I may say so, (b) a
       relative.

                      Further by THE CQROMER

    Q. I think as you are so helpful and kind we are taking
       advantage.  Have you been to the theatre?   Do you ever
       go to the theatre? — A. Yes.

    Q. Or the cinema? - A. I go to the cinema all the time.

    Q. You do? - A. Yes.

    Q. And do crowds go into those areas as well? - A. Yes.

    Q. Do you find that the behaviour of those crowds is any
       different to the behaviour of a football crowd? - A. I
       wouldn't say the behaviour.  I go to the match more for
       the atmosphere, because of the great atmosphere in the
       Kop, and that is why I go to the match, so  it is
       different in that way, I would say.

    Q. But for example, you would be surprised if you went
       down the corridor in the cinema complex and people were
       urinating against tne walls there?  You would think
       that that was a little unusual? - A. There is plenty of
       toilets there.

    Q. Yes.  Have you found that people when they want to go
       in and see a filsa are also pressing forward in the same
       sort of way as you have described the pressure which
       you were experiencing? - A. Hot really.   You don't get
       that sort of people, amount of people going to tne
       theatre.

    Q. You don't get as many, of course, I agree, I accept
       that, but of course you have got a smaller space as
       well because the stadium seats 55,000 and the cinema
       might seat 500, I don't know, so obviously you are

Q. This is probably unfair, but if you had been in charge
   yourself, given the task: of preparing for a big football
   match and you were- having to say to yourself, "What can I
   expect?" - you haven't been yet and you have got to try
   and think what it is going to be like.    Do you think it
   would be sensible to go to the cinema and say to
   yourself, "Well, I will go to the local cinema.    If I
   was in London I would go to Covent Garden, because we are
   going to find a situation which is roughly the same as a
   football match."    In other words, from your experience
   is it a fair comparison - a football crowd and a football
   match on the one hand and a queue of people waiting to go
   into the cinema - is it the same thing? - A. No, it
   isn't.   It's not a comparison at all, I don't think,
   -sorry.

Q. Let me explore this slightly.  At a cinema, is it right
   you have a queue, often just one queue coming out of the
   cinema going along the pavement? - A. Yes, normally.

Q. Have you ever known in a cinema 4,000 or 5,000 people all
   being asked to go through the same small number of
   entrances? - A. No.

        MR. KING:      I could develop it, but I won't:

Q. The point being made - and I am not being rude to the
   learned Coroner, it is an important point - is is it
   sensible to view matters by reference to a cinema crowd
   or a football crowd? - A. No, it isn't.

        THE CORONER:      I think we will leave this point.

   A. Perhaps.   I don't know how many fans they have.   Not
   as many as Liverpool Football Club have.

        THE CORONER:   This is a very difficult problem, Mr.
   King, because the problem is sorting out whether football
   crowds are intrinsically different.   You know, are they
   made up of a different category of person from other
   humans beings and, of course, there are implications
   whichever way you answer that.

          THE CORONER:   This is what I was_tryi ng...  I took
     the opportunity because we had a charming witness and I
     thought we would just explore it a little bit.

          MR. KING:   I agree, sir, because it goes very
     importantly to matters as to what one should expect, what
     one should anticipate.

          MR. PAYNE:   I am not going to intervene in this
     discussion, but if that kind of illustration is going to
     be put to witnesses, then it ought not to be confined to
     cinemas, but it could be applied, for example, to rugby
     league matches or to rugby union matches.

          THE CORONER:   Indeed, we could go on, and I suppose
     you could criticise me for having put it to the witness
     and it may not have been entirely fair, but she has given
     quite a good account of herself on it.

             Further Cross-Examined by MRS. M c B R I E N :

Q. Mr. Hale mentioned that if you had known there was a fire
   in front of you, or the crowd with you that day had seen
   a fire, they would have done something about it.    Now,
   Stephanie, you would not think there was danger ahead,
   would you, that day? - A. Well, if you  could not have
   seen it.   He said I could though.

Q.    There was only a hidden danger ahead, wasn't there?     A
     hidden one? - A. I suppose so.

Q. There has been a lot said about the behaviour of the fans
   waiting to go into the football ground.   Now it was
   close to kick-off time, wasn't it? - A. Yes.

Q.   And it was a semi-final match? - A. Yes.

Q.   It could not be compared with a queue at acinema, could
     it?    It was a different thing altogether?   A big
     occasion? - A. Yes.

0v. Now the crowd as far as I can make out were not doing
    anything unusual really, they just wanted to get in to
    see the match.   Would it have made a difference to the
    crowd if someone had announced that the game    was going^to
    be delayed? - A. I don't think so.     I mean, it wouldn't
    have mattered really.    It would have given everyone a
    lot more time to get in.

Q. You still think they would have pushed forward even
   though they had half an hour, for instance, to wait?       - A.
   Well, no.
                                                              4b



                                            S. L. JONES


Q. If you had more time - I was thinking maybe the fans were
   arfxious to get in because they were running out of time.
   That was the reason for their behaviour, not just because
   they wanted to push each other?     Do you agree? - A.
   Well, yes.    It s a difficult question to answer.    I
   mean, if the match had been put back a bit more it would
   have given more time to filter people off to different
   sections perhaps.    As it was the bulk of the crowd went
   in all at once and that just was no good, was it?

Q.    So all they needed was time really? - A. Well, more time
     would have helped a great deal I should imagine.

                     Further by THE CORONER:

Q. Stephanie, I need to ask you this.   You have already
   told me but I need to be absolutely sure about this.
   You did not hear any announcements made? - A. No.

Q.    You didn't see a loud speaker van or anything like, or       a
     Land Rover? - A. No.

Q. You heard nothing? - A. Definitely not.

Q. Definitely not.       You are absolutely sure? - A. Yes.

          THE CORONER:   Thank you very much.    Now then,
     Stephanie, you have already been complimented up and down
     dale, and I am very very grateful to you for coming and
     for being here and for yesterday as well.    I am sorry
     about that.  I think you have quitted yourself well.
     You are a credit to your mum and dad.    I am sure they
     were proud of you this afternoon.

          I think we will arrange for this video to be re­
     viewed, if you and the family are happy, to see whether
     the identification on the terrace is confirmed.  We will
     just have a think about it.   OK?

          THE WITNESS:     OK.

          THE CORONER:   It is up to you, of course, and your
     mum and dad.   It is not for me to say that they must.
     It is just a matter of trying to sort it out:

Q. Oh, Stephanie, we want you to put a cross on the little
   plan.    Show Stephanie which is enclosure 3.   I want you
   to put a cross where you first exited on to the terrace
   where in fact you were, and you were in -fact aiming to go
   forward?    In other words, before you felt the - I think
   we have used the word "shove" - from behind.    Can you
   put a cross there? - A. I can't honestly say.
                                                                   47



                                             S. L. JONES


Q. Can you remember where you finished up after the first
   big shove? - A. No.   The only time I can remember, it
   was just a constant shove right the way down.  I didn't
   really stop.

Q.   You really only remember yourself at the gate, is that
     right?   I'm sorry, what were you going to say? - A. The
     only time I really know is when I was at the bottom by
     the gate before I got out.

Q. Put your cross down there.   So just inside by the gate,
   is that right? - A. Yes, when I came out of the gate I
   came out to the right of the goal post.

Q.    Yes, that is right, I remember that.     Thank you.     We
     will give it a C" number.     (C.302)

          THE CORONER:    Stephanie,   thank you very much.        We
     have finished.

          Ladies and gentlemen, we have finished today.
     Before I let you go we have been thinking about the times
     for starting and stopping on Monday and Fridays, not the
     other days.    If I   were to say to you that we would start
     on Monday at 10.30 instead    of 10.00 and on Friday we will
     start at 9.30 and aim to finish at 3,30 - you will
     realise that "aim" is not quite the same thing as
     achievement - but aim to finish at 3.30, would that sound
     acceptable to you?      If it sounds acceptable to you, then
     I will sort out whether it sounds acceptable to the
     lawyers.    We think it might be easier because a lot of
     people have to travel, including me as well.      You
     wouldn't mind if I made those changes.

                  (In the absence of the jury)

          THE CORONER:   You heard .what I said to the jury.
     We thought that might be a bit easier if we start on
     Monday at 10.30.

          MR. KING:   I have not canvassed it yet with my
     colleagues, but certainly I would have thought that was a
     sensible idea.

          THE CORONER:   Is there anybody who feels very
     strongly that would be jolly inconvenient?   If we start
     at 10.00 on Friday and finish at 3.30 we have actually
     lost a whole hour and I thought if we started at 9.30 on
     Friday we are only sacrificing half an hour, and aim to
     finish at 3.30 rather than 4.00.   Whether we make it is
     another matter.    Are you happy with that as well?

          MR. KING:   Sir, I haven't consulted any.ijf my
     friends on this idea which I am merely floating, sir.
The way we look ahead it would appear that we are going
to go well into January and it might even go slightly
beyond that - I know not.   The prospect of five days a
week now until that period without any opportunity to
gather one's thoughts about other matters, although one
accepts it as one does as a professional person, is
perhaps one which if one didn't have before you, one
would welcome, that is to say, the possibility of a day
off now and again during the week.   In other words, a
business day off.    The only idea I have, sir, is that
now and again one could perhaps have a long weekend.    In
other words, starting the week on the Tuesday rather than
the Monday.   I am not suggesting for one moment every
week but just now and again so as to give the opportunity
of dealing with other matters which, of course, are
gathering around us all.

     THE CORONER:   Indeed,   you are quite right.

     MR. KING:   Sir, the only quid pro quo I could put
in the balance is this:  whether or not, sir, four
o'clock is necessarily the right time to finish.   I know
sometimes we go on to half past four and I for one have
not found that too much of a burden.   I know we have the
jury but we do have plenty of breaks, sir, and I don't
know whether perhaps a 4.30 finish might give us that
extra half hour which would enable us to complete more
witnesses.

     THE CORONER:   I will think about your suggestion,
Mr. King.

     With regard to taking the days off, in some ways I
would like that because it would make my life a great
deal easier, but there is a very real problem with the
jury because if we have the jury for X number of weeks,
they are expected to go back to work on any day when they
aren't in attendance.   To expect them to have a day off,
go back to work, or alternatively be penniless for that
day if I can put it plainly, I don't like that.

     Secondly it might happen, in fact I fear it will
happen at some point during this period we are going to
have to have a day off because somebody will be ill.    I
hope not.   Although that is an unplanned break, we would
have to use it because it would be there.

     I am not rejecting that out of hand because
fortunately we are doing, if you like, a five week stint
and then we are going to have two and half to three weeks
off before we resume in January which will make it a
little bit easier.
                                                      49




      With regard to the time, I have thought of putting
it' back a little bit but we overshoot already and if we
plan to finish at 4.30 all that will happen is that we
overshoot to 5.00.




         At the moment I am
At the moment I am inclined to say, four and understand
that we may well overshoot which on the whole we have done
and 'then review it as we go along.

    I am hoping, firstly, that it may be possible that
progress will be faster after the initial few weeks because
we will have gone over a lot of ground and it will be
possible to take things more shortly and, secondly, it may
be that I will review the list of witnesses in the light of
the evidence which we have got.  I think that atthe rate
we are going it is inevitable we are going to go well into
January.  I cannot see any prospect of avoiding that.
However fast we go, if we are to do it reasonably
thoroughly it will take that long.

     MR. MANNING:    We are just sort of opening our hearts
at the moment.

     THE CORONER:   Indeed, yes.

     MR. MANNING:   An unplanned day off is pretty
disastrous.   It is disastrous for everybody.   We all come
and then.find we cannot go ahead and there is nothing that
any of us can do about that.   I am very much with Mr. King
in relation to at least a planned something and purely
voicing a thought as to life after this, if you like,
outside this.   It must be hard enough as well for the Jury
to do anything, shopping, public commitments as well as
professional commitments and I just wondered perhaps about
haying just one or two 9.30 starts but in return having a
Friday afternoon off.   in other words, rather than coming
for an hour or an hour and a half on a Friday afternoon,
actually saying that we will take a late lunch and we will
have Friday afternoon off, full stop.

     THE CORONER:   Thank you very much, Mr. Manning.

     MR. HALE:   I think I speak for M r . Maxwell as well,
sir, when I say that we would not like to go over four
o'clock except where it is absolutely unavoidable.

     MR. MAXWELL:   I will speak for myself now, sir.  What
concerns me is whether we along this row could not achieve
greater efficiency by avoiding the repetition which seems
to creep in and you, sir, with your limitless patience
allow it.  It may be if you felt it appropriate to remind
us of the need to avoid repetition - I do not say may be -
I am sure none of us would take it amiss because it would
remind ourselves of the need to avoid that repetition which
increasingly is creeping into this as each witness is taken
through episodes time and time again.  I feel, although I
may have repeated myself far more than anyone by saying I
have no questions, this is a matter where we can achieve
greater proficiency for you.
                                                            51




     THE CORONER:   Does anybody want to say anything about
that'because it is a good point-  No, no, pass the message
up to Mr. King and he will tell me.  Let me say what X want
to say for a moment but, Mr. King, what does Mr. Hicks want
to say?

     MR. KING:   I was going to say that if I did have a
day off it would not come out of the pocket of those
people-  He is making a serious point which I have in my
mind which is that time is money.

     THE CORONER:     Indeed.

     MR. KING:   Everyone here is having to be funded out
of the pocket of private individuals.

     THE CORONER:   I am very conscious of that.   I have
been very conscious of that point you have made, Mr.
Maxwell, and because I am not blind I can see how many
representatives are here.   I am out of touch with the sort
of fees which are current these days but it obviously is a
substantial sum of money we are consuming each day and I am
very, very conscious of it.   I am not just talking about my
costs but all the costs.  I have been aware we have been
repeating certain things and I am also aware that I have
not been quite as fierce as I fear some of my colleagues
might have been with some of the questioning but it has
been deliberate.  I felt particularly in the beginning that
I wanted you to have the opportunity to put your questions
and let you have a chance to ask what you felt you wanted
to and develop it as far as possible.   I know occasionally
I have disagreed with one or two questions but on the whole
I have no t.

      Are we saying in fact   that we are (a) going into this
too deeply or (b) that we ought to tighten up on -        using
Mr. Maxwell's word - repetition?    I am willing to listen to
you on this because I want    to conduct this Inquest     sothat
the Jury can form a proper    judgment.   That is the
objective.   I do not want to put them into a position where
they come in with a verdict on which they have not heard
the evidence.   On the other hand, I do not want to tell
them more than is absolutely necessary to enable them to do
tha t.

     MR. PAYNE:   I am early in the batting order and so I
am not the butt of any criticism by Mr. Maxwell but I would
like to speak, if I may, because it is probably easier for
me to say something than it is for p e o p l e •further down the
row.  Each of those people has got a very real interest to
look after in this Inquest and each of them has got to be
concerned with that particular interest.        I certainly would
not like anybody to feel there was any pressure to restrict
                                                          52




their efforts to look after their own particular concerns.
I do appreciate that sometimes that does look like
repetition but quite often a question is being asked to
explore a point which does not always come out right-   That
does not mean that a person has not got in mind something
which they particularly want to elicit-  X am saying that
on behalf of people who might appear to be repetitious but
who might not be so.
     MR. KING:   Sir, I tend to have sympathy with that
point of view.  For whatever reason there are a number of
interests represented here and I have been conscious, sir,
of your generosity in allowing those of us who are a
certain way along the opportunity to return when matters
are raised further along the line which have not been
developed or anticipated at the time when any one of us was
looking after our own particular interests.

        If we are speaking openly and the Jury are not here,
sir, the interests very broadly can be divided into ~ I am
almost tempted to say two camps — three camps.     There is,
if I can put it broadly, the Police camp.     There is,
putting it broadly, the family camp.     It may have seemed on
occasions, and it is not meant to be, sir, and I very often
find myself on occasions not wishing it to be, that those
representing the family camp, basically myself and Mrs.
McBrien, are finding ourselves looking after the interests
of the much wider world, that is to say, the wider world of
when we had observations made on fans' behaviour, drink and
so forth.     One is concentrating one's mind and one hopes
o n e 's presentation of questions on what the Jury have to be
looking to which is, of course, the cause.     Of course,
there are the reasons and that is what one is looking at.

     Sir, it is difficult.  One of the problems we have,
speaking frankly and openly, is the Police interest which
quite understandably is split.  It is split into a number
of interests because there are individual Officers who have
a concern but the result of that is sometimes questions are
asked of a particular interest which, in fact, is no more
than the general Police interest rather than that specific
Officer’s interest.  I can understand how that happens,
sir, because it is very difficult to divide the two but
that is where there is a danger of repetition.  I tend to
agree with my learned friend that it is inevitable when you
have those interests split up in that w a y .

     I would prefer not to be in a position from my point
of view of feeling so restricted that one did not fulfil
one's own professional duty to those one represents but I
know that is a difficult task, sir.

      THE CORONER:   Mrs. McBrien, did you want to say
 something?
                                                        53




      MRS. McBRIEN:   Yes, please.  I want to thank Mr.
Payrfe for the point he has just made.  I think it is very
considerate of him to say the things he did and the more
thoroughly this matter is investigated the happier I shall
be personally.   I am very happy with the way you are
dealing with it, sir.

     THE CORONER:   That is very kind of you.

     MRS. McBRlEN:   I am more than happy and   that is all I
have to say.  Thank you.

     MR. CATCHPOLE:   I rise simply to raise the question
of whether we are going into this in too much depth and I
hope I speak for all of us here.   You are the only person,
sir, who can have that burden of deciding because, as has
been said by my learned friends, we all do have different
interests and it would not be right for any one of us to
say, "I think we have had enough on that one".   X believe
all of us would say that that question, difficult as it is,
is for you, sir. We cannot help you on it I am afraid.

     THE CORONER:    I was not expecting you to tell me that
but, on the other hand, one can get a certain amount of
feedback, so to speak.   At this point the Jury are not here
and so we are really discussing procedural matters more
than anything else.   I feel we either do it properly or we
do not do it at all.   That was my sort of basic
proposition.

     What I am a little bit concerned about is spending a
great deal of time on what I would call issues of civil
liability which, at the end of the day, will not feature in
the verdicts and will be excluded almost automatically from
any summing up.  The difficulty is that it is sometimes
necessary to deal with those points in order to establish,
or to try and establish, whether or not the possible
verdicts which could conceivably be left with the Jury have
any merit.  The dilemma which I am in is judging quite
where to take the cut off point. As I say, my present
inclination is to be very flexible and to allow pretty full
discussion.  I would, as I say, anticipate that as we get
to the fiftieth supporter - just to name that group - that
it may not be necessary to go over every detail of what
happened outside the turnstiles.

      At the moment I think it is necessary because there
were 55,000 people there and 24,000 at the Leppings Lane
end.  If we call 300 witnesses we are taking point
something of a per cent and so we are taking a very small
percentage of the people who were there.  That is the
problem.  There is such a vast body of evidence there and I
have tried to select out of that sufficient.  You can call
                                                        54




just one witness, if you like, to say there a crush but it
would not give the Jury a feel for the incident and this is
one of the reasons why I am doing it.  I am thinking about


    X am very conscious about (a) the time and (b) the
cost.   If need be we will perhaps have another session
where we can discuss the procedure and mechanical matters
but I am not asking you to say this is enough.   The only
possible thing I could say, and I just throw this out as a
thought and will not help most of you but particularly Mr.
Maxwell, is that you know very well that one of the
verdicts which is a possibility and I say no more is that
there is an open verdict, accidental death and then there
is the verdict of unlawfully killed.   If it were not for
that latter one we would not have to go into the detail in
which we are going to now.

     The issue really is whether that latter verdict is
actually feasible, shall we say, against either Mr.
Maxwell's client or yours to name two.   If you were at some
point to rise and say, "Yes, we think there may have been
mistakes there but from what we know we really do not think
we can press that point", then it might make things easier
for Mr. Maxwell and yourself to decide whether it is really
necessary for you to be here throughout.




                                     / I think i t .
                                                   55




I think it would be necessary for you to be here at
some point because when we come to dealing with the
  icensing, which I do intend to deal with, either to a
greater or lesser extent, ditto we are going to hear
irom Dr. Eastwood, it is totally unavoidable because,
ri 5-ourse» i,: has a bearing on, if nothing else, the
i r r ’ii.8?  is absolutely vital that we hear from him,
out that does not necessarily mean that you are in
peril, so to speak, with regard to the verdict.

     Of course you know, as I do, that the verdict
will not name anyone, so nobody is going to say it was
him, or her, or that police officer, or anybody else.
So in the end, if the Jury were to bring in that
verdict, whom or, if it is more than one, how many of
them they have in mind.  But that is the system in
Coroners' Courts.

     But what I am saying is if the parties were to
say, "We accept that this is not going to be
possible", then it might help the representatives to
decide what level they wish to be present and for how
long, and may save some costs, but not costs for those
who want to be still here.  Have I made myself clear
on that point?

     MR. PAYNE: Sir, you have made yourself clear as
to what is passing through your mind.  May I say that
our response to that would be that, sir, you have
referred, not directly but in what you have said, to
Rule 42 of the Coroner's Rules.

     THE CORONER:  That is the one about the framing
of the verdict, is it not?

     MR. PAYNE:  Yes that is right, the one about the
framing of the verdict. It is at page 390.

     THE CORONER:   Yes,   I have got it.

     MR. PAYNE:  It says as you can see.  I think the
point that immediately springs to mind is that if one
were to proceed by eliminating various categories,
then this would have the effect of producing a result
which is intended to be ruled out by Rule 42.   So we
would resist the idea of eliminating particular
categories of candidate.

     THE CORONER:  That can happen anyway,because at
the end of the day   when I have heard all theevidence,
I think it is R -v- McKlrvin or R -v- Higgins - I
can't remember which case it is now but I think it is
Higgins actually - it is quite clear that the Court of
Appeal said that if the Coroner is satisfied that
' there is no evidence which could possibly be left to
  the Jury, then he must withdraw that particular
  verdict.   So I accept your point, but it does not
  necessarily follow that at the end of the day you do
  not or may not actually exclude various groups 7^
  categories, persons, or what-have-you, because I feel
  that on the evidence there is no possible way in which
  one could bring such a verdict.

      MR. PAYNE:  If, as the evidence progresses, you
 were to reach the conclusion that a particular verdict
 were not on the cards at all against anyone, then it
 would be appropriate to give that indication at an
 early stage.  Of course, if that were of general
 application, there could be no objection to that.   The
 only reason I rose was to avoid the possibility of
 particular candidates being eliminated or included.

      THE CORONER:  You are quite right, and this is
 one of the reasons why I didn't, if you like, exclude
 anybody from the word "go", partly because of the
 point that you have just made and partly because
 although, of course, I have had the benefit of reading
 I do not know how many hundreds of statements, my
 experience has not taught me much, but it has taught
 me that you cannot always rely on the statements, and
 the evidence which you get at the hearing may be
 different.

      MR. PAYNE:   Quite.

      THE CORONER:  Or have a different import, or a
 different emphasis, and so what you might think is A
 turns out to be B, and that is, of course, a major
 difficulty.  But you have told me what you think on
 that and I appreciate it.

     MR. KING:  Sir, can I make my position clear.   It
would not be possible at this stage on behalf of the
families I represent to, in effect, give an
undertaking that they were seeking a verdict of
unlawful killing only against one particular party.
At this stage my instructions are very firm on that,
and that, fortunately or unfortunately as the case may
be, one has to keep everyone in the frame, as it were.

     THE CORONER:  Very well.  That is, in many
respects, very helpful, and certainly- very helpful to
me because it confirms, if you like, my feeling that
it is necessary to go into this in depth, as far as

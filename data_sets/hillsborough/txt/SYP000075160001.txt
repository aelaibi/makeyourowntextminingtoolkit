There       were      several        Police           Officers          along        the       route,        s ome w h o        were

directing           the     traffic.         I didn't             see a n y         giving        directions              to    the

/J? ou n d ,    but    they weren 't              necessary             because           you     just       followed           the       crowd.

We a r r i v e d      at    the     entrance           to the          g r o u n d at a b o u t         2 . 0 0 p m,      at    t hat      time

there       were      lots     of    people           hanging          a b o u t but       not     going        towards          the

turnstiles.            We w e n t      through             the    turnstiles              with     no    trouble           at all.

There       were      a few P o l i c e         standing              about      the      turnstile            area       but    they

were     not      giving      any      directions.                I have         been      to     the    ground           before,          so

had    no      difficulty           in f i n d i n g        my    entrance           point.        There        were       also       a

couple         of S t e w a r d s    outside           the       turnstiles              but    t h e y w e r e n ’t g i v i n g

directions            either.        There        was       about       f i ve      of    them     the       other        side       of    the

turnstiles,            in a b u n c h        ju st         talking        to     each      othe r.        I handed my                ticket

in at       the     turnstile         as     I went          through.

I did       not    see      any     gates       o pe n e d ,      or a n y       unauthorised                entry        to    the

g round.

When ye         had    passed        through           the       turnstile           we w e n t       through          the

\usrfie 1 w i t h      ’s t a n d i n g ’ o v e r          the    top.       We w e n t        through         the     tunnel         very

easily,         and    then       turned        left at           the     end a nd         i n t o P e n 4,

When     I first           entered Pen            4    it w a s        solid with              p eo ple .      I am 6ft          tall         and

could       see     t hat    there      was       lots       of       room     to    the       left     of     us,     and with           my

two    friends         made       our w a y       to       the    space,         but      t h e n we     saw        the    fence

separating            the    pens      and      stopped           trying         to m o v e       over.

Where       we w e r e      standing         there          were       three        or    four men           between           us a n d       a

crush       barrier.         There      was       a    lot       of    shoving           from     the     back a n d a f t e r            a

while       the m e n       in f r o n t     of       us    ducked        under          the    bar     leaving           us    up

against         it.    After        about       five m inutes                the     crushing           wa s    getting          worse

and    I got u n d e r the bar a n d m y f r i e n d                                      f o l l o w e d me.                         d i d n ’t

come     with       us a n d we        didn't          see       him a g ai n        u n t il     l at e r     on    the       pitch.

I was       talking         to a girl           and        her    father,           the    girl       was      crying          because            of

the      crush.          Then    f iv e       big     lads      came a n d        forced        their way             past       us g o i n g

sideways            to    the    left.         They       had obvi ou sl y             been     drinking,             you     could

smell         it as       they went            by us.          They were          singing          and     just       shoving             people

out      of     the way.         This         was about            2.40pm       (1440).

A few minutes               late r        everyone             started         to m o v e     forwards           because             of    the

pressure            from    the       back,         it w a s       impossible           to    stop yourself.

People          were      obviously            having          difficulty            in b r e a t h i n g ,      I was        telling

them       to    put      the    heads         upwards          if      they    could.        There        was    one       lad to m y

ri g h t      who    h a d his        eyes       s h ut     and was         j u st     leaning        on      p eop le ,      he w a s

facing          the w r o n g      way.        He w a s        covered         in s w e a t     and also          stunk          heavily

of    drin k.

At    this       time      I was         about        6ft      from      the    front        barrier          fen ce.       People          were

shouting            and    screaming             at      the    Police         and Stewards              who     were       by the

barrier.            The    Police         and Stewards                were      telling         us    to      push      b a ck       but    we

c o u l d n ’t.

At about            2.50pm       (1450)          I sa w        two      lads    climb        o ver    thg          m j / b a r rr i e r a n d

took       them      off        to m y rigb'ta n d             pushed       one      of    them      b ack      into       the       pen

through          a g a t e . I d o h / t ytbj^nk he, c o u l d                   get      the      other       on e     in.      I

remember            thinking          why      i^nvl^ohe             Police       do    something             they      can see

w h a t ’s h a p p e n i n g .

A    few m i n ut es            l ater I s a w f o u r             or    five     Stewards standing                   on    the

fencing          and      leaning           o ver to        try a n d       pull       p e o p l e out.        It w a s     only           the

Stewards            rfo i ng this,            the     Policemen were                 just     standing           there.

At    this/time            I was         aware        that      the      game    had      started and             that        there         were

now f         l o a d of    fans         on    the       pitch       side      helping        to     pull      people         over         the

ta y .     The      Police       were         s t il l    not      helping

I put m y           hands       up a l o n g        with       lots      of o t h e r     people         and     eventually                three

lads       p u l l e d me       o ve r    the       top.       I then       lay on        the      grass and            I was         crying

as    I l o o k e d at          the      people          s t ill     behind       the     fen c e .      At    t hi s     time        the

              gate     in the       fence        had    been       opened and          people were         getting     through.

              After      a while         I went        looking        for m y      two    friends       and after      a     long     t i me

              I found        them    both.                   had    torn     the m u s c l e s     in his a r m s     and my         c hest

              f el t   very     tight,

              I have        been asked about                 my    views     on the      way      the   matter   was       handled

              after      the m a t c h w a s          stopped.

              Firstly        the    t a n n ^ ^ r ^ s t e n T was       inadequate         and     should    h av e   been      used     to

              give     advice       to   those         people       who     were      trapped.      Also    I think        t h at    ticket

              allocation           should        be    based       on a v e r a g e    gat es .

                                                                                                                               SIGNED

                             Cross-examined           by MR.     HYTNER:

Q.   Dr. E a s t w o o d , in r e l a t i o n to exit g a t e s from the p e r i m e t e r
     fence, w o u l d it be r i g h t to say t h a t the G r e e n G u i d e is less
     than h e l p f u l and i n d e e d p o s i t i v e l y u n h e l p f u l to t h o s e
     c o n c e r n e d w i t h s a f e t y at f o o t b a l l g r o u n d s ? A.    No.

Q.   Can I put it this way:               you h a v e a g r e e d w i t h Lord j u s t i c e
     T a y l o r and i n d e e d you w e n t f u r t h e r in a g r e e i n g w i t h h i m
     a b o u t the n e e d e i t h e r for two g a t e s or one g a t e w i t h i n
     a n o t h e r to p e r f o r m the d u a l f u n c t i o n s of e n t r a n c e for  the
     P o l i c e and e xi t for fans.           A.        Yes.

Q.   It is right, is it not, t ha t the c r i t e r i a for e a c h are
     w h o l l y i n c o n s i s t e n t one w i t h the o t h e r ?    The P o l i c e w an t
     as n a r r o w a g a t e as p o s s i b l e and p e o p l e l e a v i n g the t e r r a c e s
     as w i d e an e x it ---             A.     I t a k e y o ur po i nt , Mr. H yt n er ,
     and t h at is so but the G u i d e d o e s not h e l p you to s t r i k e
     the b a l a n c e .

Q.   T h a t is ri g ht , but w h a t the G u i d e is t r y i n g to do                 is   to
     r e c o n c i l e the two w h o l l y c o n f l i c t i n g p r i n c i p l e s ;   is   that
     right?           A.   Yes.

Q.   And it w o u l d be m o r e h e l p f u l , w o u l d it not, if the G u i d e
     r e c o g n i s e d t h i s and p e r m i t t e d e n t r a n c e g a t e s for the P o l i c e
     to be as n a r r o w as the P o l i c e             in any a re a w a n t e d t h e m to
     be and r e c o m m e n d e d exits, and I am c e r t a i n l y not g o i n g to
     w a s t e t i m e g o i n g t h r o u g h the v a r i o u s m e t h o d s t h at c o u l d
     be p r o p o s e d , as w i d e as it is p o s s i b l e to d e s i g n c o n s i s t e n t
     w i t h s a f e t y and c o s t ?        A.      That is so, yes.

Q.   Next, w o u l d you a g r e e that on s o m e b o d y ' s p a r t - for the
     m o m e n t I am not s u g g e s t i n g w h o s e - it was a b l u n d e r for
     S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y to put in the r a d i a l f e n c e s w i t h o u t
     i m p l e m e n t i n g your s c h e m e for s e p a r a t e t u r n s t i l e s ?
     A.        It d i d n ' t h a ve to be a b l u n d e r , I d o n â€™t think, Mr.
     H y tn e r.       If t h e r e had b e e n the r e q u i s i t e c o n t r o l of p u t t i n g
     p e o p l e in the v a r i o u s pens, t h e n o b v i o u s l y it c o u l d h av e
     w o r k e d but it did n e ed the c a r e f u l c o n t r o l .              It was a
     c o r o l l a r y of p u t t i n g t h e m in.

Q . Can >ou p o i n t to any d o c u m e n t or r e c a l l any c o n v e r s a t i o n
    w h i c h w o u l d h e l p us to p i n p o i n t a c o n s i d e r a t i o n b e t w e e n
    y o u r s e l f and the C l u b a b o u t the n e ed for s u c h c o n t r o l .
    A.        As I s a id t h is m o r n i n g , this k i nd of c o n v e r s a t i o n was
    g o i n g on all the time.                In the W o r k i n g P a r t y m e e t i n g s ,
    for e x a m p l e , w h e n e v e r s o m e t h i n g of t h i s k i n d w as b e i n g
    done, it wa s for the p u r p o s e of c o n t r o l and it w as o b v i o u s
    to e v e r y b o d y that you did n e ed to c6ntrol the e n t r y into
     these    pens.

Q.    You see, I am         not g o i n g to    go on at l e n g t h on this;                 I am
     only g o i n g to      ask you ----         A.   But no d o c u m e n t .

Q.   --once about          it.     T h e r e is no d o c u m e n t but you do a p p r e c i a t e
     that w i t h o u t    a d o c u m e n t a n y b o d y can say, "Well, t h is w a s
     considered".            A.        Yes.

Q.   Can    you   h e lp   us   --      A.       Can    I ---

Q.    Can I ask you the q u e s t i o n ?          Can you r e c a l l any c o n v e r s a t i o n
     w h i c h r e l a t e d to the m e t h o d by w h i c h such c o n t r o l was to be
     exercised?                A. If you w i l l e x c u s e me, felts.- .H y t n e r , c o u l d
     I j u s t add a l i t t l e to my p r e v i o u s a n s w e r ?       I am s or r y
     that I was i n t e r r u p t i n g you.

Q.    Certainly.             A. I do think, a l t h o u g h o b v i o u s l y I h av e
     l o o k e d at an a w f u l lot of d o c u m e n t s s i n c e I wa s put on
     n o t i c e a few d a y s ago that I may be g i v i n g e v i d e n c e ,
     but I do t h i n k t h a t t h e r e is a d o c u m e n t in the P o l i c e
     files w h i c h    m a k e s it c l e a r t h at t h e y w e r e i n t e n d i n g to
     c o n t r o l the flow i n t o the pens, but I c a n n o t r e c a l l
     w h i c h it is, s o m e w h e r e , that t he y w e r e g o i n g to h a v e
     this f i l l i n g s y s t e m one af t e r the other.           So I t h i n k
     I can r e c a l l a d o c u m e n t .

Q.   I s u p p o s e I o u g h t to ask you to a m p l i f y that.       The only
     m e t h o d that ha s so far b e e n s u g g e s t e d w h i c h has any
     r e m o t e sense, in the s e n s e t h at it c o u l d see, was by
     Mr. E v a n s of the F.A.        A.   Yes.

Q.    And I w i ll see if t h i s         is w h a t you are t h i n k i n g          of,   and
     that was     t ha t you use          the t u r n s t i l e s c o m p u t e r ,   you   fill
     in Pen 1.       A.    Yes.

Q.    W h en the c a p a c i t y of Pen 1 has b e e n r e a c h e d on the c o m p u t e r
     you m o v e        to Pen 2 and t he n Pen 3.               Is that the s o rt of
     t h i n g that you are no w s a y i n g was d i s c u s s e d w i t h the
     Police?            A.     No.      I d o n ' t p e r s o n a l l y t h i n k that that
     was p o s s i b l e , Mr. Evans' s c h e m e , q u i t e l i k e that, b e c a u s e
     p e o p l e c o m e t h r o u g h the t u r n s t i l e s and t h e y go of f to
     the r e f r e s h Eaent r o o m or w h e r e v e r and w h i l e - e v e r t h e r e
     was no g a n g w a y w h i c h m e a n t t ha t s o o n e r or l a t e r they
     got i n to t h a t pen, it t h e n did not m a t t e r w h e t h e r it
     was s o o n e r or later;           they::could go to r e f r e s h m e n t s ,
     but if you had t h a t s y st e m, a s i g n a l from the t u r n s t i l e s
     if a b ig p a r t y or a n u m b e r had gone in and g o n e s o m e w h e r e
     else it d o e s not q u i t e w o r k so it d o e s h a v e to be c o n t r o l l e d
     by v i e w i n g .      I do b e l i e v e t h a t we w i l l find that the
     P o l i c e had s e e n w h a t Mr. E v a n s was s u g g e s t i n g , the f i l l i n g
     of a pen at a t i m e but w i t h o u t any c o n n e c t i o n w i t h it of
     t u r n s t i l e s in a P o l i c e d o c u m e n t .     I may be w r o n g but I
     t h i n k t h e r e is.         So the a n s w e r to yocar v e r y e a r l y q u e s t i o n
     was, yes, I t h i n k t h e r e is a d o c u m e n t .

               MR. H Y T N E R :      Sir, I am not g o i n g to           pursue, because
     it has b e e n d o n e o ve r and ov e r again, the                   i n e f f i c i e n c y of
     c o n t r o l by v i e w i n g .

Q.   Can I now t u r n to s o m e t h i n g a l i t t l e          different?            You

Q.   No?       A.     Consulting        engineer       helping       with    safety      matters.

Q.   Yes, I am sorry.                It was not your remit, as it w e re,                       to
     w a n d e r r o u n d and   r o u n d and c o m e up w i t h s u g g e s t i o n s .
     A.        No.

Q.   Let us s u p p o s e that you had b e e n t a k e n by the Cl u b S e c r e t a r y
     and s h o w n t he L e p p i n g s Lane end, and s u p p o s e he had s a id
     to you, "Dr. E a s t w o o d , we are a l i t t l e c o n c e r n e d .              We

     r e m it to t h i n k up w a y s in w h i c h the t u r n s t i l e a re a c o u l d
     be m a d e s a f e r or w o u l d that h a v e b e e n o u t s i d e your
     c o m p e t e n c e and r e m i t ?     A.     I did do that w i t h four
     schemes.

Q.         L O R D J U S T I C E T A Y LO R :       I am sorry, w i t h w h a t ?
     A.    I did do that.               I p r o d u c e d four s c h e m e s w h i c h     made
     the   t u r n s t i l e a r e a safer.

Q.            MR. H Y T N E R :      I think       you h av e had an o p p o r t u n i t y of
     l o o k i n g at a s u g g e s t e d r e - j i g g i n g of the t u r n s t i l e area.
     I t h i n k t h e r e are s o m e c o p i e s for you, sir.               Mr. C o l l i n s
     has had them.              (H a n d e d )    I do not ne e d to s p e n d any
     t ime on a run up to the w i c k e t , Dr. E a s t w o o d , b e c a u s e
     you h a v e had an o p p o r t u n i t y of s e e i n g that plan.               A. Yes,
     I h a v e s e en it.

Q.   The a c t u a l t u r n s t i l e a r r a n g e m e n t in   r e l a t i o n to the p e n s

     own s c h e m e s for that.         A.          Yes.

Q.   And this, I think, p r o d u c e s    a few m o r e t u r n s t i l e s             but   it
     does not r e a l l y m a t t e r . A.   No.

Q.   What I am m o r e concerned w i t h at t h i s s t a g e of the I n q u i r y
     is j u st to ask you v er y s h o r t l y this.                      Can you see a n y t h i n g
     w h i c h is not f e a s i b l e or a n y t h i n g w h i c h is not p r a c t i c a l

else.        A.   Yes, and they d o n ' t k n ow the          g r o u n d and   they
are u s i n g as t h is a c c o m m o d a t i o n area this   road which        runs
d o w n h er e and w h i c h ---

No, t he y are not, in fact, if you lo o k at it c a r e f u l l y .
That is s i m p l y an o v e r - s p i l l s a f e t y ar e a w h i c h can be
used for fans wh o are in a crush.




                                          A.     Well,    I take     it   that.
                                 68

                                                   W. EASTWOOD

     Q. Well, I take it that they are using this area as an assembly
        area before going to the turnstiles.   Now, the semi-final
        is unique in the games in the year, in that it is the one
        occasion when all supporters of one club are here and all
        supporters of the other club are down there, and normally
        every other Saturday afternoon I walk through there and
        there is a dividing fence, and this is the Â©kit route for
        approximately 5,000 people from the South Stand. Now, it
        does mean that this scheme would still have to incorporate
        the separation area which exists on my scheme. There is
        a fence --

     Q. Well, that would not be very difficult?    A. Oh   no.

     Q. That is a minor alteration? A.   Yes.  It would be possible
         but it would not give the large area that this scheme has,
VJ      and that is no criticism of the designer.

     Q. I am not asking for an imprimatur for that particular plan.
        There would be little difficulty in enlarging the area
        between the turnstiles and the blue gates to enable far
        more people to assemble there and for the police to have
        a larger area in which to control the turnstile crowds?
        A. Yes.

     Q. You agree with that?   A.     Yes.

             Mr. HYTNER: In that case, Dr. Eastwood, I do not need
        to ask you, as it were, to give us the details of the
        improvement to that scheme. Thank you.

             Mr. JACKSON:   I have no questions, sir.

                   Cross-examined by Mr. MULLER:

     Q. Can you help me please first of all by reference to the
        1976 green guide, which I trust you have in front of you?
        Will you look please at 15.2 and 15.3? These are repeated
        elsewhere in the second guide which I can give you too.
        This is "Estimation of safe ground capacity".   A. I am
        with you now.

     Q. 15.2, "The method assess: a. the holding capacity of a
        terrace ... b. the capacity of a given exit route from a
        terrace or stand", and I emphasise the word "given".
        Go now to 15.3:  "The number of people that can be safely
        accommodated on a terrace, however, is either its holding
        capacity or the capacity of thfe exit system from it
        whichever is the smaller".  In general, the position is
        this, therefore, is it not - that one of the things you
        consider is the holding capacity and the other is the rate
        at which people can escape in an emergency?    A. Yes.

     Q. And if you find, by applying the maxium holding capacity
        that the green guide allows for, that that gives you ample
        time to escape, then you would be quite happy if the
        maximum actually is chosen as the capacity, from the point
                           69


                                                W. EASTWOOD

     of view of escape in an emergency?   A.   Would you mind
     repeating the question?   I'm sorry.

Q. It is probably my fault. When you are considering the
   question of escape, if you approach it by discovering what
   the maximum holding capacity is by applying 54 people per
   10 sq. metres, that gives you a certain figure for capacity?
   A. Yes.
Q. Now, providing that gives you what you as a professional
   person (in this case the Fire Brigade) regard as an
   appropriate time or safe time for escape in your
   professional view, then you are not going to be concerned,
   are you, Dr. Eastwood, if the figure is lower than that?
   A. No.

Q. In fact, all it can do is improve on the situation?
   A. Indeed.
Q. You are only going to be concerned, are you not, in terms
   of input, if somebody has any reason to believe that
   somebody is likely to put it higher than 5 4 people per
   10 sq. metres?   A. That is so.

Q. Of course, as far as the Fire Brigade were concerned, their
   interest and concern, as you will have appreciated, was
   with the rate of escape at which people could get out?
   A.   Yes.
Q.   And you yourself carried out just such an exercise early
     on, did you not, when you were looking at the Safety
     Certificate for the first time?   A. Yes.

Q.   And you came to a figure, when the whole of the terrace    was
     one, of something over six miniates? A. That is so.

Q. I do not know whether you have actually done the exercise,
   but it can be done very easily, can it not, because the
   guide provides in 16.2 the recommended flow rates.  16.2
   is the recommended flow rate for a terrace?    A. Yes.

Q. So the mathematical equasion is a very simple one really,
   is it not?   A. It is indeed.

Q. And if you take it from me for the moment, because I have
   done the arithmetic and I do not want to troufeie you doing
   it while you are giving evidence - it may be that someone
   else can check it if it is wrong - if you take, as I think
   is the case, that the tunnel provides on either side three
   unit widths for people to get out, and if you accept the
   figures as have been calculated by the Health and Safety
   Executive in respect, for example, of pen No. 3, which is
   1,015, if you work that out, it comes to 5.38 minutes?
   A. I have done the arithmetic and that is what it comes to.

Q. 5.38 minutes, bearing in mind that this is a concrete stand,
   quite apart from being better than the figure originally put,
   is an ample figure for escape in these circumstances, is it
   not?   A. It is.
Wfrii.
                                  70

                                                       W. EASTWOOD

         Q. And there is plenty of leeway?   A. That is so.

         Q. May I then go to another matter? The green guide also
            enjoins us to consider the possibility of that route not
            being available. We can find that, I think, at 6.13.
            That enjoins us to consider that there should be
            alternative exit routes?   A. Yes.

         Q. You considered that, as obviously did the working party?
            A. Yes.

         Q. And as far as that secondary means of escape is concerned,
            it was to be through the radial gates at the top? A. That's
            it.

         Q. Those gates being 1.1: metres, therefore two units?   A. Yes,
  â– v J      that's it.
         Q. If one does the same calculation as far as that is concerned,
            applying the same figure, that is to say 1,015, you come to
            a time of escape I think of eight minutes and 22 seconds?
            A. I haven't checked that.

         Q. WelJ, somebody can check it.   A. But even without checking
            it, you are of the right order, I'm absolutely certain.

         Q. As a secondary route of escape - and of course it is not
            given any time in the guide - that is perfectly satisfactory
            in relation to this particular stand, is it not? A. Taking
            into account the possibility of escape on to the pitch,
            I believe it is very satisfactory.

         Q. Let's leave that out completely for the moment. As I pointed
            out to you when I first directed |fou to the green guide,
            paragraph 15.2 and 15.3 does not deal with all possible
            means of escape, does it? A. No.

         Q. It deals with the route of escape?   A.   Yes.

         Q. As far as 15.3 is concerned, 15.3 is satisfied in terms of
            escape if there is any particular route which comes well
            within the safety margin?   A. Yes.

         Q. And when we are talking about the extra route of escape,
            that is not covered by 15.3, which is dealing with
            capacities, is it?   A. No.

         Q. As far as these capacities are concerned, you did in fact
            pass on to the Club your opinion as to what the capacity
            should be or was, in terms of people, applying the green
            guide, in the two central pens when they were one big pen?
            A. Yes.

         Q. And later on you provided further information to the Club
            afedut what the capacities were going to be with this
            dividing pen?    A. That is so.
                                          W. EASTWOOD

So whatever they did with it, they certainly knew:,,what your
opinion was?   A. Yes.

And as far as you were concerned, it was important, as far
as practicably possible, to adhere to those figures? A. Yes.

I just want to ask you now please one or two things about
the perimeter gates. As far as the perimeter gates are
concerned, they were never intended, were they, to be
anything other than a means of escape if there was some
localised problem which would require people to come out
at the front?   A. That was their prime purpose. Obviously
we must have in mind that in emergency they could be used,
but that was their prime purpose, I agree.

Obviously if there is an emergency somebody might open the
gates. A. But the prime purpose.

For the purpose of any calculation that was done, those
gates did not feature in terms of determining the capacity?
A. No.

You have mentioned the width of various gates that you have
had to deal with elsewhere. Am I right in saying that you
mentioned one which is 1.7 metres and that was at B ^a m a H
Lane?   A. That is so.

That is for a gate on a wooden stand, is it not? A. Not
on a wooden stand.  It's a terrace very like this one and
the stand behind has a lot of timber in one half of it.

So that is obviously a consideration which certainly does
not apply here?   A. Everything is analogous except at
Bramall Lane there is a lot of timber in the stand.

And, of course, there being a lot of timber, you have to
have a quicker rate of escape?   A. Yes.

Â£nd hence you have to have either more gates or wider gates?
A. That is so.

As far as the others at Bramall lane are concerned, where
I think you said it was 1.2 metres, I am not sure that the
situation has yet been resolved, has it? Is there a safety
certificate as far as Bramall Lane is concerned; yet? A. I
believe there isn't, but I don't know.   I mean I have
discovered since this iiteident that Bramall lLane didn't
have one either.

But am I not right in saying that Sheffield United Football
Club - perhaps you as well - are urging for those gates,
which are 1.2 metres, to be used as part of the normal
route of escape? Isn't that right?    A. You say "are
urging" now?

Yes, the discussion is still going on. In other words, the
position is not analogous to this at all In the case of
Bramall Lane where you are talking about 1.2 metres, the
ifUJrtS'.
                                       72

                                                       W. EASTWOOD

               idea is that those gates are used as part of the recognised
               normal route of escape? A. Yes. Well, this is not now.
               Going right back ten years or so, this was part of a
               recognised picture.

            Q. But that is a totally different situation from the one
               here?   A. Yes.
            Q. Can I ask you to look at 7.9.2 which deals with perimeter
               fences in the gate.  7.922:   "Access points should be
               controlled" - and the word used is "controlled" as opposed
               to "manned" - "so that immediate access to the pitch or
               perimeter track can be ensured in the event of an emergency
               Now, the vital thing about any perimeter gate is that that
               should happen?   A.   Yes.




                                            /Q. And that there should be
A



                                     73     W. EASTWOOD


    Q. And that there should be extreme vigilance and speed in
       opening the gates if the necessity arises? - A. Yes.

    Q. And it is essential that everybody involved in operating
       the system should be fully aware of that? - A. Yes.

    Q. Can I ask you please in the core bundle to have a look
       at 240. It is a letter dated the 8th of May. I raise
       this with you because it does rather appear that you
       are taking a slightly different view as to the function
       of the perimeter gate in that letter, because what you
       say in the penultimate sentence on that page:

                 "It is our view that in the event of an
                 emergency spectators can be evacuated
                 quickly enough by the gates on to the pitch
                 and by the normal exit gates at the rear."

            It is certainly an unhappy way of phrasing it, isn't it?
            - A. Yes, a rather daft letter in a sense.

    Q. Because it really rather sounds there as though you are
       putting prime emphasis on the gates on to the pitch and
       then going on to a secondary basis dealing with the
       exit gates at the rear. The position being that really
       you don't take the gates on the pitch into account at
       all.  Isn't 1that right? - A. I have no recollection of
       what this is about whatever.   I can't imagine which
       gates it is at the minute.   I would need the letter and
       the drawing.
                  LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: We looked at this this
            morning and at the letter to which this was a reply.

                  THE WITNESS: Oh sorry, we are back to Sheffield
            Wednesday.  I thought we were still at Sheffield United.
            I am sorry, I am with the wrong Club.

    q   .         MR. MULLER: The position is simply this, isn't
            it, that in considering escape you really should not
            be taking into account the perimeter gate at all, should
            you? - A. I did. You see I explained this morning with
            this drawmpg that my own calculations for the secondary
            means of escape this was me satisfying myself.  I did
            take account of the fact that the gates were there
            and the 8 minutes 29 seconds or whatever it was that
            you worked out, when I added in that third gate became
            whatever it is, 5^ minutes, so I had been taking into
            account the fact that with my quick opening device in
            position, which it was going to be any day, it was
            in fact several months away, we could be sure that it
            would be possible to open the gates.

                                          W. EASTWOOD


     Q. Well of course that reduces it. The more gates you put
        in the more it is going to reduce it? - A. Yes.

     Q. But what I am suggesting to you, Dr. Eastwood, that
        even without including those gates, the radial gates as
        a secondary means of escape, which of course is a very
        unlikely eventuality, are perfectly adequate bearing in
        mind the kind of Stand you have got? - A. It is a   very
        good Stand from that point of view.

     Q.   Can I then turn to another matter.   In 1981 there was
          an incident of which you have some knowledge at a Cup
          Final between Wolves and Tottenham Hotspur and the
          position is this, isn't it, that although that incident
          had occurred, there was no suggestion or complaint at
          that time by anyone about the width of the gate? - A. So
          far as I know there was no suggestion.

     Q. You certainly at that time from what you knew, you weren't
        saying:  "Well perhaps we ought to have wider gates than
        we have already got"? - A. No.

     Q. Can I then go to another matter as far as that is
        concerned. As early as 1981 you talked about this
        embryo, the plan of having separate turnstiles for each
        part of the terrace? - A. Yes.

     Q. Now that was something which wasi private as it were
        between you and the Club? - A. Yes.

     Q. It was not something that was made known to the Local
        Authority? - A. I did not make it known.

     Q. Well it certainly does not appear in any of the correspondence.
        And at that time in 1981 when you are emphasising that
        of course control is important and people were appreciating
        that control was important, there was no suggestion was
        there that you are aware of, that people were having
        difficulty in controlling people in numbers going into any
        of those pens? - A. The pens had not appeared at the time
        of the Spurs, incident.
     Q. But they subsequently appeared in 1981 and when they were
        put in in 1981 you were not saying to anybody on the
        Working Party, nor as far as you were aware was anybody
        saying to the Working Party;  "Look, we have got problems
        with controlling people getting into these pens"? - A. No,
        I was not saying that. You will know that there was
        correspondence as to how well the pens were working and
        indeed the Chief Constable went to look and there are
        references'in the Working Party Minutes that they appear
        to be working well up to to the moment and so on.

     Q. You see if there had been concern on your part or on the
        part of the' Club oron the part of the Police about controlling
                                   W. EASTWOOD


  the numbers that were going into these pens, certainly
  as far as you are concerned you would have been pressing,
  would you not, for your system of turnstiles because
  you would be saying:  "Here is the answer.  I will now
  tell you the Working Party all about it"? - A. Yes.
  I did not feel that kind of pressure at that time.

Q. The truth of it was as far as you are concerned nobody
   was being told "Thereis a problem" if indeed there was
   one? - A. That is so, except that the Policewere having
   discussions with the Club about the one specific incident
   of the semi-finalt
Q. And that produced the radial fences? - A. That is so.

Q. But did not produce any turnstiles? - A. No.

Q. Didn't even motivate you to suggest to the Working Party
   the plan which you had already got written out? - A. No.

Q. Can we then move on a bit please. The stipulation was
   made by the Working Party - we can see this I think at
   153 in the core bundle - when those radial fences were
   introduced, the stipulation was made that "the new gates
   at the rear of the terrace also being under Police control".
   - A. Yes.
Q. And if you have a look again would you at 792 of the then
   Green Guide, exactly the same word is being used, that
   is to say with some amplification in respect of the
   perimeter gate in the 1976 Guide? - A. Yes.

Q. And that is entirely appropriate, isn't it? - A. It is
   extremely appropriate.
Q. And "control" in this context means actually having it
   manned, doesn't it? - A. Of course.

Q. And how many people you have manning it is obviously
   a matter for the Police. They must decide how they
   control it. If it requires one man so be it. If it
   requires 5 it needs 5? - A. Yes.

Q. And that is desirable, if not essential, for a variety
   of reasons, isn't it? - A. Yes.
Q. Because for example if what you are going to do is block
   off the tunnel to stop more people coming in, you have
   also got to have a facility for immediately blocking <&ff
   the radial gates because otherwise people who don't go
   down the tunnel are going to be able to go round the
   side of the Stand and enter by the radial gate so it
   would make a nonsense, wouldn't it, of closing the
   tunnel. Is that not right? - A. Yes.
                               76
                                     W. EASTWOOD


Q. In addition to that it would be essential if any emergency
   arose to get an Officer, if you did not have him there/
   very quickly? - A. Yes.

Q. And that could well create problems getting an Officer
   to that position very quickly? - A. Yes.

Q. So the desirable thing is to have him already positioned
   there. Isn't that right? - A. Yes.

Q. And having somebody there at the time gives you flexibility
   in operating the system, doesn't it? - A. Yes.

Q. Again in relation to that gate you have got a conflict
   again just as you have with the perimeter gate. The
   bigger the gate is the more difficult it is to control
   in terms of people entering that central desirable pen
   from the side pens? - A. Indeed.

Q. So you have got a conflict, the same as we had similar
   at any rate, between the two situations, people wanting
   to come in and people in an emergency wanting to get out?
   - A. Indeed.

Q. Of course when you think in terms of signing the gate,
   it would not be a good idea to put a sign over that gate
   saying it is the exit, because in a normal situation
   where some problem had arisen and you wanted to get people
   out of that pen, you would want them to go through the
   tunnel, wouldn't you? - A. Yes.

Q. And you would not want them to be deflected into going
   through the secondary exit? - A. This is a difficulty.

Q. And of course if you have got a Police Officer or Police
   Officers manning that gate, then they can perform the
   function that the exit sign otherwise might perform by
   directing the people through that gate in the event of a
   particular kind of emergency? - A. In a different way
   they can.

Q. Now can I ask you please 1985. I think we can find this
   in the core bundle at 208 and 207, 207 being the drawing.
   That is the plan that was put before the Working Party,
   isn't it? - A. Yes.

Q. And as we have already heard it was put before the Working
   Party on the 18th of April 1985? - A. Thereabouts.

Q. That is the figure.   The date I think you were led to this
   morning? - A. Yes.

Q. If you look at that it is quite obvious, as you have
   indicated already, that that does provide or potentially
   provides a great deal of control? - A. Yes.
                                 w. EASTWOOD


But again that scheme was abandoned, wasn't it? - A. Yes.

And when that scheme was abandoned you were not saying:
"Well we have got such problems with control you really
must have this scheme" were you? - A. No.

Nobody at that time was saying to the Working Party,
as far as you are aware, "You must insist on this because
this is going to overcome the big problem we have got
all the time". Nobody was saying that were they? - A. No

Because the assurance was being given even in the absence
of such an arrangement control was possible? - A. Yes.




                    /Q. And what actually happened
                              78

                                                   W. EASTWOOD


Q.    And what actually happened, and you can see this most
     conveniently in the text of your statement, paragraph 101, was
     that whereas ;the working party had been involved in that
     plan, unbeknown to the working party you were having
     discussions with the club.   Is that right? - A. Yes.

Q.    In relation to a revised   plan. In fact, if you look at 101
     you can see you describe how on4th June, 1980, you proposed     a
     revised scheme? - A . Yes.

Q. And that scheme, if we go to 103 on page 45, what happened was
   you say:

          "Because of the particular interest of the Police in my
          propose reorganisation, on 25th June we submitted a copy
          of our drawings 86705/8A to them for question and
          comment".

     - A. I am sure we did, but I am just find   theplace.

Q.   Look at page 45. - a. Yes.

Q.   The second sentence. - A. That is so.

Q.   The position was that on 4th June you are telling the club
     about it or giving them a revised plan, having had some other
     discussions. You then send a copy to the Police with whom you
     were having discussions, and it is not until very much later,
     I think on 25th July that a document, and we can see this in
     the middle of paragraph 105, not until 25th July you are
     sending off a submission   to the working party which is to be
     dealt with within 4 days,because the meeting    is on 29th July?
     - A. That is so.

Q. So they were given very little notice of your revised plan? -
   A. That is so.

Q. Notwithstanding that very little notice and the new plan
   abandoning to a large degree the turnstiles, there was no hint
   or suggestion emanating as far as you know from you or the
   club, saying, "Well, we really ought to be having these
   turnstiles, and it is a bad thing we are not getting them".
   Is that right? - A. That is right, yes.

Q. No hint there really was   a problem with control and you really
   must insist on this turnstile system.   Is that right? - a.
   That is right.

Q.    Was that a case of keeping the working in the dark about what
     the real situation was, or was it the situation that as far as
     you knew the club were not having any problem with controlling
     the capacities in those pens? - A. It certainly was not a
     question of keeping the working party in the dark. Obviously
     one speaks with one's clients. One sets out to produce a
     scheme. We produced 4 or 5 of them over a few weeks, and we
     made people aware we were starting on this by sending off the
     notice in April. So we were not keeping anybody in the dark.

     The second part of your question was?

Q. It was a case.... - A. There was no great pressure.

Q ..... of there being no real pressure? - A. No great pressure.

Q. What you actually did was to send off a number of drawings.
   Is that right? What happened was a number of drawings were
   sent off to the working party or to the local council, one of
   them being that drawing, 67058/8A? - A. Yes, it was one of
   about 17 drawings.  We did not just prepare that drawing.   We
   had to prepare over a few days a great bundle, I think about
   17.

Q. And that was the letter which was without any explanation,
   just a list of drawings?

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Mr. Muller, where is all this
     taking us?

          MR. MULLER:    May I just deal with it with this one
     further question:

Q. One of the drawings that was sent was a proposal for a
   personnel gate in that wall, or door? - A. Yes.

Q.   Which is now a gate. - A. In the wall,   which is now a wide
     gate, and it was built as a narrow one   and is now wide.

Q.   It was never intended, was it, that in those initial stages it
     was going to be for the access of spectators? - A. No, that
     dividing wall was our view of a segregation of home and away
     fans.

Q. The situation you then devised was very much as we can see
   here.  Is not that right? - A. With regard to that door, do
   you mean?

Q. No, the general plan? - A. The plan, yes, it was that.

Q. And the situation as it stands there and as was originally
   intended was this - correct me if I am wrong - that by using
   turnstiles A-G you could get people through to the tunnel and
   also round the top of the stand, the south side of the stand?
   - A. That is so.

Q. And the idea was that the north side of the stand would be
   served by other turnstiles? - A. That is so.

Q. So that still gave the club and the Police a degree of control
   over numbers going into different pens? - A. Yes.

Q. Because they could be using the different turnstiles shut off
   different areas of terrace? - a. That is so.

Q. And by for example shutting off the tunnel serve just through
   A-G the southern part of the Leppings Lane terrace? - A. That
                               80


                                                    W. EASTWOOD


     is s o .

Q. But what happened on the day of this disaster was that that
   plan was abandoned, was not it? - A. It had been abandoned.*

Q. So that the system that was then created was the      system which
  â€¢ had never been contemplated at the time when the     working party
    was considering the 1965 plan? - A. That is so.

Q.   because by introducing a much wider gate and by just using A-G
     as turnstiles all effective means of controlling numbers going
     into the different parts of the Leppings Lane terrace had
     gone? - A. That is so.

Q.   Did you know that was going to be done? - A.    Did I know what
     was going to be done?

Q. That they were just going to use A-G, and therefore abandon
   the control afforded by using some of the turnstiles in 1-16?
   - A . N o , i had no idea.

           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     I don't follow that last question.

           MR. MULLER:   Perhaps I can put it again:

Q. Can I put the premise this way The original idea was that the
   Leppings Lane terrace would be served by turnstiles A-G plus
   some of the turnstiles in 1-16? - A. Yes.

Q. And that was what was put before the working party? - A. That
   was.

Q.   What eventually happened, I think many games before this but
     certainly was in operation at the time of the disaster Semi-
     Final, was that the only turnstiles being used for the
     Leppings Lane terrace were A-G? - A. Yes.

Q.   Were you aware that was   going to be done? - A. No.

Q.    Would you have approved of it if it had been done if you had
     been told about it? - A. I would not have approved.   The
     widening of that narrow gate into a wide one was never
     referred to me. I was not involved in that widening and it
     did break down some element of the design as I had originally
     seen it.

Q. It undermined it. It effectively took the wall away, did not
   it, if you were going to use it for spectators? - A. Yes.

Q. Would you have been worried or concerned if you had been told
   that the way in which it was going to be operated, the filling
   of the Leppings Lane terrace, by just using turnstiles A-G? -
   A . Yes.

Q. Would you have been thinking to yourself, "With just
   turnstiles A-G the flexibility in controlling people going
   into different parts of the stand is almost nil"? - A. There
                              81

                                                    W. EASTWOOD


     was flexibility for people to go to different parts.  They
     could go from A-G and they could go off in any direction,
     because there was a bigger hole in the wall. The word
     "controlling", is it?

Q. Dr. Eastwood, the great problem would be the only way, if it
   is A-G serving the whole terrace, the only way you can stop
   people at the turnstiles      - A. Yes, I see what you mean.

Q.   Is by shutting all the turnstiles? - A. Yes.

Q.   Which with the crowds that were there was totally
     impractical? - A. Yes.

Q.   And so by this deviation from your plan the whole basis of
     your plan was destroyed.  Is that not right? - A. Much of the
     benefit had gone.

Q. Finally, if I may ask you this about that.  If that had been
   put forward to you as a proposal or a suggestion by the club
   or by the Police would you have accepted it? - A. I would have
   deflected them, I think.

          MR. MULLER:   I don't know, sir, whether I have made the
     situation clear or not?

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    I am not entirely clear what you
     are saying.  Let me see if I have got it. You are saying that
     the plant which Dr. Eastwood had would have provided access
     through turnstiles to particular pens, whereas what you had
     was A-G access certainly to the centre two pens and the
     southern end, although unless you used the hole in the wall
     none to the north   end.  Therefore you had no control other
     than shutting all   the turnstiles. Is that it?

           MR. MULLER:     What you could have done, sir, is you could
     have closed the tunnel and then you had an option whether you
     went left or right according to which turnstiles were left
     open.   If one side got very full you could then close that
     side and feed everybody to the other side.

                   Cross-Examined by MR. MAXWELL:

Q. Dr. Eastwood, could I begin by looking again at a small bundle
   of correspondence which was produced yesterday and which dealt
   with the question of when certain capacities were put on
   plans.  It was a small bundle of correspondence produced by
   your learned counsel.  It has on its front a letter from
   Sheffield Wednesday, 10th march, 1987.  I don't know whether
   you have that? - A. This is in effect the file that was asked
   for yesterday, is it?   Yes, I have it.

Q. It includes at the second page the letter from the Football
   League, Ltd., signed by Mr. Kelly, and it points out on page 2
   that certain points were agreed between the League and the
   Government, and the first is:
                           82

                                                W. EASTWOOD


        "All clubs are required to submit detailed local plans
        for dealing with the management and control of home and
        away supports as per the attached document".

   It goes on to point out at the end of that sentence:

        "These plans will be available to the FA in the event of
        a disciplinary Commission".

   On the next page details are given of the local plan:

        "Each club is required to submit details of its own plan
        for dealing with crowd control before, during and after
        matches. This should be determined after due consultation
        with the Police and local authority and take account of
        the following points".

   The first is the ground plan which you prepared, and secondly,
   stadium operation, there has got to be a policy for policing
   and stewarding, details of turnstile operation in relation to
   ground capacity. Do you know, is there such a local plan that
   exists with regard to Sheffield Wednesday? - A. Such a local
   plan?

Q. As that which is referred to on this sheet? - A. A plan in
   terms of a drawing or a scheme?

Q. This is "plan" in a rather wider meaning, I think.  It is more
   than the ground plan.  It is a plan or strategy for dealing
   with a situation.  Do you know whether it exists? - A. No.

Q. Were you ever consulted about such a plan? - A. No.

        MR. MAXWELL:   Sir, it does not appear to be part of the
   core bundle, and I am not aware to its being referred to in
   either of the openings that Mr. Collins has given us. I don't
   know, sir, whether you are aware of it or whether it is a
   matter that will be pursued?

        MR. GLASGOW:    I do not know if I can help my friend,
   there is indeed such a document.   It is a 3 or 4 page
   document.   I regret to say I physically don't have it here at
   the moment because my friend raised it with me at quarter-
   past-2.   I am sure he did not have notice of it either.  I
   think we can get it in a legible form and copy it for you on
   Monday if that would be more suitable than trying to do it at
   this time.

        MR. GIBSON-WATT:   Sir, it may be I can do even a little
   better than that.  I was also asked by Mr. Maxwell at
   lunchtime.  I said I would dig it out if I could find it. I
   believe I do have in my possession and have now dug out a
   rather poor faxed photocopy of it. If Mr. Maxwell really
   needs it this afternoon he could make do with that.   It is
   only in the last few minutes I have managed to obtain it.

        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Mr. Maxwell, there are two
                          83

                                              DISCUSSION


offers.   Do you want to pursue it further until you have seen
it?

      MR. MAXWELL:    I can go on to a different matter, sir.
I do n 't want to pursue that until I have seen the document.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Have you got a number of other
matters to put?

     M R . MAXWELL:   I have a number of other matters.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   In that case I think we will break
off now and then you can look at that and carry on where you
left off.

     Monday, 10.30. Can I say this, because it may well be on
the sort of prognosis that we have had, that the evidence
which is proposed presently to adduce before this Inquiry may
well terminate within next week.  I would like to say as
everybody knows and as has been repeated on a number of
occasions, there are many, many people who could give evidence
of matters relating to this disaster, and as we have been at
pains to point out what has been sought to be done is that we
should not go on interminably with evidence but have evidence
which covers the ground, and of course be prepared to receive
any further evidence if it adds anything significant to what
we have already had.

     I just want to give notice now to all the parties
represented here that if they have in mind any witness who
they think can add anything significant - I don't mean simply
underline something that has been said - something new or
significant by way of addition to what we have heard, then I
would urge them to contact Counsel to the Inquiry as soon as
possible about that so that we can try and fit it into next
week, because at the end of next week, if we do finish the
evidence that at present we intend to have, then we shall be
concluding the hearing here, and although there will remain a
final opportunity if something does turn up unexpectedly to
introduce it a little later, time will then be limited and I
give this warning and notice now for that reason.  Thank you.


  (The Inquiry was adjourned to Monday. 26th June. 1989.
                      at 10.30 a.m.)

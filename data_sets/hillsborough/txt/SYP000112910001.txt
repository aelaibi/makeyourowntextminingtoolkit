                      On S a t u r d a y ,   15 April,    19^9 ( 15Q 48 9 ) I •was:.                ;"«r Hillsborough

                      Football Ground.            I came on duty at about 8.45am<0845)                      that date and

                      travelled to Sheffield from Barnsley by my own car.                               I arrived at

                      Sheffield at about 9am (0900) and parked rny car in the premises of

                      Carlton Press which is located on the road from Penistone Road

                      roundabout and Merries Road which comes out near to the arches.                                  At

                      this time there were several Liverpool                      supporters wandering around.

                      At 9.4 5 a m (0945)       I attended at the North stand and joined my serial,*                        ;

                      number 27,         led by Sgt. tiozley. After briefing, meal was taken.

                      At 1 0 .30am (1030 >, both myself and PC 2711 Patterson went back to my

                      car in order to collect ray waterproof jacket.                           Once again fans from

                      Liverpool were           in and around the Herries Road area.                     Fast food

                     mobiles were            ready to sell     refreshments.             After collecting my coat we

                      proceeded to Leppings Larie from Penistone Road and onto the, junction

                      with Fielding Road and.Leppings L a n e .

                     Up6ri arrival we set up barriers at about                          10.4 5 a m (1045)   in order to

                      stop vehicles          parking     in the road which didn't belong to residents arid

                     By this time Liverpool and Nottingham fans had begun to arrive ,and •

were asking for directions to public houses and off-licences.                         We ;

tried to explain that         local   pubs were       closed or only open for local

residents.       This did not” deter them as many stated that                it w&s early

and they would w a l k .a mile or so for a drink.

At this tiwi the mood of the fans was very; cheerful and jokes were




tickets were       changing hands for between thirty and fifty pounds.

Inspectors and ranks above were in abundance outside the ground early

an but as the strength of people increased senior officers were                         in

less abundance than before.            Sgt. Mosley attended several             times to

check if we had any problem            and remained with us a few minutes each

time.    Also an       Inspector ofwhom I have never seen before                came to our

barriers several       times early on but never           introduced himself or spoke

■ to' us,. '                                     •x

Fans were arriving up Leppings Lane              (Liverpool fans) and were

carrying bottles and cans of beer and lager.                   Several     by this time

were the worse        for drink and at one point two fans of about HQ years

were asleep on         the   pavement in Leppings Lane o p p o s i t e F i e l d i n g Road

and were       in a state that I could only call drunk and incapable.

As time progressed more and more fans arrived and many were very

too ister i ous » throwing food and litter around a s w e l l             as swearing and

Fans were turning up without tickets <fans                                             if

                    spare tickets directly in front of us and this was in a period of

                    about E hours,

                    By 1.30prn (1330)       there were hoards of people on Leppings Lane „and

                    many asking.tfor toilets as there was already massive queues forming?

                    outside th# turnstiles on Leppings Lane.

                    At about 2 . 10pm (1410)         I remarked to PC Patterson that the, train

                    carrying Liverpool         supporters was just pulling into Wads ley Bridge

                    Raily&y S t a t i o n T r a f f i c   was, using Leppings Lane and fans were

                    waging     in amongst the traffic because of their sheer numbers they

                     rouldn't possibly keep to the pavements.                                          V

                    Club Stewards from Sheffield Wednesday persistently tried to park

          „C   "    'their cars in Fielding Road, which by now Was already full with

                    residents cars.         At one point I was told by a Club Steward to "Fuck
   '
   (\ " r - . f i   Off'    for not allowing him to park.           The general   behaviour from the

                    stewards was poor and I would have expected better from them towards

                    us.     If they treat us as they did what would they treat the fans

                    like.     Many used an excuse that their boss had given them permission

                    to park where they wanted and were not slow to drop names of certain

                    Inspectors     in the force.          However they left and found suitable

                    parking elsewhere.

                    The time by now was about 2.20pm             <1420) and we had dealt with a lot

                    of people who were not very amused with both the Police and stewards

                    at the turnstiles.          Many Liverpool and Nottingham Forest fans showed

                    us tickets and were generally convinced that they had gone to the

                    wrong entrances.         Many,    and I. would say to be conservative,    about 300

                    people stating that they had tickets for seats in the North stand and

                    because of the prefix letters before their seat numbers,               had been

                    told that they had to go into the football ground via the turnstiles

                    on Penistone Road.          These were Liverpool     supporters and it was

                    obvious by their accents.             After being sent down Leppings Lane ar^d

    onto the turnstiles on Penistong/Road they were rather dismayed when

    they came back and saw the ja4ss of people waiting,           or rather pushing

    'to1 get in

                              ) the crowds were so immense outsj.de the

    turn%|ffc|#s /in Leppings, Lfne that I remarked to PC Patterson that

    way would ail these peopie get i n = in time tos^e? the mat                 ki q_k“ 0f f .

    People werfe pushing that' much that people were retreating back towards

    us and stating that no way they would get           in and they were going to

    sell their tickets.       Police horses,were     in attendance5 and seemed to

    be having little effect in controlling' the crowds-.                    ’

    Fans were climbing over fences and walls but I c o u l d n ’t say whether

     it was to avoid being     crushed or because they tyafci no tickets.

    the street.      At about 3pm(1'300) or /     little before there was a cheer

    onto the field.      There were still about 2000 people outside the

    ground,       I said to Graham Patterson,     "They will have to delay the

    match to let them all      in".    At just   leaving 3pm <:
                                                              15Cfo) I made my way

    down Fielding Road towards Penistone Road to meet up with PC 2752 Jowit


    and PC 2584 M u s k .   After discussing which one was going to take their

    meal first, we waited for any officers from our serial                to walk along

    towards Claywheels Lane.          Instead officers were walking towards the

    turnstiles at the Penistone Road end.           I remarked to both officers

    that there were still a few thousand fans waiting to get                into the

    North and West stands on Leppings Lane.

    Whilst standing herf Traffic patrol          cars were very much in abundance

    and Senior., of f ijcers were returning to the ground.        PC Musk ^sked, them

    above had them.      14e wefe toid to remain where we were.

   Some fans 'came- out of the ground and remarked that a pitch invasion

   was      in progress.*       These were Notts. Forest supporters.       Over the next

   SO fninutes or so ambulances and fire engines -arrived on Penistone Road

   and after several            beat cars arrived,   some from A Division,     we; began

       to tsk t h p ;'qufstifns as to what had happened.           We got the impression

       that there was trouble within the ground and a message had been sent

       out to get every available man to the ground.              This had been done so

       quickly that there was a distinct smell of burning clutches from the

       cars.    I loSked back up the road to see my colleague Graham Patterson

       and several    Other officers waiting around.

       I returned back to the barrier at the top of Fielding Road with

       Leppings Lane and asked Graham if he Jkffew what was going on.

       Naturally he didn't have much o ^ a n         idea.

 ^ R e s i d e n t s came outYof t^B^fiouses and were stood looking rather

       shocked.      I went to one la d y and all she could tell me was that it

       was terrible and these ware people dead,              but she didn't fill   in any

       I returned to the .barriers, and. watched the Liverpool           fans spill back

' ^ o u t onto Leppip^s Lane,          Many initially were very distressed,         tears

       were fr^Jty^flowing and there was a great deal, of aggression being
fit*
       shown towards the Police.                                               ’

       I remained behind the barriers oblivious to what was happening and

       tried my best to soak in what had hapened in the football ground.

       Ambulances were trying to get up Leppings Lane being 1-ed in turn by

       either a Police motorcycle or a traffic           car.    The fans were not

       prepared to move to one side to let the emergency services through.

       As more fans     came onto the street we were met with fans who were

  '.exceptionally aggressive and were           calling us from fuqking bastards to

       cunts an4 ariythinglinked.         Our so called incompetence and all we

   were doing was standing around while their friends lay dead and we
  didn't care;         Of course we did care but they knew more thati we did.

 A lot m o r e .             '                   "

 When there were so many people on the streets we were getting a lot

  of aggrcsfrom the residents to stop them coming from Leppings Lane

f end into Fielding Road.         As more protests were aimed personally at me

 and insults several         fans spat in our general direction.       Insults and

 abuse were constantly hurled at us and when threats were administered

  I really felt threatened.         We were alone,     no radios to' ca.ll for help,

  nowhere to go or hide and I felt frightened,            so much so I had hold

  of my staff and if anyone had attacked me I would have used it

  without notice.         I feared for my safety so much as we were so

  helpless.        / r e m e m b e r seeing a sergeant who I don't know stood in

  front of    Jn e'■   He was trying to calm the area down as we tried to

' allow Doctors,        nurses and fire personnel      into Fielding Road in order

  to tysep Leppings Lane open for the emergency services.             While I moved

 k tbre barriers out the Liverpool        fans did nothing to help only jostled

  and insulted us as well as push the sergeant away.

  During this barage a woman ran across the road from Shentall Road and

  said to us that a man had collapsed in her house.              Immediately PC

 Patterson and myself attended at                               to find a man

  having an epileptic fit in her house.              1 remembered my first aid and

  put the man in a recovery position while I tried in vain to ring for

 an ambulance.          Eventually I got through and about SO minutes       later an

 ambulance attended and took the man who I only know as

  from Halifax away to Hospital who was still             in deep shock.   He had

  rung home to say he was fine and after ringing off went             into an

  epileptic fit.         I obtained a telephone number from him and said I

 would try and ring home for him.

 We then went b^ck onto Leppings Lane to find our serial and: ?nqyire

 what we could do,         if anything.   We came across Sergeant Mosley and
  informed him that we had s o m e      property which was handed to us

  personally irt the day to hand to central, control.

 We then went        into the ground still not aware Of what had occurred..

• Property was handed to a sergeant and we then looked for a

 tf Vephon&>. ,, I remembir looking through the passageways under the

  North stand and seeing debris scattered on the floor,

  I proceeded towards the gymnasium in order to find a phone and once

  inside    I. was met by a mass of people standing around. . As I walked

  through I was aware of bags of clothes and directly behind I saw one

  body dfk the floor apparently being searched.           Curiosity got the better,

* Of mk- and I noticed rows of dead bodies with no real outside

        uries.   I w a s n ’t aware that they ^ere dead at this time.      I just

  remember feeling numb.           I eventually found a phone and tried to get

  an outside     line to no avail.      As I hung the phone up a policewoman in

  the police     room went hysterical and I knew something was wrong but

  what    I didn't    know.   1 proceeded with PC Patterson to Claywheels Lane

  where I awaited the         rest of our serial.    Eventually retiring from

  duty at 6,45pm       (1845 >.    On my way back to the car I remembered seeing

  a helicopter hovering over the ground.            Once alone   in my car and

  travelling back home         I remember listening to Radio Hal lam




  All    in all on the day there was a degree of incompetence.           We d i d n ’t

  all have radios,' we needed at least one between two.            We wire told to

  deal with any incident outside the ground and not lea ve            it to F1.

  Not easy without       radios.    Arrests for drunkenness would have been

  carried out before the ground, with radios.             >

  Fans were drunk and badly behaved and after the crowds cleared there

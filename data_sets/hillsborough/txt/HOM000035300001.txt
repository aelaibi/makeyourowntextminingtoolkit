HILLSBOROUGH

Thank you for your letter of 3 February and the extensive supporting material which
you enclosed.

This is to confirm that we will consider fully all the material which you enclosed
before Ministers decide whether any further action should be taken. I will, of course,
let you know when they have reached a decision.

I am arranging for copies of the material to be provided to the Legal Secretariat to the
Law Officers, in view of the Attorney Generalâ€™s responsibilities in relation to the
reopening of inquests, and to the Crown Prosecution Service.




                                       PAUL PUGH

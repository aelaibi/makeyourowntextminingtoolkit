               In     connection           with    the       above       event I came           on    duty      at     9.30am       (0930).              '<




              My      specific        area    of    r e s p o n s i b i l i t y was         Sector     2B       under      the      command        of

              Superintendent                Marshall.              I was       in    charge      of    serials            34-51,       exclusing

              4 4,      46,    47    and    48?    whose       Inspectors             were     Townend,          Ellis,       Meek,

              Broortihead,           Morton       and    Robinson.              Serials        34-35      were        performing             coach

               reception            for    Liverpool          fans       in C l a y w h e e l s      Lane.        Serials          36-37      were       i

               public         order/train          reception             u n i t s at   Wadsley        Bridge          Station.          Serial          !

              38      was     involved       in m i n i - b u s      reception             on W a r d s e n d    Road,       whilst

               serials         39-40       were    responsible                for    coach      reception            in H a l i f a x    Road.

              Serials          41,    42    and    43    were       public          order      patrols       in H a l i f a i x        Road,       and

               finally         serials       49,    50       and    51    were       mobile       units      operating            in    the

              Foxhill,             Parson    Cross       and       Grenoside          areas.

              Due       to    the    fact    I was       supervising                these      officers         on    foot,       my    basic

              area       of    deployment          was       from    the       Leppings         Lane    roundabout             to      the    top

               of     Halifax        Road    near       to    Chaucer          School,         including         the       designated

               streets,            Claywheels       Lane       and       Wardsend          Road.

              The       last       semi-final       I worked             at    Hillsborough            was      during       the       season

               "1980-81        when       Wolves    played          Spurs.           However       since        that       time     I have

              worked          numerous       games       at    this       ground.           Additionally              I have        been      in

               charge         of    games    at    Barnsley          during          a 2    year      period         in    that     Division.

During        the     last       12    months             I have       been       responsible             for    the     planning

and    policing            of    matches             at    Bramall          Lane.        In    essence          therefore          I have

considerable               experience                in    the    policing          of    football             matches.

On    the     day     in    question             some       pubs       in    my    sector          were    open       but    they       were

adopting         a    back       door       selection             policy.           Clearly          these       pubs       appeared

full     bu t    to    the       best       of       my    knowledge          none       of    my    officers          attended          at

any    licensed            premises             in    response          to    calls       for       assistance.              On    my

routine         patrols          in H a l i f a x          Road    I saw          numerous          fans       who    had    clearly

been     drinking           but       none       of       whom    could       be    described             as    drunk       enough       to

arrest.          One       is    bound          to    record       that       the    Gateway             Supermarket          at

Kilner        Way,     Wadsley             Bridge          , did       enormous          business          in    the     sale      of

intoxicants            prior          to    the       kick       off    at    3.00pm          (1500).

The    mood      of    some       of       the       fans    I saw          was    boisterous             and    loud,       but    not

unlike        the     vast       majority             of    football          fans       every       Saturday          of    the

season.          The       only       difference             being          their    numbers             were    greater.

The    escort         of    fans       from          Wadsley       Bridge          Station          to    the    ground       was
             /owV-
c ar r i e d / e f f i c i ent'.I. y a n d           effectively             with    the       valuable          assistance             of

the    Mounted         Branch.              I gave          my    officers          strict          i n s t r u c t i o n s ' to   leave

the    Liverpool            supporters                under       no    illusions             that       having       arrived       in

Sheffield            they       were       to    behave          themselves.              I    instigated             selective

searches         of    certain             supporters.                 It    was    evident          that       they    were       not

used     to     such       positive             policing,          many       of    the       fans       asking       why    we    were

searching            them       etc.        In       my    experience             this    is       unusual       as    currently

most     fans        expect,      such          actions          from       the    police.

After       supervising               the       above       officers          I    returned          to    Halifax          Road    to

oversee         the    continuing                arrival          of    Liverpool             coaches.           I was       therefore

unaware         of    the       size       of    the       build       up    of    Liverpool             supporters          in

L e p p i ng s L a n e .

At    approximately               2.55pm             (1455)       I was       in    Halifax          Road       near    to    the

Wadsley         Bridge          Station          when       due    to       the    tone       of    radio       messages

    ,**        emanating             from       Match        Control             I took         all       the       available           personnel          and

               attended           at      the    Leppings              Lane       end      of    the       ground          where        I reported

               initially             to    Superintendent                       Marshall.             We       were       unable        to    contact

               Match       Control          and      so      in       company          with      Chief          Inspector              Waring       who    had

               by    this       time       joined         me,      we       attempted            to       make       Leppings           Lane    a    sterile

               area     to      enable           the e m e r g e n c y          services         to       enter        the    ground.

               In    the     interim             period         in     company            w i t h other         officers           I assisted              the

               injured          to     waiting          ambulances                and      ensur ed the              safety        and       sanctity       of

               about       10/12          bodies        which         were        lying         outside             the    turnstile           area
I
               adjacent           to      the     river.           I did          not      handle          any       bodies.            The    match       was

               then    abandoned                 a n d our    task           then      was      to    placate              fans    obviously             in a

               state       of     shock          and make         a    sympathetic               attempt              to    advise       them       to     leave

               the    scene.              Officers         were            s u b j e c t A to    violent             and    horrific           verbal

               abuse       from        many      fans,        but          to    their       credit            the    majority           of    officers

               were     professional                 and      sensible               in    their          attitude.

               Radio       communication                  initially               appeared            to       be    satisfactory,              however

               shortly          before          2.30pm        (1430)            my     own      set       began       to    become           distorted          and

               but    for       the       events        thereafter                I would            have       certainly              either       changed

               the    radio          or    the     batteries.                   During          the       tragic          events       after        3.00pm

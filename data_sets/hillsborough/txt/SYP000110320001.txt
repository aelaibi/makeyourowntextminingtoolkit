            bowed out amid a new storm over the
            Hillsborough disaster.

            deared himself to_Owls sup­
            porters by pledging his "des­
            peration to start winning
            some trophies’* . . . and
            sooner rather than later.
               Team       manager ' Ron
           Atkinson has signed a con­
            tract binding him io thcclub
           for a further year, it was
           announced today.
              Some        had     expected
           fellow-director Keith Addv
           succeed M r McGee. M r
           Addy said: “ It was a diffi­
           cult decision for me to
           make. I would have b een ;
     U extremely proud lobechair-
     |     man but I do have an active
           role to play in my own
           company.”

               Instead he is to continue
            as vice-chairman. Bassetlaw'
            Labour- MP-Joe Ashton has
            finally won his battle to cet
           on the board.
               But as M r Richards took
           over there was fury over
           remarks made by the out­
           going chairman.
         ^ Speaking about the disas­
          ter on TV. M r M cGee
          claimed: -M any,        many I
          hundreds o f Mersevside
          people came to Hiffs- '
          borough without tickets in
         the knowledge that if they
         Created enough mavhem the
         police would open the gates.
         And that is exactly what
         happened." ^
        Immediately, the Hills- :
     borough Family Group '
     accused ^ .y e a r-o ld Mr
     McGee o f insulting the
     memory o f the 95 dead.
       •'"Hie club is partly res-
    ponsible tor the deaths
    because of the p o or faciiites
    which led to the build-up at
    the turnstiles" said chair­
    man Trevor Hicks.
      ’•Perhaps M r McGee is so
    ashamed o f the ground’s
   record in this that he is foofc.

   who better than the fans, as
   usual. It is a good jo b that
   he is retiring. There is no
  place in lootball f0r pe0pie
  who have lost touch with
  reality,                    v
        M r Richards, who lives in
    Norton and js boss of
    Hackenthorpe-based Three
   i t a r Engineering, admits
   people will be surprised by
   the choice o f chairman.
       "J didn’t expect it, but it’s
  an honour - and i f s a
I challenge I am happy to
  accept.”                   3
I "W e must seek to exploit
 evcfy commercial avenue
 open to us. for we must gen­
 erate funds from as m any di­
rections as possible" he said.

Speaking about the disaster on TV, Mr McGee claimed:
"Many,  many   hundreds  of Merseyside    people  came  to
Hillsborough without tickets in the knowledge that if they
created enough   mayhem the police would open the gates.
And that is exactly what happened."

McGee's sadest memory of his Hillsborough years    is,   of
course, April's FA Cup semi-final tragedy.

"It is something which I shall never forget as long as I
live" he said, "To see so many people, young people, die
and realise there's nothing you can do about it    . . .
that kind of distress never leaves you."

"Today, sadly, Hillsborough is known in many parts of the
world for the wrong reasons, and the memory will always be
there."

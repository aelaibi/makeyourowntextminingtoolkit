 London SW1A OAA                                                              November 1990




 Thank you for your letter of 17th October about the decision
 taken by the Director of Public Prosecutions not to institute
 criminal      proceedings       against      any person          arising         out        of   the
 Hillsborough disaster.


 The decision taken by the Director followed a careful analysis
 of all the evidence assembled by the West Midlands police in what
was      by    any     standards       a    thorough        and    detailed              criminal
 investigation.        That investigation had the benefit of the equally
 thorough report submitted to the Home Secretary by Lord Justice
Taylor following his public inquiry.                   The inquiry had identified
many factors leading to the disaster, ranging from the purely
 historical      (e.g.     the     layout      of    the    stadium),            through          the
 assessment          and   supervision         of     safety        requirements,                  to
 shortcomings in the policing arrangements on the day.                                 These had
 all combined in differing proportions to produce the disaster.


 The question of criminal              liability fell to be determined by
 reference not to the overall picture which had emerged, but on
 the basis      of an analysis             of the    individual conduct                    of each
 potential      defendant        and       whether    his     or    her         conduct           was
 sufficiently proximate to the disaster to constitute what the law
 describes      as a "substantial operating                  cause".           To establish
 liability      for manslaughter            in respect       of any        individual             the
 prosecution would have had to establish beyond reasonable doubt
 that he or she (a) had intentionally done an act, or omitted to
do an act whether there was a duty to do so,                 being grossly
negligent whether death or serious injury would result; and (b)
such as act or omission had been a substantial operating cause
of the deaths.


Careful consideration was given by the Director to the position
of all those whose conduct could be regarded as having a bearing
on the tragedy.       This included the football club itself, those
responsible for the design and safety aspects of the stadium as
well as those responsible for enforcement of the relevant safety
legislation together with the police.             The Director had the
benefit of advice from two very experienced leading counsel.                He
came to the conclusion that the evidence was insufficient for
there to be a realistic prospect of securing a conviction of any
person for manslaughter or any other criminal offence.


I   concur   with   his   decision.    You   will    be    aware    that   the
Divisional    Court   has   recently   declined     to    grant    leave   for
judicial review of that decision.

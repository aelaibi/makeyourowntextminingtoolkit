spoke        to    the     unknown          youth.         He    was       very        unsteady           and      worse       the    wear

for     dri n k .        He     was    sitting           on a s m a l l         wall     and appeared                unable          to

stand        unaided.            Police        Constable             BASHF ORTH          spoke          to     the   older        member

of     the    group and             told     h im     that      the     younger          m a n would, not                be    let    in

the     ground        in that          state.            The    older       man was            reasonable            and

understanding                 and     said     he w o u l d a r r a n g e          someone           to      stay with          the

younger           man.        They     then       continued           on t h e i r      way,         assisting            the     young

ma n along.              He     was    not a r r e s t e d ,         firstly           because          his       friends       were

helping           him along           and    secondly,           due       to    the    amount            of      passing

supporters            in      comparison            to    Police        presence,              to    do      so    may    h ave

The     day       itse l f      was    very       hot     and    1 was          approached              many       times       whilst          in

Public        Houses          were     open.          Although         Public          Houses           were       in t ha t

immediate           a r ea,      many       had     their       doors           and windows             b o a r d e d up.         I was

unable        to a s s i s t        in t h e s e      enquiries,            firstly            because            I do    not     know         th

a r ea,      and    secondly,           it a p p e a r e d       that       they       had      drunk          enough         alcohol

hours        when     the       train arrived.                  As    previously               stated,            these       supporters

Leppings          L n was        very     busy with            supporters            on    foot-           I was       under          the

 impression            t ha t    very     few     supporters              made     any     positive             attempt          to    enter

supporters             into      the     ground.

went    up o n t o        the     grass        banking         owned       by    the      tyre       fitting          company

directly          opposite          to    the     Leppings           Ln    entrance.             Officers             were       unable

to    get    these       supporters             back      onto       the    roadway.             This       group          of    probably

40    to 5 0      supporters             were     drinking           heavily,           supping           from    large          plastic

two    l i tr e    cannisters             and     tin     cans       of    beer     and        lager,       etc.



I,    along       with     what        appeared          only    a few P o l ic e              Officers,          made          hopeless

attempts          to    get      the     supporters            into       the    ground.             It was,          as    I at       the

pleased.           Many         supporters           would      approach           and     ask       me    how    to       get    into         a

certain        area      within          the    ground         but    unfortunately,                  I know          nowhere

either       inside        or     outside         the     ground.           The      coloured             tickets          did    not

help    as     I was       unable         to    see      the    colour          coded      boards          on    the       turnstile

entranceways.                   I feel       t hat      they    should          h ave     been       situated          w el l     above

young       children aged                approximately                ten years             old,       now w a l k i n g         away       from

the    crowds          and     one m a n        commented            to me      that        it was          ’B L O O D Y    DISGUSTING’

and    he     said      that       the    organisation                was       pathetic.              The      crowding          was       very

tight       and    it was          becoming           difficult            to   raise        my arms            from my          sides.

To    be    closely          compact          was     becoming         clostrophobic                   and      because          we    were

I,    with Police               Constable           A D S H E A D ? then made                an attempt                to    catch       up

One    man with           his     young        boy       shouted          to    us     to    get       in the          ground      and        hei p

They    were       crying         and a n noyed               as    well       as    bitter        towards             the    Police.




Frustration              wa s    shown       by     the       supporters             and     a    bitterness                towards

Police.           Several         of    these        supporters                were     coughing             and       choking        and

very    upse t.           Some        came    out        without          shoes        on    their          feet       and    some       no

arrived          almost        at      the     same      t ime       as    did       thiSjfire       tenders.            A senior

fire     Officer            approached             me    to     establish             what    was      happening             and where

did    the P o l i c e         require          them       to a t t e n d .           I was       unable      to    assist          and

directed          h i m to a n           Inspector            standing           nearby.           This     confusion went

on    for    some       time        u n t il    I made          my way          down    the       rig h t   s ide       of    the

ground       to       the     gates       where         the     injured were                taken      from.        I was       then

shocked          to    see a n d         count       ten      bodies        l y ing     on    the      ground,          some    tendered

to    by P o l i c e        Offices          and     others          overseen          by St       John's      first          aiders.

No    screens          were       at     this      time       around        the       bodies,       and     it w a s         obvious

that     they         were     in f a ct        dead.



I recall          speaking             to P o l i c e      Constable             LIPSKI       and      saying       t hat      I had

counted          ten    d e a d at        the      top     s ide      and       he\*>aid      t h at    it w a s        rumoured          that

about       60 were           feared         d e a d at       Vhv^s tirne.             I stayed         near       to    the    ten       dead

bodies,          forming          a human          chain        to    prfc&ect         the    bodies        from        the

supporters             leaving           the    ground.              Several          male    supporters            were

distraught             and    began          visibly          fighting           with       their      friends          on    seeing       the

bodies       and       they       totally          lost       control           of    themselves.             Their

colleagues             held       o nto      them and           in f a c t       received          punches         and       kicks    from

their       own mates.                 1 heard          the     comment          from       one    man who         said       to me,

We    tried          to    form      a    line to        get      the    crowd         to      c l ear    the      area        to       leave

of    violence            whenever          we      tried      to m o v e         them      on.        We     tried          to    be

diplomatic            and     caring           when moving              the        crowd       on    but      they       had       become

hostile         towards         us,         However?           TWO      supporters               were       excellent,              one     wa s

aged     about               years        and       he a p p e a l e d       to     the        crowd     to     le a v e      quickly           to

allow        the     emergency            services           access.              Another           young      man       aged       about        i:.b

years,         was    also      excellent              and appe al ed               to     the      crowd       in a s i m i l a r

In fact,             the     crowd        w e r e no w     taking        more        notice         of    the      two        supporters

moving         on    the     crowd.            It was        in f act         on      speaking           to    this          young       man,

t hat    I wa s       for     the        first       t ime     made      aware           of w h a t      had       gone       wrong.

As    the      crowd       dispersed             more      thinly            we     returned outside                 the      gate        used

             Many    of    the     supporters      were    dishevelled             and    clearly      shaken,        as    were

             m a ny P o l i c e    Officers.




             Several       supporters       asked       where    the    nearest          telephones       were       and    due    t

             not    being       local,    I was    unable       to a s s i s t .     I feel      that     a stunned

             silence       had     come   over    the    majority       of    the    supporters         who     made       their

             way    home,



             I,    with    my     serial,   l a ter     returned       to C l a y w h e e l s   Ln    p r ior   to    returnin

             to    'C1*    by     coach and      going    off    duty.

approached             these men as             they were        in their           40* s and would           be able          to

The     game was            in progress          and       I dx dn *t have               have much          time    to settle,

I think        someone about               me might             have m e n t i o n e d       there was          trouble             behind

the     goal      so    I    looked      towards           the West S t a n d and at the                      standing

t errace        behind the              goal and        there          just se e m e d      to be        something             wrong.

I   could       see      a number         of p o l i c e    pitch         side      of    the     perimeter         fsstfce

1 later,        and    it was a very short               t i m e , saw a proper           stretcher and

ambulance        go to the West          Stand.          I then saw mak e s h i f t           s t retchers

carried        from the      pitch,     west S t a n d end wit h           people       on them        carried           by

other     fans,,      One    stretcher       was    carried        by Police        officers        but    that was

the     only one,,       All    the    rest were         being     carried        by fans,

I saw three           stretchers       wit h a body upon            it and        1 saw that        the    heads

were     covered and         I com m e n t e d to my son that              there       was    s o mething w r o n g .

I told him         I was     going     down to help as             I had the        skill      and knowledge

of m o u t h to m o u t h and         cardiac.        I went       to the       bottom       of the N o r t h

Stand     to a gate ma n n e d         by two      stewards,,        I explained             to them and           they

opened the         gate ahd        let ms    through.         1 went       to the       left hand         corner             of

the     p i t c h in front      of the B p i o n Hop end,,            On the        pitch were a numfcsr

of bodies        lying      face     up wit h    coats     or w h a t e v e r     covering       the    heads,,

A m b u l a n c e men were working           on some,        I saw a ^ fogj. i ce w oman work i n g             on o n e

and     I saw a number          of fans      looking after           their        friends who were

breathing.

The     one    that the      p o l i c e w o m a n was working       on h a d ^ u s t ^ been        put    down          by

I j o i n e d her and a sked her             if she wa n t e d       the     heart massage.               She      said

yes and        for a few       cycles we        both w o r k e d    on the        body.       It was      clear

that     the    body was       far too      longMead         to be of a s s i s t a n c e        but    she     kept

worki n«^on him.             This     body w ould h a s ^ been about 30 years,                         a white

male w i t h g i b b e r i s h hair,        well    built.         1, c a n ’t remember          any more.               I

moved     to the area aro u n d me.                I saw a number            of    people about           in a daze

and     1 as ked them        if their mates           were    breathing.

I realised then then more                   help was       needed     so     I saw an         Inspector         of

Po l i c e walking       past      on the    gravel       surround      to the         pitch.       I asked          nim

to put a call          out     for    doctors      and    nurses,,      He      said    it wasn't         up to

him,,     At this       point      there were more           people a r r i v i n g       on s t r e t c h e r s     and

one boy        put down on a s t retcher             who     didn't     seem to be breathing,,                       I

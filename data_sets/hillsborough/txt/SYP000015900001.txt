           Dear Mr Smith




           I am writing to you in the hope that I may be able to assist in the enquiry w hich will
           take place follow in g the events at Hillsborough on Saturday.

           I have watched Liverpool throughout Britain and Europe for approximately 28 years from
           the Director’s box, the stands and the terraces. On Saturday I took my sons aged 12 and
           13 and three friends to the match. I had tickets for the north side.

           I was late leaving for the match because my eldest son had been playing                                                                           cricket at
           school. In consequence I arrived at the ground at about 2.45.

          The road from the M l motorway to the ground was heavily policed such an extent that one
          o f m y com panions remarked on what he considered to be the unusual numbers o f police on
          that roadway.    When w e reached the ground however the police presence did not appear to
          be so marked and indeed the police presence at the turnstile entrances and the approaches
          to the turnstiles appeared extrem ely limited.

          There were no queues to the turnstiles but just a general melee.    I joined the crowd
          seeking entry into the ground but my youngest son was frightened at the crush, I decided
          to pull out o f the crowd until it had died down.

          I retreated out o f the immediate crowd but within v iew o f the turnstiles.

          M y son pointed out a large number o f supporters w ho were scaling the perimeter wall to
          get into the ground and perhaps surprisingly a police offic er at the top o f the wall
          appeared to be helping supporters over the wall. I have no way o f knowing whether or not
          those supporters had tickets but I assume that they did not.

          Suddenly some large blue gates to the side o f the turnstiles opened. T hey must have been
          opened from the inside because I did not see who opened them although it was clear that

they were opened in a conventional manner and not broken down by crowds outside.
Im m ediately the doors opened the crowds swarmed through.      In my judgem ent it w ould have
been quite impossible for anybody patrolling those gates either to check tickets or to
indeed establish whether the entrants even even possessed tickets. There was a huge rush
forward w hen the gates opened and although I did not see what happened inside I w ould say
that if that same rush were repeated inside the ground it must have caused some
consternation and distress to those already on the terraces.

The congestion outside the terraces disappeared in a remarkably short space o f tim e once
the gates were opened and this gives some indication o f the speed w ith w hich supporters
w ent through the gates.  Very fe w people at this stage were actually going through the
turnstiles.

When the crowd outside      the turnstiles had largely disbursed I took my     sons into the
ground and actaully arrived in the ground at about 3.10 by w hich tim e supporters were
already on the pitch.

I have experience ? many    major football matches whilst follow in g Liverpool Football Club
over the years and with the benefit o f that experience I hope that             the follow in g
observations may be o f some value: -

1. The m elee outside the turnstiles whilst unpleasant was not in my v iew presenting a
danger o f life.   I can honestly say that I have been in much more severe crushes. Had I
been on m y own I would have joined the throng in an             attempt to get into the ground
without fear for m y life.   The only reason I pulled back was because o f the fears o f my
younger son.     I cannot accept a police com ment that the gates were opened because there
was a danger o f life outside the ground, and in any event the crushing outside the
turnstiles was crushing in a non confined space. Surely the opening o f the gates merely
transferred the crushing to a confined space w hich was potentially far more dangerous.

2. There was no police control whatever at the turnstiles.        You w ill know over many
years that crowd control outside the ground at A n field is     exceptional and the police
ensure orderly queues at the turnstiles.   There were sim ply not enough o fficers in my
opinion to deal with the situation and to ensure that orderly queues were formed. I feel
sure that if there had been proper queues then there would have been no need to open the
steel doors.

3. I have heard that the police felt ju stified in opening the doors because they knew
from the computer count that there were spaces inside the ground. With great respect to
that v iew there was no way o f telling once the gates were opened how many supporters
piled through the gates as that situation     was impossible to control.   There must
inevitably therefore have been a risk that too many supporters would com e into the
ground.

4. There is a suggestion that fault may lie w ith supporters w ho arrived at the ground
w ithout tickets. A gain with respect to that view I think that I can safely assmue that I
yourself and many thousands o f others could have told the police weeks ago that many
suppoorters w ould travel without tickets.  The police must have known that this w ould be
the case but did not appear to have made any provision for it. I recall the sem i-fin a l




                                                                                     (
against Southampton against Whitehart Lane. On that occasion the police erected barriers
about 200 yards from the ground and supporters were not allowed through the barriers
without displaying their tickets.    It follow ed that the only supporters in the immediate
v icin ity o f the ground had tickets and events proceeded without hitch.

5. It had been suggested in       defence o f the authorities that the same match was handled
at the same ground last year without difficulty. I would venture to suggest that far
from ju stifin g the authorities’ handling o f the match on this occasion it was more a
question that they were lucky last year.

6. The question o f ticket      allocation arises.   The C hief E xecutive o f the Football
A ssociation on television "washed his hands" o f the matter and said that the matter was
entirely in the hands o f the police. I find this attitude disappointing. I am sure that
if all parties got together the matter could be satisfactorily resolved.    Further I do
not accept that it would have created insurmountable problems.        Both last year and this
year the M erseyside press, and, I understand, Liverpool Football Club asked the football
association to reconsider the ticket allocation without success.   H owever, surely it is
not beyond the w it o f the police to arrange that Liverpool Supporters com ing in from the
north could be      ouied behind the north stand into the Kop enclosure whilst Forest
supporters be routed behind       the main stand into the Lepping Lane end.         This way the
supporters could be kept apart and yet a more suitable allocation o f tickets arranged.
Villa Park has housed sem i-fin a ls over many years and there are majority o f both sets o f
supporters are housed in the same end o f the ground ie the H olt end.           I have been to
Villa Park on several occasions for sem i-fin a ls and police arrangements w ith regrard to
the supporters appeared to have been totally adequate.          Surely the F.A. could have
pointed this out to the Yorkshire Police and asked the Yorkshire Police to make
appropriate arrangements.

7. I b elieve that the Football Association and often the police and other authorities
w ho regulate football matches are too remote from the majority o f the supporters.               I
fully accept that the authorities in making arrangements for b ig matches have only the
best m otives in mind but I question their ability to fu lfil that roll effectiv ely if they
do not understand the average supporter, his mentaility, his view s and his needs. Indeed
I wonder if the authorities actually realise what many supporters go through to follow
their team.    On the occasion o f the second European Cup Final in Rom e I stayed w ith my
fam ily in the H oliday Inn where o f course the Liverpool party were accommodated.                 I
wonder how many o f their party were aware o f the riot that took place after the match, on
a scale far worse than anything I have experienced in football, and o f how it took four
hours to travel from the stadium to the hotel w hich as you know was probably only a 30
m inute walk in any event.          Unless the authorities understand these           problems and
understand the d ifficu lties faced by many supporters then I fear they         w ill never fully
attend to the needs o f those supporters.

M y concern at this stage is that the loss o f life should not be for nothing. H opefu lly
w e w ill learn the lessons o f Hillsborough so that those w ho died did not die in vain.
Frankly, I don’t believe that British Football has learned the lessons o f the last fe w
years, or in any event I b elieve that financial considerations have outw eighed the
obvious need for change.      I fervently hope one day that w e shall see a large sporting
com plex in Liverpool and that the centre piece w ill be an all seated football stadium
shared by both Everton and Liverpool. Our stadia are antiquated and often located in
tow n centres or in densley populated residential areas. Surely the tim e has come to re ­
locate to the outskirts o f towns and cities in stadia which are all seated, where the
seating is com fortable and spacious, where the access roads are w ide and clear and where
the stadia can be surrounded by large car parks, ensuring easy access to and egress from
the stadia thereby avoiding congestion. This is clearly an undertaking o f great enormity
w hich w ill take many years to develop but would it not be a wonderful tribute to those
w ho died on Saturday if Liverpool and Everton could take the lead.

I hope that my letter w ill be o f some interest to you          and   that   the   observations
expresseed w ill provoke debate in the most contructive sense.

Yours, sincerely

T28.OR OFFENCES: HANDLING
Following the recent decision by H Committee to accept the
Home Secretary’s recommendation that the new Taylor offences
be introduced as early as is practicable, and the article
reflecting that decision in yesterday!s Telegraph (copy
attached), it would seem both helpful and right to announce
the Government1s intentions as soon as possible to Parliament.

2. I attach a draft arranged PQ for this purpose. This might
be offered to Mr Steven Norris who was on the Standing
Committee which considered the Football Spectators Bill: he
has consistently supported firm Government action against
football hooliganism.

3.      The proposed reply refers to creating offences "on the
lines recommended". This gives scope for some minor variation
from the Taylor formulations if this seems desirable in the
course of drafting precisely.


4. The proposed reply also makes explicit the potential for
disorder as providing the justification for outlawing touting
at football. This implicitly sets football aside from other
E.R. *
    sports where touting is a nuisance but not a public order
    problem.

       ARRANGED PARLIAMENTARY QUESTION FOR ORDINARY WRITTEN ANSWER ON
       FRIDAY 26 OCTOBER

       Steven J Norris (Epping Forest): To ask the Secretary of
       State for the Home Department if, in the light of his
       consideration of Lord Justice Taylor's recommendations, he
       will introduce new public order offences at football grounds;
       and if he will make a statement.




       Having considered very carefully the four new offences
       recommended by Lord Justice Taylor, I have concluded that they
       would provide valuable new measures to control hooliganism at
       ^pptball grounds. As soon as the legislative timetable
       allows, I shall bring forward legislative proposals to create
       offences on the lines recommended. These proposals will cover
       selling tickets for and on the day of a football match without
       the authority of the home club to do so. In connection with
       football the potential for disorder makes touting
       unacceptable. The proposals will also outlaw, at football
       grounds, the throwing of missiles; the chanting of obscene and
       racialist abuse; and going onto the pitch without reasonable
       excuse.

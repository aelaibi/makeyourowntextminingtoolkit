            and       have    been        here    for    the    past    eight years.

            I am a          registered           general       nurse    and     qualified          in M a r c h         19 85    ( 0003 85)

            at    Sheffield.

            On Saturday              15th April          1989    < 1 50 ^89 )       I was       working       in t h e C a s u a l t y

            I remember              that    it w a s a b u s y      day    sometime             around 3pm             (1500)       the

            afterwards              the    emergency        telephone         rang.         This    telephone               gives      the

            hospital          a direct           line w i t h a m b u l a n c e      control       so    that          they     can    pre­

            this       telephone           call,     I became       aware       that       there    was       a    paediatri
                                                                                                                                PAGE            2

     cardiac        arrest        en     route          to    the    hospital.         We    started          to    prepare         the

     resuscitation               room a nd          informed           the    registrar          paediatrician.                I had       no

     dealings          with      this      patient.

     At    this     stage        I had        no    idea where            the    patient         was    coming        from    or     the

     circumstances               surrounding                 his    injuries.

     I was       by the       s i s t e r ’s o f f i c e           in A & E w h e n a n a m b u l a n c e m a n w h o m             I only

     k n o w as                   i n f o r m e d me          that     something       had       o c c u r r e d at H i l l s b o r o u g h

     &    to    expect     more        casualties.

     Wi t hi n a very            short        t i me     other        patients      a r r i v e d at      the      hospital.

     Immediately           p r ior       to     this         I had     been     instructed          by C h a r g e     Nurse        BATTY

     to    set    up a     resuscitation                     point     which     I did      in     ’C l e a n T h e a t r e ’ .      I

     cupboard.

     The       first    patient          that       I had any dealings                 w i t h wa s       a white         m a le,    aged

     injuries.            Hi s    pupils           were       dilated        but w e r e    reacting          to    light.          He

                                         Dr     GLENDENING             left me      to a s s i s t      with other           patients

     that       ha d a r r i v e d at         the       hospital.

     The       youth    continued             to    require manual               ventilation which                  I did.

     After       a short         time      a second            patient        arrived       in the        room that          I wa s

     A    student       nurse,         whose        name       I d o n ’t know,        had       come     into      the    room where

            I was      working         and    I asked          her     to t a k e        over     f r o m me &     continue        manually

            ventilating           the     first      patient.              This       she    did,       under     my supe rv isi on .

            Victoria HICKS appeared                       blue        in   co lour,         her    pupils        were    fixed &

            dilated                                                                                 She    was     not    b r e a t h i n g.

            At   this       p o int    her    father        was       giving        her m o u t h       to m o u t h & the       other

            p e r s o n , the a m b u l a n c e m a n       or    policeman,              wa s    giving     cardiac       massage.            I

            could      feel     no     pulse.

            I wa s     joined         by a d o c t o r ,       I think          it wa s      Dr    John CAULDER           & together           we

                                                                                                   d e c i si o n was     made     by the

            doctor      present,          who    I think          wa s     Dr      CAULDER,        to    stop     treatment.

            V i c t o r i a H I C K S was       then      removed          from       the    room & taken           to    the

            orthopaedic           plaster        room.           I had        no    further        dealings        with     this

            pat i e n t .

            As   s o o n as     Victoria         H I C K S wa s        removed           from     the    room a no t he r       patient

   *        arrived.           It w a s      a white        male with              dark     wavy    hair     &    I think brown

            e y es.     He wa s        wearing       jeans        &    I think a green                  jumper,     but     I c a n ’t be

            sure      about     the      top.       He    was     aged        18-20 years.

            He was      blue      colour        in a p p e a r a n c e ,        not      breathing        & without         pulse.         I



                                                                                                                             I c a n ’t

            remember         which       doctor      wa s      present,            but    I was     instructed           by a d o c t o r      to

            stop      treatment.             This    patient           wa s     also      taken     to    the     plaster       room.

            I dealt with a further                       two     patients,            both males.            Upon arrival            they

            were      breathing          with    the a s s i s t a n c e           of a i r w a y s .     They were         treated and

             admitted         to W a r d 60.      Both     of    these    patients      to m y      knowledge       lived.

             The    first      patient      who   had arri ve d      in the C l e a n T h e a t r e      had   remained

             the r e ,    still    being m a n u a l l y    ventilated          throughout       the    course      of    events

             I have       described above.             Within      half    an    hour   of    the     last   patient       being

             taken       to W a r d 6 0    this   y o u t h was    also    transferred         to W a r d 60.        He

             su bse que nt ly went          to C o r o n a r y   Intensive       Care   and    I am aware        t h a t Jie

             I had       no   further      dealings      with any        other    patients       or    the   ones    that      I

             had a d m i n i s t e r e d   treatment       to.

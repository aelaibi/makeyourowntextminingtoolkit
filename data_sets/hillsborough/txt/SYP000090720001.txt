w hen    I was      i nstructed to take a meal                break.



At 3 .00       pm   (1500)       I was    instructed by PS GREEN to go to the Leppings

Lane     of the ground due to a report                   of    crowd problems.            Along with

other officers             in our serial we          left the G y m n a s i u m    i mm ed iately and

made     our way a ro u n d the touchline              towards      the Leppings Lane                end.     As

we neared the L ep pings Lane                 end I saw several           fans     climbing          fencing

s eparating         standing       fans    on the elevated section of the L e p p i n o /l La ne

end from the seated                persons    in the N orth Stand.            A s o l i t a ry /o ff ic er

was dealing wit h            the matter and          I, a c c o m p a n i e d by PC            G I L L, went

into     the stand and            I saw a y outh      laid on the seating who                  had

a p pa r e n t l y fallen from the fencing.                   After we had a t t e m p t e d to move

the youth he stated he was alright and                          I then went        to the front of the

stand      intending        to    inform the St Johns am bu la nc e            personnel         there was a

man     in the      stand who might          need their assistance.               Upon     reaching

the     touchline         I saw several       spectators        on the track and e ncroaching                      on

the     playing area.             I then saw a Police Officer who was                     of at       least    the

rank of Inspector                running on the       pitch towards         the    referee.          At this

moment       I thought a pitch             invasion was        occurrLrfg.        I ran onto          the   pitch

crossing        the goa lm ou th at the Leppings La^e                  end where        I saw a young

woman      running        onto    the    pitch.     I stop pe d her & a s ke d her             not to go on

the     pitch.          She was    hysterical       & scr/amed      ’T h e y ’re getting         crushed in

there.'         I i mm ed ia te ly       ran to the    exit     gate from the L ep pings Lane

terracing w hich            is to the       left of the goalposts            facing       the terracing.



On arrival          the gate was wide open,              there were a number              of    people      lying

on the grass at             the    edge    of the    pitch.      Bodies were          totally w e d g i n g

the     g a t ew a y.     One man was       laid on the track with his                 feet     trapped       in

the fencing.              I tried a number of times to               pull    him clear          but his feet

were w ed ged fast.               He was    conscious;        talking & his        life did

appear       threatened.          Alo ng si de him was another man who was                      trapped fay

the    lower       part of his      body.        I tried w ith the help of other                     officers

to    pull    this man      clear    but we was wedged.                 Above    him was a girl

wearing a green T-shirt.                  She was        unconscious and a s he n faced.                    She

was    trapped from her            chest downwards.              The    girl's    life a pp e a r e d to be

in danger and          tried to      pull    her out.           I m a n ag ed to move      her a little

but not s u f fi ci en tl y to relieve              the     pressure         on her.     I turned my

a t t e n t i o n to another       person above          her,   a man wearing           glasses.           He was

calm and       conscious,         I tried to pull           him out         by his shoulders          but was

unsuccessful.             I was    on my knees        by the       gate whilst         trying    to    pull

people out.          Whilst       I was    trying     to    pull    people out a number               of    people

ran through the gate               trampling       the     people who were we dg ed & also

myself.        In a d d i t i o n officers       on the      railings above me were                  pulling

people over         the    railings,       some of these were                landing on my       back and

head,      knocking mjr over a couple               of times.           I recall       Chief

the    rescue      but due    to the       confined space           there was      only    room for two

or three       officers      to extricate          people from the gateway.                    I was aware

of supporters          running      towards      the gate        from the       pitch side       on several

occasions.          On one o cc asion        I     was     pulled away from a           person        I was

trying       to rescue      by a man who           I can only describe as behaving in a

f r e nz ie d manner.        Eventually          I was able        to^pull      some    people fr5m the
                                                                     ^                     --------------
m e l ee    in the g a t e w a y and the         pressure       seemed to ease a little.                    I saw

the girl       in the green t-shirt,               who     had earlier         been unconscious,

stir.        Her   eyes    began to       roll     a ro u n d and she started           to moan.           I held

her hand & told her               that we would get her                out.     After    several more

seconds       of heaving      I freed her^a-nd passed her                     to officers       behind me.

I then,       a s si s t e d fay other jrff i c e r s , pulled a large             number       of    people

t hr ou gh the gateway                    .Ithen saw as the terraces                   cleared a little

that       there were a large         number       of a p p a r e n t l y    dead people       in the
                                                                                                             P AG E 4
                                                                                                             S3496A

      enclosure       near    to the g a t e w a y .      To   the    right    of the gateway was a

      large    pile of e nt wined bodies.                 There were a large             number       of bodies

      laid on the terracing.               I went       into    the t^rfracijng a n d          it was apparent

      that    life was       extinct    in the m a j o r i t y of the          persons     laid on the

      terracing.    I did,         however,     atteypt         for several        minutes       to    resuscitate
& fcruz        <4-1                                 / /
      one man.    However,         this was      urfsuccessf u l .           I then found a man sat at

      the back of the terracing who                    complained of          leg injuries.            I carried

      this man out of the ground with the a ss is t a n c e                       of a supporter.              Thera

      were so many       bodies      laying ar ou nd that a third man had to guide                             us up

      the    terracing and        through the tunnel             into the open a rea at                the    rear    of

^    the stand.        I c arried the man through the                   concertina gates and                 placed

      him    in the    recovery      position near an a m b u l a n c e .            Whilst      I was       tending

      this man a came raman            came up taking           photos,       he was a t t a c k e d    by an

      a ng ry mob who        had to be restrained by officers.                         I left the       injured

      man after a short while and               returimdr"'to the terracing.                     By this       time

      most    of the injured and dead tvsfa been                 removed.         At    this     time    I

      r ecovered a number          of watcj^Bs from the t e r r a c e s for safekeeping.                         I

      saw a man       pick up a wet £10 note from the terrace,                          he told me had           lost

      one    in the    crush.      I was    by this time             too stunned to argue with him.

      I later h anded the watc he s            to                    a long with a £ 1 coin            I had

^    picked up.        I then     r eporterd to PS GREEN & as the m at ch                        had been

      a b a n d o n e d we were   i nstructed to escort               fans    on the     buses    back       to the

      city centre.

                Fur th er       to my    recollection,          date 23 October           1989    (231089),     that

                r ec ol le ct ion       is true and       I am    content      tor      it to be used      in any-

                proceeding s .

                I make this            statement       on the    under st an di ng       that    I can take a

                p hotogcopy of           it after       I have    signed      it.

                On page 2 of nyj- r ec o ll ec ti on             I referred to an incident                in an area
                                      y «—»
                where     the Lej^Jkngs Lane             terraces a dj o in the N orth Stand,                together with

                PC 3158 -GIL^ and              I can recall       my   involvement         in that      incident.

                At abo£it 3.00           pm    (1500),    together wit h other             officers     from my Serial             I

                was      called to       leave       the gyrrmasiurnn to assist            in dealing wit h what             I

                u n de rs to od to be crowd problems.                   On entering         the stadium on the

                perimeter            track    I f ol lowed    colleagues as we made              our way along         in

                front      of the N or th S t an d towards             the L ep pings Lane          terraces.        The
                                                                                                           PAGE
                                                                                                           S 3 498B

sergeant        in charge         of my Serial            was    some distance        in front and

c ertainly          not w i t h i n earshot          of rny position.

As    I reached the           corner         of the ground where               the N orth S t an d meets           the

Leppings        Lane     end.         My a t t e n t i o n was    drawn to my        right where         I saw

that    supporters were                climbing up on the fencing w hich divides                         the

N o r t h Stand seating area and the N o rt h West                             terracing where        fans

supporting Liverpool                   had been allocated.                My    r ec ol lection    is that

there were          two or three             s upporters a c t u a l l y on top of the dividing

fence and          I noticed others were                  close    to   it but     I cannot       say that         they

were    trying       to scale          it.

I noticed that there was                      one   p o l ice officer''in t ne North S ta nd seating

area.        I w ould estimate               that   the    puiiit1 uTTALsr         1 couid see was

a p p r o x i m a t e l y 5 yards        from the fence           itself and was s u r r o u n d e d by a

number       of a p p a r e n t l y    hostile      supporters.           I was    i mmediately       concerned

for this officer              due to the fact              that,    despite       being a seated area,

all    the    people a ro u n d          him were     standing arid it was             obvious      to me that

the officer          needed assistance.

I was unable           to attr ac t my Ser ge an ts a t t e n t i o n and so together w it h PC

3158 GILA. I made my way towards                          the officer

I made my along a gang wa y                    into the N or th           Stand       and as      1 approached            I

could hear a lot of shout i ng go i ng o n .

As    I got     closer      I r ecognised             the   officer as an             officer      Ihad seen

before at matches and whom                      I     a s s u m e d was an officer        from H a m m e r t o n

Road.        The    officer       had a beard.             I saw that he was           standing       over a

well    built youth who was                   lying on his         back    in between      rows of seating.

The    officer       said words           to the effect           " H e ’s fell    off the fence."

As    I saw the y outh he a pp e a r e d groggy and                       immediately      I formed the

impre ss io n that          he was        suffering        the    effects       of alcohol.        His   eyes

were    glased and he gave a strong                        smell    of drink.         We tried to        lift him

to place        him on the            seats    to examine         him   properly.        It was     chaos
                                                                                                        PAGE
                                                                                                        S34988

a ro un d us as some         supporters wa nt ed him                lifted up whilst           others were

obstr uc ting      us want in g        him    left where       he was.         My i mpression was          that

those     supporters       ar ou nd us who w an t e d him             left on the floor wan te d him

left     there    be cause      they    thought      he would be a rr es te d or ejected                 from

the    ground     if we got him to his feet.

W i t h i n the   crowd a ro u n d us there a p p e a r e d           to be some who knew him who

said to leave           him and that they w o u l d            look after        him.       I was able      to

ask    him,    as he became more              coherent and started to sit up,                    whether     he

was alright and he said he was                      okay.      Nevertheless,           I was     concerned to

satisfy myself and ensure                    that   this youth was         not    injured.         My

impression was           that my actions were                now    in charge     of the        incident

a l th o u g h the officer who m             I first went          to assist and my own            colleague

PC 3138 GILL were,              like me,       waiting       to make sure that           he was alright.

I was     confident       in my own min d that he was                  not hurt       but   to be certain

I went down to the              perimeter       track    to summon a St Johns a m b u la nc e

officer        to ask    that    the youth be         checked out for            injury.         I left the

y outh    in the k nowledge            that a number          of supporters who m            I had spoken

to had said they w o ul d              look after       him.

As    I got to the        perimeter          track my a t t e n t i o n was s ud denly drawn to a

senior     officer       on the    pitch,       running       to attract        the    referees

attention.         At that       point       the disaster          started to unfold and            I went

onto     the    pitch to     remove a girl           w hom    I refer     to    in my    reco ll ec ti on on

page 2.

I had not spoken to a St Johns a m b u la nc e                       crew as my a t t e n t i o n was

focused on the disorder                 itself and my own attempts                    to save    life    meant

that for a considerable                 period of       time       I gave no more       thought     to the

               On S a t u r d a y    15th April        1989 the day of the Semi- f i n a l                at S h e f f i e l d

     £as at home until                10.00 am.          At    10.00 am          I w a l k e d to L e p p i n g s Lane

                                                                                    I walked               into L e p p i n g s

Lane       I saw that         there were a lot of                   s up p o r t e r s a b o u t , far more                                than at

t he same         time at        last years          semi-f i nltl/          T h e y were standing                              around                in

groups       of about a dozen.                   I w ou l d say there were about 4 groups                                                   of

this       sue       and then smaller             groups       of    t w o ’s or t h r e e ’s,                   fathers and

sons       or young         couples.

I could tell             they were Liv e r p o o l            supp o r t e r s      due           to their a c c e n t s                       and

dress.           The groups         of a d ozen or more were agec^- between                                         15 to 20

y ea r s    of age.          Most     of the youths            in groups wjfre drinking                                   from             cans

of beer and when                 f i n i sh ed   they    crushed the             sans up a n d threw                               them

into the          street.          E v e n some      of the young            ones           of about              15 yrs were
*    ..
drinking          from      cans    of beer.          None     of the youths were                          particularly

n o i se y or disorderly,                they were just              s t a nding            talking and drinking.

I bought what               I needed from the             newsa g e n t s an d               returned home.                                I saw

that       the    police were          standing         by the       gates       to the ground,                           they

h a d n ’t blocked oft" the                road                                                                        at this                 stage

At    1 0.30 am        I a ga i n     left my house            to visit my mother                          in law,                     I

walked       back up to L e pp in gs              Lane    then turned               right towards H a l i f a x

Road,       awa y from the            football        ground.         By this^time                    the amount                      of

s up p o r t e r s    had    inc r e a s e d g rea t l y w a l k i m j / t o w a r d s             the gr o u n d standing

around       in small         groups and          sittinlgygfn walls,                       I noticed that a lot of

the    s uppo rters were             d r i n ki ng    from     cans     of    beer.               I still           d i d n ’t see

a n y of them acting                in a d i s or de rl y manner.                I walked               to the end of

L e p pi ng s Lane          to the     traffic        island at H a l i f a x Road,                        then along

H a li fa x Road.           As     I w a l k e d along H a l i f a x R o a d                I saw a few groups                                 of

football          supporters         stand i n g around,             most     of who m were                     d r i nking                 cam

of beer.             I presume       these were L i verpool                  fans           because           thats             the

              d i r e c t i o n they come         from        but    I c a n ’t be s u r e . W h e n      I a r r i v e d at my

              Mother       in laws        it was about              11.am.

              At    11.30 am         I left my m o t h e r - i n - l a w s         house and        caught    the    bus to

              H i l l s b o r o u g h a r r i v in g    at about        12.00.       The      shopping     area     in

              H i l l s b o r o u g h was    packed w ith suppo r t e r s              which       I believe      were

              N o t t i n g h a m Forest        supporters,           because       I remember         seeing     the tree

              motifs       on their         hats and scarves.                 I don't         remember     seeing any             of

              the     fans a ro u n d the          shops       d r i nking    from     cans      of beer.       I left        the

              shops      at about         1.00 pm a n d         caught       the    bus to W o r d s f o r t h Avenue             to go

              to the       bingo        hall.     By this           time a l t h o u g h there we re still a                lot of

              fans a r o u n d       there were          considerably           less       than at     12.00.

               I. a r r i v e d at      the bingo        hall at        1.30 and didn't             leave until          3 . 10    pm.

              At    no time       did     I see any           fans?    L i v erpool        or N o t t i n g h a m Forest

              acting       in a d i s o r de rl y manner.

              Some     of them that             I had seen during              the day drinking              gave me        the

              they were         collapsing             onto    the    floor    but     I    saw quite a few who              by a

               c o m b i n a t i o n of the way they were                 talking          and messing a r o u n d        in a

              f r i e n d l y way with each other an d drinking                             from   cans    of beer        I got        the

RESEARCH INTO THE PROVISION OF VIDEO TAPES TO YORKSHIRE TELEVISION

I refer to our discussions on 24 September 1997, my letter of 8 October and Lord Justice Stuart-
Smith's letter of 13 October 1997 on the above subject. A search of the indexed material within
the Hillsborough Archives has failed to reveal any correspondence from Yorkshire Television. A
search of non-indexed material and in particular the personal file of Chief Inspector Norman
Bettison (now assistant Chief Constable West Yorkshire Police) has revealed a letter from
Yorkshire Television dated 4 July 1989 and an internal memo dated 7 July 1989 from Mr Bettison
to the Chief Constable (Copies attached).

I have not spoken to Mr Bettison, nor to Superintendent Pratt, who is now retired, but is
mentioned in Mr Bettison's memo, nor to Peter Wright the former Chief Constable of South
Yorkshire Police, all of whom may be able to recall the response given to Yorkshire Television.
The YTV letter does however, make it clear that the West Midlands Police had agreed to assist
them make a documentary into the Hillsborough Disaster and was seeking the approval of South
Yorkshire Police to copy tapes and photographs for possible use in the programme. At that time
all the original Hillsborough video tapes and photographs were in the possession of West
Midlands Police and if approval was given it would have been the originals in their possession
that were copied in order to maintain picture quality.

Inspector Michael Layton of West Midlands Police (Now Superintendent at Willenhall Police
Station, John Street, Willenhall, WV13 1PU Tel No 01922 439121) was responsible for the
management of the video and photographic evidence for Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry, the
Coroner's Inquest and the preparation of discipline files. I have spoken to Mr Layton and he
recalls West Midlands Police co-operating in the making of the documentary and feels that the
copy tapes and photographs used by Yorkshire Television must have been provided by West
Midlands Police as they were in possession of the originals, but he cannot specifically recall it.




                                                 The person dealing with this correspondence is:
                                                 Superintendent Hepworth

Another serving officer that Mr Layton suggests mav he ahle to assist is R e te n tiv e C h ief
Superintendent Michael Foster, who works at the

Mr Foster worked directly to ACC Mervyn Jones on the Hillsborough Enquiry and would have
been privy to policy decisions. Alternatively Mervyn Jones recently retired as Chief Constable of
Cheshire Constabulary could be contacted for his recollections, or a search of his paperwork
from the Hillsborough Enquiry presently still stored at Cheshire police Headquarters may reveal
correspondence between Yorkshire Television and West Midlands Police.

I enclose a copy for your viewing of the actual Yorkshire Television Documentary, which was
broadcast on the ITV Network on Tuesday 6 February 1990, in the "First Tuesday" series of
programmes and entitled "Disaster at Hillsborough".

PC Greenway and myself have viewed the programme and have prepared a schedule that
identifies the source of all the still photographs and video clips used in the programme. The tape
running time identified in the schedule is the actual elapsed time from the start of the enclosed
copy video tape. All the still photographs and video clips have been identified with the exception
of a 3 second clip shown at 20 minutes 12 to 15 seconds actual running time of the tape. Where
possible we have also indicated the actual time of the video clip on Saturday 15 April 1989. In
the case of the BBC Video there are nine separate tapes of their footage on the day and it would
have taken us an inordinate length of time to identify the actual tape that the clips come from and
so this has not been done. With the exception of the 3 seconds we have not been able to
identify, we can categorically state that none of the video clips or still photographs used in the
programme is new and that all of them were available to Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry and the
Coroner's Inquest.

It is also worthy of note that in her introduction to the programme the presenter, Olivia O'Leary,
says "Lord Justice Taylor allowed us to film the 9 month enquiry... We used police video footage
seen only by the enquiry team..."

I do not feel that I can take this matter any further forward without speaking to people I have
named above or without access to Mr Mervyn Jones' paper.

If you feel I can be of any further assistance please do not hesitate to contact me.

    FROM:   Chief Inspector Bettison                         S T A T IO N /D E P T *

    TO:     Chief Constable                                  DATE:              7 July 1989


            SUBJECT:                 YORKSHIRE TELEVISION DOCUMENTARY

            I have contacted Superintendent Pratt who claims to have something similar
            in train with the BBC and the West Midlands Police to be produced in January
            1990, but he has no knowledge of a YTV documentary.   No other 'Hillsborough
            Inquiry Team' member is aware of such an arrangement.

            Initial thoughts:

            West Midlands appear, already, to be fully committed to assisting in the
            production of a national television documentary (see paragraph 2 of the
            attached letter).

            IF South Yorkshire Police agree to assist we could find ourselves playing
            "â– "second fiddle', however . . .

            IF South Yorkshire Police      decline   the opportunity we may be depicted as
            the 'accused'.

            The conclusion, therefore, is that we agree to take part in the production
            of this documentary on our own terms.

            Those terms might ensure that we are presented as a caring and professional
            organisation, doggedly pursuing the facts surrounding the disaster, eg

            i)         The conspiracy theory.

            ii)        Position of bodies - Pen 3.

            iii)   . Viewing and reviewing the video   evidence todetermine    when,
                     precisely, barrier 124A failed (possibly before the opening of
                     Gate C).

            iv)        Obtaining over 800 statements    on behalfof the                WestMidlands
                        Investigation team - and our attempts, from them,              to build up a
                        picture of events.

            In other words, presenting the South Yorkshire Police as                   active   rather
            than simply a passive subject of the West Midlands enquiry.

            We should not underrate the value of our comtemporaneous film material,
            video and stills (without it the proposed documentary would consist of
            images of West Midlands detectives knocking on doors).    Perhaps this could
            be traded with great care.  (See paragraph 4 of the attached letter).

            Superintendent Pratt returns to duty on Monday 10 July 1989 and will have
            a view on this matter.     I have left a copy of these documents for his
            attention.

        l am trying to trace all the video material obtained by the South Yorkshire Police on the day
of the disaster and I am also anxious to know precisely what material was supplied by the South
Yorkshire Police to Yorkshire Television.

       I have already been provided with two tapes TB1 and TB2 together with a schedule of the
contents of the tapes, which I understand was provided to Lord Taylorâ€™s Inquiry and the Coroner.
Please confirm that this is correct. TB1 finished at 15.04 and TB2 at 15.34. Mr Hicks, who has
provided me with a copy of some of the material said to have been provided by you to Yorkshire
Television, told me that there are tapes which go on till 17.22. I assume that these are those which
were inserted in the monitors in the control room at about 15.34. I would be grateful if you would
send me the original of these tapes (you should retain a copy).

        On one of the copy tapes that Mr Hicks has provided to me there are views from cameras
 other than those at fixed points around the ground, for example there are views into pen 6, scenes in
 the mortuary and views from the N orth Stand after the disaster. I believe these were taken by the
 police underwater team. I have seen part of the film taken in the mortuary when I came up to
 Sheffield on 24 September.

       Would you also please be kind enough to supply me with correspondence passing between
 Yorkshire TV and South Yorkshire Police.

I refer to the letter dated 13 October 1997, from Lord Justice Stuart-Smith addressed to the
Chief Constable, Mr Wells, which has been forwarded to myself for a response.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith indicates that he wishes to trace all the video material obtained by
South Yorkshire Police on the day of the Hillsborough Disaster. I enclose a copy of the video
schedule prepared by West Midlands Police for Lord Justice Taylor's Judicial Inquiry. I am told
that together there are over 70 hours of video. The schedule details all the tapes by reference
number and there is a brief description of the salient points as a guide to the content of each
tape. At the time this schedule was produced all the original tapes were in the possession of
West Midlands Police. They are now in the Hillsborough Archive here at Heeley.

The tapes which were placed in the recorder in the police control room after the tapes reference
TB1 and TB2 were given the reference number TB3 and TB4. Copies of these have been made
and have been forwarded under separate cover. I know that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith asked for
the originals, but as I discussed with you on the telephone I am loath to supply them, particularly
through the post, as the quality of a copy degrades from that of an original. If we then had to
supply a further copy from a copy the picture quality would be poor.

I do not feel able to comment on the third paragraph of the letter without actually seeing the copy
tapes that Mr Hicks provided.

Finally in respect of the material supplied to Yorkshire Television, we have identified a "First
Tuesday" documentary programme, which was broadcast on the ITV Network on Tuesday
6 February 1990. The programme was made with the co-operation of West Midlands Police and
we have a video copy of it. We are presently identifying the source of all the video clips shown in
the programme and still enquiring as to how these came into the possession of Yorkshire
Television. I have traced a copy of a letter from Yorkshire Television to the then Chief Constable
of South Yorkshire Police seeking his approval for the making of the programme, but I have not
traced the response. I will deal with the matter more fully in a separate letter, when I forward a
copy of the programme to you together with a schedule of the video used.

        I am trying to trace all the video material obtained by the South Yorkshire Police on the day
of the disaster and I am also anxious to know precisely what material was supplied by the South
Yorkshire Police to Yorkshire Television.

        I have already been provided with two tapes TB1 and TB2 together with a schedule of the
contents of the tapes, which I understand was provided to Lord Taylorâ€™s Inquiry and the Coroner.
Please confirm that this is correct. TB1 finished at 15.04 and TB2 at 15.34. Mr Hicks, who has
provided me with a copy of some of the material said to have been provided by you to Yorkshire
Television, told me that there are tapes which go on till 17.22. I assume that these are those which
were inserted in the monitors in the control room at about 15.34. I would be grateful if you would
send me the original of these tapes (you should retain a copy).

        O n one of the copy tapes that Mr Hicks has provided to me there are views from cameras
other than those at fixed points around the ground, for example there are views into pen 6, scenes in
the mortuary and views from the N orth Stand after the disaster. I believe these were taken by the
police underwater team. I have seen part of the film taken in the mortuary when I came up to
Sheffield on 24 September.

      Would you also please be kind enough to supply me with correspondence passing between
Yorkshire TV and South Yorkshire Police.

RE: EXAMINATION OF VIDEO TAPE

I refer to the video tape you marked by the label "Copy of P Hammond Tapes 3) and Â© , copied
by Home Office Press Office, 22/ix/97, at request of C Bone, Hillsborough Scrutiny.
Property of C Bone", which you handed to me during the evening of your visit to Sheffield on
Wednesday 24 September 1997.

Ken Greenway and I have carried out an examination of the video tape and have produced a
schedule which shows the camera location and the view of the various shots, based on the time
visible on screen. We have also produced a code index for the camera locations and for the
views shown. Copies of this documentation are enclosed.

We have compared the timed sequences on the above tape, with tapes in the
Hillsborough Archives and have positively identified that the sequences timed from
12.36 and 28 seconds to 15.26 and 35 seconds are from the South Yorkshire Police CCTV video
tape of 15 April 1989, reference TB2. The sequences timed from 15.32 and 31 seconds to
17.22 and 52 seconds are also positively identified as being from the South Yorkshire Police
CCTV video tape of 15 April 1989, reference TB3.

Police Constable Trevor Bichard was the CCTV operator at the Hillsborough Football Stadium on
15 April 1989 and the video tapes TB2 and TB3 are referred to in his statements, copies of which
have been forwarded to you under separate cover.

The original copies of these tapes were handed over to the West Midlands Police during the
week commencing Monday 17 April 1989, for the purpose of their enquiry into the
Hillsborough Disaster and were taken from Hammerton Road Police Station, Sheffield by
Police Constable                >f the West Midlands Police, on Thursday 20 April 1989.

    RE: REQUESTS.FOR INFORMATION FROM HILLSBOROUGH ARCHIVES

    During the visit of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, Chris Catherall and yourself to the
    Hillsborough Archives at Heeley on Wednesday 24 September 1997, you made a number of
    requests to us for information, which you agreed to put in writing. To date we have not received
    these.

    Of the two requests we have already responded to, one on 24 September 1997 was to supply
    transcripts of the main and mini inquests and the other was the provision of copies of the plans of
    the Leppings Lane terrace reference C275 and C278, which we forwarded on
    30 September 1997.

    If my memory serves me correctly the other requests were:-

    Report on continued research into amendment of officers' recollections;

    Research and report on the suggestion that officers were coached to give evidence, to
    Lord Justice Taylor's enquiry;

    Research and report on the provision of video tapes to Yorkshire Te

    Examine the copy video tape provided by        yourself via Trevor

    .-'"Research any breach of the          law   by       Granada     Television   in   the   approach   to   a
    > Hillsborough Inquest Jury Member;

      Prepare a report on policy and procedure for the release of Hillsborough Documentation to
      interested parties;

I Q Report to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith on a number of outcomes from the civil actions,

â€¢    â€¢Incidentally, neither Ken Greenway nor myself has sufficient knowledge, nor the information to
      supply the details which you are likely to request about the civil actions, particularly as most of
      them were confidential. The outcomes are not within the knowledge of the force solicitor,
      Alan Walker either. I therefore have in mind to write to Peter Metcalf of Hammond Suddards
      Solicitors at Empire House, 10 Piccadilly, Bradford BD1 3LR, who acted for
      South Yorkshire Police and our Insurers in these hearings, asking him if he will respond to your
      request once we receive it, unless of course you wish to write to him directly, I will not action this
      further until I hear from you.

      Work is progressing on the other requests and I shall soon be in a position to start responding.

       Finally, I believe there was a suggestion that Chris Catherall should revisit Heeley to examine the
     . police officersâ€™ statements and the amendments made to them. Can you inform me if this is to
       take place and a likely date, please.

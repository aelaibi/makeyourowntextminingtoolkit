Whilst       at    our     point        awaiting           the    train,         I spoke            to    several          supporters

basically would                 not     turn aro u n d           when asked,               and      continued            up H a l i f a x

they    di d      not     appear        dr un k.           I also        spoke        to    several           people          wh o    were

with    f a m i l y who         wanted         food and          directions            to     the        gr o u n d .         On e    family

consisted          of 2 m e n         and a young               boy.         The      b o y ’s f a t h e r        ha d     a h om e        made

stand     for      his     so n    to     use      in s i d e    the     ground            but      shortly          before          1 had

heard     a message             stating         t h at     milk     cr a t e s       were     to     be     banned         in the

losing       it.          This     he     did.           As he was            doing        this      I was        talking            to    his

thing           wa s      a huge       joke.               No     nastiness            at    all.




I must           sa y      now that             up to        this      p o int        I thought           everything           was      going

quite           well       a n d we        seemed          to     be w i n n i n g        over     the      supporters          we      were

talking              to    by h a v i n g        a    laugh and                 a j o ke a n d         it s e e m e d    to    be    p a y i n g off,




T he       supporters                were       taken        to     the         ground without                 incident and             t a k e n to

t he       turnstiles.                      I found             that       traffic; wa s           still         running       along

Leppings               Ln w h i c h        seemed          daft       as    it was          only adding            to    the    congestion.

At        the    elbow          of    the       ro a d     r ight      outside            the     ground,         the    situation           was

so        bad    that          I went       into         the      r oa d a n d        began       to w o r k      traffic       and

pedestrian                 c on tr o l      off       my     own      bat,       because          people         were milling

everywhere                 and       someone          wa s      going           to     get h u r t      before      m u c h longer.

Buses           were       trying          to    plough           through and               the      s i t u a t i o n was      te ns e .




I sorted               out      the    initial             problem and went                     back      onto     the     footpath          on

agitated          and       I informed                hi m    that       if he       felt        so     strongly about                     the

he    said       he w o u l d         do.         He     then       stormed          off       b ac k     to    the       queues           and          the

I spoke          to    the       l a dy     for       about        2 minutes            and      she      then       left        me    thanking

The     c r u s h for        the       5 North           Stand          turnstiles             was      by     now g e t t i n g           very

bad.         I went          and       t oo k     up a        position against                      the      wall      of    the       sweet

From      what          I could             see      the      sit ua tio n was              chaotic            all     around          the     area.

People         were          p u s hi ng ?        chanting?               singing       and        the     position           was       useless

from a         control              p o int       of    view.              Young       men     were        actually            climbing            over

the      wall       above           the      West       Stand         seating          turnstiles               and     into       the       ground.

By     now     people             ware       getting            hysterical             a r o u n d me          both male           and       female

and      begging             for       help.            I decided               that    someone            was       going        to    get

anyone         could          do       to    stop       trouble            happening.                   (By t r o u b l e         I mean

A-,   Immediately              the    crowd       surged              forward               to    t hi s    g a t e ^ayc( w e n t         through.

      The     pressure          eased within                30        ss/onds               but     sta.ll       people           were    pushing             and

      whole        mentality          seemed          to    be            not    to rniss the               ki ck      off        at    any    price.

      It was        frightening,                       I bollocked                      the 2 lads a n d t h e n                 let     them       go.

      To     be    quite       honest       Iwas       sweating                  like       a dog          and        was    physically              tired

      due     to all          the    pu s h i n g ,    shoving                  etc,,         plus       the     warm        weather          and    having

the     noise,         a mixture             of       squeals          and       shouts.             Next        the    smell,            you

                    By    no w      I was       feeling          rough.               I'd      carried         dead?      worked         on d e a d arid

                    shoulders             were       burning           and       1 felt        sick.           I just         felt      useless            to    be

                    quite          honest.            I've       never           w o r k e d as      hard      in rny life a n d               got       nothing

                    out       in m y a r m s         as    we    sat        talking.              He'd      lost        his    mate       in the           c r ow d

                    and       couldn't          find       him.             I brought           him     round and             g a ve    him a drink               and

                    ha    came       to a n d w e n t           away.

            HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY FINAL REPORT

            In response to Mr Gilbert1s note of 24 January I discussed with
            him the desirability of providing a CFR copy to Peter Wright, the
            Chief Constable of South Yorkshire. As the South Yorkshire Force
            bore the brunt of criticism following the publication of the
            interim report, it is inevitable that the media will look to the
            Chief Constable for early comment on the final report.

            Mr Gilbert indicated that he would discuss the matter with the
            Police Department but was not optimistic that an exception would
            be made in favour of Mr Wright i

            If advance copies are made available to the press (Mr Mower's note
            of 26 January) to provide them with preparation time, then I
            suggest that the case for providing a similar facility to
            Mr Wright is strengthened.  There is no likelihood of Mr Wright
            not honouring the embargo and in consequence there is little risk
            factor.

            If this request is acceded to I would be pleased to arrange for
            delivery to Mr Wright at the appointed time on 29th.

    HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY FINAL REPORT

    I have seen Mr Gilbert's note of 24 January which,
    unfortunately (my fault!), I was unable to comment on
    yesterday.

    He questions whether we should make confidential final revises
    available to press. With such a bulky document we should come
    under great pressure and be subject to a lot of criticism as a
    department if we were not able to give the press some time to
    prepare; this would be particularly true of the evening
    papers, those in Sheffield and Liverpool, of course, but more
    generally also.  I should be prepared to take this flak if it
    were in our overall interests and indeed my initial view was
    that we should provide CFRs only an hour or so before
    publication (perhaps with some covert help to Liverpool and
    Sheffield). The situation has changed however. Given the
    exposure already given to the demise of the membership scheme,
    it is in our interest to ensure that the media give as full as
    possible a treatment to the report's wider comments and
    recommendations.

    I propose, therefore, that we should make CFRs available as
    early as we reasonably can which will probably be late on
    Monday morning. Given that Parliament is familiar with this
    system, I think it unlikely that there would be a sustainable
    criticism if the embargo should be broken in some way.

I attach a suggested timetable of the Pariiamentar
leading up to the statement on Monday 29 January.


As there is no time for conventional CFR copies of the Report
to be printed Parliamentary Section will have to produce
copies for use in advance of publication by removing the
outside covers and placing an embargo label over the
publication date (so that details are embargoed until the
Home Secretary stands up).


However, in the absence of proper CFRs Ministers may wish to
consider whether in fact we should issue CFRs to the press in
any numbers at all.                  There could be points of order raised
before the Statement about their precise status and also
adverse comment in the House about the pains evidently taken
to inform journalists in advance of Members themselves.
Whatever is decided we should, I suggest, lay the report
before Parliament slightly before CFRs are given to the press

                                                                          /We have also

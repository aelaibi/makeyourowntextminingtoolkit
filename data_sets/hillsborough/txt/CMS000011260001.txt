                    SPORTING EVENTS (CONTROL OF ALCOHOL ETC)



              Lord Dormar.a's Bill is down for Second Reading on Tuesday, 10 March and I
      am writing to seek your concurrence, and th at o f colleagu es, to its receiving the
      Government's support.

                Under the Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol Etc) A c t 1S85, football clubs
      wishing to sell alcohol m ust obtain an order from a m agistrates' court. The maximum
      period for which such an order may be granted is fiv e months. The Bill seeks to extend
      this period to 12 months.

              The Football L eague and others have been lobbying hard for such an
     amendment and I understand th at the Bill has the support o f th e Minister for Sport. I
     too am anxious not to p lace an unnecessary burden upon foo tb all clubs, and indeed on
     the magistrates' courts. The p olice tell us th at there have been few d iffic u lties in
     respect of the renewal o f t h e s e orders. It th erefo re seem s reasonable for the interval
     to be extended.

               I realise that the Bill is unlikely to p roceed very far because of pressure on
     Parliamentary time. N everth eless I believe th a t th e G overnm ent should support these
     practical measures if there is a division on Second Reading.

LORO DORMAND OF EASINGTON'S PRIVATE PEERS BILL ON SPORTING
EVENTS (CONTROL OP ALCOHOL ETC)


Mr Wilson's note of 27 May requested advice on the
Government's approach to this Bill.    This is the second time
that Lord Dormand has introduced his Bill.    The previous Bill
was supported by the Government but failed to progress past
Second Reading because of the dissolution for the election.


Background


2.    If football clubs (or other organisations managing
designated sports grounds) wish to sell alcohol on their
premises, they require an order under the Sporting Events
(Control of Alcohol etc) Act 1985.    By virtue of section 4(1)
(b) of the 1985 Act, the maximum period for which an order may
be issued is five months.


3.   There has been increasing pressure recently for this
interval to be extended.    The Football League have been co­
ordinating the lobbying.    The argument put forward is that the
current time interval places an unnecessarily high
administrative burden on the football clubs, and for that
matter, the magistrates' courts which are required to hear the
applications.
Recommendation


4.   The amendment contained in the Bill would not relax any
of the controls on the sale of alcohol, simply reduce the
administrative burden on the football clubs and the courts.
We therefore recommend that, once again, the Bill receives
Government support.


5.   If Ministers agree, the Home Secretary may wish to write
to the Lord President as in the attached draft.

LORD DORMAND OF EASINGTON'S PRIVATE PEERS BILL ON SPORTING
EVENTS (CONTROL OF ALCOHOL ETC)


Mr Wilson's note of 27 May requested a short speech and
background material for the Second Reading of this Bill.       I
understand that Lord Astor will speak for the Government.


2.   This is the second time that Lord Dormand has introduced
his Bill.     Lord Astor also spoke for the Government during the
Second Reading of the previous Bill (a copy of the Hansard
extract is attached).    Despite Government support, Lord
Dormand's Bill failed to progress past Second Reading because
of the dissolution before the election.


3.   As this is territory revisited, we have kept the speaking
note and briefing very short.     I shall be absent from the
office Monday but Miss Vivien Pugh (273-2698) will be
available to brief Lord Astor at 0930 and to attend the debate
that afternoon.




                             KEIR HOPLEY




                           KEIR HOPLEY
SPEAKING NOTE


My Lords, those of you with keen memories may recall that I
spoke on the previous occasion that the noble lord, Lord
Dormand introduced his Bill to amend the Sporting Events
(Control of Alcohol Etc) Act 1985.    On that occasion I
welcomed the opportunity the Bill presented to extend the
maximum period for which an exemption order may be issued to
sell alcohol at designated grounds.


As I explained then, this Bill, if enacted, would not relax
any of the controls on the sale of alcohol.    The police would
retain their powers to step in and close bars if they foresaw
a problem.   The amendment would simply reduce the
administrative burden on ground authorities and the courts.


My Lords, it was unfortunate that events in another place
prevented the progress of the noble lord, Lord Dormand's
previous Bill.   I congratulate him on his resolve in bringing
forward, once again, this practical and timely amendment.     The
Government welcomes this sensible measure; I hope the House
will do likewise.
BACKGROUND NOTE


The Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol Etc) Act 1985 is the
major instrument for controlling the sale and consumption of
alcohol at designated football matches.     Broadly speaking,
all Football League matches, Cup Competitions and
International matches are designated for the purposes of the
1985 Act.    The designation will be amended to cover "Premier
League" matches when the new competition is formed.



The Act's major provisions make it an offence to be drunk in
or whilst entering or trying to enter a designated ground;
prohibit the taking of alcohol into the ground; and prohibit
the carrying of alcohol on certain vehicles and trains going
to a football match.


Under section 3 of the 1985 Act, the sale or supply of alcohol
at licensed premises inside grounds is prohibited unless the
licensee or club secretary has obtained an exemption order
from a magistrates' court.     Section 4 of the Act provides that
the maximum duration of such an exemption order should be 5
months.     Lord Dormand's Bill seeks to extend this period to 12
months.


During the committee stages of the Sporting Events (Control of
Alcohol Etc) Bill, concern was expressed by members of the
Opposition in the House of Common that the period before
renewal of the order should be kept as short as possible.       The
Government was anxious not to impose an unnecessary burden on
the courts by requiring over frequent renewal and a compromise
period of 5 months was agreed.


The clubs are undoubtedly inconvenienced in having to return
to the courts every 5 months to seek renewal of their
exemption orders.     The police tell us that these renewals are
readily granted which suggests that there would not be any
difficulty if the interval were extended to 12 months.
The amendment does not relax any of the controls on the sale
and possession of alcohol.   The court powers to revoke the
exemption order at any stage and the police powers to close
bars if they believe that the sale of alcohol there is
detrimental to the orderly conduct and safety of spectators
would remain unaltered.

              Lord Dormand’s Bill is down for Second Reading on 8 June and I am writing to
      seek your agreement, and that o f colleagues, to its receiving the Government’s support.

             This is the second occasion that Lord Dormand has introduced his Bill. Despite
     Government support for the Bill on its first introduction it failed to progress past Second
     Reading because o f lack o f Parliamentary time before the dissolution.

              Kenneth Baker wrote to John MacGregor on 6 March explaining the background to
     this matter (a copy o f his letter is attached). I support his view that these practical measures
     warrant Government support if there should be a division on Second Reading.

             I am copying this letter to members o f LG Committee, the Secretary o f State for
     National Heritage, First Parliamentary Counsel, to Sir Robin Butler and to the Secretaries
     to LG.

           LORD DORMAND OF EASINGTON'S PRIVATE PEER ’S BILL ON
               SPORTING EVENTS (CONTROL OF ALCOHOL ETC)



        Lord Dormand’s Bill is down for Second Reading on Tuesday, 10 March and I
am writing to seek your concurrence, and th at o f colleagu es, to its receivin g the
Government’s support.

          Under the Sporting Events (Control o f Alcohol Etc) A c t 1985, football clubs
wishing to sell alcohol must obtain an order from a m a g is tr a te s ’ court. The maximum
period for which such an order may be granted is five months. The Bill seeks to extend
this period to 12 months.

         The Football League and others have been lobbying hard for such an
amendment and I understand th a t the Bill has th e support o f th e Minister for Sport. I
too am anxious not to p lace an unnecessary burden upon footb all clubs, and indeed on
the m agistrates1 courts. The p o lice tell us th at there have been few d iffic u lties in
respect of the renewal of th ese orders. It th erefo r e seem s reasonable for th e interval
to be extended.

         I realise that th e Bill is unlikely to p roceed very far b ecause of pressure on
Parliamentary tim e. N everth eless I b elieve th a t th e Governm ent should support these
practical measures if there is a division on Second Reading.

         I am copying this le tte r to members o f LG C om m ittee, the Secretary o f S tate
for Education and Science, the Minister for Sport, First Parliamentary Counsel, to Sir
Robin Butler and the S ecretaries to LG.

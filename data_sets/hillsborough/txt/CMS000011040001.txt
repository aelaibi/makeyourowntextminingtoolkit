set out in safety certificates made under statutory powers are complied
with, but it is for the ground management to adopt as appropriate the
guidance contained in the Green Guide and the safety recommendations
made by Lord Justice Taylor. For the purposes of this circular: "ground
management" means those who stage the event and/or administer the
ground; "certifying authority" means the Regional Council responsible
for the issue of a safety certificate under the Safety of Sports Grounds
Act 1975.

4.    The Secretary of State considers it to be essential that all ground
managements should carry out their responsibilities for the safety of
spectators in terms of the Green Guide and the advice below.             In
particular, all ground managements should appoint Safety Officers in
terms of Chapter 2 of the Green Guide to take responsibility for all safety
matters.

ALL-SEATED A C C O M M O D A T I O N

5.   In April 1990, Mr Michael Forsyth, Minister of State with
responsibility for sport in Scotland, had meetings with the Scottish
Football Association, the Scottish Football League and the Scottish Rugby
Union on the implementation in Scotland of Lord Justice Taylor's
recommendations, particularly those relating to all-seated accommodation.
These meetings took place on the basis that the Secretary of State has no
statutory powers to enforce any recommendation, eg on all-seated
accommodation work (but see paragraph 8); and that there was a general
determination that Lord Justice Taylor's recommendations should be
implemented as soon as was practically possible in the interests of public
safety. Paragraphs 7-14 below provide a framework for implementation of
all-seated accommodation at football grounds.        Paragraph 15 covers
all-seated accommodation at Murrayfield.

DEFINITION O F ALL-SEATED A C C O M M O D A T I O N

6.   It is important to stress that Lord Justice Taylor's recommendations
on all-seated accommodation do not require that all existing standing areas
should be converted to seating. They mean that from specific dates
designated grounds should provide only seated accommodation for
spectators. It is equally important to note that seated accommodation at
designated grounds should be covered and that individual seats, rather
than benches, should be provided.

TIMETABLE F O R F O O TB A LL G R O U N D S

7.   As detailed in the Department’s letter of 12 April 1990, Mr Forsyth
has agreed that:

      7.1 Premier Division grounds and the national football stadium
      should be all-seated by August 1994, so far as is practicable;

      7.2 designated grounds in the First and Second Divisions should be
      all-seated by August 1999, so far as is practicable;

      7.3 any ground management unable to comply with those timetables
      may in exceptional circumstances take longer to complete necessary
      works but of course those parts of the ground in use must satisfy
      the safety guidelines set out by the then current Green Guide.

29 J a n u a r y 1990
Initial response by the Government to recommendations contained
in the Taylor report. (As presented to Parliament on 29 January 1990.)


ALL SEATED ACCOMMODATION (Recommendation 1-4)

1.   General recommendation in respect of all sports grounds
     designated under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.

2.   To apply to all UEFA "high risk" matches from Autumn 1993.

3.   To apply by 20% stages between now and Autumn 1994 to
          Football league, Divisions 1 and 2
          Scottish football league. Premier Division
          National stadia.

4.   To apply by 10% stages between now and Autumn 1999 to all
     other matches played at designated grounds.

The Government accepts this recommendation in principle and
expects to apply it in the case of UEFA high risk matches, the
4 Divisions of the football league, and the national stadia as
recommended.


The application of the recommendation to Scotland and to other
sports cannot be achieved under the Football Spectators Act 1989
but the Government will in any case wish to discuss it with the
sporting authorities concerned. Designated sports grounds under
the 1975 Act include cricket, rugby union and rugby league
grounds which are not all enclosed grounds and which it may not
be practicable to deal with in this way.



ADVISORY DESIGN COUNCIL (Recommendation S)

The Government supports Lord Justice Taylor's recommendation
that the football league and Football Association should
establish an Advisory Design Council on stadium design.




NATIONAL INSPECTORATE AND REVIEW BODY (Recommendation 6)

     (a)   The Football Licensing Authority should be created to
           review the discharge of functions by local authorities.

     (b)   The powers of the Authority should be extended to other
           sports and other sports venues.

The   Government   supports  the   recommendation   that   safety
certification of designated grounds should be centrally reviewed
and proposes to bring into force relevant provisions of Part I
of the Football Spectators Act to create and empower the Football
17.   Emergency gates in perimeter fences.

18.   Marking of emergency gates (interim recommendation 7).

19.   Gates normally to be kept open during matches            (interim
      recommendation 8, revised).

20.   Manning    of    emergency      gates      (replaces     interim
      recommendation 9).

21.   cutting equipment (interim recommendation 10).

The Government supports the recommendations on perimeter fencing.
Local authorities will be urged to amend safety certificates to
include requirements so as to implement recommendations 14, 15,
17   and  to note    recommendation   19 which varies     interim
recommendation 8.   The revised recommendations on closure and
manning of gates in perimeter fences at football grounds will be
drawn to the attention of local authorities, clubs and police.

CRUSH BARRIERS (Recommendations 22/ 23)

22.   Inspection (interim recommendation 11).

23.   Review of layout (interim recommendation 12).

These are repeated from the Interim Report.        They have already
been commended to local authorities.

SAFETY CERTIFICATES (Recommendations 24-31)

24.   Mandatory conditions in safety certificates.

25.   Variation from terms of safety certificates.

26.   Terms of safety certificates.

27.   Review of safety certificates (interim recommendation 13).

28.Issue of certificates     to    grounds    without   them   (interim
recommendation 14).

29.   Annual   review  of   certificates;  annual         renewal    of
      certificates (interim recommendation 15).

30.   Review of arrangements for issuing certificates          (interim
      recommendation 16).

31.   Local authority advisory groups (interim recommendation 17,
      revised).

The Government agrees with the aims of these recommendations.
An order under S.15A of the 1975 Act will be made to implement
recommendation 24. Consideration will also be given to including
within the scope of such an Order provisions which will require
terms and conditions addressing other aspects of safety to be
included in safety certificates.
48.   Review of arrest procedures

49.   Postponement of kick-offs (interim recommendation 29).
50.   Early kick-offs and Sunday fixtures.
51.   control room facilities.

52.   Training of senior officers.

53.   charges for police services.

These recommendations, some of which are repeated from the
Interim Report are directed primarily to Chief Police Officers
and police authorities. The Government supports the proposal for
senior   officer   training  and   the   objective    to  improve
effectiveness of policing at football matches.     The Government
agrees that the cost of policing inside grounds should be met in
full by clubs and will consider providing guidance to police
authorities after consultation with relevant representative
associations, to ensure consistency of practice.

COMMUNICATIONS (Recommendations 54-58)

54.   Radio communications (interim recommendation 31/ amended).

55.   Provision of a command channel.

56.   Land lines (interim recommendation 32).

57.   Public address (interim recommendation 33).

58.   Illuminated advertising (interim recommendation 34:   advice
       on hand signals withdrawn).

These are largely repeated from the Interim Report which the
Government has already urged clubs, local authorities and police
to implement. Chief Officers will also be encouraged to use an
additional, discrete channel of communications for police match
commanders.

CO-ORDINATION OF EMERGENCY SERVICES (Recommendations 59-63)
                                             *


59.   Co-ordination (interim recommendation 35).

60.   Pre match briefing (interim recommendation 36).

61.   Communication with emergency services.

62.   Arrival of emergency vehicles (interim recommendation 37).

63.   Briefing of police officers (interim recommendation 38).

These recommendations are intended to ensure full co-ordination
and co-operation of the emergency services and are substantially
those covered in the Interim Report which the Government has
already endorsed. The Government will urge all those concerned

INCIDENT AT HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL GROUND, SHEFFIELD, SATURDAY 15 APRIL 1989




I/C OF SERIAL 21

A reserve serial comprising the following officers



Police Sergeant 2607 Eddison, Police Constables 1141 Smith, 2130 Frost, 1729

Hampshire,      2304 Crookes, 2577 Trewick, 2507 Wilks, 2496 West, 2372 Justice,

Reported for duty at       ’E ’ Divisional headquarters, Heeley to conduct detailed

briefing of Serial 21 and for transport to the Hillsborough ground.



9.45 am - 15.4.89



Arrived at Hillsborough,       where my serial occupied seats in the North Stand

for the main briefing.

10.00 am - 10.20 am



General briefing by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield, Superintendent Murrray.



10.30 am - 11.00 am



Packed meal consumed in C & V Crew Bus at rear of North Stand.



11.00 am



As per the Operational Order, I deployed my serial to a position adjacent to

the Police Ground Control Box, between the South and West Stands.                               At this

point the ground was empty and all appeared to be in order.                          Radio tests were

in progress.



11.25 am



I noticed approximately 12-15 people on the Spion Kop, indicating that the

turnstiles      may   be    open.     The    remainder       of   the    ground    appeared    empty   of

supporters.      At this time my serial was deployed via Ground Control to assist

in policing the turnstiles at Penistone Road North.                        This was in response to

a   request     by    Inspector      Booth    who     had    insufficient         officers    to   cover

turnstiles      'L*, 'M', and 'N'. (Turnstiles 'O' were not in use, as these only

gave   access    to   the    North   Stand    and     this    area      being   allocated     solely   to

Liverpool supporters,         it was contrary to the principles of crowd segregation

to have them queueing alongside Nottingham fans who were seeking entry onto

the Spion Kop).
                                                        -3-


During the period of policing these turnstiles, many a Liverpool supporter

came   to    the   Penistone Road              North   End    and    when faced with the closure of

turnstiles        'O', made enquiries regarding access to the North Stand.                              These

supporters        came    in     very   small     groups,      but     at    regular   intervals.      In my

opinion they had travelled by car.



Many supporters were in possession of cans which contained intoxicants.                                  They

comprised        mainly    of     Nottingham       supporters        (mostly male,      but    females were

included) and in the 18 to 30 age group.                            I was suprised to find that seme

were   not       aware     of    the    Control        of    Alcohol    at    Designated      Sports   Ground

Legislation.             Numerous       cans    containing       intoxicants,      were    discarded     into

plastic bin liners kept by Police Officers at the turnstiles.



Other items confiscated or discarded, included a bulb horn and flag poles.



At 2.45 pm that afternoon, I arrested a 48 year old, Nottingham supporter for

the offence of 'attempting to enter a designated sports ground whilst drunk'.

He   was    in    a very        drunken        state and     required       the physical support       of his

friends.      He was attempting to enter the Spion Kop via turnstile 'N'.



I escorted this man to the                 police room and noticed him holding                   out histicket

to public view; before any                 action could be taken someone came                    from behind and

exchanged his ticket for a £10.00 note.



At 2.50 pm we arrived at the Police                          room and myself and my prisoner were

photographed.        He was then placed in the holding room pending documentation.



At approximately 2.55 m he was subjected to documentation and then returned
to the holding room.



At approximately 3.00 pm I entered the gymnasium at Hillsborough to commence

the necessary paperwork relating to the arrest.                  I was aware that two other

persons had          been arrested   by members of my Serial         for similar offences at

that location.



At approximately          3-05 pm Chief    Inspector Sumner entered              the gymnasium and

informed me that there was some trouble at the Lepping Lane end of the ground

and     that   he      re-deployed   the   rest of my     Serial     to    that    area.    He   also

requested other officers in the gym to go to the Leppings Lane end.



I immediately entered the perimeter track via the entrance between the Spion

Kop and North Stand and made my way along the perimeter track (in front of

the   North     Stand)     towards   the   Leppings    Lane   end.    The        game was   still   in

progress       and     I recall   the   crowdroaring    in    response      to    a near    miss    by

Liverpool at Spion Kop goal.            I seem to recall Liverpoool winning a corner as

a result,      but I cannot be certain.         As I neared the halfway line I saw some

supporters on          the playing area in the penalty box at the LeppingsLane goal.

Some supporters were climbing over the perimeter security fence at this point

and may others were congregating on the track.                   At this moment the players

had started to leave the field.             The radio messages were totally incoherent.

In the absence of any other information, I believed that a pitch invasion was

about to occur, but I had no idea for what reason.                        The crowd in the other

parts    of the ground were very orderly and the only trouble appeared to be

behind the Leppings Lane goal.



On reaching the Leppings Lane end and standing on the track in front of the
                                                      _5 _
                                                                                                         <a

North Stand, I still could not                 see the cause of the trouble.The only police

action which seemed obvious to                 me was to form an open cordon across the touch

line    from    the     North    West    corner     flag     towards     the goal mouth.     I ordered

officers to form this cordon to which they complied.



As I neared       the goal mouth I             saw that the emergency gate             in the perimeter

fencing    was        open    and   Police     officers were       attempting     to     pull Liverpool

supporters through and onto the track.                       (This gate was the one immediately to

the left of the goal, as viewed when facing the West Stand).



Some supporters were lying on the grass just off the playing area, some were

in tears, some were vomitting, whilst others just appeared shocked and dazed.

Shouts    and    screams        could    be heard from         the supporters     in the Central pen

area.



I approached the perimeter fencing near to this emergency gate and on looking

into the crowd I saw a pile of people at the front of the crowd.                                 They were

lying     on    the    terracing        near   to   the      perimeter    wall   and   several    of   them

appeared to be dead.                Bodies were lying at all angles, some were completely

buried by other bodies on the top of them.                        Most of those visible were blue

in the face and lips, eyes fixed and staring, their hands and arms were ivory

colour.        Traces of vomit were visible around their noses and mouths.                             They

appeared inconsistent with life.



The    crowd    behind were         hysterical,      those     in direct contact with the bodies

were still under             crowd pressure from behind.               The only means of relieving

pressure was by assisting persons to scale the fence or to squeeze through

the gate; both these means being hampered by the presence of dead bodies.
                                              -6-




At this point I took possession of a loud hailer (I don't know who from) and

shouted instructions         into the crowd for calm.        I also pleaded for those at

the back to stop pushing.            I was aware that other officers were attempting to

remove part of the perimeter fence behind the goal.



After   a short while        the pressure had eased        in the   crowd    enabling several

police officers to enter the terracing to untangle the bodies.                   I instructed

numerous officers to enter this area and be observant for any persons in the

pile who may still be alive and to give them priority.



I was joined by Chief Superintendent Nesbit and Superintendent Greenwood (to

whom I handed the loud hailer).              I then assisted at the emergency gate by

causing the other officers present to form a tunnel thereby endeavouring to

keep    the   exit   clear   of   persons   and   to   facilitate   the   passage   of bodies

through the gate.        A human chain had developed whereby bodies were handled

onto the playing area.



St Johns Ambulance       officers were       attempting to revive the bodies,         as were

many other persons       including fans       and Police Officers.          Many were clearly

dead and needed to be moved from view.                 I asked some supporters to collect

advertising boards      for    use    as stretchers.      The radio was faint amidst the

noise in      the ground.      I could only presume the gymnasium to be used as a

temporary mortuary, so I therefore instructed supporters and Police Officers

to form stretcher teams and take bodies in that direction.



I was aware that an Ambulance had stopped behind the Leppings Lane goal and

that dead     and injured     persons were     lying in     that area.      I instructed one
willing    supporter     to    unhook     the   goal   net,     as    it    was    obstructing   rescue

operations.



I'Sdid1not£ heai* messages passed by radio or via the PA System and the crowd on

the Spion Kop could not as a whole, have been fully aware of the situation at

the opposite end of the ground.                 Those being stretchered out who were dead

were covered by coats and carried on advert boards which for ease of carry

were held by up to some 12 to 14 people.



It was    not    unreasonable       for   the Nottingham supporters               to be unaware that

people were dead.        The long wait caused some of the Nottingham supporters on

the Spion Kop to jeer and chant.                Liverpool supporters on the pitch, some of

whom were in grief at the loss of friends and relations, reacted angrily to

this and some ran towards the Spion Lop with arms raised and fists clenched.

Some    seeing    others      running,     simply      joined    in        the    advance,   which   was

immedately dispersed          by Police Officers.          As a result a cordon was formed

across the centre line of the pitch.



The dead and injured were slowly being cleared from the pitch but the terrace

was now clear, save for those uninjured.                 Shoes, coats, keys and money lying

on the terrace was guarded by other Liverpool fans, most of whom were still

hysterical.       From   the outset of the rescue operation,                      these fans had been

blaming police for the disaster and comments such as "MURDERING BASTARDS" and

’’WHY DID YOU OPEN THOSE BLOODY GATES” and ’’I T ’S YOUR FAULT" could be heard.



Emotions were extremely high and in the eyes of some supporters, the police

were clearly to blame.          One supporter was so angered by the police that with

tears    streaming   down     his   face   he    took hold      of my       shoulders    in a violent
                                                  -8-


manner and called me the chief of killers.                    His colleague restrained him.            I

did not witness any other attack on police.                         Many fans vented anger at the

press who they said had done nothing to ’help’ but had just taken photographs

of the dying.       Any person in possession of a camera was an immediate target.



Several members of the Hillsborough catering staff had come onto the field

and were distributing cups of water to rescuers and supporters.                             They were

greeted with abuse by some fans who made reference to the fact that water

would not restore life in their friends.



There    was     outrage    and   a   scuffle    on     the   Leppings    Lane    terrace, when      one

Liverpool fan tried to collect money from the property behind the injured or

dead.



At     various    points    during     the    rescue,    I    had    attempted    to   contact    ground

control via radio, but the radio traffic was such that I was unsuccessful in

making    contact.         In   the   early   stages     I had      attempted    to contact      control

asking for the evacuation procedure to be adopted at the rear of the central

pen.     I was unable to hear any response to my call.



Eventually the announcement was given that the match was to be abandoned and

the crowd was asked to remain in situ for a few minutes.                         The crowd, however,

began to leave.        I took my Serial to the Leppings Lane gates on the outside

of the ground until the terraces inside were empty.                       I then ordered my serial

to perform mobile          patrol on the routes leading from the ground and joined

them in this duty.          Radio contact had been re-established.



At approximately 6 .30 pm we were directed to the Northern General Hospital
where a disturbance was       in progress involving Liverpool supporters.         On my

arrival I ascertained       from some of the fans that the press had been intruding

upon those in grief.        The press had been asked to remain in        a holding area

and were under the directions of the Health Authority, Press Officer.              Some

had become     over   enthusiastic    and had taken matters into their own hands.

All parties including       the Press Officer were advised.



At   7*15   pns my Serial   gave   assistance   to   'Dl' Sub-Division   but no serious

incidents occurred.



At 8.30 pm Serial 21 went off duty, being no longer required by Force Control

and Ground Operation;

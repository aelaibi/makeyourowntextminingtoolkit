     Chief Constable

     Snig Hill

     Thank you for your letter of 4 August.    I have now received a
     copy of Lord Justice Taylor's Report and Geoffrey Dear and
     Mervyn Jones have attended at this office to give broad details
     of the scope and extent of their enquiries to date.

     Having regard to the findings of the inquiry it is, in my view,
     appropriate that the matter should now be the subject of a full
     criminal investigation.   I understand that you have written to
     Geoffrey Dear raising the possibility of him continuing with
     enquiries and I also understand that he is happy formally to
     continue to investigate in accordance with the provisions of
     Part ix of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984.      This
     investigation will not, of course, be limited to the possible
     culpability of police officers alone.

     I am sending a copy of this letter        eoffrey Dear.




                                                            DPP

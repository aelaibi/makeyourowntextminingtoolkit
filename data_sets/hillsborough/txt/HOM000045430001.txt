MEMORANDUM

Date:    9 December 1997

To:     Lord Justice Stuart-Smith



I attach -

                the letter to Mr Hicks, for you to sign;

                my note of your discussion with Mr King yesterday, for your approval - 1 must
                then send it (also attached) to Mr King for him to approve too. You are to
                write to Mr Hytner;

                letters, which both arrived today, from the St John Ambulance Service. These
                tell us that the argument that they could have saved Kevin Williams is bogus,
                as suspected. I doubt whether we are going to get any more from them.

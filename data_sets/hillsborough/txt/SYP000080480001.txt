                 Being a supporter            of L i verpool          Football         Club,   and also an e x p e r i e n c e d

                 I had gone       to S h e f f i e l d    for,       like many others,          was   to watch two fine

                 teams    play football.



                Below     is an account          of events as            I saw them from the time                 I left home,

                 to the arrival         of the        e m e r g e n c y services        to tend the      injured,      and

                 remove    the dead.

I left Birkenhead,              Merseyside,           w ith two friends           to drive to Sheffield.

We tr a v e l l e d via the M53 -- M56 and H&2,                     following          the signs        marked

’Football       Traffic'.           Fol l o w i n g    the d e s i g n a t e d   route which took me

t h r o u g h busy shopping areas              outside Manchester,                 through numerous             road

works and e v e n t u a l l y      into the D e r b y s h i r e Peak District.                    At     one time

the   traffic      jam was        so bad      it took me 45 mins.                to travel        3 miles.



On the outskirts            of S h e f f i e l d    I /W itnessed       coaches and vans               being

pulled     into    the     roadside        by Police Officers,               who,       I presume,       were

looking      for alcohol.             As    I proceeded further along                     the    road    I again

w i t n e s s e d Police O f f i c e r s    standing at the             kerbside         every few yards

stopping      private       vehicles.              It was at this          time        I myself    was    stopped,

a s k e d my destination,           and was         told to proceed down the                    road until       1

reached yet anot h e r            group of Police Officers,                      who would direct me             to a

parking area.              This are a was a road,                very,     very steep           in a

residential        area off        the a rea the          locals      call       the    ’.F lounch" .



O n a r r i v i n g at    the   ground at 2. 1 5 p m          (1415)      it was very evident              the

organisation         of the       previous year was              sadly     lacking.             People were

milling around            the gates        trying      to get      into    the ground,           their    progress

thro u g h the t u rnstiles           b e i n g hampered         by Police Officers               searching

handbags      outside       the    turnstile and,             handbags and male              suppo r t e r s    being

searched      just       inside the turnstiles.                   Once     in the ground we              proceeded

to our seats         to witn e s s      the    dreadful        events      of that fateful              afternoon

unf old.



At first,       like many         people a r o u n d me,         I did not         realise the          enormity

of the situation.                 I just      thought       the occurr e n c e s         below me were          due

to over      crowding       on a normal            scale,    and w o u l d soon be sorted                out.         I
                                                                                                        PAG E            C
                                                                                                        SS474

w a t c h e d Police O f f icers            shouting at the fans            to move     back,     peopie who

had m a n a g e d to      climb over          grab b e d by the Police as             if being a r r e s t e d .

On    realising what was             happening         I found myself          shouting,       like many

people a r o u n d me,         in a futile attempt at making                    ourselves       heard,        to

the Referee,          the shouts            being to       'stop the match'.



I stood       routed to the           spot        unable to    c o mprehend fully what was               going

on ar o u n d me,       people      by this         time were     standing      on their       seats     in

front     of me obl i t e r a t i n g my view,              voices were       being    raised     in distress

and anger.            I m oved to the gangway,                 and at this       point saw a man

running with a child                in his a r m s, who was            either uncons c i o u s       or dead.

A    Female Police Officer was                     dragging a male St Johns Amb u l a n c e man

over    to anot h e r      person         lying     on the ground,         Police were standing

around,       some helping,           some        standing    on the       base of the      railings

pleading wit h          people      to move         back,    other Police       doing     nothing.



Realising        that as much help as                 possible was          going to be needed           I

s tar t e d to make my way down                    the gangway,      only to find my way

obstructed         by other       fans,       d i s t r e s s e d at the    scenes    they were

witnessing,         others       pulling          people    up from the       standing area.



On    reaching the         landing          the    caf ete r ia is based on,          I e n c o u n t e r e d a man

lying     on the floor w i t h a Police Officer                      in attendance.             Having

introduced myself as a nurse                        I checked the man,          he was      e x h a u s t e d but

alive and a doctor              had seen him,              the doctor       being a Liverpool           fan.

The P o 1 i ceman       promised to stay with him so                       I proceeded,      found a

s t e w a r d , a g a i n exp l a i n e d    I was a nurse and offered assistance.                            He

did not seem to know what                     to say or do at          first,    but su g g e s t e d    I go

down and       find a Police Officer.                       I went   down another         flight      of stairs

and    e n c o u n t e r e d anot h e r     group of       perhaps   three     of four      supporters,            hot

                                                                                                   SHV74

and    exhausted but mobile.                  I event u a l l y arri v e d at ground         level and

stood    in horror at the scene                 before my eyes.            Bodies    lying all       over

the    place with       coats     over    their       faces,    men   lying   on the floor      being

a t t e n d e d by fellow supporters,             and male and          female Police Officers.



I a p p r o a c h e d yet another        Police Officer          e x plained my     profession a n d

a s k e d who was      in charge.             I never    received a reply to this             question,

as    I was    obv i o u s l y ove r h e a r d by another Police Officer              tending      to a

man,    who was s t r u g g l i n g    to breathe        lying    on the floor       behind me,       he

was    shouting at me        to    come and help.               As he was     shouting   at me to

help,    the female Police Officer with him shouted that she was a nurse

as well,       and that     the man was alright,                injured but alright.



At    this    time   I m o v e d a way telling myself             that    there was    nothing       I

could do to help these men                    lying    vey still      with navy blue      extrem i t i e s

so    I took another        look at my surroundings.                     By this    time more      injured

but    living men had been brought                    out,    and had been      placed on the        floor

in sitting       positions a r o u n d         the wall.'



I checked all          of them,       some had        possible    rib    injuries,    some    very

s h o c k e d and exhausted,          some     just    vey hot and exhausted.             By this        time

another       Liverpool     fan had a p p e a r e d w ith buckets             of drinking water,           and

plastic       d isposable    cups,       he    couldn't       give any    professional       help so was

making       himself    useful     in any way he             could.      He went a r o u n d the

i njured with water,            and man y words          of    comfort.       Another Liverpool

supporter       ran up to me saying              he was a qua l i f i e d      'First Aider',        what

could he do?            I d i r e c t e d him to the e x h a u s t e d fans and he stayed with

them until       they were        removed to Hospital.



I carried on,          checked a g a i n on a young man               called^_____ who was         lying
                                                                                                    PAGE         !
                                                                                                    S2474

on the     floor     exhausted,        and shocked,         and enco u r a g e d the fan who was a

stranger      to him,     but st a y e d with him,           e ncouraging        him to breathe          and

reassuring        him until      he was       e v e n t u a l l y wal k e d to an ambulance.



Wh i l s t all    this was     going        on it was    becoming        more and more a p p a r e n t

that    firstly nobody among                the Police      or Stewa r d s      had taken    charge       of .

the    s i t u a t i o n , s e c o n d l y the eme r g e n c y services    had not a r r i v e d .



I continued going a r o u n d the              injured s upporting           injured      limbs   using

theirs,      and mine,       football        scarves.        At some      point a Police Officer

came up to me and s u g g e s t e d that all                people    should be moved to an area

outside      large    blue    roll     back g a t e s , so that       the ambulances         could       get

to them,      it was at this           time    I realised help had               finally arrived.               I

managed      to get     one you n g s t e r    to his    feet,     and assisted          him outside       the

gates,     the    dead had a l r e a d y been moved           to this area by the Police,

having     been directed         to do so by a man             I. took    to be a Doctor,         who     had

arrived      from one of the           local Hospitals.              He was telling         the Police

that    he wa n t e d the     injured to be          placed     in categories,           the badly

injured to go         in the     first ambul a n c e s and not            the    ones with minor

injuries,        w hich at first        seemed to be the           case.         I was    later    to

discover,        the following         morning,      that    the Doctor         concerned was a

f e l l o w fan who     had a r r i v e d    on the scene a        lot earlier       than    I,    had

su m m e d up the total         lack of       leadership and had taken over h i m s e l f .

Again,     I was a p p r o a c h e d   by a lady      in a red trouser            suit,    she    produced

a card from her          pocket,       she was a _qualified           ’First A i d e r * — a local

lady who      had seen the scenes              on TV and had a r r i v e d to h e l p .



I carried on,         made    some     three    or four a t t e m p t s    to get help to a man

propped against          the wall       just    outside      the   large entrance          to the

standing area,         who    had an obvious          painful      neck    injury.         I eventually
                                                                                                              PAGE        6
                                                                                                              S2474

e n l i s t e d the help of a tall Policewoman,                        showed her were            the man was.

She went away and very soon came                         back w ith blankets and more

supporters,           and wit h all          this    combined help we m a n a g e d to get                this man

onto     the    blankets,         an d onto a stretcher.                  An ambulance a p p e a r e d with

the    latter        just at the           right moment.



Having       by this       time    got most         of the     injured outside            the    gates,       badly

i njured to the            right and minor             injuries       in order      of    importance          to the

left.          The    sight      of the      dead    lying a l o n g s i d e    one wall        in this area,

head     to toe,        and the      living      leaning       or    lying against         the opposite

wall,     s e parated        by a human shield of Police                     personnel,         is a sight       I

will     never       forget.         The arrival         of a m b u l a n c e s a nd     crash teams          from

the    local     hospitals was              by this     time    getting        stronger,        the    badly

injured had been              removed.           All    that was       left to do was            continue       to

support injured limbs with scarves, reassure some of the injured ,

y o u n g s t e r s who    gave    their      names as                    15 yrs    of

•age, w o r r i e d how he was              going    to get home,          a young P o l i c e m a n     stayed

wit h him saying             "We will        get you home           sonny,     don't w o r r y ’ .       Another

y oung    lad about          14 yrs,                     think,       a young P o l i c e w o m a n wit h hirn

holding        his    injured foot           reassuring        him all       the time.



The    local     nurses       took     over,     handed out          blankets,      a young A sian            doctor.,

local     I think,         was    by this       time    going a r o u n d the       lads with minor

injuries,        carrying a brief               case and stethoscope.                    I realised       that       by

this     time    there was         little       left for me to do so               I wandered          back    into

the area        behind the s t a n d,           intending       to go back to my friends,                     but was

stopped        by yet anot h e r           distressed      fan,     who    I knew,       uninjured

physically           but m e n t a l l y    very d i s t r e s s e d - he had been to B e l g i u m and

witnessed        the Heysel          Disaster.           He was       e v e n t u a l l y comforted      by myself

and    the     same young P o l i c e w o m a n who          had helped me with the                   spinal
                                                                                                             PAGE
                                                                                                             S2474

injuries man,              and sent    on his way his            purpose     in life at the             time was

to go and           ring his Mum.            On this      departure       the P o l i c e w o m a n    herself

broke        down briefly,          and was     rescued by one of her                colleagues.



To sum up this              lengthy account my overall               opinion was            that      of a

dreadful         sit u a t i o n were the       people who        should have         taken     control        of    it

were     good when they were                event u a l l y   organised,       but    previous         to this

a p p e a r e d to be running ar o u n d           like       'headless    chickens'        and,       if there

was    or     is a D i s aster       Plan at this stadium,            then       I would suggest              the

o f f icials        there    told s o m ebody else what            that Plan         is.



I do not know what              time     I left      the stadium.            I did not arrive                home

until        9 . 3 0 pm.




T H U R S D A Y 4 MAY



I have        tonight       been over       to Anfi e l d Football         Club to purchase my

ticket        for the       replay.           My theory being         that      life has to go on,and

if you fall            off a horse       the    best    thing     to do     is get      back on again!



The    scenes at A n f i e l d        tonight were            remarkable,      hundreds and hundreds

of    people        pouring    into one gate at the A n f i e l d Rd end,                    the      road

outside         jammed w ith        cars.       These     people were the            same    people who

visited Hillsborough,                 they     lined up in m any orderly queues,                       snaking

ar o u n d    the    car    park,    d i r ected   by Stewards,        I saw only two Police

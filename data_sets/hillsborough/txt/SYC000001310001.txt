                 SEVENTY SEVENTH DAY'S PROCEEDINGS

                        MONDAY,      25th MARCH 1991

      THE CORONER:           We are just c a r rying on as if nothing

had happened,       as if we had not had the weekend,                   but I

would remind you that we are deal i n g with 95 inquests,

that your task is to e s t a b l i s h who the d e c eased was,                 when

and where they d ied and h o w they died*                    I am not r e p e a t i n g

e verything I have said on T h u r s d a y but again I have                    to

remind you that que s t i o n s of law are for me,                   questions      of

fact are for you.           When you consider             the evidence you have

to j^oigh the qual i t y of it!           _ is it truthful,          is it

mistaken,     is it u ntruthful,          is it muddled,          and you can

judge this by,        as I e x p l a i n e d to you,       demeanour,

corroboration,        p o s s i b l e bias.   There are lots of other

things w hich might apply but in the end you have to d e c i d e

h o w m u c h you accept and h o w m u c h you             reject.

        I reminded y o u - that the crucial                thing is the e v i d e n c e

of the witnesses and not              the q u estions       from the lawyers,

b ear i n g in mind     that,    of course,       "yes" and "no" answers

you do have to take into account what                      the que s t i o n s were

o t h erwise you ca n n o t u n d e r s t a n d   them.

        An important point          to remember when you are thinking

about    the evidence is to try and think of the e v i dence as

a whole - from the witn e s s            I mean - rather than specifics,

 and the point I am really driv i n g at                   is this, that it is

 quite possible,        and we h ave had lots              of examples,       to ask a
                                                                                2




question in such a way that you get evidence in a

particular form,     and then if you ask the question in a

d ifferent format you get the same response but in a

different way.      This is why it is so important                to try and

sift the wheat from the tares and not allow yourself                         to be

led or misled by simply the question.                 I will give you two

very simple examples.        I don't want to waste           too muc h time

on this but it is important           that we have this clearly in

our heads,   and I will give you two what I consider to be

non controversial examples.            One is Dr.      Nicholson,       and I

cannot recollect where the q uestioning came from at the

moment but he was asked about            the blue gates,        and one form

of question was,     "Would you go along with the Fire Officer

when he says    that it is all right to shut those blue gates

in certain circumstances?",           and his reply was yes,            he

would.     Subsequently he was asked a similar sort of

question but this time put in a slightly d i f f e r e n t format

with regard to what other people had said as to the risk,

and he also went along w i t h that.            I don't c o m plain about

that,    it is just an illustration,           and another one w hich is

perhaps even better,       even less emotive,           is the questions

w hich we have w i t h Dr. Nicholls and h o w to interpret the

total nu m b e r of people who had or did not have alcohol

within them,    and you saw it ver y gr a p h i c a l l y d e m o n s t r a t e d

that if you wanted to put it one way you could say two

thirds of the people had had a drink,                and if you wis h e d to

put it the other way and show that only one third,                      or not
even a third,       sorry,    20 per cent were above      the limit,           and

he agreed w ith both and         there was nothing wrong with that

either.        In fact,   he was right    to agree w ith both,      but

this is the point,         you have got to sort it out when you

think about it.

        The other thing       that you have got to think about is

what is       it that we are trying to do?        I think I have

already       said there are three - I will       remind you - there

are three possible conclu s i o n s w hich you are able to

consider.        The first one is unlaw f u l l y killed.        The second

one is accident/misadventure.             The third one is open.               The

first one,       u nlawfully killed,     you have to be satisfied on

the evidence beyond r easonable doubt or so             that you are

sure.        The second one,    accident/misadventure,      you have           to

be satisfied on the balance of probability.                The     third

one,    an    open verdict,    you are in fact    saying that       the

evidence is i nadequate         to enable you to reach a verdict of

the other two.

        I am not going       to go through all the legal stuff

again in detail       today,    but I will again just remind you of

the cardinal points w h i c h Lord J u s t i c e Watkins made.             I

think they come       to about seven and I will just remind you

of what      those are.      What he said was    that - in his case he

was d e a l i n g with a Police Officer in a p a r t i c u l a r

s ituation but anyb o d y whose conduct you are co n s i d e r i n g -

anybody w hose conduct you are considering,             first of all
                                                                      4




you have got   to decide,   did that person have a duty to

have regard to the hea l t h and welfare of the deceased?

Did he fail to do what in the circumstances he ought to

have done for the he a l t h and welfare of the deceased,        or

did he act in such a way?       Was his   failure a substantial

cause of the d eath of the deceased?       Next four:     was   the

failure to act for the benefit of the health and welfare

of the deceased reckless?       An act of recklessness means

that he did or failed to do something where           there was an

obvious and serious risk to the hea l t h and welfare of the

deceased,   to which that person whose conduct you are

considering,   having regard    to his duty,   was    indifferent or

that recognising the risk to be present he deliberately

chose to run the risk by doing nothing about it.            Next,     it

should be emphasised that a failure to a ppreciate that

there was such a risk would not by itself be sufficient               to

amount to recklessness,     and you have to be satisfied,

before you can bring in such a verdict,        that you can

attribute   these ingredients    to one single person,      i.e.,

you must not add up the activities of dif f e r e n t people.

Finally under no circumstances must you name the person

you are considering in respect of who m you de c i d e this

applies.

     Of course,    in thinking about this you have to take

into account e v erything that applies,      all the

circumstances,    including the time,     including    the location,
including     the event and so- on.       I think that is at this

stage enough reminder but just so that you have it more or

less in your mind.

       Now,   I was just dealing w ith the outside,              if I can

say,   I was just beginning        to work my way into the Ground,

and you will of course be aware that we spent an enormous

amount of time on this at the Inquest,               but I do not think

that it is necessary for me to give you a blo w by blow

account of everything       that was     said or done*          Basically,

in a nutshell,     at some time between 2.17 and 2.30 ~ there

is a bit of a problem wit h the timing because the

recollection of most people is that it was about 2.30,                       or

2.25 but Mr.     Murray's   log,    w h i c h was the h a n d w r i t t e n one,

shows the request as coming through at 2.17 but in a sense

I don't think it matters       too much.         At some time in the

afternoon Mr.     Marshall,   the Superin t e n d e n t outside,         after

consultation w ith Mr.      Sykes,     deci d e d to request       to have

Leppings Lane closed to traffic - not to p e d e s t r i a n s of

course - and the explanation that he gave us was                     that

there were a lot of people          there,    he p e r c e i v e d that there

was some risk of injury beca u s e of traffic and collisions,

and in a d d ition to that it also enabled them to hav e a

space w here people could congr e g a t e p r e s u m a b l y without

danger.

                                            It was a most unus u a l         ....
        It was a m o s t unusual requ e s t to c lose L e p p i n g s L ane at

t hat time.          They d i d c lose it as a m a t t e r of r o u t i n e when

crowds left          b u t the y di d not,        as a m a t t e r of routine,       c lose

it on arrival.           So t hat was unusual.              In fact,      it was one of

t he u n p r e c e d e n t e d ev e n t s w h i c h have b e e n m o o t e d b e f o r e you.

W e spent a lot of tim e d i s c u s s i n g and qu e s t i o n i n g as to

whether this was a w i s e or un w i s e t h i n g to do, w h e t h e r in

fact it inc r e a s e d the flow rate and w h e t h e r it w o u l d have

b een better to have allo w e d the traffic to m o v e a n d to,                         in

effect,     act as a b a r r i e r and,        therefore,        c ause a h i n d r a n c e to

t he p e o p l e w h o w ere coming up a n d down Leppings Lane.

        I think this is one of t h o s e cases w h e r e w e m i g h t sa y in

r e t r o s p e c t it w o u l d h ave b e e n b e t t e r t o hav e h a d a roa d

t raffic incident t here and c o m p l e t e l y jam the r o a d up b u t at

t h e time,     a n d this is w h a t is i m portant for you,                 I t h i n k if

a n y b o d y h a d said,    "It does not m a t t e r if w e h a v e s o m e b o d y or

injured" t h a t would,          in m y v i e w - b u t it is in t h e e n d y o u r

v i e w - at t h e tim e k n o w i n g noth i n g of w h a t was c o m i n g tha t

w o u l d h a v e b e e n an almost i n d e f e n s i b l e p o i n t of view.          In

fact,    a l t h o u g h we hav e spent a g r e a t d eal of t i m e on this,                   my

v i e w is t h a t it is h a r d t o see h o w t h e c l o s u r e of L e p p i n g s

L a n e b y itself can b e causative.

        I find       it d i f f i c u l t to eve n fit it into a b u t for

example.        D o you r e m e m b e r w e t a l k e d a bout this,        t h a t a n d th e

t h i r d thing,    it w o u l d not h a v e h a p p e n e d ?     It depends.          You

c o u l d argue b u t for t h e c l o s u r e of L e p p i n g s L a n e b u t I t h i n k

it is e x c e e d i n g l y d i f f i c u l t an d if y o u ca n n o t e v e n g e t it

i nto a b u t for t h e n y o u h a v e no t eve n b e g u n t o t h i n k a b o u t

the o ther things that L o r d Justice W a t k i n s is t a l k i n g about.

C e r t a i n l y it w o u l d be v i r t u a l l y impossible,         if I am r i g h t on

this,    as a substa n t i a l cause and m u c h less as an obvi o u s and

serious risk of injury b y the clos u r e of L e p p i n g s Lane.

        The next t hing we spent a g reat deal of time on was wha t

was h a p p e n i n g ar o u n d the tu r n s t i l e area.          I was just p o i n t i n g

out to you tha t there were some sim i l a r i t i e s b e t w e e n the

tu r nstile areas and the terracing,                     do yo u rem e m b e r ?        That is

wh e n y o u felt ill and I do not b lame y o u for that.                             You are

a l l o w e d to.    I do not t hink t h e r e is any n e e d to r e p e a t it

apart from saying,             be careful tha t yo u do not tak e a n alogies

too far b e c a u s e a l t h o u g h t h e r e are similarities,                there are

also dissimilarities.                 It m a y just h e l p w h e n yo u t hink about

some of th e events to c o m p a r e the tw o situa t i o n s b u t be

the s t atements f rom the Police O f f i c e r and the b o l t w h i c h h a d

        F orc i n g those gates open does not n e c e s s a r i l y mean

        The m o u n t e d Officers' on the whole gave very c o n ­

sist e n t accounts and in a nutshell w h a t they said is

they were trying to split the crowd,                      either by splitting

them wi t h i n the turnstile area and creating a gap between

the back of the front of the crowd and the front of the

back crowd and the per i m e t e r gates being the divide,                            so

to speak,      and the objective was that the people within

the turnstile area should be able to move back.

        ^11    the evidence that we have is that that did

not in fact happen,            that that gap was taken up by others

who ente r e d and even w h e n the gap w a s in existence the

people at the front were not keen to come back.                               Not

e n t irely s u rprising b e c a u s e the turnstiles w e r e in front

of them and the gap was b e h i n d them,                  b u t nevertheless          it

w o u l d have r e l ieved the p r e s s u r e s i tuation a t the front.

         One O f f i c e r in p a r t i c u l a r I thought gave v e r y

i n t e r e s t i n g e v i d e n c e as to the m e t h o d o l o g y of mo v i n g

the crowd an d t hat was P.C. W a t s o n f rom Nottingham.

W h a t he said he was trying to do an d w h a t in fact the

people were trying to do is to use the horse as a catalyst.

If yo u can ge t some of the p e o p l e to turn r ound an d m ove

bac k then yo u are n o t just u s i n g the p r e s s u r e from one

h orse b u t yo u are als o u s i n g the p o w e r of the pe o p l e

w h o are now g oing in the same d i r e c t i o n as y o u are and

 if yo u are successful yo u then ge t a snowball ef f e c t

 a n d you can conv e r t a forward m o m e n t u m into a b a c k w a r d

 momentum.
                                                                                    12




        A great deal of time was also spent in discussing

w het h e r or not the technique was sensible anyway and

it was put to m an y of these Officers,                 and indeed to

others,    that the place to start is at the back and not at

the front and to peel off,              I suppose w ould be the eas i e s t

way of putting it,          to peel people off back in order to

relieve the pressure.             It is a m a t t e r for you,        and the

Officers to a certain ex t e n t agreed w i t h that.

         I mus t confess that I found the a r g ument d i fficult

to follow because w h i l s t I can see its m e r i t in a static

situation,      if you have a continuously mo v i n g crowd in the

sense that people are joining it from the back,                         then

you either have to w a i t until yo u have the whole crowd

there and then start peeling, w h i c h seems to me to b e not

a ver y good w a y of r e lieving p r e s s u r e a t the front,               or

you ma y s t a r t a t the bac k b u t e v e n t u a l l y finish up in

the middle,      w h i c h is p r e c i s e l y w h e r e these O f f icers in

fact finished up and if you r e m e m b e r they t ried to come

in from the side of the turnstile are a and in the end

they pu t a cordon across,             so y o u ha d a cordon of Police

horses,     p e r i m e t e r gates,   turnstile area,        turnstiles an d

so on.

          T h a t cordon in the end did a c t u a l l y hol d for a

 little while.         It was d i f f i c u l t to u n d e r s t a n d w h y it

broke.      M y i m p r e s s i o n was tha t p e o p l e wer e coming u n d e r ­

 n e a t h it a n d w e r e d u c k i n g u n d e r the horses.     W e h eard

 vari o u s wit n e s s e s inc l u d i n g Mr. B a r t h o l o m e w say that he

 saw that,     b u t in a d d i t i o n to that the c o n c e r t i n a gate
                                                                                   13




had been opened,          people were coming through,             and the need

for the cordon in that sense had d isappeared because

people    left the scene by e n t e r i n g into the ground.

         I think again w i t h hindsight,            and I don t w a n t to

waste m u c h time on it,            if the timing had been a little

bi t d i f ferent we m i g h t not be sitting here today bu t it

is no use thinking a bout w h a t m i g h t have been.

         Now the next thing we will think about is w h a t some

or other of the s upporters have said because at the mom e n t

I have mer e l y talked a b o u t b a s i c a l l y m o u n t e d Officers and

Police.       You remember there w e r e Mers e y s i d e Officers;

there were Notts.            Officers an d there w ere South Yorkshire

Officers.         It was a m i x and I d e l i b e r a t e l y chose witnesses

from all three groups so that we w o u l d have a mix.

         There were q u i t e a lot of w i t n e s s e s w h o did talk

a b o u t w h a t was going on.         Some de s c r i b e d the situation

as "no p u s h i n g a t all",        a t the v e r y m o s t they w o u l d say

 they were b e i n g "pushed" b u t some w o u l d n o t even go us

 far as that.           T h e y m e r e l y sai d it was j ust a bi g crowd

 an d it was si m p l y a comp l e t e l y natural c rowd m o v e m e n t

 that ca u s e d the crushing,          b u t there w e r e some an d I am

 no t g oing to give you all b e c a u s e I nee d to sum an d not

 summarise,       as I told you,         b u t there is one for instance,

 Mr. Barry,       w h o a c t u a l l y recol l e c t s the remark      where

 so m e b o d y said:      "There is o n l y one copper,          let's rush

 the p e r i m e t e r g a t e " .

          There w a s Mr.         Hilton.    He did no t a c t u a l l y r e m e m b e r
                                                                                   14




anything about push i n g b u t he remembers that the gate was

b eing used as a control at some time after 2.40.                           He

said they were        letting people through in batches.

         There was Mr.        Hewstone,      that is the P r o bation Officer

do you remember him, wh o did not like crowds because he

got stuck in one in Wembley.                 He said it was even bigger.

He described not so m u c h the pushing b u t the announcements

w h i c h you heard and the fact it did n o t seem to make

any difference to the situation.

         There was s o m ebody called Mar k Dawson who heard

appeals b u t he nevertheless w e n t forward through the

p e r imeter gates.        He said up to the p e r i m e t e r gate position

he need not have gone forward.                  Once he got through it

was a dif f e r e n t matter,       he felt once he was w i t h i n the

turnstile area things wer e m ore difficult.

         T h a t in fac t was one of the po i n t s that a lot of

people sai d and in fact a lot of the Police Officers

agreed w i t h this,     that the pe o p l e i m m e d i a t e l y a g a i n s t

o u t of the p e r i m e t e r gate,    the horses o r the turnstile

areas c ould n o t hel p themselves.               T h e y had g o t trapped,

so to speak,       and w h e t h e r o r n o t they w o u l d have w i s h e d

to p ush o r n o t to p u s h wa s an a c a d e m i c e x e r c i s e as far

as they w e r e concerned.

         The q u e stion that y o u have to ask y o u r s e l f I think

w i t h regard to this - and as I say I have t ried to

o u t l i n e it b r i e f l y an d w i t h o u t s t r e s s i n g one side too

s t r o n g l y a g a i n s t the o t h e r - b u t one of the q u e stions
                                                                                     15




that you have to ask yourself is this w i t h regard to the

outside of the ground:

         (1)    w h a t e v e r the s i tuation m i g h t have been within

the turnstile area w h a t was the reason for the crushing

at the p e rimeter gates?

        You will remember there were one or two witnesses

who were actually more c o ncerned a bout the people outside

the perimeter gates than they were a bout the people within

the turnstile area,         beca u s e w h i c h e v e r wa y you look at it

al t hough of course you are going to have to describe

the geography,       there is an inward movement,               a funnelling

ef f e c t towards the p e r i m e t e r gate,     nevertheless Leppings

Lane an d that outer are a does in fact provide a considerable

amount of space w h e r e peo p l e could if they had w i s h e d

congregate,      so you have g o t to ask y o u r s e l f the questions

"Was it simply e n t i r e l y m o v e m e n t of the people or was

there some p r e ssure forward?"

        The second q u e s t i o n     you need to ask y o u rself           is:

"Is it right that the p e o p l e could n o t have done anything

a b o u t it?   Wa s the forward m o v e m e n t s uch that they wer e

unable to remedy it themselves?"

        I have alre a d y sai d t h a t n e a r l y e v e r y b o d y ag r e e d

tha t a sect i o n w e r e in that s i t u a t i o n an d indeed a lot

of others said:         "Well I could n o t have done a n y t h i n g

a b o u t it anyway"    even the ones w h o w e r e f u r t h e r back,            but

there is a little b i t of e v i d e n c e w h i c h y o u do have to

take into a c c o u n t in a s s e s s i n g this issue,        three bits
actually.        F irst of all you have got to consider the

geography.        W h a t e v e r m i g h t be said about the vie w of the

terraces through the tunnel,                    the v iew of the turnstile

area from outside L e p pings Lane w h i c h slopes slightly

downward,      I had not noticed that actually until

Mr. McMahon came along and he said:                      "It slopes downward"

and I thought:           "What is he talking about?" bu t in fact

he was right,         it does slope downward,              and therefore

people outside have a relatively clear vie w of the turnstile

area.

         One has to ask oneself the q u e stion whet h e r a

football crowd is so i n t r insically d i f f e r e n t to any

other crowd of peo p l e that they are un a b l e to assess the

issue as to w h e t h e r or n o t they should stand, move back,

move to one side,           a n d in f act we k n o w lots of p e o p l e did

a c t ually do that,         so they are no t intrinsically different.

There m a y b e some wh o are b u t I think it is p r o b a b l y fair

to say that they are not i n t r i n s i c a l l y different.

         Secondly,       the a r g u m e n t t h a t no m o v e m e n t was p o s s i b l e

b e c a u s e of the severe c r u shing has als o g o t to be

e x a m i n e d and there are at least two w i t n e s s e s a n d there

m a y be more,      b u t there a t least two w i t n e s s e s w h o talk

a b o u t w h a t h a p p e n e d w h e n the    communication about a

p o s s i b l e kick-off was comm u n i c a t e d to p e o p l e c lose by.

T h e first one was E l i z a b e t h Wilson,           she is one of the

m o u n t e d Officers,      she was outs i d e furt h e r afield.

She m o v e d in b e c a u s e do yo u r e m e m b e r she was the one

w i t h the horse w h i c h was s u p p o s e d to b e new a n d they
                                                                            17




did not w a n t it in the c rowd b u t it did not make any

difference,    she finished up there anyway.               She said,

e n t irely incorrectly w i t h o u t authority:        "Kick-off will

be postponed"    and she said it created "an easing in the

situation"    immediately ar o u n d her w h i c h changed when

the roar within the ground was heard and all the previous

situation recurred.

actually within the turnstile area and he said that a rumour

went through the crowd that kick-off would be delayed and

that eased    the pressure    to a certain extent            for a short

period and then the rumour was countermanded,                  so to speak,

and   the whole   thing started up again.             There was another

witness who talked about a horse w h i c h misbehaved but                I

think we can ignore       that p a rticular problem.

      The point about it is this:              you have to make up your

mind whether on the e v i dence it is right that this crowd was

in fact such that it could not have eased back.                    The

evidence of nearly all       the Officers was          that the people at

the back could have eased off,           so to speak,         and I am talking

about the outside.         However,    it is a very important            point

because it goes to the issue as to whet h e r or not                this crowd

that was    there was behaving in a manner w hich was

unexpected.       Mr.   M a r shall quite clearly said          that you could

always expect lateness,       but in a d d ition to the u n p r ecedented

d e c i s i o n to close Leppings Lane he also felt that the total

n umber who arrived were unprecedented.                    In other words,   a

larger nu m b e r of latecomers came than one could r e asonably

have expected on the one hand,           and    that their b e haviour with

regard to entry was,       as far as he and the South Y o r k s h i r e

Police were concerned,       unprec e d e n t e d   too.
       I think there is no use beating about the bush.                     One

has   to grasp this nettle and          think about it and       sort    it out

in your minds.

      You will remember        that we heard      from at least one

mounted Officer who d e scribed the m a t c h at Tranmere,               I think

Tranmere Rovers,         where he described only one or two

turnstiles working,         people not getting in until four

o'clock.       In other words,        an hour   late,   or so,    and yet no

problems whatsoever.

       Now only did we have him, we also had one witness,

Mr. Grant, who also d e scribed problems w hich h e had

experienced at Wembley,          if you can remember.            On that

occasion he said two interesting things.                   First of all,          he

got in without having          to show his      ticket because the

turnstiles were free-wheeling,            and he queued       for an hour and

twenty minutes       and was    twenty minutes      late in getting        in.

       Like e verything else in this account,              ever y t h i n g has

got two edges.           On the one hand,       those two examples - I

think the T r a nmere R over one was a fter the event so it may

not be a good example because of that,               because people had

been alerted to the situation.               N e v e r t h e l e s s it illustrates

the p o s s i b i l i t y that you can get large crowds,         and   this   is

what Mr.    Marshall was       saying and you hav e to de c i d e whether

you b e l i e v e him,   indeed Mr.    Mole said it as well.            He said,

"The m ere fact there are large crowds              in itself means

nothing.       You can hav e hug e crowds w ith no problems              at all.
It is what is h a p pening with the crowd and what effect that

is having on the situation."

       Everybody knows that everybody who goes                 to a football

match wants     to be in by three o'clock,            or whatever time

kick- off is.         Everybody,     whether man or woman who goes               to

a football match or,         indeed,    anything you want to go to, you

know if you think you are going to be late you are going to

get niggled and you may get very cross                in fact.         You may

even shout.        It depends on you.             However,    it does not

follow that everybody need n e c e s s a r i l y decide that they are

going to press       forward in order to get in on time.                   The

problem of not getting in on time is missing part of a

match.      That is a r e latively small price to pay as against

injury to others.

       It can also be remedied.             You cannot,       of course,       see

the m a t c h again, but as indeed in any contractual situation

if you feel     the other side has not done its bit then vou

recl a i m your money or you sue for damages,                you do w h a t e v e r

you wish.       We are not in the business of sorting                  that out

but I merely m e n t i o n that a l t h o u g h one talks about          the

problems of not getting people in,                the only real p r o b l e m is

that they are g oing to be late for a part of a match.

       There was one other witness wh o gave an i n t e r e s t i n g

acco u n t for the p o s s i b i l i t y of c r u s h i n g and that was

Mr.   Cully.      He d e s c r i b e d the fact   that if you get a c r u s h

                                                                                              21




            situation in fact some people like that.                    It is very

            c onvenient       for activities        like pick-pocketing.
        B
                    Whilst I am on this subject we als o heard from a whole

            load of witness          right at the beginning about people who had

            d iscussed the p o s s i b i l i t y of getting in.         They said,     "Oh,

            we can get in."             Do you remember     that one group at the

            Matilda who said to the young lady,               "Come with us, we can

            get in."          Mr. Cully,     I think,    said you can always get in if

            you have not          got another ticket.

                    We h ave      got to be careful wit h      that because we have

            very little evidence as to w hat a c t u a l l y happened.               There

            were one or two who did hear comments                about,   "I told you we

            would get in with o u t        tickets."       Tha t was Mr.     Murray,    I

            think,     heard s o met hing like that.          T hat is the father of

            one of the boys who died.                I think there w e r e one or two

            others who heard          such comments.

                    You may feel that w h a tever may or may not h ave be e n in

            the minds of          pe o p l e a bout w h o m we heard, the events    on the

            day p r o b a b l y   s w allowed up,    if I can use that expression,

            w h a t e v e r plans or o t h e r w i s e anyb o d y m i g h t have had and I

            think from a p r a ctical point of v i e w you can ignore               that as

            a feature.




    H
     Up to now I have merely        talked about the fact that

there was crushing and how it was caused,           and   tried to

draw your attention to some of the thoughts w h i c h you

might want    to have on this.      The next question of course

which arises    is whether or not the condition out there was

actually as bad as for instance Mr. Marshall              thought.

There is no doubt whatever,        and we don't need       to go over

it in detail,    Mr.   Marshall was clearly of the opinion that

if the gates were not opened he would have deaths and

injuries outside and,’ in fact,        there was at least one chap

whom we had who hurt his shoulder.          I don t consider that

necessarily a very serious injury but he did hurt his

shoulder.     Mr. Marshall said in fact there w ere 37 people

who had been hurt.        I am not suggesting for a minute that

any of those were seriously hurt though there was one lad,

and I think he is on the video,          you can see h i m being

passed across,       who certainly Inspector Purdy was very

worried about.        If you r e m ember we went to a bit of pain

to try and est a b l i s h that this lad a c t ually recovered

because we did not want to think that he had been lost,                 so

to speak.

        So Inspector Purdy clearly thought that s o mething had

to be done;    Mr.    Marshall   thought that som e t h i n g had to be

done;    quite a lot of the Officers w h o s e e v i dence we h eard

- Mr.    Creaser,    Mr. Mackay,   various others    (I am not sure

about Mr.    Mackay)    - but there w ere vari o u s others who said
action had     to be taken o t h erwise something serious would

go wrong out there.

        They were not the only ones because there were a

substantial number of supporters who took exactly                     the same

view.     There was a c hap called Mr. Atkin.                 He said he was

crushed outside the per i m e t e r gates,            in fact to such an

extent    that he was having d ifficulty with his breathing.

There was a Mr.        Edwards who was panic stricken and

frightened of being crushed.               He was,     I think,   within the

turnstile area.         Mr. Doyle,       whom I might mention again

later on and whose account               I thought had some

discrepancies       in it,       shall we say, but he said his brother

helped lift a lad out.             Mr.    Gains   thought that people

would get hurt.         Nicola Stewart was          frightened in the

turnstile area and in fact she said that pe o p l e were

actually     trying to p u s h back.         Mr. Ball said pe o p l e were

distr e s s e d against the p e r i m e t e r gates.      Mr. Richards      said

people were very d i s t r e s s e d in the turnstile area.               Mr.

A n d erson was very d i s t r e s s e d in the turnstile area,           and

par t i c u l a r l y his dad.     Stephanie Jones was h urt at the

gate.     In fact, we had a lot of d i f f i c u l t y w i t h Stephanie,

if you can remember.              She was a very,      very   i n t e r esting and

very good witness.           The diffi c u l t y we had w i t h he r was

trying to w o r k out what time this p a r t i c u l a r epis o d e of

disc o m f o r t arose and p r e c i s e l y where,    but in the end she

said it was d e f i n i t e l y nea r the c o n c e r t i n a gate "C".      Mr.
Rawlinson,      he was not p a r t i cularly worried about himself

but he was worried about a friend and some older people,

and as I say Inspector Purdy was very worried,                      and Mr.

Gould overheard a lady say that if something was not done

somebody would die.             That,   of course,    means nothing in a

way.    We also heard of people who were coming out of the

terrace saying,            "It's murder in there".         That    is a

colloquial expression and does not n ecessarily mean too

much but he did go on to say that he accepted                      that as a

correct comment.

       Richard Thompson,           another witness,       his view was that

if those gates had not been opened there would have been

more deaths outside than inside.                Who knows?         Do not jump

to that - that is a possib i l i t y - the only reason why I

adduce or remind you of these witnesses is because it may

h elp you to make an a s sessment as to the reasona b l e n e s s or

otherwise of r equesting the gates              to be opened.

       So in a n u t shell you have Police Officers,                  and

part i c u l a r l y Mr.    Marshall,   who assessed that the situation

was gett i n g critical.           T here is no doubt w h a t e v e r from all

the evidence w hich you have heard               that his requests became

more insistent,            and indeed the Control R oom d e s c r i b e d the

last one as a demand and some people d e s c r i b e d his voice

as being e x c e e d i n g l y agitated,     shall we say,        or words       to

that effect.         There is no doubt that in his mind action

was ne e d e d and was ne e d e d urgently,          and inter e s t i n g l y
Sergeant Higgins,       who was on the inside but at Gate A made

exactly the same request         two minutes     later,   and gave

exactly    the same reasoning,       so you may    feel that on

balance the evidence does show that things were pretty

d esperate outside the turnstile areas.

       We know that 95 people died on the terraces and we

also know that not a single person died outside the

turnstile areas.        It is very easy to say well,          there you

are,   that must have been the wrong decision because nobody

died there and 95 died inside,           but you cannot do that

b ecause you do not actually know what would hav e happened

if the gates had not been opened.             It may be that       that is

right,    not a single person would hav e died.             It may be

that Mr. T h o mpson is right,       that we w ould be dealing w ith

100,   120.    Who knows?     We don't kno w and you cannot wit h

hindsight     try and sort     that out.     All you can do is put

yourself as nea r as you can into the shoes of the people

who were there on 15th April and say given that s i tuation

was that a reaso n a b l e thing to do?        Would a reaso n a b l y

skilled Offi c e r have done the same?           All the evidence

would seem - not all but vir t u a l l y all the e v i d e n c e would

seem to point      to that direction,       that the d e c i s i o n to open

the gates was a r e asonable one in the circumstances.

       We did explore the p o s s i b i l i t y as to w h e t h e r people

could have been diverted down           the roadway,      do you

remember,     and w h e t h e r or not kick-off should be pos t p o n e d
and I,have already dealt w i t h that so I don't want to go

over the kick-off side again,          but very briefly,      if you

think back to the photographs          and the videos and so on you

will remember     that there were actually lightweight

barriers blocking that roadway,          just past the concertina

gate "C",    and my impression of the evidence is that nobody

was actually pressing against          this.    There was not a

pressure on those lightweight barriers            in that position.

That means,    I think,    at least    two things.     First of all

that you could hold that crowd w i t h lightweight barriers,

provided that you were h o l d i n g them at a place w here they

did not want     to go.    It is an important prov i s o but

nevertheless     it is a fact,     and indeed this is also

illustrated by the fact that the side roads w ere blocked

w i t h n o t h i n g but lightweight barriers and one Policeman,

and Mrs.    Hockenhull - that is the lady w h o s e n ame I could

not remember,     the carpenter - said that w hen a Police man

came into he r garden he was able         to divert    the fans to

stop them d oing what they had been doing previously.

      So it was possible to use r e latively small numbers                to

achieve control,     provi d e d it was in the right place.            The

control ax the pe r i m e t e r gates,   for instance,     appeared a

totally dif f e r e n t ma t t e r and I have already i l l u s trat ed

and r e m inded you of some of the evidence there.             It is an

important point because it wil l reapp e a r w h e n we come to

think very,    very briefly,     and again we must not w a s t e time
on what did not happen,           but just briefly think about what

might have happened           if the tunnel had been blocked off

w i t h a lightweight barrier or a Policeman.                 Mr. McMaho n -

I have jumped a little bit - said one Officer could have

done it,      to stand there in this way,         and that would have

been it.       To a certain extent,       and I will deal w i t h it now

and then I have done it, your v iew of that will depend

upon whether you equate that tunnel entrance w i t h the

perimeter gates,           if I can put it like that,         where you

might think that Mr. McMahon might be mistaken,                     or with

the side road where he m ight well have been right,                     and

this is w here it is important not to d raw the analogy of

the two areas            too far, because whereas one could perhaps

j ustifiably argue that people outside the per i m e t e r gate

were not in the Ground,           and therefore that is why            they

were p r e s s i n g forward,    c e rtainly once they wer e in the

c o n course area they were wi t h i n the Ground,            and it may

well be that if they had been d i v e r t e d to a different

route they knew that they were going to get to the vi ew i n g

areas,     they might have p r e f e r r e d and no doubt some would

have p r e f e r r e d   to go down the tunnel,    and I hav e got very

little doubt         that some w ould have g one down.

       We know that is so beca u s e again we h e a r d from Mr.

Cully,     who had no right to be in the stands but he gave,                       I

thought,      very honest and fair evidence.              You r e m e m b e r he

had gone down the tunnel,           di d n ' t like it,    bac k out, up
into the stands,       looked down,     saw his son,   got him to come -

out and meet him in the con c o u r s e area,     saw the concertina

gate "C" opened,       realised that there were going to be a

lot of people come in and made a mad dash for the stairs,

and got there just as somebody was           trying to close the

gates and he said,       "I just pulled them open and went up".

      We also heard not dissi m i l a r accounts       from the

friends of Mr. McDonnell,         who also decided that the stands

were better and who took the opportunity to go up when

people were not looking.          U n f o rtunately poor Mr. McDonnell

having got up came down again and we know that

unfortunately he lost his life.

      So things in the concourse area were not all

sweetness and light all the time for all the fans but it

is a matter for you to decide,           insofar as it is necessary,

and it may not be terribly nec e s s a r y because w h a t e v e r the

rights and wrongs of the success of that ope r a t i o n w o u l d

have been the facts of the m a t t e r are that no order was

given.      I don't think anybody has s u ggested that an order

was given to divert fans in 1989.

      Mr.   Marshall    together w i t h the pe o p l e outside --- Mr.

Marshall's     control was     (1) to close Leppings Lan e    (b)    to

seek further assistance,         in the main from Mr.     Buxton,    (c)

for m o u n t e d Officers   to come.

         Judging from the video it w o u l d appear that the

entry into the concourse,            cer t a i n l y after the initial

inrush - I will use that word,              not in a critical sense

but it seems that is w h a t yo u w o u l d expect,            if you open

a gate you are going to get an inflow — bu t after that

it was substantial but not headlong,                 it was that there

weire ci lot of people cominQ in*

         The people within the concourse area and p a r t i cularly

the gatemen,      they did not feel that the/could interpose

themselves into this crowd.               In fact Mr. B e a dsley I

think said he w o u l d have done if he had b een ordered

but he did not think that it wa s safe,                 in effect.

         T hat se e m e d to be the general feeling.              That may

have been b e c a u s e there w e r e such a lot of people coming

in as o p p o s e d to a con c e r t e d rush forw a r d beca u s e we

spent a lot of time trying to e l i c i t w h e t h e r the people

wer e b e i n g c a r r i e d in one direction/      w h e t h e r they had

space to m o v e to one side a n d there wa s one chap,                 Mr.   Dodd,

w h o sai d he wa s m ore or less b e i n g carried.             T here was

one o t h e r y oung man, Mr. M a c A r t h u r w h o j ust f o l lowed

the crowd.        There w e r e several w h o f o l l o w e d the crowd

b u t he s e e m e d to have g o t into the st r e a m a n d he ha d

b een t o l d "Follow the crowd" a n d that is w h a t he did.

 In fac t he h a d go t a S t a n d tic k e t if you r e m e m b e r and

 he f i n i s h e d on the terrace a n d there wer e a few like

 that.

          I o r i g i n a l l y t h o u g h t that there w o u l d n o t be any
                                                                               37




but there were a few but I am not saying it was a signif i c a n t

nu m b e r and in any case it m a y well have been balanced

by all the terrace people w h o wer e up in the Stands but

we don't know.

        Although as I say my impression from the overall

evidence is that the e n t r y was not viol e n t          in the sense

that there was a mad rush,          n e v e r theless there were some

people w h o appear ed c e r t a i n l y to have   lost shoes because

you can't find shoes         lying around if the y d on't come off

feet,    and the ones that I think I am mor e impressed w ith

are the ones near Gate B because Gate C shoes, well I

don't know,      b u t the Gate B that was ou t of the w a y so to

speak,    it was not d i r e c t l y in line w i t h a n y t h i n g really,

but I w o u l d no t mak e too m u c h of it,      there wer e just a

 lot of people w h o wer e e n t e r i n g at a m u c h faster rate,

as I have a l r e a d y e x p l a i n e d to y o u than they w o u l d have

done if the y h a d come in thro u g h the turnstiles.              They

w e r e coming in through the turnstiles as well of course

 so   yo u h a d turn stile e n t r y at a fast rate plu s a large

 nu m b e r coming in thro u g h Gate C a n d w h e t h e r all w e n t down

 the tunnel or not there seems to be v e r y little d oub t

 a l t h o u g h a substantial number d i d go down the tunnel

 a n d if you just judge it f rom the n u m b e r of w i t n e s s e s

 w h o m w e h a d w h o said:   "We w e n t down the tunnel" yo u will

 realise that v i r t u a l l y all d i d go d own the tunnel.          Some

 of t h e m came b a c k out, n o t many, b u t some di d b u t v i r t u a l l y

 all w e n t down the tunnel,       so I think e v i d e n t i a l l y that

 is so.
       Wha t puzzles me m u c h more is w h a t was going on in

the tunnel becaus e we have heard accounts frora people

wh o came through Gate C w h i c h completely,              some of them

said the tunnel was clear:             "I was just able to go through

it and the exit was clear".              Others said:        "We could see

people weeing down the side".               Others said:        "There is

no question that anybody could p o s s i b l y have stood to

do that it was so full."

        Mr. McMa h o n and Mr. T r a c e y for instance they said

the tunnel was full and that they had to shuffle                     down

and that the exits w ere blocked.

        Mr. Rich a r d s o n also said t hat the tunnel was full

and there w a s a b i t of p u s h i n g there.         The o t h e r two

did not imply a n y pushing.

        Mr. Carroll,      I am j ust       p i c k i n g o u t one or two,

he said:      "The tunnel was p a c k e d w i t h people b u t able

to w a l k a n d there was some s l i g h t two- w a y traffic".

        Mr. C u l l y seems to have m a n a g e d to g e t down the

tunnel.     He looked down,        he d i d n o t like w h a t he saw

on the terraces,        he tur n e d r o u n d   an d w e n t out.

        Mr. L a c k e y for example,       he    s a i d the tunnel was

c lear an d he c o u l d see the p l a y e r s on the pitch.

        Mr. H o i 1inrake s a i d the tunnel was clear b u t the

exi t was b l o c k e d a n d he a c t u a l l y s aid he h a d to p u s h

quite h a r d to ge t through.

        Mr. T.W. Lloyd,        he sai d h a l f w a y d own the tunnel

there was an Increase in pressure,                 he h a d to w a l k faster
                                                                                  39




because of the crowd w h i c h was coming in from behind

him and then whe n he got to the exit he said it was like

w a l k i n g into a b r i c k wall,    he was pu s h e d forward he says

by the p r e ssure fro m the people beh i n d him.

        M r.   H e w s   tone hd w e n t down the tunnel and he said

the exit was blocked,            he d e c i d e d he was not going to

go in, he just stood there.                He was the chap w h o saw

a small group of people make w h a t sounds like a

fairly forceful entry into the t e rracing b u t we don't

know w h i c h side they w e n t into,          five or six he said made

a little run and w e n t through and he also saw somebody

bring a c hild out b u t he said nobody a p p eared to take

very m u c h notice of that and then he left the tunnel

and f i n ished up somewhere else.

         There was Mr. Crawford.              He was a c t u a l l y told not

to go down the tunnel.              Th e o nly m a n I think or witness

w h o m we h a d w h o a c t u a l l y said that someb o d y tol d h i m not

to go down on the day b e c a u s e it wa s full.                I t hink it

was just a n o t h e r fan w h o said it b u t he m a d e a personal

assessment,        looked down,        d e c i d e d it wa s o kay an d went.

I d on't c o m p l a i n a b o u t that.

         So I think the p o s i t i o n w i t h regard to the tunnel

to me is rather confusing.                 It m a y b e it d i f f e r e d from

m i n u t e to m i n u t e beca u s e a fter all we are talking a bout

what, a l t o g e t h e r a 12 m i n u t e p e r i o d if yo u s tart at

 14.48 or if y o u s tart at 14.52 y o u are talking a b o u t an

e i g h t m i n u t e period,    so that m a y be the reason w h y d i f f e r e n t

pe o p l e saw d i f f e r e n t aspects of the tunnel.
       The exiting from the tunnel is also' interesting.

There was Mr. Mu l l i n for instance.             I think he said he

"sidled out".

        Mr. R i c h a r d s o n I have already mentioned.            He said

that he did some pushing.

        Mr. Bullis gave a ver y graphic description.                      He

said it was like a "stream of lava"                 that he seemed to

see coming out of the tunnel mouth.

        Mr. Hughes,       that is Mr. G r i e r ’s friend,        Stuart

T hompson's friend,        he was sitting on that little wall

and he said he wa s knoc k e d off it, off his perch by the

crowds of people coming in, not "crowds"                     numbers I think

w o u l d be a b e t t e r word,   so I find as I say the evidence

regarding the tunnel,           I a m n o t going to say u n s a t i s f a c t o r y

because it is no t a q u e s t i o n of b e i n g s a t i sfactory or

unsatisfactory,        I just fin d it v e r y d i f ficult to reconcile

all the accounts w h i c h w e have had.

         I now w a n t to turn to the terraces themselves.

 Yo u will have no ticed that I have m a n a g e d to speak for

 I d on't kno w h o w long and I have n o t referred to a single

 'C' number yet I think or have I?                 Anyway,     I ce r t a i n l y

 have n o t r e f erred to v e r y m a n y b u t I will refer to a

 couple now.       T h a t is beca u s e I have n o t got p a r t i c u l a r l y

 Mr. R u s s e l l ' s skills w i t h re g a r d to the photographs,           but

 be that as it m a y I do w a n t to r e f e r to a couple w h i c h

 I found helpful an d tha t is 536 a n d 537.                 T h e y are the

 p lans w h i c h Mis s Goodall p r e p a r e d w h e r e the w i t n e s s e s .
                                                                                  41




were,   the location of plans,           w h i c h in f act I initially

thought w o u l d be o nly of i n t erest but I have found them

v ery useful because they do actua l l y give you a nice

ov e rview of where people were wi t h i n the terraces.                   They

are not,    I was going to say not e n t irely accurate,                  that

is not fair,      they are e n t irely accurate I am sure, but

because we followed           the conve n t i o n of always       taking the

second position,        in    one case at least,        for example

Mr. Hughes,      I have alre a d y referred to him.              If you

look for Mr. Hughes           you w o n ' t find him w here       I said he

was because that was not his second position,                      it was

in fact his third,           bu t you will have all the numbers so

if you need to check you will be able to look it up if


it became necessary.

        N o w if we look then at the pens and if we have a


look a t Pen 4 f i r s t of all,         I t h i n k we had ar o u n d 26

w i t n e s s e s in that pen, n o t that m a n y deaths b u t we did

h ave a r easonable n u m b e r of witnesses.

        If you listened to the pe o p l e in Pe n 3 nearly

all of the m r e f e r r e d to "surges",         sometimes one or two

surges,    strong surges.          T here w e r e q uite a few p e o p l e in

P e n 4 w h o di d no t r efer to surges or w h e r e the surges

were n o t such a s i g n i f i c a n t feature.

        This is simply an i m p r e s s i o n w h i c h I have got.

I have go t the i m p r e s s i o n tha t m a y be t here wa s a

d i f f e r e n c e in the m o v e m e n t w i t h i n the c r o w d in those

two pens.       W h e t h e r t hat is b e c a u s e the b a r r i e r di d not
b r e a k in Pen 4 I don't know,     bu t if that were so then it

can't be the whole explanation because the barrier was

fairly far down and if it had broke it w o u l d only have

b roken once, whereas we had q uite a lot of evidence of

more than that.

         I have tried to look through at some of these

witnesses w h o m we had and in summary altho u g h quite a

lot of witnesses d e scribed d i s c o m f o r t at an earl i e r stage

than w h a t I am now going to tell you,          the v ast major i t y

of the witnesses in that pen i n dicated that they did

n ot become d i stressed until the players came on to the

p i t c h or a fter and in fact w hile      I am on that subject

that is exac t l y the same in Pen 3.          T h e r e are a few

e xceptions b u t the v a s t m a j o r i t y of the w i tnesses

describe distress w h e r e things ha d gone w r o n g and s ome­

thing ha d to be done a f t e r the players came on the

pitch.




                               The d i f f i c u l t y of course
        The difficulty,         of course,   as you know, has been to try

and pin people down to when it happened and a lot of people,

particularly in their statements,              used times.        They said

that it was at this           time or that time,     but,   of course,        if

you don't actually look at your w a t c h you do not know what

time it is.

        Also,   and    this   is one of these illustrations which I

have already given you like Mr.              Nicholl.       The responses

depended very often on the form of the q uestioning so I will

give you one illustration.              Alison Bennett,       she came with

her friend David Lowe and some others and                 she was one of the

ones who had Spion Kop tickets,              but that is neit h e r here nor

there,    not    for what I am going to say now,            because there          is

no suggestion that she entered improperly.                    She p r ese nted

her ticket at the turnstile and then she was allowed

through.        Whether she should have been is another matter,

but she was.

        She,    in response      to some questioning,       said that the pen

was as full as she had ever experi e n c e d it at 2.30 and yet

in response       to other questions she des c r i b e d      the c o n d i t i o n

at 14.50 as normal;             14.50 was the time whe n she said her

friend Julie,         who was    less experienced,      decided   to m ove

away,    but she was q uite cont e n t to stay.             In fact she

started off by saying 14.50,            then she said it was as full as

she had ever exper i e n c e d      it at 2.30 and then upon further
examination by somebody        further     down the line,     she said it

was normal up to 14.50 and         then    it changed suddenly.

      I am not c omplaining about          this girl in any way.            I am

merely using her evidence as an            illustration of the

difficulty of being a b solutely sure when people are

referring    to times.

      Those who were able        to locate it to players coming out,

kick-off,    of course are better beca u s e we know what time

that happened.

      Now as I say,       I do not want    to spend too much on

individual cases,        a l t hough I can do, but I do not think it

is going to hel p us, but there are one or two who m I think

one ought to mention.          Tak e Robert Knowles,       this was     the

gentleman who came in through Gate C w i t h two boys.                  He was

a very intere s t i n g witness I thought in many ways.                He

entered pen 4, hav i n g come in through Gate C.                     It was

full but he did not think that was in itself unus u a l but

because he had the boys he wanted to go forward and he

w o r k e d his way down to the front.         He says that r ight at

the front    there was a gap near the fencing and he was able

to walk,    as I u n d e r s t o o d his evidence,   m ore or less

uni m p e d e d up to where   the radial fence was,       or almost up to

the r a d i a l fence.     He took up his p o s i t i o n there.       Located

the boys.      He was not right against          the fence b e c a u s e he

felt he wa n t e d to be b a c k a step or two, and h e was
perfectly       satisfied with his position when the players were

already on the pitch and he said so quite clearly.

        He then      says that just after kick-off things became

tight.        He   w a s   not   d istressed but for some reason w h i c h he

was not able to put              into words he realised something was not

right.        He got the boys out and put             them over    the front and

they eventually were put back into pen 5.                      He went on to

say that as far as he was concerned up to kick-off                       in his

position that pen was not abnormal.

        Mr.    Spearritt who I think is here and who,                of course,

u n f o rtunately lost his lad Adam,             as you will no doubt

remember.          He too was in the front only he was nearer                  to

the gate.          He had not walked,         if you like,      quite as far as

Mr.   Knowles.             He too when he first got down there w h i c h was

just before the play e r s came on the pitch,                 had described

there was a gap dow n there and that he was able                     to take up

his p o s i t i o n and that he was able to c o n v e r s e w i t h his lad.

T h e n he remembers the players coming out of the tunnel.

His e v i d e n c e was v er y graphic and very moving,             as you will

remember.          It was as if a vice came down at that very

point.         Up to that time he had just had time to make some

comment       to the lad about Hanson p l a y i n g - one of the play e r s

- and then that was it.                 Things had changed so fast,          as far

as he was concerned.                You will remember he told us h o w he

turned the boy round.                H o w he saw a Po l i c e O f f i c e r fairly

close    to him.            How he called and said would he p l e a s e open
                                                                                 46




the gates.         I think he said,    "My lovely boy is dying."                 He

said the Officer          took no notice of him,    or at least appeared

not to take any no tice of him.           He thinks Ada m by then had

lost consciousness and certainly he did.               He was very,         very

ill himself.            He did not see the gate open so we do not

actually know exactly when he. lost consciousness,                but if the

pathologists are to be believed,           it does not take very          long

to lose consciousness.

       Within that short period of time there was a c o mp letely

dramatic change in that front area.

       We also know that in fact that gat e was opened around

14.59.         W e can say that wit h reas o n a b l e confidence because

we h ave photographs         of Sergeant Swift at the gate and           in

fact on one of those w here he has seen somebody has

identified himself as well.            If you remember one of the

w i t nesses    said,    "My friend is outside and I am jus t coming

out,   or p o s sibly I am out."

       Yet despite the fact that he was so close to that gate,

w h a t e v e r e v i dence there is, and there isn't very much,           it

does not look as if Adam actually got out straight away.

You r e m ember we did call PC Harratt.            He was   the c hap who

said he thought he saw h i m being passed           from pen 4 across

into pen 3 and then out.            I m ust admit I ha d n ' t r e a lised

that he had not h a n d l e d him.       I thought he had actua l l y

held him, but he hadn't, he merely saw him.                 A l t h o u g h he

felt r e asonably confident it was Adam,           bear i n g in mind      the

    A                                                                                     47




        c i r c umstances he could just as easily have been mistaken.

        It is very difficult          to say.
    B           Mr.    Spearritt,   of course,      felt that if the gate had

        been opened that m u c h sooner when he called,                 then m aybe Adam

        and he would have been able             to get out and survive.

        That may be or may not be so, we don't know, because                       the

        facts are that they did not get out of that gate straight

        away.         One has to ask the question why was that and the

        answer must surely be that other people were getting out at

        that time and for some reason or other they had got

        displaced.

                Mr. Anderson and Mr. Mullee,            they were half way down

        the terrace.          They were n ' t quite so far forward.              They

        described,        p a r t i cu larly Mr. Mullee,   I think,     that pressure

        started b u i l d i n g up at 14.45 w i t h a c rush from about 2.50

        onward.         Be careful wit h the times.            W h e n I give you       times

        always        treat them w ith caution.

                He then went on to say that Mr.              Anderson,     senior,      that

        is the gen t l e m a n who died,        a p p eared to be really d ist ressed

        when the players were on the field.                   He did not a c t u a l l y

        see the play e r s on the field.              He just h eard the n o i s e        and

        he m a d e the deduction.           He may or       may not be right.

                Ge o f f r e y Bridson,   do you r e m e m b e r him?     He was   in

        there at 14.40 and he said h e was not apprehensive.                         At

        14.45 h e thought the c o nditions wer e about                  like 1988.        When

        the players came out he was one of                  the few people who
actually     looked at his watch.          He said he    tried to set his

stopwatch.       It is just his habit.          He said he could not do

it because he could not get his arm up at that time when the

players came out.         He was in     fact able to do it

subsequently,      so he must have      been able to m a noeuvre himself

and he set his watch and he was, d e s p i t e that condition,

prepared     to watch the match.        In fact he said he was not

worried until kick-off.          He thought the track officers

would    have been     aware of the crushing,      but if in fact he         was

not concerned until kick-off          we kno w from the photograp hs

which I have already referred to that at that time activity

was already     taking place at the gate.

        Now I have     reminded you h o w dangerous      it is to rely       on

the      photographs and particularly you r e m e m b e r the shots

which showed the gates being open at .59,               .01,   .03,   .05.

Just b e c a u s e they happen to be open at those times does not

n e c e s s a r i l y m ean that they w ere not closed in between,       but I

think w i t h regard    to gate 4 we do n o t just hav e to rely on

the photographs.         We hav e also got the evidence of

PC Hooson,     Sosnowski - do you remember        the lady - and

Sergeant Swift and also the witness who had come out and to

whom I have already referred.

        Mr. Perry describes conditions at 14.45 like sardines,

but not significantly bad u ntil the players w e r e on the

field.      He said the c r u s h was q uite n o r m a l whe n it

initiated,     but it just did not relax.          Tha t was     in fact
what a lot of people          said.      When they were talking of

surges    it was more in pen 3 than in pen 4,                 they said what

was different was          that the surge went        forward and never went

back.      That was what converted what would have been an

acceptable forward m o v ement          to something which,        of course,

was    totally unacceptable and w h i c h led to tragedy.

        He described Police Officers p u t t i n g people back into

the pen - Mr. Perry.             He was asked h o w it happened and he

said that it was more by signals - hand signals - and people

went back.         That,    you may feel,      is not somebody b eing

pushed back into the pen.               If I say,     "Get off," and you get

off,    that is hardly b eing pushed back.                   He did say that he

saw one Officer tapping somebody's h and at about ten past or

quarter past three.            He also said there weren't many people

on the pitch.          Yo u have seen the photog r a p h s and you know

what it was like at ten past and quarter past three.

        I treat w i t h c o n s i d e r a b l e suspicion,    and I ought to

tell you,      anybody who says that peo p l e were b eing pushed

b a c k into the pens at ten past or q u a r t e r past three.

        There is another chap, Mr. Wright,               who was up in the

N o r t h Stand.     H e said at quar t e r past p e o p l e w ere b eing

pushed b ack into the pen.            Noth i n g is impossible,       but   I find

that d i f f i c u l t to r e c o n c i l e w ith the video evidence w h i c h we

h ave seen.
    Taking Mr. Perry again as an example,   he very readily

agreed that he was too far back to see what was actually

going on, nor could he hear the conversations.




                 W h i l e I am on this
      While I am on this topic I will see if I can find it

- I am skipping into another pen,               namely Pen 3 - Mr.

Abbott also,     he describes         a person being pulled out and

falling back into the pen.              What he said was that the

people who were       trying to pull him out did not succeed and

all they got was his jacket.                The jacket came off and he

fell into the pen.         Now,   the question that you have to ask

yourselves     is this,    when people describe people being put

back into the pen,        certainly       later on,    is it possible they

were seeing incidents of this nature?                  I am not saying

that is the full explan a t i o n but it is a possibility.

      Mr. Latham,      that is anot h e r witness,         he also

describes people being pas s e d to the railings,                 not being

able to get over them and d r o pping back,               and he went on to

say it is not at all u n c o m m o n for people to be passed

forward when they faint in a football situation.                      The

point I am trying to m a k e is the same that I was making

w i t h the m o u n t e d Officers,    you have got to think about            the

quality of the evi dence and w h e t h e r or not,            in all the

c ircumstances,     to what extent you accept it or not as the

case may be.


      There was another witness who also said that peop le

w ere coming over the top,            the Pol i c e wer e ha v i n g n o n e of

it and were putt i n g them back,           and when e v e n t u a l l y £ asked

h o w many pe o p l e I think he said that there was one.                   When

e v e n t u a l l y one e x p lored it a bit further it turned out
that he was on the outside         looking in, he had already got

onto the pitch,     and it was not somebody going over the

fence but somebody being apparently pushed back through

the gate.     We have heard an awful        lot about the problems

with people at the gate,        so his perception,       interpretation

and so on, has     to be u n derstood and looked at in the light

of all the evidence,       not just his.

      While I am on that,       there is one more,       Sergeant

Swift.    Do you remember him,        the bald headed man?        We pick

on this poor man because he is bald headed and everybody

can recognise him,      but he describes       the situation where he

was dealing w i t h people and he said that there was one

chap who was in a panic and kept on coming back and in the

end he said that he had to hit him beca u s e he was getting

in his way.      That is hardly what we w ould n o r m a l l y expect.

It may be p e r fect ly u n d e r s t a n d a b l e in the circumstances

but to an o b s e r v e r not quite right,     and indeed somebody

actually said,     I think about Sergeant Swift or certainly

an Officer,    he was call i n g people names,       quite rude names,

but again,    I think it was Serge a n t Swift,        he said it was

at a time w hen the rescue was in being,            there were

p h o t o g r a p h e r s there and the crowd were very angry.      Who

knows wh o that rem a r k m i g h t have been a d d r e s s e d to, and in

any case even if it wer e add r e s s e d to the fans,         the r emark

in that situation is hardly likely to have caused or
                                                                         •53




c o n t r ibuted to the d e a t h of anybody,   although it may not

have been a very wise thing to do or say.

        In Pen 4,    as I say, my impression is if you look at

the plans    that first of all there were far fewer people

who died,    secondly some of them I think were further back,

and that is why I think there was a slight d ifference ---

and that may be for the reason w hich I have said to you,

it may be that people were actually heading             towards Pen 4

because of the ---       I don't   know that is sheer guesswork

and hardly w o r t h mentioning,     but whatever the situation it

was clearly very,       very   full in that pen.

        There was another chap - I am picking out all the

ones who tended to say things were worse early beca u s e it

is important that we don't o v e rlook those - and that was

Mr. Langley.        He said that distress was at 2.40 but he

linked it to when people were climbing up into the stands.

Now, we can't be abso l u t e l y sure what time pe o p l e b e g a n to

c l i m b into the stands beca u s e of course,     as you know,     the

cameras did not follow that scene the w hole time - I w i s h

they had - there is a gap so we don't know,             but he did

look at at least one exhibit,         C344, w h i c h is timed at

around that time,      and he agreed that that was not what he

was d e s c r i b i n g as the contrition in w h i c h he was in.   In

fact,   it was Mr.    Langley who refer r e d to the Officer,

S e r geant Swift,    swearing at somebody and I have alread y

dealt w i t h that.
      I think that gives you a reminder and a summary of

the sort of situation and what it was like in Pen 4, and

there were,    of course,    others.    There was Mr. Gray.           I

will just mention him because he said that he felt the

surge but again he associated it wit h players being on the

pitch and he was one of the people who subsequently tried

to resuscitate John McBrien but not within the pen.                   I

could give you plenty of other people who were there,                     as I

say there were a lot, but I think you have got               the

picture.

      Pen 3, we had many, man y more witnesses in Pen 3.

That was partly because there were many, many m o r e deaths.

In fact, no t partly,     mainly beca u s e of that,      and on the

whole as I say the position is exactly the same.                   If you

take - I think there were about 60 of them in this pen -

the vast m a j o r i t y place discomfort,    not discomfort,

distress when the players come onto the p i t c h or later.                  I

am not talking about some who said that they w ere squashed

and in disc o m f o r t but nearly all of those who said that

was not --- they were quite p r e pared to put up w i t h it.

It was something w h i c h they had e x p e r ienced before,         quite

often it w ould settle at kick-off,          and it h a p p e n e d at big

matches part i c u l a r l y if you wer e in that area.

      So we have got to d r a w a very clear d i s t i n c t i o n

between those two features and it is e x c e e d i n g l y important

because it goes to one of the root questions w h i c h you
have to decide,       namely at what point could - assuming

somebody had    looked at the terrace - could anybody have

realistically noted       that there was serious overcrowding

with the terrace,       and if you accept --- and as I say

questions of fact are entirely for you, when you go in

there you can say,       "That's rubbish,     we know what     these

witnesses    said",    but if you accept     that I have summed        the

evidence of the witnesses         in the pen correctly,       then the

distressing situation did not occur until             the players came

out onto the p itch or later,        or from there onward.

      I have already men t i o n e d St e p h a n i e and the fact of

her apparent relatively fast traversing of the pen and

there were several other people who did the same.                Mr.

Carroll,    he describes    the s i tuation at kick-off,       like

Anfield on a full Kop.        He did actua l l y look for a safer

place,   he said,     but all he wan t e d to do was get in front

of a barrier.       Mr. Lackey,    he was   the gen t l e m a n who cane

on the train with o u t a ticket a c t ually and w h o was

surprised that nobody had searched him, but of course he

was on a football special and Mr.           France told us that they

did not see any point in searching that p a r t i c u l a r crowd

because they all looked and wer e indeed e x c e e d i n g l y well

beha v e d and per f e c t l y proper in every sense of the word.

He said he felt safe at kick-off,           it was not any wors e

than on other occasions.          He r e members people shouting;          he

remembers    two openings of the gate;        and he als o remem bers
                                                                             ' 56




Police shouting for people to go back.                  He also

recollects,     as indeed one or two others in Pen 3, people

coming over the tops of people's heads                  towards the front,

and he says      that the people coming over the              top - this     is

not a quotation but the sense was                that    they had the

strength to do it.         There was     somebody        else who made a

very telling remark,         that   the ones who         were not shouting

were the ones who were in trouble.                 I think that was Mr.

Latham - I am pretty         sure it was Mr.        Latham.


       You heard     from Anthony Grier and Simon Hughes.                They

were very interesting witnesses.                 They were friends of

Stuart Thompson.         They were the ones who wer e climbing up

on the barrier and enjoying themselves.                  I say nothing

more about that,       it was a lovely afternoon and it was an

exciting match.        Anthony said that          up to kick-off it

appeared that he was quite content                w i t h the situation.      He

was spun r ound at kick-off but he was quite prepa r e d to

settle down to w a t c h the m a t c h at that time.           He did go on

to say that for a time he was set as if in concrete,                     even

though he was      fairly far back.         It    then eased off,    and he

was an intere s t i n g witness beca u s e        w hat he did, he then

went forward,      could see the scene,           that there were

problems,    deci d e d very rightly not to go towards             the front

to get out, deci d e d to go b a c k w a r d w h i c h I a p p r o v e of,   so

to speak - not that it matters w h e t h e r I a p p r o v e of it or

not.    The thing that I found intere s t i n g a bout hi m was
that first of all he said that when he was asked by a

Police Constable,           and a Police Constable must of course by

then already have been within the pen,                   whatever time that

might have been,           to leave he refused,         and he decided that

he would rather go up into the stands because he did not

want to miss        the match.          His e x p l a nation was,   "If I go now

I won't be let back in".

        Now,    that was his perc e p t i o n of the situation and he

was within       that very pen.           The m a t c h must have ceased by

then because we know that no Police Officer got in - at

least,     when I say we know,            there is no evidence that we

have heard       that any Police Officer was within the terrace

before the m a t c h finished.             S e r geant Morgan was one of the

earliest and a l t h o u g h he felt he got in quite quickly,

there is visual evidence w h i c h shows him on the playing

area at 9 - m i n u t e s - p a s t .   He thought he was m u c h faster

than in fact he was but I expect Mr. Russ e l l found the

p h o t o g r a p h in w h i c h he is shown,     so he m u s t have got into

the terrace after that and yet this lad still w a n t e d                  to

stay.




                                           Q uite a lot of the people
Q u i t e a lot of p e o p l e got p u l l e d up i nto the stand,                 I do not

k n o w why,    j ust convenient.           There w e r e some like Mr. Twid a l e

w h o t o l d us that the y w ere h e l p i n g p e o p l e up into th e stand

a n d p e o p l e di d n o t w a n t to go up into Pen 2.                The gate was

t here w h e r e he was.         It was q uite c l o s e a n d v i s i b l e and for

 some r e a s o n they still w o u l d n o t go.            So you h a d some p e o p l e

who,    e v e n within the p e n an d e v e n r e l a t i v e l y late in the day,

h a d not a p p r e c i a t e d the e n o r m i t y of the s i t u a t i o n w h i c h was

devel o p i n g in front of t heir v e r y eyes.

        Of course,       t h e y w e r e not r e s p o n s i b l e for t h e p e o p l e c ”

a n y thing like tha t and I am not in a n y w a y w i s h i n g to p i c k on

this lad or indeed any of the others an d say,                           "It is t h e i r

fault".        I a m not saying tha t at all.                 W h a t I a m sa y i n g is

        In addition to all the people in the pens we also

had a look at these from w i t h i n the ground but from

outside,     you know we had got people looking in and I

am not again,        for the same reason,          taking you through

every one bu t the first one we had was Mr. Wright.                        Do

you remember he was the chap in the,                  actually I said

the North Terrace,           he wasn't,     he was in the Nort h - W e s t

Terrace in the c o r n e r ,       al m o s t o p p osite the Police Control

Box in exactly the same spot,               and his evidence was that

he got up;      that the-match was in play;                 that he looked

at the terrace centre pens and said:                    "Wish I was there".

         A t the time I thought to myself:                   "Well so be it"

b u t the more I think a b o u t it the m o r e I w o n d e r about

his timing because the e v i dence w h i c h we have gleaned

from others is that at 2 or 3-minutes-past, w h i c h is

w hen he s aid it was,         there was a l r e a d y a lot of a c t ivity

bot h a t the gates,         the p e r i m e t e r fence,    and on the

p e r i m e t e r track,   so it m a y be that he was a c t u a l l y earlier.

         He is a n o t h e r one of these wit n e s s e s w h o said he

saw people b e i n g p u s h e d b a c k a t q u a r t e r - p a s t and that

is the other re a s o n w h y I am a little bit more doubtful

a bout his timings bu t I a m n o t doubtful a bout w h a t he

felt he saw,        it is just a q u e s t i o n of whe n he felt he

w o u l d have liked to have b e e n there.

         T h e i n t e r esting p o i n t a b o u t h i m is of course that

he is looking at the terrace fro m a l m o s t the same spot

as the Police Control Box,              in fact the p o i n t w h e r e m o s t
                                                                                     67




of these p hotographs wer e w h i c h we have spent ages looking

at,   3 - 6A and that series,           and quite correctly it was

poin t e d ou t he had no responsibility for monitoring.                     It

was not his task to make assessments,                  b u t he did make the

a s sessment that as far as he was c o ncerned he w o u l d have

baai quite content to have gone into that crowd at the p o i n t

in time whe n he a s s essed it.

        Mr. Devonside        looked in.       His son of course was           lost

and I was quite impressed w i t h Mr. D evonside's evidence

because I thought it came over e x a c t l y as it had been.

He had gone to e n j o y the match.             He w a n t e d to be there,

I think the words he use d was to "savour the atmosphere"

and b y and large he did not say "I saw d i s a s t e r staring

me in the face" at that p a r t i c u l a r point.             He said:      "It

 looked a bi t tight" b u t he jpaid no p a r t i c u l a r a t tention

bu t w h e n kick-off o c c u r r e d he said s o mething to the e f f e c t

as "if all hell h a d bro k e n loose".              He did no t q uite u s e

those w ords bu t that w a s I think the sense a n d pe o p l e w e r e

b e i n g p u l l e d ou t an d people w e r e coming out.         So that

w a s Mr. D e v o n s i d e from the N o r t h Stand.

N o r t h S t a n d b u t w h o a c t u a l l y saw nothing.   T h a t was

significant.        He d i d n o t notice a n y t h i n g until a f t e r the

        We h e a r d f rom Mr.     a n d Mrs.   Steele w h o w e r e up in

us quite clearly that she- was standing up and of course

standing up you do get a be t t e r v i e w than sitting down.

My r e c o l lection of Mrs.      Steele's evidence is that she

really became alerted to the p r o b l e m at around the sort of

time w h i c h I have been d i scussing and she also refers to

somebody wh o was pulled o u t and w h o came in and said:

"It is murder down there" or w ords to that effect,                         but

interestingly he then w e n t and sat down.                    Now whether

that means that it was m u r d e r down there, w h i c h it was,

no it wasn't,       I m u s t n ' t use that word,       people died so

he was right in saying it was a b s o l u t e l y dreadful but

whet h e r he was just using a colloquial expre s s i o n

w h i c h we all -tend to do w h e n we say things are bad, but

he had not a p p r e c i a t e d q u i t e h o w b a d it was b e c a u s e his

n e x t action was to go an d find hims e l f a seat to sit down.

        I have m e n t i o n e d I n s p e c t o r Bullis already.          He

looked dan and he saw t h i s ■"river" as he ca l l e d it, of

Stand.     He said he was worr i e d a bout the Stand collapsing

beca u s e so m a n y people were going into it.              He did think

the terrace was crowded and at one p o i n t he felt that he

had .a be t t e r view beca u s e he was further back,            do you

remember,     b u t he then did agree that people nearer to the

terrace,    I am not talking a bout n e c e s s a r i l y people in

Pen 3 b u t those in Pen 2, w o u l d have had exactly the same

vie w at least of the people b e i n g pulled up and you will

also remember,       I have also r e m inded you w h a t Mr.          Goodman

said, w h a t his a s s e s s m e n t was of some of the people who

had bee n pulled up, b u t c e r tainly he a ppreciated that

the terraces w ere crowded.

         Mr. Hicks was v e r y ver y close to h i m actually.                    I

think that is another one of those coincidences which

surro u n d e d if you like Mr. Hicks,          b e c a u s e we did not

a c t u a l l y k n o w Dr. F l e n l e y until after the event.

         Mr. Hicks of course has had a v e r y h eavy burden

b e c a u s e n o t o n l y di d he lose two daughters;        n o t o n l y did

he a c t u a l l y find the m on the pitch,        b u t in a d d i t i o n of

course he has als o b een v e r y active w i t h the o t h e r

families      and so he has no d o u b t sh a r e d some of their

b u r d e n s and griefs and I a m v e r y conscious of this,              but

it is onl y r i g h t to sa y I a m a little b i t w o r r i e d a b o u t

he gave in the first s t a t e m e n t he mad e on the night of

the 15th April       1989.

        Now of course Mr.          Hicks quite rightly e x plained to

you that on that night he had had a pretty hard day,

and I think that is an understatement,                    b u t nevertheless

we have done in m a n y cases referred people to their

statements on the basis of the nearer the event the more

likely it is to be accurate and also we have to bear in

mind when that sta t e m e n t was given nobody knew,                   at least

I did not know that the m a t c h had finished at 6-minutes-past.

It m a y be this was known to people who were at the ground,

I don't know.         It m a y be t hat Mr. Hicks did kno w that,                 I

d o n ' t know, b u t it cer t a i n l y was no t as p r o m i n e n t in our

minds,    in m y mind,       beca u s e w e only found o u t later whe n

we started reviewing the videos and so on.

         He did e x p l a i n to us tha t his b e s t e s t i m a t e he

t h o u g h t wa s w h a t he gave to L o r d J u s t i c e T a y l o r w h e n

he sa t dow n later o n and t ried to w o r k it o u t and I think,

if I remem b e r rightly,          t hat was a b o u t 10-to,       or thereabouts.

         The o t h e r thing is Mr.         Hicks gave ver y graphic

des c r i p t i o n s of people he could see distressed,                 parti—

c u l a r l y an elde r l y g e n t l e m a n in grey,    I think.       He also

told us w h e n he e v e n t u a l l y left his position,             he was

going towards the p e n and then he sa w his d a u g h t e r b e i n g

 taken across and he b a c k - t r a c k e d and w e n t o u t through

 the little gate.

plenty of witnesses who had g reat d ifficulty w i t h r emembering

the e xact points in time,             b u t you will have to decide

w h e t h e r in fact Mr.     Hicks saw that gentleman w h o m he

describes from the p o s ition where he was, w h i c h is w h a t

he said,       or w h e t h e r perhaps bear i n g in m i n d that those

pens were full of people,              not as full as the centre pens

b u t they still had,         we know that the s trip along Pen 2

alongside Pen 3 was 0.5 p e r metre,                  five people in 10 square

metres w h i c h was the c a p a c i t y loading.             You will have to

mak e up your m i n d about that.

         In fact it is right to say t hat Mr. Hicks is the

man w h o gives the e a r l i e s t time,          as I have already

indicated,       of anyb o d y for serious distress.

         We heard fro m Mr. Motson.                He w a s up on top of the

South Stand and the fascin a t i n g thing a b o u t h i m is he

spot t e d that there was s o m e t h i n g unusual b u t w h a t he

s p o t t e d w a s the d i s c r e p a n c y b e t w e e n the o u t e r and the

centre pens an d w h a t he n o t e d was t h a t the o u t e r pens

w e r e empty.      He d i d n o t not i c e t hat the inner pens w e r e

overcrowded.         W h a t he w a n t e d w a s t hat all of t h e m sh o u l d

look like Pens 3 and 4 a n d tha t is w h y he w o u l d not refer

to "full capacity".             T h a t is a v e r y i m p o r t a n t p o i n t

b e c a u s e if tha t is right,        if that is w h a t t hey sh o u l d

have looked like,          then to a n o t h e r o b s e r v e r t hey m a y also

no t have looked overcrowded.

         Mr.    C u r r y w h o w a s in the same s o r t of location

but lower down,         he says tha t w h e n he s a t d own he got

his binoculars out and h ad-a look and remember we got a

pair to try and m a t c h so that you could have a look.

He said that he had spotted,                I t hink he said at about

quarter-to,       quite early in fact,            that a corner,         o r the

p a r t of Pen 3 looked crowded,              he could see that the

people were       looking be h i n d them and he made a comment

to the man next to him,             he said:        "I think there are

going to be problems ove r there" or words to that effect.

         He w e n t on to say that things did see m to take

a sudden turn for the worse when the players came out

and he also looked at several p hotographs and at the sort

of time w h i c h he m e n t i o n e d and he agreed that those p h o t o ­

graphs di d not appear to give the same impact that-he had

seen b u t he q u alified it by sa y i n g he was n o t looking at

tha t p a r t of the pen,         he ha d bee n looking a t the corner

n e x t to Pen 2, tha t little             t r i angle n ear the front.

         There is a w i t n e s s w h o d i d notice w h a t he c o nsidered

to be some p r o blems a t a r e l a t i v e l y e arly s tage in the

p r o c e e d i n g s and c e r t a i n l y in a p a r t i c u l a r l y localised

                                   W e h e a r d fro m Hr. W ells
                                                                                 73




        We have heard       from Mr. Wells and Mr. Gillara and

Mr.    Eason.      They were at the Spion Kop,          at the two corners,

and they were looking across.                We also heard from another

gentleman who was an ambulanceman who was                in the catering

department,       earning some extra money          I suppose.      Me looked

down at about kick-off             time.   He went    in and said,    "Don't

bother to hurry.            They will have to postpone the match,"

because he could see the people coming over.                     It was only

subsequently that he realised there w ere injuries.                    He

said,    "I saw them carrying          injuries."      He used an unusual

.turn of phrase.

        Mr.   Eason,     who was    the ambulance man,    and again who had

no p a r t i c u l a r duties - I am not s u g g e s t i n g that for a moment

- but he noticed          things around    kick-off    time and he walked

down    to have a look to see wha t was going on.                He went down

to the gate A area.            Whe n he got d o w n   there some time after

he still - and now I think the situation changes                   because he

is no w going down as a man to look w h e t h e r h e l p is needed.

A f t e r all, he is amb u l a n c e chap.     He can assess injuries.

He mad e a very i nteresting ob s e r v a t i o n     that even when he got

down    there,    there w ere people on the p i t c h and they were

walking about,         he did not see any serious problems.             When

h e was c hallenged w i t h one of the photog r a p h s h e said,           "I

don't see anybody p a r t i c u l a r l y s e riously injured walk i n g

around out there.*'           Of course it all changed within a very,

very short       time.     I think it is significant,        and one of the
witnesses, whose evidence you do have to take into account,

that here was a man,         and Gillam and Wells                    to a certain

extent    as well,    who had injury,            if you like,           in mind,    as

opposed    to anything else and             their evidence seems to be that

it wasn't immediately apparent to them and even with

Mr.   Eason,   when he got relatively close.                         Of course it did

not take long after that             for him to twig but we are only

talking in many cases about minutes                     or maybe even seconds.

You must remember that.               All this time sequence is very,

very quick.        Look how long it is taking me to do this

summing-up.        I thought I would almost have finished by now

so time is a difficult           thing to estimate.

       L u n c h time n o w though.          I can estimate that!

                          (L u n c h e o n a d j o u r n m e n t )

       I want to turn for a few minutes                     to the gaces

themselves,     gates 3 and 4.

      Before I deal w i t h the gates                I have to ment i o n the

barrier,    this barr i e r in pen 3, I had over l o o k e d that.                       I

did try and call a number of witnesses who appeared to have

b een close to the barr i e r w h i c h b r o k e . .            Yo u may think that

if you compare       the two pens,         as I have already said              the

b a r r i e r that broke is the one very big d i f f e r e n c e betw e e n

pen 3 and pen 4 and also the barrier w h i c h was                       removed up at

the top,    144, was anot h e r difference.
        My personal feeling was that that barrier,                   a l t hough it

may have made      the inflow of people        that much easier into the

terracing,     indirectly may perhaps have led to the barrier

1 24 . A breaking.      I am not entirely convinced - I would have

thought it was pretty tenuous because the most direct

barrier which should have broken was              the one immediately

b e l o w it - if you remember there was a very long stretch

down - and     that one did not break,         fortunately.            It seems
                                                  i

to me that the breaking of the b a r r i e r almost c e r tainly must

have - even from the point of view of "how" - played a very

important part in the d i sparity in the number of deaths

between pens 3 and 4.           Also if you consider           the

d ist r i b u t i o n of the people who died you will r e collect that

a very substantial number were in the vicinity of that

barrier that broke and in the v i c i n i t y of the gates,                so

there is      a double aspect there.          Also,   if       you think back to

what Mr.      Gre e n w o o d said, h e said it       looked            to him asif

there was a longitudinal          cut across          the pen;         people in

front of      that b a r r i e r in a terrible        state,            people further

back,    in his judgment,      not so bad.

        The problem,    of course,     is trying to decide w h e n          the

barrier broke.         It has proved to be a very difficult

p r o b l e m to sort out.     I think at one point one might have

felt it mus t have been w hen B e a r d s l e y hit     the c r o s s b a r w h i c h

w o u l d h ave put it at a b o u t five m i n u t e s past.         However,     I
think in the light of some of the evidence it would be

difficult      to support that point of view.

        If I can just remind you of one or two of the people

who said something.               Mr.   Moore said he was not sure but it

was   sometime after kick-off.                I am just summarising it, of

course.        Mr. R. J. Thomas said he felt a sudden forward

movement and he was against a barrier.                   He identified

himself on the pitch at four minutes past three.                         If in

fact the barrier broke and he was against it as it would

sound,     then it must have broken before Beardsley hit the

c rossbar because you cannot be on the pitch and against the

barrier at one and the same time.                   Of course,     this assumes

that his identification             is correct.

        Mr. Gains,       the young man w h o spoke so fast,           he could

not remember the kick-off but he does                 remember that        the

b a r r i e r went so he is not m u c h use to us from the point o:

v i e w of e s t a b lishing a time.

       Mr.    H o llinrake des c r i b e d h o w the barrier went but did

not h e l p us m u c h on timing.            He r e collects   that it "gave"

initially,       and then it suddenly went.             He fell forward and

p r e s u m a b l y so did others       as well.

       Jus t as an aside,          it is, of course,      p o s s i b l e that   this

sudden "give",         and people losing their bala n c e and going

forward, may have bee n part and parcel of the surge that

w ent forward and did not come back.                  It cannot be the whole

e x p l a n a t i o n because   there wer e also peo p l e in pen 4 who
talked about surges coming forward and not coming back like

Mr.   Knowles,    so it cannot be the e xplanation but it may have

been a contributory       factor to the pe o p l e who were further

forward.

        Mr.   Smith similarly described     the barriers giving

slowly and then coll a p s i n g totally.       That fits      in very well

with what Dr. N i c holson was saying about complicated stuff,

if you remember,      that if you have a b o w on that bar,          he   said

the legs have got to be standing.            You cannot bend the bar

unless you have got the supports and it is only when - you

know,    once you put the bend in,       the barr i e r must have gone

after that.

        Mr.   Abbott identified himself on the terrace at two

minutes past three.         At the point when he did           that he said

he was not against       the barrier,    but he was making his way

towards it.        He thought he got to it within the next min u t e

or so and      the exhibit number on w h i c h this is seen is C.440.

        Mr. G r i ffiths who was a witness who had come with John

M c B r i e n if you can remember,   he also was near the barrier.

He a ssociated it w i t h Mr. B eardsley's      shot,    but

Mr. Griffiths'      timing e v i dence I think left quite a bit           to

be desired.        Again I mak e no cri t i c i s m of this.       I k n o w it

sounds as if I am b eing critical.           I am not.         If I had

been in their shoes I would not have k nown A from B,

ce r t a i n l y not as far as time is concerned,       I'm sure.
                                                                    78




     If you then look at these people.            W£ have got two

witnesses who identify themselves      on photographs with times.

One is Abbott at 15.02 in the pen but not against the

barrier.   The other one is Thomas on the pitch at 15.04.




               If those i d e n t i f ications   are
                                                                         79




If those identifications are right and we are satisfied

w i t h the timings,    then the barrier must have gone in that

two minute time interval,        in other words sometime into the

m atch but before the end and before Mr. Beardsley hit the

crossbar.     It is important beca u s e it fi^es,        I think,   a

time at w hich the situation in Pen 3 at least probably

became totally i r r e trievable because of the inevitable

collapse of people forward onto each other and the

compaction which,       from all the evidence w h i c h we have

heard,    then occurred,    and it also helps us to a certain

extent w ith regard to sorting out the pathological

evidence.     So that,    I think,   is all that I nee d to tell

you - all that I can tell you - w i t h regard to the

barrier.     I have already dealt w i t h other aspects re lating

to it earlier.

       I n o w want to talk brie f l y on the gates and we will

start w i t h Gate 3.     We w ere f o r tunate w i t h reg a r d to this

gate because we actually were able to find about four

people who a p p eared to have been right in or at the gate,

namely Mr.    Sephton,    Mr.   Singleton,    young Mr.   Case and his

dad.     You will remember that bas i c a l l y the accounts were

all very,    ver y similar,     that they had taken up their

positions    early,    they had no t m oved from it.       Mr.

S i ngleton said that every t h i n g was okay u ntil 14.50 or

thereabouts,     then pushing began.         It got re a l l y bad at

kick-off - it fits in w i t h the accounts of n e a r l y
everybody else - he was worr i e d but not for his life,                 he

said,    just before the gate sprung open.             The upshot of the

accounts,    particularly when you couple it w i t h the

accounts of P.C.      Cooper and P.C.       Taylor was        that the gate

sprang open as opposed to being opened.                The design of the

lock,    it was not designed to spring open,             it just happened

to do it because as Dr.         Eastwood explained to us it was a

specially designed quick release lock,                and if you get the

angle slightly wrong it will open perhaps a little bit

quicker than you planned,          but that was a good thing as it

happens in this particular instance.

        On the first opening the Police Officers said that

more     than two or three came out and they quite clearly

said     that when they came out they caught them, so to

speak,    and put them back,       and that is exactly what the

lads said as well except that they did not remember

anybody coming out other than themselves.                  The evidence

from the Police Officers was            that there was no complaint

made about b eing put in and the Police Officers                  said that

they did' n o t have any p a r t i c u l a r d i f f i c u l t y getting them

back,    so to speak,     and shutting the gate.           The lads agreed

that there was no c o m plaint but they did say that it was a

bit m o r e d i f f i c u l t to get them bac k in.

        The second thing that was said,            and this    is why    I

think Gate 3 is r elatively straightforward,                  the gate then

opened a second time and a l t h o u g h there was slight
variation,       was it 10 seconds,         20 seconds,        30 seconds,    a

minute,     the substance of the evidence was                  that there was a

very short time interval between the two openings and

furthermore none of them said that the gate was shut after

that time.         It is true that they were walking away but

they were asked as to whet h e r they looked back - I am

talking about the lads now,              and also Mr.      Case senior.           I

wanted Mr.       Case to come because his son had referred to

the fact that when they came back in he suddenly turned to

his dad and said,           "I have got to get out of here,             dad",         or

words    to that effect,         and he tried to speak to the Officer

on the pitch.           The Officer,     the son said,         said something

like,    "It will sort itself out",              and he also was observed

to be using his radio.

         My u n d e r s t a n d i n g of wha t Mr.   S mith said,   when we

read his statement,           was that bas i c a l l y he does not

actually d i s p u t e the evide n c e w h i c h we have heard from the

lads.      The only substantial d i f f e r e n c e is that he thought

that the gate had opened three times and the lads only

r e m e m b e r e d it as twice.


        The one person's evidence that I did find very

d if f i c u l t to r e c oncile was S e r geant Green.          I k n e w that it

was di f f i c u l t   to rec o n c i l e his e v i d e n c e but I thought it

was r ight that you should hear it.                   He was    the c hap who

said he was in the gym - not Sergeant Swift's                       team - and

he was     told to go,       in fact he said to go to G ate A at
Leppings Lane and told to go across               the pitch because it

was quicker.        I find that a bit strange because if you

look at the plan,         to get to Gate A from the gym,           it cannot

be the quickest way to go across              the outside because you

have to come all the way round to the South Stand and then

back across past Gate C, past Gate B and round to Gate A,

and in addition to this his evidence was                that when he got

to Gate C --- he describes walk i n g round and the states of

the pens.       He says that Pen 6 was sparsely populated,                Pen

4 he didn't notice anything p a r t i cularly distre s s f u l about

the fans,     then he got to Gates 4 and 5 and I suppose the

most interesting        thing about his evidence is that he said

he met P.C.      Illingworth.        As he was coming down P.C.

Illingworth was going the o p p osite way,             and he did not

speak to him because it a p p eared to h i m that he was

preoccupied.        He then got to Gate 3 and having looked at

it decided it ought to be opened,              and in fact opened it

and people came out.             He said in his v i e w the pe o p l e who

came out at the initial stage were not seriously injured,

though one of the girls was distressed.


       The d i f f i c u l t y is fitting it in w i t h the e v i d e n c e of

the other Officers,            and there wer e three of them.         They

were all par t of Sergeant Swift's serial and they had all

wa l k e d down past the N orth Stand.          Sergeant Swift stopped

at the corner and they were spacing themselves out along

the p e r i m e t e r track.     They all,   of course,    had to w alk
past Pen 4 and n one of these three,    Cooper,   Taylor or

Packer stopped at that location.      They got to Gate 3 and

P.C.   Cooper describes how the gate burst open and ho w the

fans came out but were put back w h i c h fits in precisely

w it h what the lads said,   and then he said within 30

seconds of this he could see that the fans were

distressed,   the gate was opened - the lads said it burst

open - and people came out initially on their own and then

of course we k now that after that things got very,         very

much more difficult at that gate,     and he confirms     that he

was not told to do it, he just did it on his own

initiative.




                                              P.C.   Ta y l o r

Gate 4.       PC Taylor s aid at the time he c o u l d not see any

re a s o n w h y he should not put the lads,                 or the fans, w h o came

 out on that first opening b a c k although,                    of course,        in

retro s p e c t he w i s h e d he h a d not done so.                That I am a f r a i d

 is, of course,        som e t h i n g w h i c h we all do a n d no t just whe n w e

 are dealing w i t h m i n o r matters.            W e say,     "If only we h a d not

f o u n d somew h a t confusing.       He di d s eem to say at a r o u n d kick-

off he c o u l d hear noises f r o m the pen s w h i c h i n c l u d e d screams

and he saw girls p r e s s e d against the fence.                 W e are talk i n g

about Pen 4, of course.             He also sa w p e o p l e c l a m b e r i n g over

others were push i n g and s ignalling p e o p l e to get b a c k into

the pen.      He w ent on to say he wa s not at all s u r p r i s e d by

this.     It is wha t he w o u l d hav e expected.             On the o t h e r hand,

he d i d rec o g n i s e that the noise,        the cries,       was different.




                                              /He tried.
          He tried if you remember to reconcile these two

things and I think his e x p l a n a t i o n was that the people

wh o were coming over a p p e a r e d to him to be perfectly

okay and that a c t ually - except for one lad w h o was

vomiting - and that fits in w i t h Mr.                  Eason's accounts

as well at the initial              stage.

           He did not realise the d i s a s t e r had o c c urred until

the players had defin i t e l y left the p i t c h and just so

that we get it right Mr.               Illingworth's names are

David Alfred and not John.                   I thought at one stage his

mi d d l e name m i g h t have bee n John.

           No w we have a l r e a d y m e n t i o n e d S e r g e a n t Swift an d

           S e r g e a n t S wift h a d b een at the M i d l a n d Station w ith

his Serial.         T h e y had come across on a coach;                they had

d r i v e n p a s t L e p p i n g s Lane;   they h a d noti c e d the crowds

there but they had gone on to the g y m n a s i u m and I don't

           T h e y h a d b a r e l y got in.      "We got in" he said

"between 10-to and 5-to" w h e n t h e y w e r e told to go

on to the pitch.

           His i n t e n t i o n h a v i n g a s s e s s e d the s i t u a t i o n I think

wa s that this w a s p r o b a b l y an overspill,             t hat people

should be re l o c a t e d in P e n 6.

          He did not himself           I am talking about Sergeant

Swift     — open the gate.         That seems to have been done

by P.C.    Hooson and P.C.       Sosnowski.

          Their evidence was whe n they first wa l k e d past

the pen the players were clearly on the pitch,                    they were

not initially alarmed and the crowd as far as they could

see did not appear dist r e s s e d bu t then there was a surge

w h i c h did not retreat.        In fact P.C.      Sosnowski said when

she first saw the surge she t h o u g h t this was just the

normal thing that w o u l d happen.            It was the fact that

it did not go bac k - and remember this is the Pen 4

surge.
          Hr.   S p earritt said he did no t feel a surge,               he

just felt this vice like feeling b u t this could have

been a m o m e n t or two later.         We d o n ' t know w h e n Mr.        S p earritt

a c t u a l l y lost consciousness.

          We kno w that Mr. H o o s o n s a i d he was no t sure

w h e t h e r he o u g h t to o p e n the gate b e c a u s e he k new one

n e e d e d a u t h o r i t y b u t he e x p l a i n e d to us I think very

 c l e a r l y that that was not a m a t t e r w h i c h o c c u p i e d his

m i n d for long.      He saw the n e e d a n d he deci d e d he w o u l d

 go a h e a d and do w h a t e v e r he thou g h t was right.

           We k now f rom the p h o t o g r a p h s that a c t i v i t y was

 taking place at that p e n at 14.59 or thereabouts.

           I have a l r e a d y tol d y o u that the timings,          of course

 we kee p on a d j u s t i n g them, y o u k n o w one m i n u t e this w a y

 or that way,      b u t we have n o t g o t seconds so we d on't

 kn o w e x a c t l y w h a t time b u t it is the b e s t we c a n do.
                                                                             90




        All of these Officers are quite clear that when

they got there the gates were shut*             None of them,

Hooson; Sosnowski; Swift; Packer,           all of them said the

gates were shut.
        Mr. Illingworth was the official Track Officer

and you heard how he had gone off to have a meal at

about 2.     There was some d elay for various reasons and

then he heard that there were some problems in the

Leppings Lane end on the radio and decided to come back

to take up his position and he arrived,               he said,     at

about 10-to.       The teams at that time,         he said, were not

on the pitch,      so it m u s t have bee n before 6-minutes-to.

He spoke to P.C.       Helliwell he told us and his attention

w as d r a w n to some p r o blems at P e n 6 and indeed on C511,

time 14.54 yo u can see h i m an d he is in fact at Pen 6.

         His acco u n t is he s t a r t e d going b a c k to Pe n 4;

he heard cries of distress w h i c h w e r e q u i t e c l e a r to hia

that pe o p l e needed .help and he says that he in fact

op e n e d the gates a n d the first p e r s o n out was somebody who

had hur t his leg and o t h e r p e o p l e then came out.           It

was his int e n t i o n to es c o r t t h e m towards Pen 6 and 7

a n d he says that he o p e n e d the gates an d as far as

he was c o n c e r n e d he n e v e r s h u t them, b u t of course y o u

c an't be standing at all the gates.

           It is a m a t t e r for y o u to assess his e v i d e n c e but

it is on the face of it d i f f i c u l t to reconcile w i t h

Mr.   Hooson,    Mr. S w i f t and Mrs.   S o s n o w s k i ' s and indeed
                                                                                          91




Sergeant Swift because they said at about l-minute-to-3

the gates were not open and indeed he was not able to

reconcile it either,           I m ean P.C.       Illingworth.

          You will also remember that S e r geant Green

refers to h i m as hurrying in fact towards Pen 4 b u t from

the opposite d i r ection and on the last v ideo w h i c h we

looked at,      I think you can a c t u a l l y see him m o v i n g b a c kward

and forward between the pens but at a rather later time

than he has indicated in his statement.

          N o w his timing is p r o b a b l y just as bad as e v erybody

else's.      The one thing that can be said w i t h any certainty

is that he was at Pe n 6 w h e n the play e r s came out and that

fits in w i t h his acco u n t that he was told there were

problems up in the Stands and indeed he looks as if

he is looking up.

          If that is so then it is q u i t e p o s s i b l e that the

escorting and so on w h i c h he talks a b o u t o c c u r r e d at some

time s o m e w h a t later than w h a t he describes.

          He also sai d that he could no t r e m e m b e r any o ther

Officers there bu t he is not the o n l y witn e s s w h o m we

heard w h o c ould n o t r e m e m b e r w h a t on v i d e o a n d p h o t o g r a p h i c

ev i d e n c e w o u l d s e e m to be s e l f - e v i d e n t a n d I just instance

one name a n d it is Mr. D o y l e w h o also c o u l d n o t see any

O f f icers and he c ould no t see the gate ope n a n d y e t there

is clear p h o t o g r a p h i c e v i d e n c e of h i m s t a nding o n the

fence n e x t to O f f icers n e x t to an o p e n gate, Gat e 3.

           I d on't b lame hi m for that.              D o n ' t get me wrong.
                                                              92




He remembers like most of us the bits which are important

to him or to me or to you and it is for you to piece it

together and to sort it out.

       Now the real issue is that one has to - while we

are on these Gate Officers — is to consider whether or

not what was happening and in considering this matter you

have to take into account that there is no evidence that

they were aware of the fact that Gate C had been opened and

that there was an influx of people on to the concourse

and from the concourse towards the terracing and probably

a substantial number through the tunnel.




                         They had no part in that decision ►
        They had no part in that d e c ision and they were not

involved in it in any way.

        You have got     to take into account what the evidence of

the supporters within          the terraces is*, which I have already

recounted     to you and w hich I am not going to repeat.                       You

have got to take into account              the fact     that c e rtainly        as far

as PC Illingworth was concerned he was distracted                        to a

certain extent by what was going on on the stands in pen 6.

You have got      to take into account           the overall        time that was

a v ailable for assessment,           d e c i s i o n and action.

        A lot has been said wit h regard,             indeed,       to everybody,

that there was noth i n g specific in the O p e ration O rder about

m o n i t o r i n g the pens for o v e r crowding and we hav e already

d i s c u s s e d that earlier.       However,    I do want to d r a w your

at t e n t i o n to the fact that all these Officers who m we hav e

mentioned,     part i c u l a r l y the Sergeants of       the Serials and,

indeed,    there are others,          there is PC McGuinness and PC Best

and so on.        T hey all in fact acted w i t h i n a very short

period of time of their arriving on the scene and they all

a cted i n d e p e n d e n t l y and they all a c t e d w i t h a v i e w to

o pen i n g gates in order        to relieve w h a t e v e r   the s i t u a t i o n was

and h o w e v e r it had b e e n caused.

        As far as    those Officers c e r t a i n l y are c o n c e r n e d - I am

t alking about the ones who c ame a l o n g - there cannot,                     in my

view,    be any q u e s t i o n that their conduct can be called into

q u e s t i o n in any way.
        In a moment or two I am going to turn to the Control

Room staff,       but before      I do so I want    to dispose of,       if that

is the right expression,            of Mr. Mackrell,      to a certain

extent Mr.      Lock,       and Superintendent Greenwood.

       I have already d ealt to a large extent with the

e vidence relating to Mr.           Mackrell and the relationship of

the club to the Officers'            Working Party,     the Police,      various

people,     and you will remember that I dealt w ith that.                   In

fact you will also remember that I dealt w ith the situation

of those people who were not at the ground in r e l ation to

your consid e r a t i o n of the first verdict and the fact that

you should not - and            this will m a k e your life easier - need

to w o r k your way through these various people such as,                   for

instance,      Sheffield City Council or Dr. Eastwood.

       No w the club,         to a large extent,    is in exactly the same

position,      but they were,       of course,   present on the day

b e c a u s e it was their ground and that is why I need to deal

with it.

       You would only be able to consider              the club if (1)

Mr. M a c krell was the e m bodiment of the company,              w h i c h I have

d e s c r i b e d to you;    and (2) if his acts or omi s s i o n s were of

such a nature as to e n a b l e you to c o n s i d e r the p o s s i b i l i t y

that he had acted r e c k l e s s l y and therefore a verdict in

r esp e c t of some or all of the p e o p l e of unla w f u l l y killed

m i g h t be considered as a result of his acts or omissions,

assuming,      of course,       that you have got to the fact that
       As far as the track Officers are concerned,                      the

position as far as I can see it seems                       to me to be as

follows.        Whether or not they acted as fast as they might

have done is e xceedingly             difficult       to be absolutely sure

about.         However,      the time interval,             as I have already

indicated to you,          if you accept all the rest of the

evidence,      within which they had to act and the circumstances

within which they had to act,                was relatively short.            It

seems to me it would be exceedingly d i fficult for you to

come to the view that these Officers had acted recklessly in

regard to their duties             to the people who were standing

oppos i t e them within the terrace.                   You remember what      the

d e f i n i t i o n of that is.       T h e r e must be an obvious and

serious ris k of injury.               Namely,      first,      that the act or

omission w hich they pe r f o r m e d caus i n g an obvious and serious

risk of injury and two,             if you were        to take that view,       and      I

suggest her e that it may             be d i fficult        to take that view

bear i n g in mind you hav e          to be s a t isfied        beyond reasonable

doubt,    you would also have to be s a t isfied that their state

of mind was either they were i ndifferent                       to the ris k or that

they recognised         the risk but n e v e r t h e l e s s went on to take

it.      I think you may h ave very su b s t a n t i a l d i f f i c u l t i e s    in

r e a c h i n g those co n c l u s i o n s w i t h regard   to these Officers.

       I think that is all I need to remind you of w i t h regard

to the gates.           We will b r e a k now for ten minutes.

                               (Short a d j o u r n m e n t )
there was a duty to act and that he failed and that whatever

he did or did not do was a substantial cause of the death.

        Now my u n d e rstanding of the evidence in relation to

Mr. Mackrell on the day is that he did not - and I do not

mean this unkindly - he did not feature until about three

o'clock,     or perhaps a little bit earlier,           when he met Mr.

Lock and he was told that people had got through the

concertina gate.          I fact Mr.    Lock was on his way to find

out what was going on and Mr.           Mackrell apparently said to

him,    "Leave it to me,      I will go and sort it out."            The

exact time when this happened is difficult,                but if you

remember Mr. Locked remembered while he was giving evidence

that he remembered Mr. Cl o u g h coming out.              This was on his

first exiting on to the field beca u s e Mr. Lock came out

twice.       Of course we k n o w from other evidence,          m a i n l y as a

result of Superintendent Greenwood             that Mr. Cl o u g h and     the

videos came out just be f o r e kick-off.

        There are quite a lot of d i s c r e p a n c i e s betw e e n h i m and

Mr.    L o c k in the sense that Mr. M a c k r e l l says he walked

round,    c ould not really see anything,          chatted to the gatemen

and then went       to the Control Box to find out what had

happened.        Mr. Mackrell says he met hi m a second            time.         It

is very dif f i c u l t to fit that second m e e t i n g in if

Mr. Mackr e l l ' s e v i dence is spot on, unless        that second

m e e t i n g was at some c o n s i d e r a b l y later period of time.
                                                                                     97




        It seems     to me,   therefore,       that w h a tever involvement,

or otherwise,       Mr. M a c krell may have had on the day,                 it was

minimal,     or,   to put it anot h e r way,         it was after the events

had occurred,       whatever those events were,               w hich had caused,

led or contributed          to the disaster.            I am sure he was very

busy before        that doing things which needed to be done in the

normal running of a big            football match in seeing              to the

people who were        there, making sure           that everything

a d ministratively worked right,             but he did not seem to fulfil

or perf o r m any function in relation to crowd control,

opening of gates,         superv i s i o n of terraces or a n y t h i n g like

that.

        As I have already indicated to you,                  although I have no

doubt there is plenty of room for cri t i c i s m of the club in

resp e c t of signing,        or lack of it, and various other

matters,     they did seem to be in the situation where they nad

(a) instructed a p r o f e s s i o n a l e n g i n e e r of c o m p e t e n c e to

advise and h e l p them,         (b)   they had a r r a n gements wit h tne

P o l i c e in order to try and police            the matches and (c)            they

were caught by the Officers'               W o r k i n g Party,   w hich had

inspec t i o n s and gave advice and d i r e c t i o n s as to w hat they

should do.          T h e r e was no evidence that I could see that

they s u b s t a n t i a l l y failed in these regards to suc h an extent

that their failure could be d e scribed                  as falling wi t h i n the

d e f i n i t i o n w h i c h we hav e already c o n s i d e r e d several times.

In o ther words,        their earlier conduct,            as I have said there
may well be ground for criticisms in certain respects,                          but

it is one thing to hav e a ground for criticism,                        it is

another to be         satisfied beyond reas o n a b l e doubt that a

person has been reckless.                Even more important,            you have

got to be satisfied that             those acts or inactions were

causative,      substantially causative,             of the deaths.

        As I say,      the club is behind,         if that is the right

word,    Mr. Mackrell.          If one cannot be satisfied that there

is evidence on w hich one could find that his acts or

omissions could be such as to enable a reasonable jury

properly directed to find a verdict of unlawfully killed in

respect of any one or more of the deceased and by d e f i n i t i o n

it cannot be found against the club.

        Therefore,      I think it is right and proper                  that I should

direct you that as far as the corporations are concerned,

that would be Sheffield City, E a s twood and Co.,                      and

Sh e ffield Wed n e s d a y Football Clu b pic.,              that you should not

c o n s i d e r them as parties in respect of w hose conduct you

need    to weight whether or not a verd i c t of u n l a w f u l l y killed

is a p p l i c a b l e in respect of any one of the deceased.

        N o w let's    turn to Sup e r i n t e n d e n t Greenwood.

S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Gre e n w o o d was, of course,   one of the se n i o r

m a t c h Commanders.        He was r e s p o n s i b l e for the inside of           the

ground.       We have alre a d y dealt wit h some of the h i s t o r y

that he     told us about 1981 and I am not going                   to w eary you

w i t h a d e t ailed r e c i t a t i o n of his evidence,        but    the
                                                                               99




substance of it is this,        that he, having given appropriate

instructions - well,       ha v i n g given instructions to staff,             he

busied himself wi t h i n the stadium.         One of the areas which

concerned him p a r t i c u l a r l y was the Kop,    because of the

potential of segregation problems w hich was based upon

previ o u s experience.        He told us that as far as he was

concerned he pera m b u l a t e d the ground at twenty minutes            to

three,    or thereabouts,    or perhaps a little bit earlier.                   He

certainly had got,      he said,    to L e p pings Lane,      inside of

course,    the terraces,    at about quarter         to,   that he had

spoken to PC Helliwell,        that at that point in time there was

nothing on the terraces w h i c h had alerted his attention,

that he had continued round the ground round the North

Stand, had finished u p at the Kop, was consid e r i n g d oing

something about some p r o b l e m there and then r e a l i s e d that

the players were about to come on to the field and that his

position, w h i c h is w here he had wan t e d to be anyway,         was at

the players'    tunnel and then he w e n t there.




                   You know that in fact
                                                                   '100




You know that in fact he was identified on video at just

before kick-off when Mr.      Clough comes out,       and he is seen

looking in towards ---       well, you did not see the video so

you d o n ’t know this but he is at that position at one-

minute- to-3.

      He then told us that shortly         thereafter his attention

was attracted to Leppings Lane Terraces.              He went over and

as you will remember      there was a whole series of

photographs in w hich he is traced,          from about 2-minutes-

past to about 6 - m i n u t e s - p a s t , doing various things in and

around the terracing,      and in part i c u l a r Gate 3.   He was

quite clear in his evidence that when he first got there

he still thought the p o s ition was r etrievable if he could

have only got the people in,          shall we say,    the three

quarters of the pen ~ if you divide the pen into four

segments like HSE did,      Dr. Ni c h o l s o n - then his evidence

is that the first quarter was the area - in fact,               I think

he said six or seven steps,          in fact it is a bit m ore was

w here the real problem was,         that if he could have got

p eople to m o v e bac k he thought it was retrievable.

W h e t h e r he is right in that,    of course,   is another

question,   bearing in min d that the barr i e r m i g h t well have

broken by then,     though of course that was s o mething w h i c h

he could no t have known beca u s e it w ould hav e not been

something w h i c h was visi b l e to him.
        He did not send people straight round into the back

of the terrace and it may be that we can sit n o w and

consider    that,   as to whet h e r that was,       in fact --- maybe

it would have been a better policy.                His objective was      to

try and get people        to mov e back and it was clear from the

evidence of quite a lot of the fans that they understood

that,    they knew that the Police wanted them to mov e back.

Quite a lot I think felt that they could not mov e back and

others,    there was at least one who said he did not

u nderstand why he should m o v e back,           but whate v e r the ins

and outs of the compr e h e n s i o n the mess a g e was conveyed,            it

was just that for w h a t e v e r reason it was not actioned.

        He told us very sadly that things in fact went                 from

bad to worse and he realised after a few moments                   that   the

game had to be stopped and that there was a m a j o r crisis.

A lot of c r i t i c i s m I think has been m a d e as to w h e t h e r or

not he had organised a conve y o r belt system to get people

in and out of the gate, w h e t h e r he should hav e don e this,

that or the third thing w i t h regard to the rescue but even

if you were to take the v i e w —              and that in fact things

w ere not org a n i s e d until a witness who m we have not

actually h e a r d but who has sort of lurked around in the

background,     namely Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Nesbit,   turned up

and got things organised.

        You have h eard the evidence,           you can m a k e your own

judgm e n t and a s s e s s m e n t on that,   but I do just w a n t to say
                                                                     •102




this,    that passage of time sometimes makes organisation

easier and what may be possible at 12 or 15 minutes - p a s t - 3

may not n ecessarily have been possible at 2 or 3-minutes-

past-3.

        That is the first thing and the second thing is that

if you come upon a situation w h i c h was horrific in the

extreme,    not just for the poor families who have lost

relatives but also for a lot of people who were injured,                   a

lot of people who were not injured - I am talking about

the fans now,     the people within the pen - but also

horrific in the extreme for the people who were engaged in

the rescue activity,      it is not always quite as easy as we

imagine to think on your feet and come up w i t h the

absolute best solution.

        So we have to be careful,      but even if you were to

take the v i e w that there was some failure in this regard,

and perhaps    I should just m e n t i o n one of the"interesting

things about Mr. Greenwood was         that he did not assess        the

crowd density,     certainly in the three quarters of the pen,

I will call it,     as s i g n ificantly dif f e r e n t from w hat he

had seen earlier,     and yet we kno w almost c e r t a i n l y that it

was.    All we nee d to do is look at p h o t o g r a p h s and we can

see it, but even if he m ade a complete e rror of judgment

w i t h regard to densities,    and it would seem as if he must

have done bearing in min d wha t we have n o w seen,          there is

n o t a shred of e v i dence that he was a ware of the situation
                                                                        103




outside in Leppings Lane or the opening of the gates,                  or

that he had been informed of that by anyone.                Radio was on

talk-through,    that is true,      so he could have heard what

was being said but we also heard that there was a great

deal of noise.      We heard that he told us that he did not

hear it and we have heard no evidence               to suggest that

that,    in fact, was not so.

        There was one other item of evidence,            of course,    and

that is the question of whether or not he was on the

Police Control Box steps.         You will remember        that this was

the evidence of Mr. Hicks.          He said he saw an Officer with

gold braid cap,     light c o l o u r e d jacket,    standing on the

steps at about - I can't r e m ember the exact time but well

before kick-off - about 10-to,          I think he said it was -

who surveyed the scene for three,           four minu t e s and then

left,    and that he,   Mr.   Hicks,   had a t t empted to attract

this Officer's attention.         This Officer had said nothing

to him, w h o e v e r this Officer m i g h t have been.         There was

another one,    an Inspector later on, when there was some

exchange of conversations,        but the first O f f i c e r said

nothing.

        Mr. Hicks at that time did no t know,           of course,    who

this Offi c e r was but subsequently,        in fact,     he told us on

around 30t h May,    that is about six weeks           later,    he

ha p p e n e d to w a l k round a corner and he saw Mr.         Greenwood,

and he said,    "That's   the chap".       I think it is right to
                                                                             104




say that Hr.       Hicks'   evidence has hardened wit h regard to

the identification.           He feels more confident         today than he

did in 1989.

        Apart from that there is no evidence that

Superintendent Greenwood was in or near the Control Box.

All the people in the Control Box who were asked all said

they did not see him there.           He did not wear a gold

braided cap.        Mr. Hicks e x p lained that that might have

been the sunlight on the silver.             He certainly did not

wear a fawn coloured anorak and it is difficult                   to see how

he could have been on the steps at the time when Mr.                       Hicks

says,    if he was at the players'         tunnel at the time when

the players came out,          and it certainly would have meant

that Mr.    Greenwood would not have done his wal k round,                   if

that is the right word,          Leppings Lane,      N orth Stand,        Spion

Kop,    players'    tunnel.     That w ould have been impossible.

        I have c a refully c o n s i d e r e d this and I feel that it

w ould be unwise and in fact incorrect for you to rely on

Mr.    Hicks'   i d e ntification of Superin t e n d e n t Greenwood.          1

am quite sure that Mr. Hicks is genuine in w hat he says

but given what I have indicated to you and the total lack

of other s ubstantial evide n c e w h i c h in any way supports

it, and the risk of relying upon i d e n t i f i c a t i o n evidence

w h i c h in itself has a d m itted flaws in it, b e c a u s e Mr.

Hicks quite clearly agrees          that on the p h o t o g r a p h i c

evidence he is not w e a r i n g a fawn c o l o u r e d anorak,           it is a
standard Police issue job w h i c h is either black or dark

blue,    so on that basis I do not think that you can rely on

it, and in the light of what I have told you w i t h regard

to the rest of the evidence I think it is only right that

I should say that when you come to consider persons whose

conduct you may w ish to take into c o n s ideration as to the

possibility of u n lawfully killed,         S u p erintendent Greenwood

is somebody else whom you m ust exclude from your

consideration because no reasonable Jury in my view,

properly directed,      could p o s sibly come to the conclusion

that he acted in a manner r ecklessly and that a verdict

can be found on the basis of the evidence w h i c h you have

heard.

        I should just pause here,       because there is a risk and

I have consi d e r e d this at great length and it has given me

a c o n s i derable amount of concern,      that when I go through

these various people and say exclude him,             do not think

about him,    exclude the companies,        exclude Dr.     Eastwood,

exclude so and so, you may get the i m pression that if I do

not say excl u d e "x" and "y" I am actually saying you must

find a v e r d i c t of u n l a w f u l l y killed in respect of the

people who m I have not excluded.           I h ave to dea l w i t h that

n o w and I am going to deal w i t h that n o w b e c a u s e it is

n e c e s s a r y for you to u n d e r s t a n d your role and my role in
                                                                            i06




       A l t h o u g h questions of fact are for you,      as I have

already said,    questions of law are for me and oddly enough

the question of whether or not there is any evidence which

a reasonable jury properly d i r ected could r each a

particular verdict on is a question of law for me,                  and

that is why I am doing it this way,           but I am conscious

that there are maybe in some of the cases w here there are

issues w hich you can consider.         If I had not thought that

I would have w i thdrawn the verdict completely from you,

but that is not the same as saying          that is the verdict you

have to bring in, because if it were,            and this is the

point,   in any court where a judge does not w i t h d r a w a case

from the jury,       because what I am doing is what any judge

would do in c i r c umstances    like this,    in any case where a

judge does not w i t h d r a w the v e r d i c t from the jury,      the

jury w ould have to bring in a guilty v e r d i c t if this was a

criminal    trial,   and you know as wel l as I do that is not

the case.     All it means is that there is something                that

you can think about.       You have to think about it,             you have

to apply the c r i teria w h i c h I have already told you -

satisfied be y o n d r e asonable doubt,    single person,         obvious

and serious risk,      indifference,    re c o g n i s i n g and d e c ision

to take it - I am doing it in shorthand as quic k l y as I

can,   but I will repeat it for you tomorrow.              So I neit h e r

direct you one way or the other w i t h re g a r d to the

verdict.    I may express a v i e w in some cases but in the
                                                                107




end those w h i c h I leave w i t h you are your d e c ision and you

take w h a t e v e r decision you want.   Is that clear?




                                          Because of the way
        B eca u s e of the w a y I have done it,                 in some ways,         of

course,     we h ave a l r e a d y c o v e r e d q uite a bi t of w h a t happens

is an e x - s u p e r i n t e n d e n t as we know.

        The s e c o n d p o i n t tha t arises is tha t there is no doubt

he gave a briefing.             W e hav e h e a r d f rom m a n y of the Officers

w h o were t here and we h e a r d h i m r e a d a section of that

b r i e f i n g to us and you m a y r e c o l l e c t there was clear

reference to the importance - in fact he u s e d the words

p a r a m o u n t importance I think,             b u t eve n if he d i d not - there

was certainly a strong r e f e r e n c e to the safety of the

spectators.         It is c lear if you t hink of Mr.                     Sykes an d others

tha t that h a d come across.

        T he quest i o n yo u n e e d to ask y o u r s e l v e s is, w o u l d it

        A t h i r d p o i n t w h i l e w e are on this,             and I have already

a l l u d e d t o it m e r e l y w i t h r e g a r d t o th e o p e n i n g of t h e gates,

o r d e r issues a n d tha t c o n s e q u e n t l y safety m a t t e r s w e r e less

important.           Therefore,     w h e n a safety issue a rose on the pen

the r e a c t i o n was,     p i t c h invasion,      ra t h e r t han overspill,           if

you like, p u t t i n g it v e r y simply.

        I think there is some j u s t i f i c a t i o n in t h a t and indeed

Mr. M a r s h a l l d ealt w i t h it at one stage w h e n this was p u t an d

he said,      "Yes,      it is quite true b u t w h y do w e n e e d 800 o d d

Police Force for the w h o l e of S o u t h Y o r k s h i r e n e v e r m i n d

S h e f f i e l d - "and w h y do we n e e d t h a t m a n y Po l i c e O f f i c e r s to

                                         / You h a v e a l s o heard.
                                                                                     115




         You have also heard,            and again I am going to deal

w i t h this now at this stage,           that there was a conversation

in the Control R oom at some p oint in fact later on where

Mr.   Kelly was pres e n t and w h e r e Mr. D u c k e n f i e l d is

reported,     Mr.   Bich a r d reports it and Mr. Jackson half

reports it,      that there was some reference to the fact

that the gates had "burst open".                  This was o b v iously a

m a t t e r of great m o m e n t to e s t a b l i s h this p a r t i c u l a r fact.

          I had considerable d i f f iculties about this ma t t e r

and I spent quite a bit of time c onsidering w h e t h e r or

not I o ught to allow the q u e s t i o n to be asked at all

because it is p e r f e c t l y c lear to me,          and I hope it will

be clear to you,         that w h a t e v e r he m a y have said wit h

r egard to "gates b u r s t i n g open" and w h e t h e r that is right

o r w r o n g an d w h e t h e r o r no t he a d d e d any q u a lificatio ns

and assume for a m o m e n t tha t he a dded none, Mr. Bichard

did n o t say he did n o t add any,             he said:       "I h e a r d a

snippet a n d I remember that b u t I don't r e m e m b e r anyth ing

else" b u t let us assume for a m i n u t e t hat he a dded no

further qu a l i f i c a t i o n s that that is all he s aid a t that

time at the p o i n t in time w h e n he a l r e a d y knew that the

m a i n o p e n i n g s h a d b e e n authorised.

           It seems p e r f e c t l y p l a i n to me an d it m a y well seem

p l a i n to y o u that e v e n on that assumption,              that stat ement

d i d n o t cause a n y b o d y 's d e a t h b e c a u s e b y the time it was

m a d e the dye,     if I can use that term,             ha d b e e n cast,     so

 the inc l u s i o n of that s t a t e m e n t does not en a b l e y o u to

 d ecide h o w the p e o p l e died.        So w h y d i d I a l l o w it?
                                                                                         116




Why did I allow this p a r t i c u l a r q u e stion to be asked?

The answer is because I was in the end per s u a d e d that it

did go to the issue to wha t ext e n t you can accept his

a ccount of events.           In o t h e r words it goes to establishing

w het h e r or not the qual i t y of his evidence is one w hi ch

you wish to believe.

          Now there are two points about this.                        You could say,

and I am proceeding on the a s sumption that that was not

right,     incorrect,       and that is all          that was said because

I wan t to deal w ith it at its highest level rather than

 "Yes, but m a y be he a dded som e t h i n g else and he m a y have

 been telling the story and the o n l y thing I have remember

 was this little bit."              W e will assume for the purposes

 of this summing-up that in fact that is not so,                           that that

 was a st a t e m e n t w h i c h was n o t true a t the time.

           Two things a b o u t it.           F i r s t of all because a pe r s o n

 does not tell the truth at p o s i t i o n B does not n e c e s s a r i l y

 m e a n that he has also lied at p o s i t i o n A a n d therefo re

 a l t h o u g h it is o b v i o u s l y a v e r y serious m a t t e r a n d yo u

 have to w e i g h and consider the e v i dence v e r y car e f u l l y

 an d you m a y nee d to look v e r y ca r e f u l l y to see w h e t h e r

 there is any c o r r o b o r a t i o n a n d w h e t h e r the accounts of

 w h a t h a p p e n e d b e f o r e are c o n s i s t e n t w i t h w h a t you kno w

 fro m o ther sources w h i c h is one of the reasons w h y I have

 sort of gone r ound the houses to g e t to this position,

 at the e n d of the day y o u m a y come to the v i e w that:

  "Yes,   oka y eve n g i v e n that^I a m still s a t i s f i e d that

  the rest of the acco u n t is s u b s t a n t i a l l y correct",               or
you could of course come to the vie w that we cannot

a ccept it.        That is a m a t t e r w h i c h you have to decide

and in thinking about this of course you also have to

put yourself into the sit u a t i o n in w h i c h he was at the

time     both        before the disaster,                 during the disaster

and after the disaster w hen this conversation is

supposed to have taken place.

           Now I have dealt w i t h this at some length because

I think it is n e cessary that we grasp this nettle and

under s t a n d w h a t it does not do and w h a t it does do,

and I hope I have been r e a s o n a b l y clear.

           No w then I have already d e a l t w i t h his account,

his briefing,          an d I d on't n e e d to repeat w h a t I have

s aid w i t h regard to that.

           He took u p a p o s i t i o n in the Control R o o m w h i c h

is not the p o s i t i o n w h i c h Mr. M o l e w o u l d have taken up.

Mr. M o l e w o u l d have p o p p e d in as far as I can m a k e his

evidence o u t b u t he w o u l d n o t have b e e n there cont i n u o u s l y

b u t he wa s an d Mr. M u r r a y d e s c r i b e d it as a "classical

position"        a n d you m a y feel in itself the fac t that he

di d not roam quite so m u c h as Mr. M o l e that that ma y

no t n e c e s s a r i l y be a s i g n i f i c a n t thing.

            He recollects the r e q u e s t for the closure of

the road and he said and in d e e d Mr.                       G o d d a r d sup p o r t e d

h i m in this,        this was clea r l y w i t h i n the ambit of

Su p e r i n t e n d e n t M a r s h a l l ' s a u t h o r i t y a n d a l t h o u g h he

 said;      "I w o n d e r w h y he w a n t s it closing?"                 he di d not
feel it was right to c o u n t ermand it.          He could not see

around the corner anyway on their videos,               so it was also

clear there was some conversation r e g arding the number

of people outside at around 2.30 and he of course had no

experience of the number of people w h o could come in and he

turned to Mr. Murray and asked him:               "What do y o u t h i n k ? ”

and Mr. Murray said:          "We can get them in".          Mr. Goddard

whe n giving his e v i dence sai d that he did not disagree

w ith that.

         They d i d n ’t in fact use the data w h i c h was available

from the Club to w o r k o u t how m a n y people had come in and

how m a n y people had not come in,         they did it shall we say

by e y e .

         Mr. L o c k did have the data.         C e r t a i n l y he ha d it

at 14.48 because he was in the C l u b R o o m an d w hen

P.C. Guest acc o r d i n g to Mr. L o c k said:      "The gate has

b u r s t open" or s o m ething like t hat     "People have come in",

one of the things that Mr. L o c k d i d wa s to see how m a n y

pe o p l e still h a d to come in an d I think he thought there

wer e a b o u t 4,500 spaces at that p o i n t in time.

             It is quite clear from the e v i d e n c e of Mr. L o c k

that that at that time did n o t cause him any p a r t i c u l a r

c onc e r n so if the data ha d b e e n u t i l i s e d in the Control

Room,   c e r tainly it made n o d i f f e r e n c e to Mr. Lock's

im m ediate appreciation.

             In fact if y o u look at Mr. Lo c k ' s timings,        if

he f ound ou t at 14.48 that s o m e t h i n g had .happened, w h i c h
                                                                              119




he w o u l d have done,    or a few m o m e n t s    later,   he did not

get on to the p i t c h initially he said whe n the players

came out,    bu t if his s u bsequent recollection is right

that in fact he was still there w h e n Mr. Cl o u g h was there

that would have been quite a few minu t e s              later,   you can

work it out for yourself, and on his wa y to the pitch

in order to find out w hat had gone w r o n g or wha t was

not tried to retrace his steps,             bu t he certainly spent

some time doing various o t h e r things and you ma y take

the v i e w at that time he did not perceive the situation

as one of creating an obvious and serious risk of injury

to anyone,     though quite co r r e c t l y he felt that one had to

go and find o u t w h a t was going on.             N o r did he feel that

he had to interfere and ring up.               He could have done.

This is an i n t e r esting point.         He d e c i d e d to go and look.

He had a    'phone to ring through to the Control Room,

I presume.      I di d n o t ask hi m t hat q u e s t i o n b u t if y o u

can ring fro m the Control R o o m to the Clu b R o o m then one

imagines y o u can do it the o t h e r w a y round b u t he did

not do that,      he deci d e d to look a t it on his own.

         The reason w h y I say this is if Mr. L o c k w h o

h a d had exper i e n c e in the Control R o o m as a C o n t r o l l e r

for years before he was a p p o i n t e d to the Club, w h o had

he w o u l d have done,     or a few mome n t s     later,    he did not

get on to the p i t c h initially he said whe n the players

came out,     but if his s u bsequent recollection is right

that in fact he was still there w h e n Mr.               Clough was there

not cause him at that point in time any apparent anxiety.

       Apart from saying:     "Can they get in?" they also

talked about postponing the kick-off and I have already

dealt with that so I am not going to repeat it.     You will

remember what I said about this.
       There are some discrepancies in the evidence between

Mr. Goddard, Mr. Murray and Mr. Duckenfield, but the

substance of the evidence is very similar.

       The next thing that appears to have happened is that

they noticed Mr. Bichard had put the camera on to the

Leppings Lane area and they noticed that the crowd had

got denser and that there was a Police horse which was

enclosed.     Mr. Duckenfield did not give any orders to

send in reinforcements      but it was in fact done probably

by Mr. Goddard who asked Sergeant Soresby to send some

extra staff and arrangements were also made for a Serial

 to go to Leppings Lane.     This is Sergeant Higgins

 Serial.
        It stuck, if I can put that word at Gate A,

 because by the time Sergeant Higgins got there he perceived

 the need but there did not appear to be any evidence that

 it had been sent to Gate A.
           There was some activity taken subsequently to put

 Serials at the North Stand once it was realised that

 Gate A was open or was about to open and I think

 Mr. Duckenfield accepted that this was done and the

 evidence is that he accepted and the otheas in the Control
                                                                                 121




R o o m accepted it_£S well - as I understood their evidence

- that there was a fear that if you allowed people who

did not have tickets into a seated area you could have

problems.

          No Serials were sent to I-eppings Lane terracing

and you should bear that in m i n d but you should also

bear in m ind that the terraces are s t a nding areas;                 that

the system w h i c h Mr.      D u c k e n f i e l d u n derstood he was o p erating

was a "find your own level"             sys t e m and that he had had

at that point no s uggestion that that system had not

worked.

          We know of course that in 1988 there was some

di v e r s i o n but the evidence w h i c h we have heard from all

the senior Officers a p a r t from Mr. C r e a s e r w h o did in

fact know of systems of d i v e r s i o n in certain circumst ances

though not in a semi-final beca u s e he w e n t off to check

w h a t sy s t e m they were going to use, w a s that they had

not an t i c i p a t e d h a v i n g to d i v e r t people fro m the tunnel

mouth.

          There was u n f o r t u n a t e l y a b r e a k - d o w n in communication.

It is e x t r a o r d i n a r y in c i r c umstances   like this that not

only do you have crowds outs i d e and d i f f i c u l t i e s in

Le p pings Lane,     inside yo u have a b r e a k * d o w n in radio

communication.

          W h y that sh o u l d happen, w h y things s e e m to go

w r o n g w h e n they do go w r o n g in groups I d o n ' t know,       but

the fact remains that there were p r o b l e m s outside,                there

were radio problems inside and I have no d o u b t w h a t e v e r

it made    life m o r e difficult.
                                                       The nt;:t thing    ....
      Th e next thing that happened was          that the message was

received   from S u p erintendent Marshall saying,           "Open the

gates," or words to that effect.             That was at 14.47 or

thereabouts.      PC Buxton had turned up in the meantime

outside and that was known in the Control Room,                 though they

did not in fact implement       it.     That was one of the examples

where t a l k - through actually worked.


      The message came through,        "Open the gates," and shortly

thereafter Gate C did open and a number of people came in.

Mr.   Bichard quite clearly     said that when he saw it he said,

"They have burst open the gates," and that was his

assessment of that situation at the time.                 In fact he was

w rong because a l t h o u g h it was not opened u nder authority,                it

was opened by a Police Officer to effect an ejection.

       N o w we have a lre a d y dealt wit h the people coming in so

I do not need to r epeat all that for you, but that was his

i mpression of it and that may be one of those situations

where,   if you like,    the "conditioning",        the a n t i c i p a t i o n of

the sort of things w h i c h are likely to occur, m a y have                led

to a misjud g m e n t of the situation.         It is a ma t t e r for you

to make up your mind about that.

       In any event    the p o s ition was retrieved.           We do not

kno w what went through Mr.       D u c k e n f i e l d 's mind at this

stage...     Well,    we do, a c t ually beca u s e he said that he had

assu m e d that having r e t r i e v e d the situation,     that no further

action was required.
        The next thing that happened was that Mr. M a r s h a l l came

through in very muc h more peremptory                tones and said,    "Open

the gates or else."              Mr.    D u c k e nfield no doubt was in an

exceedingly difficult p o s ition at that point.                 I do not

think anybody would want               to have been in his    shoes.     He, I

 think,    hesitated and it was Mr. Murray who in fact jogged

him and      said,    "Take a d e cision."        He did not use those

words but that was            the sense and Mr. Ducken f i e l d said,     "Open

 the gates."

        As I said,      it seems quite clear         that that was done in

the plural,       but certainly Mr.         Bichard and Mr.    Goddard, maybe

because of the focusing of the camera,                 assumed that it was

only in relation to Gate C.                 It is interesting that.

        Shortly thereafter a further request came through from

Sergeant Higgins            in almost    the same terms - strange that.

I find that strange.              We had,    as I said,   quite a lot of

d i s c u s s i o n as to w hen that came through and ho w m a n y minutes

had elapsed,         but if you accept PC Bichard's evidence w i t h

regard to the panning,            and we have seen it on the

co m p i l a t i o n tape, and that request came through shortly

a fter the formal open i n g of Gate C at 14.52.                T h e r e was a

delay then before Gate A was opened,                but in a way it is not

terribly r e l evant to our account.

       Mr. D u c k enfield's evidence is, as I have already

e x p l a i n e d to you,   you m a k e up your min d ho w far you believe

him,   that having been faced w ith this d e c i s i o n his o b j ective
                                                                                  124




in opening the gates was to save life.                      If Mr. M a r shall    is

to be believed,        and there is nothing            to say he should not

be,   then that is precisely what              they were a t tempting to do

wit h regard     to the people on the outside.

       It is quite clear from the evidence nobody has made the

slightest suggestion that Messrs.                Duckenfield,       Murray,     or,

indeed,      anybody else,      gave any orders         to any Serial or

anybody in the concourse area to divert fans away from the

tunnel.

       Mr.    Duckenfield's account basically is that firstly he

took vie w that the concourse was larger than the turnstile

area and therefore people w ould have room to expand.

S econdly he knew there were three routes, a l t h o u g h he did

not kno w their detail and he c e r tainly did not k now their

signing,     on to the terraces.              He e x p ected that the people,

if they were as badly dist r e s s e d as it would ap p e a r that

they w ere from the message,            w o u l d need to recover

themselves,      sort themselves out and then distr i b u t e

themselves across         the terracing.

       He also said that his att e n t i o n was           focused upon

L eppings Lane;        firstly upon Gate C and then he was                  taken up

w i t h the issue of Gate A.            The    first    time he r e a lised     that

a n y t h i n g was happening on the terraces was when he saw the

gate open and people climbing over.                     There was some

discussion      as to whet h e r he told Mr.           McRob b i e to go down and

sort out w hat the P o l i c e w o m a n did or w h e t h e r M c R o b b i e
                                                                                    125




 initiated the conversation,             but there was clearly at that

 point    some assessment       that something needed to be done.                    It

 was also seem that Mr.           Duckenfield      said,    "I did not know

 what had had happened."              He certainly did net a s sociate the

 entry - at least that          is my under s t a n d i n g of his eviden ce -

 the entry through the gates with what appeared                     to him to be

 a p itch invasion.

         Mr. Duckenfield,       of course,      was supported by Mr.          Murray

whose job it was         to control the ground.              He was entitled to

assume,     I think,     that people in Mr.            Murray's position would

 take appropriate action in the light of developments.

Indeed,     I think he was right to assume that people further

afield would keep him informed as to what was happening,

wit h a view to enabling hi m to take decisions.

         T hat does not mean,       of course,         he can then sit back and

say,     "Well,   I do n o t h i n g unless I am told."           He is able,       of

course,     as Co m m a n d e r to initiate his own action,           but    I tnink

there is a balance w h i c h has          to be struck betw e e n doin:; it

all yourself and w o r k i n g within the framework that has been

set up and w h i c h you hav e unde r s t o o d is a system that has

worked     satisfactorily.

       N o w what about the asses s m e n t of the terraces,                because

this   is may be the single most important - well,                    it is a

very important factor whicht you have to weigh.

Mr. M a r s h a l l was q u e s t i o n e d at great   length on w h e t h e r or

not it m i g h t be obvious        that d i v e r s i o n of people coming on
                                                                                 126




to the concourse was necessary.                  Apart    from the fact that

perhaps we should not have used the word "obvious",                       because

obvious,       as you have discovered,          is a rather      specialised

w ord almost.          It is supposed to be an ordinary English

word,    but one has to give it its due weight.                    Be that as it

may,    Mr.    Marshall illustrated just as many other people did,

like Dr. Nicholson,           that it depended how you asked a

question,       because when he was asked on the one hand whether

prior to the day there had been a suggestion that this

happened or,        indeed, whe n he requested the gates to be

opened had he thought             there was any immediate danger            to

people entering,          he said that no, he had not.                This was

partly because he thought the terraces w ould be empty

judging by the number of people outside;                     partly because he

knew there was a big c o n course inside;                partly beca u s e he

assumed if there was any action that n e e d e d to be taken it

would be taken by the Control R o o m staff;                  and partly

because       it was not his respons i b i l i t y to deal w i t h w h a t was

g oing on inside and he had his w o r k cut out coping w i t h the

d if f i c u l t i e s outside.

       He was a sked about         the o b v i o usness of d i v e r s i o n and his

reply was       that if it was n oted that the pen was o v e r c r o w d e d

then it m i g h t w ell be obvious          that you n e e d e d to di v e r t

p eople away from it.             Tha t   is why I h a v e   said the    issue of

wha t wa s seen in the pen is so important and that is why I

have spent such a long time today r e c o u n t i n g           to you what
                                                                               127




some of the fans have        said,    apart from what other people

have said in relation to the pens.

        The sum total of the evidence         from the Control Room,

that is Mr. Duckenfield,         Mr. Murray,     Mr. Goddard and

Mr.   Bichard,   was that none of them had noticed any problems

with the pens until people came over or the gates were

opened.       In other words,     shall we    say in round terms,         three

o'clock.

        This was partly because their attention was focused on

what was happening outside Leppings Lane,              though I think

certainly Mr. Goddard said he did gl a n c e around and he had

noticed nothing unusual.

        We have spent a lot of time d i s c u s s i n g the

di s c repancies in the fillings,        that there was very m uch more

space at the side,       shall we say, p a r t i c u l a r l y in pen 6 than

there was in the centre.             Y o u have seen the p hotographs

w h i c h were taken from both ends.          Th e 1988 photographs ,          of

course,    are not d i r e c t l y in point beca u s e they were taken in

1988,    but at least they s how the sort of view w h i c h one

might get across      the terraces      from the Police R o o m towards

pen 6.      You a lso h eard Sergeant Goddard who said that in

fact the front of the pens           is quite d i fficult to see because

of the angles.

        Y o u have heard,   and I have r e c o u n t e d to you,   the v i e w s

of people around the stadium who looked at the pens.                    Yo u

can make your own asse s s m e n t as to wha t they felt the state
of the pens were at any particular point in time.          However,

the evidence is,      I think,   reasonably clear that at eight

minutes   to, which is the time when Gate C was opened,      and we

just need to look at that photograph,        and the centre pens

certainly were not empty but they were not necessarily so

full and,   indeed,    they had been playing with beach balls and

various other things      in those pens very shortly before that.

You have got to add to that the evidence of the fans who

were in the pens themselves w hich I have already       tried to

recount to you.




                So you have two problems
     So you have two problems:         one,   would a prudent

observer have noted at the point        in time when the gates

were opened that those pens were so full or so over full

that diversion was something w hich had to be taken;            and

secondly,   of course,    would   the connection,   would a

reasonably prudent,      skilled Police Officer in the shoes,

if you like,    of Mr.   D uckenfield or indeed Mr.    Murray,    have

connected the need,      the opening of the gate,     diversion of

the tunnel,    and conditions     on the pen?


     I think perhaps it is time to stop and we will carry

on tomorrow at 9.30.

D u c k e n f i e l d was a n e w comer up t his p a r t i c u l a r point.

        He c o n f i r m e d for us tha t there was no s p e c i f i c r e f e r e n c e

to m o n i t o r i n g for o v e r c r o w d i n g bu t his u n d e r s t a n d i n g was thait

the serials w o u l d do this as a m a t t e r of course.                          He was

quite open w i t h r e g a r d to w h a t was going t h r o u g h his m i n d

w h e n the Gate C wa s o p e n e d a n d t hat was it d i d not c ross his

into the c o n c o u r s e an d he e x p e c t e d th e p e o p l e t o d i s p e r s e

f r o m there.       He d i d not e x p e c t t h a t t h e y w o u l d all g o t h r o u g h

the tunnel.          His p r i m a r y concern,         h e said,      was t o r e l i e v e

pressure,       to a v o i d injury,         a n d h e w e n t on to s a y t h a t n o t h i n g

        N o t h i n g of s i g n i f i c a n c e was n o t e d on t h e t e r r a c e s so far

as hi s e v i d e n c e is concerned.              He said,       "I d i d n ' t see

he also said it was not at all unusual for fans to have to be

redistributed.

       I have dealt with Mr. Duckenfield to a large extent

already but I will just remind you again in this sort of

serial way.        Mr. Duckenfield basically said that he operated

on the assumptions that (a) the ground was safe,                            (b) the

system of policing which he was employing and the operational

plan was one which was satisfactory and had worked in

previous years and (c) that he had a team of Officers who

were experienced and supportive.

       If x just p i c k h i m up,         so t o speak,       from t h e t i m e that

S u p e r i n t e n d e n t M a r s h a l l m a d e his first request,    he

r e c o l l e c t e d t hat an d he said,     v e r y m u c h like Mr. Murray,           that

w h e n th e gat e was o p e n e d an d 150 t o 200 p e o p l e c a m e in h e

too k it,    if I can use that word,              that the situation had been

resolved.       Th e s e c o n d r e q u e s t t h e n came;   th e i n f e r e n c e f r o m

tha t is t h a t th e s e c o n d r e q u e s t cam e as a n e w matter,             so to

speak,    a n d he r e a l i s e d that t h e s e r e q u e s t s w e r e of an

u n p r e c e d e n t e d n a t u r e and to o pen t h e gates,      i n his words,

w o u l d d e s t r o y th e w h o l e of th e planning.         It may,       therefore,

not b e e n t i r e l y surp r i s i n g if he h e s i t a t e d for a period.                   It

is c l e a r t h a t Mr. Murray,        b y t h e t i m e this r e q u e s t c ame

t h r o u g h a n d a l s o f r o m th e t ones of Mr. Marshall,            felt that a

d e c i s i o n h a d to b e taken,     yes o r n o so t o speak,           a n d he

t u r n e d t o Mr.   D u c k e n f i e l d a n d in f a c t said,   "Are w e g o i n g t o

o p e n t h e gates?" or w o r d s t o thi s effect.

       Y o u h a v e t o r e m e m b e r t h a t if y o u loo k at it;          fo r g e t

t h a t 95 p e o p l e d i e d for a moment.          If y o u look at t h e r e q u e s t
as it cam e f r o m a S u p e r i n t e n d e n t w h o was o u t s i d e w h o said,

"Unless you o pen the gate p e o p l e are g oing to die",                  Mr.

D u c k e n f i e l d h a d v e r y little op t i o n in fact o t h e r tha n to say,

"Yes" to it.         To h a v e s a i d "No" to t hat request,          an d if

pe o p l e the n h a d d i e d - of course,        we do not k n o w w h e t h e r they

w o u l d b u t if the y h a d d i e d he w o u l d h ave b e e n I t h i n k in an

ex c e e d i n g l y d i f f i c u l t position.




                                       /S o a l t h o u g h it wa s hi s decision.
                                                                                        7




So a l t h o u g h it was his decision he was              in a posit i o n where

he m a y not actually have had m u c h op t i o n about it.

         Having said "Open the gates" he was then faced wit h

a further request to open another gate,                      Gate A; did not

know where        it was of course and I have already dealt w ith

all that so I am not going to repeat it, but that was

actioned partly,            in fact Sergeant G o d d a r d said that he

actioned it because having heard the instruction                           to open

the gates there was not really any further need for

further authorisation,                it was m e r e l y a ma t t e r of saying:

"Yes,    go ahead and do it".

          I have already reminded you e a r l i e r that he was

aware tha t there was a large concourse;                     he was aware that

there was a tunnel leading off it; he was aware that there

w ere o t h e r routes off it, b u t he                was n o t aware       of the

d e t a i l e d g e o g r a p h y acc o r d i n g to   his evidence an d I have

d ealt w i t h that y e s t e r d a y if you           ca n remember.

          He w e n t on to say that w h e n he             gave that          o r d e r his

a im was to save life an d I think he u s e d the e x p r e s s i o n

that he was         "consumed" b y this decision.

          He too di d n o t notice anything,               ac c o r d i n g to his

evidence, w i t h re g a r d to the t e r r a c i n g of any m o m e n t

until he saw that the gate was o p e n o n the p e r i m e t e r

fence an d then w e are b a c k on the s t o r y w i t h Mr. M c R o b b i e

an d the o p e n i n g of Gat e 1 a n d we k n o w that this w a s a r o u n d

3 o ' c l o c k beca u s e there are p h o t o g r a p h s w h i c h y o u have

see n of I n s p e c t o r M c R o b b i e d o w n o u t s i d e that gate and so on.
        He e x plained to us that he e x p ected to receive

s upport from Officers b o t h on the track and on the W e s t

S tand and that they w o u l d report o v e r c rowding to hi m if

they noted it.

         He also told us that on the day he was not aware

of the difficulties w h i c h fans m i g h t have in moving

from one area on that terrace to anot h e r because of the

radial    fences.

         We now know,      because we have gone through it at

great length,       that those gates at the back are not

visible - I think we can say that quite clearly - are

n o t visible whe n you have terraces full of people.

They m a y not even be v i s i b l e w h e n the terraces are not

that full of people,           b u t w h a t I think he is really

telling us is that he wa s o p erating on an assumptio n

that the terraces w e r e b e i n g trea t e d as a whole,              as

one uni t and at the time, on the day,                     he was n o t aware

- I    am telling you w h a t he is saying in b rief - he was

not    aware of the d i f f i culties w h i c h peo p l e m i g h t have

 in seeing and indeed gett i n g to these gates.

         He also told us that m e r e d i s p a r i t y in numbers

 as such w o u l d not be a m a t t e r for concern.              Disparity

 plus som e t h i n g yes, m e r e d i s p a r i t y no.

         He was     relying upo n the f act tha t the system

 w h i c h he was   u s i n g had w o r k e d in the past;      t h a t as

 f ar as he kne w there had b e e n no d i s t r i b u t i o n p r o b l e m s

 in 1988 or 1987.          W h e n I say "distribution" I m e a n
                                                                                      9




d i s t r i b u t i o n of fans on the terraces,      and that was the

basic premise.

        He was quite clear from his e v i dence that he had

no p lan p r e p a r e d to deal w i t h the issue of m a l d i s t r i b u t i o n

if it arose.        His e x p l a n a t i o n for that was that he w o u l d

expect if a s i tuation arose,           and he w o u l d not expect it

to arise given all the presuppositions w h i c h I have a l r e a d y

told you about,        he w o u l d ex p e c t O f f icers to resp o n d to

a "developing situation", was the term he used.

         He did not ac c e p t that there was on the day,                 as

far   as he was concerned,          an obvious risk to people when

the gates were op e n e d and he also r e m i n d e d us that the

time interval in w h i c h he had to take various decisions

was short,      cer t a i n l y s hort as far as he was concerned.

         We h eard fro m S e r g e a n t G o d d a r d and P.C.     Bichard

and s u b s t a n t i a l l y on timings there are discr e p a n c i e s as

to wh o a c t ually ini t i a t e d the call,       you k n o w was it

Murray, was it Duckenfield,              S e r g e a n t Goddard,   b u t the

stories c o i ncide m o r e or less w i t h re g a r d to timings.

         In p a r t i c u l a r the y too say t hat the y h a d no t

n o t i c e d a n y thing a b o u t the pens until people star t e d

co m i n g o v e r the top o r c o m i n g o u t t h r o u g h the gates

and t hey in common indeed w i t h Mr. D u c k e n f i e l d and

Mr. M u r r a y had n o t a s s o c i a t e d the o p e n i n g of the gate

w i t h the sit u a t i o n t h a t p r e s e n t e d itself on the

 terraces.

         S e r g e a n t G o d d a r d t old us tha t if he t h o u g h t t hat
there was an obvious risk then he w o u l d certainly have

said something about it and he also told us that he

did not link Gate C w i t h the tunnel.

       On the other h and he said he was not actually

asked to make that a s s o c i a t i o n and that is actually a

very important p oint by one of these two Officers.

They were in the Control R o o m b u t they were not in

charge,     they were not taking the decisions,                 they were

effecters.        They were e f fecters w h o had a considerable

amount of experience b u t they wer e not carrying the

r e s ponsibility for the match.

        P.C.      Bichard w i t h regard to the terracing I have

already mentioned,          he did no t notice anyth i n g until

people started coming o v e r and his in t e r p r e t a t i o n of

it was that it wa s a p i t c h invasion and he b a s e d it

upon the fact that it looked e x a c t l y the same as

o c c u r r e d in 1988.    D i f f e r e n t time admittedly,     he

q uite clearly said that, b u t it looked the same.

People w ere coming over.             He said:       "That is a p i t c h

invasion".         He m a y also have b e e n i n f l u e n c e d b y the

fac t that w h e n the 14.48 o p e n i n g o c c u r r e d he d e s c r i b e d

it as "the fans ha v i n g b u r s t t h r o u g h the gates".           We

d o n ' t know.     It is v e r y d i f f i c u l t to pu t y o u rself into

o t h e r people's minds,        b u t w h a t e v e r the connec t i o n s wer e

tha t is how he saw it and he d i d n o t c o n n e c t the tunnel,

as I have a l r e a d y said, w i t h p e o p l e com i n g over.

          He sai d tha t he was f ully o c c u p i e d w i t h L e p p i n g s

L a n e and the p r o blems - b y tha t I m e a n the outs i d e
                                                                          11




a rea - and the p r o blems a s s o c i a t e d w i t h its resolution.

       He also said - and this I think was an interesting

c omm e n t - he said in his v iew there was r oom w i t h i n the

ground.    If there h a d b e e n no r oom w i t h i n the ground

then his thinking m i g h t have b e e n different.




                             N o w tha t is a v e r y risky
        No w that is a very risky bit of e v i d e n c 6~because we

don't actually know what he would have thought in a

different situation so be careful.               Do not make too m u c h of

that.

        I also want     to mention Mr. Jack s o n very,       very briefly.

Mr. Jackson was the Assistant Chief Constable and the most

senior officer on duty that day.               His responsibility was in

respect of the whole of South Yorkshire,               not specifically

for the match and he had no direct duties in relation to

that match.         He did attend and it appears to me that he

attended as a guest,           although he m ight well have been

pleased     (a) to see the m a t c h and (b) to be there b e c a u s e it

was a big event anyway.

        His evidence was        that he had signed the Op e r a t i o n Order

when it was presented to him.              He had seen noth i n g u n t o w a r d

in it and we nave already heard            from lots of people          that it

subst a n t i a l l y followed previous patterns so that isn't

entirely surprising.

        He also confirmed,        as indeed Mr. Mole and Mr. Lock,

that he was quite satisfied that Mr.             Du c k e n f i e l d was a

competent Police Officer,           suitable   to be a Divi s i o n a l

C o m m a n d e r and as such in ch a r g e of an event suc h as a

football match.

        He did v isit the Control R oom at about           two o'clock,       or

s o m e t h i n g like that,   and there was some talk but it sounded
to me as if it was more,          "Hello.     Everything OK?" a n d          then

he went off.

        He then disappeared,       if I can use that word,             and I do

not complain about this because he had no r esponsibilities

with regard       to the match.      He disapp e a r e d and took his seat

in due course in the directors'             box.       He says he never

noticed anything about Leppings Lane terraces beca u s e he was

not really     looking at them,      but shortly after kick-off he

did notice there was something w rong and once he realised

that people were coming over the top he got up and went                         to

the Control Box.

        It was he who had to a u thorise Operational Support and

he did so at ten past.            It was r e quested somewhat earlier

than that and       there is some conflict of evidence as to who

actua l l y requested it.         Was it Mr.       Ducken f i e l d or was it

Mr. Jackson?        Mr. D uckenfield thought that he had requested

it.      Mr. Bichard thought it was Mr. J a c k s o n who had

requested it.

        Whether   that is right or not,        the Control Room clearly

had not u n d e r s t o o d that it was Mr. J a c k s o n wh o had r e quested

it b e c a u s e they came back and said,          "Needs ACC a p p r o v a l . "

Well,    of course,   he was there so it was not too d i f f i c u l t to

give it.
        I do not think very m u c h turns on that as to who

precisely said Operational             Support.      They were both there,

Mr.   Ducken f i e l d and Mr. Jackson.

      ' Mr. Jackson e x p lained to you and,          indeed,   to all of us,

the m ethodology of command in disaster               situations and the

reason why he did not kick Mr.              D uckenfield out of the way

and take over control of the disaster as such.

        Bearing in mind          that he did have wider

responsibilities,             namely South Yorkshire,     and of course

there was no guarantee             that something else might not happen

which might divert him,             you may feel that that is a

reasonable way of setting about              the control structure.

        He,   in common w i t h nearly e v erybody else,        said that as

far as he was concerned,             a l t hough he did not have any

d etailed knowledge of the ground,             he had always     taken it to

be safe for the p u r p o s e for which it was intended.

        He also said that although there was nothing speci f i c

about    safety in each individual Serial             bits about the

Op e r a t i o n a l Order,   he would have expected Officers        to have

that in their minds.

        I have merely men t i o n e d Mr. J a c k s o n so you can see I

have not forgotten him,             so to speak,   and because he h a p p e n e d

to be there.          However,     his p a r t in the decision m a k i n g

p r o c e s s on that day, when it did b egin to bec o m e a c t u a l was

well a fter all crucial decisions had a l r e a d y bee n taken,
opening gates,        even calling ambulances,            was about the same

time as Operational          Support had been requested.

       T h e last person whom I want to mention,                  and I have

m e ntioned him on many occasions,              but    I just want       to draw it

together a little bit,            is Superin t e n d e n t Marshall.

Superintendent Marshall of course wasn't in the Control Box

at all.       He was outside.            I am not      going to repeat what I

spent a couple of hours on yesterday                   about what was

happening outside,          the activities of the fans,              the

activities of the mounted officers,                   the activities of other

people who were around.               You can remember that I am sure.

It must be clear in your mind.                  You have heard it often

enough.

       Mr.   Marshall did two things w h i c h I think he acce pted

were unprecedented.             Well,    that is n o t quite right.               He

did one thing w h i c h was u n p r e c e d e n t e d and that was h e closed

Leppings Lan e early.

       I have already gone over that and given you somfe

gu i dance as to what I consider the s i g n i ficance of that

pa rticular activity in relation to the disaster.                          If you

remember I said I had grave doubts w h e t h e r it w o u l d even

fall into the "but          for" category:         "But    for the clos i n g of

Leppings L a n e did X number of pe o p l e die?"                 E ven if it did

you m i g h t hav e c o n s i d e r a b l e d i f f i c u l t y in fitting that

de c i s i o n into the d e f i n i t i o n of reck l e s s n e s s w h i c h I have
                                                                                 16




already given to you and which I will be repeating in a

little while.

        The second     thing he did was...              He told us that until

about 2.30 or perhaps even a few minu t e s after that,                  there

were a lot of people           there but that in itself did not worry

him.      He was not worried by the nu m b e r of people but at

some point he said,          and    indeed others       said,   that he and the

Police Force were overwhelmed.                  Having assessed the

situation he decided           that action had        to be taken to relieve

the pressure at the front because if that did not happen he

foresaw injury and,          indeed,     towards     the end he foresaw

death.       He therefore initiated            the request for the gates to

be opened.

        Other people,       of course,      were   there as well,     as we

know,    because PC Buxton was doing things,                  Inspector Bennett

up at the top, Mr. Purdy,             Mr. H a n d - D a v i s with his horses,

the N o t t i n g h a m s h i r e pe o p l e who came up,   there was q uite a

lot of other activity,             but his a c t ivity in the main was

d i r ected at,    as he saw it, r e lieving the pressure at the

front.

        We hav e spent a lot of time t h i n k i n g about a l t e r n a t i v e s

that he could h ave employed.                Should he have chosen A

instead of B?          Should he have p o s t p o n e d kick-off?        Should

he have sent pe o p l e down that side road beh i n d the South

Stand?
     Superintendent Marshall explained   to us that he did not

do it and he gave us some reasons.   It is difficult   to know

whether all those reasons went through his mind on the day.

I suspect they did not.




            The long and the short of it
The long and the short of it is that he felt the only way

to deal wit h the situation was              to open the gates even

though this was,       if acceded to, another u n p r e c e d e n t e d act.

       You have to be very careful.              Simply because somebody

can say that there were alt e r n a t i v e s does not mean that an

action w hich somebody has         taken becomes wrong,        or that it

immediately falls into the category of causing an obvious

and serious risk of injury.            Just because there are ways

of doing things better - assuming for a m i n u t e that you

thought they could be done better and Mr.                Marshall did not

agree that they could - he n e v e r thought that he could get

the people down the road and he did not even,                 in evidence

he said,    even in r etrospect he did not really think that

postponing the kick-off would have been the solution.                   He

may be wrong in that but that was his view.

       He put through the requests and he put them through

in a pere m p t o r y m a n n e r towards    the end.   If you are

satisfied,     and we have gone through all the evidence

already about h o w other pe o p l e had assessed it,           that there

was a serious risk - or indeed that there was a risk to

life and l imb - then you may find it dif f i c u l t to say that

to remedy    that was something,            a step w h i c h should not have

b een taken,    b e c a u s e the c o rollary to that,     of course,   that

if you say well I can see a ris k to life and injury but it

breaches our o p e r a t i o n a l plan and therefore we w i l l not do

it,   if you think that through you r e a l i s e that is not
                                                                          19




really a tenable situation,         p a r t i cularly whe n somebody

dies.

        You have also got to remem b e r w i t h regard to Mr.

Marshall that he did not,         in fact,    open the gates and this

I think is a very important point.             He could have opened

the gates in my judgment,         because he was a Superintendent

and although the gates opened from the inside,                  so he was

physically unable to do it beca u s e he was on the outside,

it may well be that if he had gone up to the gate,                   banged

on it and said,      "Open that gate",       bot h the Stewards and

the junior Officers inside would have done what he told

them but he did not do that.           He radioed through and

w anted it a uthorised and he wa n t e d it done from the

inside,     if you like,    through Control.

        Now that is a very important point whe n you come to

think about Mr. M a r s h a l l beca u s e if you agree w i t h that

then of course he c e rtainly did not do an act,               and in fact

it may be d i f ficult even to see an omission,             and it may

also be d i f ficult    to fit him into some of the o ther

categories of the legal d e f i n i t i o n b e c a u s e if his request

was    in order to avoid injury you m a y hav e some d i f f i c u l t y

in saying that was a b r e a c h of duty,        or that was a failure

to care for the h e a l t h and w e l f a r e of the pe o p l e who he

was    looking at.


        On the other hand,     as I have already p o i n t e d out to

you,    by putt i n g the request   through and p a r t i c u l a r l y
putting it through in the p e remptory manner in w hich he

did he put the people in the Control Room into an

exceedingly d i fficult situation,       for the reasons which I

have explained to you,       and just in passing        this is where

one of the problems comes up because you cannot aggregate

-     you remember this is one of the points         in wha t Lord

Justice Watkins       said - you cannot add together the acts or

omissions of different people and say take this one, and

this one,    and this one,    and this one and add them all

together,    then this is bad,     this is reckless.          You can't

do it.     Each person stands on his own so it may be that

you may get different people who,         if you look at them

individually,     have maybe been negligent,        they may even

have been incompetent but it is not sufficient.                  You have

got to be able to fit them into the d e f i n i t i o n of

reckless,    and you have to do it taking into account all

the evidence,    including their explanations.

        So what we have then is,     in fact,    three u n p r e c e d e n t e d

things,    I think,   in relation to this event.          Th e first one

was    the closure of Leppings Lane.       The second was          the

evidence of the Officers and it is a m a t t e r for you to

decide what weight you put on this in the light of all the

evidence,    that the arrival of the crowd in the numbers                  in

w h i c h they did and in the m a n n e r in w h i c h they did created

an u n p r e c e d e n t e d situation outside the turnstiles,      and in

a sense you may feel that that is so beca u s e there is no
evidence that this sort of p r o b l e m had ever arisen before.

Mr.   McGauley    told us about a huge crowd.            Do you remember,

he was    the cha p who lived in Wadsley Lane w i t h his             little

baby?     He said there was a big crowd there.                  His v iew was

they w ould never get in.          Unfor t u n a t e l y he did not stop to

w atch and secondly he had never been to a football match

for ten years,       so it is very dif f i c u l t   to put too much

weight on his assessment.            He did get into the Ground;           the

match was not postponed;          the only thing he reme m b e r e d that

people    (a) were escorted round,         you know,     transferred,

relocated,     and   (b) that people were climbing up into the

stands sometime during the match.               So he did m ake that

reference to it but it is not one w h i c h I think you can

build very m u c h on.       In fact,    I don't think you can build

anything on it in the light of his limited knowledge.                      I

am sure his observation was right that there w e r e a lot of

p eople there but whet h e r he was right that they w o u l d not

get in was another matter.            If he had stopped there and

w a t c h e d it w o u l d be dif f e r e n t but he did not,   he said he

was only there for seconds or a minute,               a short      time

anyway.


        If you then boil - if I can use that w o r d - all this

down and see what is it really that we are talk i n g about,

you have,    I think,    you may feel that the c hain of

c au s a t i o n is the p r e sence of a large crowd,       and I don't

think that you can excl u d e the fans on a "but for" - but
                                                                22




for the p r e sence of the fans in that location in that

condition the disaster w o u l d not have happened.      That is

the first one.    The second one is the opening of the gates

- but for the opening of the gates.       The third point is

but for the entry of the fans in substantial numbers on to

the central terraces the d i s a s t e r w ould not have happened,

and but for the fact that these terraces became,          I think

one can't get away w ith it,    they became o v e r c rowded

because Dr. N i cholson counted it and they clearly were

overcrowded,    this disaster did not happen.      And it depends

to a certain extent where you d r a w the line but in a final

analysis you may feel that the real apex of the p r o b l e m is

the issue of w h e t h e r or not there was such a failure in

not diverting    the fans from the tunnel that you can

c lassify that as creating an obvious and serious risk of

injury.

         He    felt     that if he had       b een in that situation

he w o u l d   have    done the same,       he w o u l d have sought to

reduce the pressure on the outside and for w h a t it

was w o r t h he thought the d e c i s i o n to open the gates

was correct and he also said,               intere s t i n g l y enough,

that if people were in as bad a state as one would

deduce from those comments,              that he w o u l d have

expected them to see k to recover w i t h i n the concourse

area      and then     to disperse.

         He    told     us t hat he had n e v e r had any difficulties

w i t h regard to the signing, b u t then of co u r s e he

ha d never had 2,000 p e o p l e o r so come in suddenly,

r e l a t i v e l y sudde n l y through a gate.

         He like m o s t of the O f f icers s aid that he

w o u l d hav e e x p e c t e d his Offic e r s to use their

initiative,       r e p o r t m a t t e r s an d r e s p o n d to situations.

         He told us t h a t he w o u l d n o t hav e b e e n alar m e d

b y dis p a r i t y on its own a t 14.50.

         He also e x p r e s s e d the v i e w t h a t he w o u l d have

e x p e c t e d people to use t heir co m m o n s e n s e w h e n

e n t e r i n g an e n c l o s e d c o n f i n e d space like a tunnel

a n d n o t to r ush dow n it, b e c a u s e I hav e a l r e a d y

told y o u that the tunnel a n d w h a t was h a p p e n i n g - he

was n o t there so he does n o t a c t u a l l y k n o w the m a n n e r

of p r o g r e s s of people - and I h ave a l r e a d y allu d e d
                                                                30




to you that the manner of progress of people down the

tunnel is very difficult to assess but if Mr. Bullis is

right,   if Mr. Hughes is right and even if you consider

that there were quite a lot of the deceased who came in

relatively late and who finished up fairly far forward,

there must have been some pressure taking people forward

into the terracing.

         His view was that his plan had been tried and tested

and was satisfactory but he conceded that opening the gate

did present and create a different situation.     His baseline

on which he operated was that the stadium was safe; that

the radial fences were there to sort out the problem

which had occurred in 1981.

         So there you have a number of people, none of whom

of course had had an experience identical or similar

to what had happened at Hillsborough and this is of course

a problem because you are not likely to find anybody be

they experienced or not who had that situation, and you

therefore in a few moments, well fairly soon when you will

be retiring, will have to try and weigh and sort out what

you make of the story; what you make of the explanations;

what you make of the law; w hat you make of the assessment

that other people have made of the situation as it was,

and in thinking about it you have to take into account all

the evidence including all the explanations the people

whose conduct you are calling into question have given

you.
                                                                                  31




        You have to take into account,               well you m u s t

decide w h e t h e r this was an u n p r e c e d e n t e d s i tuation indeed.

You have to decide w h e t h e r the response w h i c h was made

was governed to a cert a i n e x t e n t by the actions or i nter­

actions of other people and w h e t h e r in the final analysis

having s a t isfied y o u rself that there was a d uty of care;

that there was a failure;             that there was a substantial,

w h a t e v e r it is you are t h i nking was substantial and you

m a y not of course e ven get p a s t those points,               but if you

do you then have to decide w h e t h e r the act o r omiss i o n

w h i c h you are c o n s i dering was reckless,          namely did it

create an obvious and serious risk of injury and if the

a n s w e r to that is "yes" y o u h ave go t to go o n and think:

"Did the p e r s o n w h o s e ac t o r o m i s s i o n we are considering,

h ad he recog n i s e d it an d said:            'I d o n ' t care,    I am

g oing ou t to take it' o r w a s he i n d i f f e r e n t to it?"

The mer e fact that he d i d n o t rec o g n i s e it, I w i l l read

yo u the w o r d i n g c o r r e c t l y in a moment,   is n o t sufficient.

        Th e p o i n t a b o u t that is n e g l i g e n c e on its own is

n o t the same as recklessness.              It is v e r y i m p o r t a n t to

have that d i s t i n c t i o n c l e a r l y in y o u r mind.   Th e fact

tha t p e o p l e m a d e mistakes;    that t h e y m i g h t be liable

for civil damages;         t hey m a y h ave m a d e serious errors

even, b u t they m a y eve n hav e b e e n i n c o m p e t e n t is n o t the

same as sa y i n g tha t a p e r s o n is b e i n g reckless w i t h i n

the m e a n i n g of the definition.

        I hav e s t r e s s e d this a t g r e a t length b e c a u s e it
is important that you should u n d e r s t a n d not only the

positive a r g u m e n t b u t the n e g ative ones as well because

you need to take a corr e c t d e c i s i o n in the light of the

evidence and of the law and as I have already said,

just two more things on             Lhis,      you m u s t not aggregate,          you

mus t not add the a c tivities of d i f f e r e n t people together.

You have got to be s a tisfied that w h a t you are c onsid ering

is attributable to just one person.                         There m a y be more

than one person who m i g h t fulfil the criteria but each

person stands on his own and u n d e r no circumstances,                          of

course, m u s t yo u name anyb o d y and in addition to that

you have to be sa t i s f i e d b e y o n d reaso n a b l e d oubt on this

p a r t i c u l a r p a r t of the conclusion.

         If the an s w e r is that it falls on any of the grounds

or that you c a n n o t        be s a t i s f i e d b e y o n d   r easonable d o u b t

on any of the grounds              then yo u m o v e on to the nex t issue

w h i c h is is this an a c c i d e n t o r misadventure;                was there

an intentional ac t w h i c h had u n i n tentional c o n s e quences

or,   we all k n o w w h a t the w o r d "accident? means, was it a

coming together of m u l t i t u d i n o u s bits w h i c h a d d e d up

in the end to d i s a s t e r an d that yo u decide on the bala n c e

of p r o b a b i l i t y and   if yo u c a n ' t de c i d e on that y o u b r i n g

in an o pen v e r d i c t      on the basis t hat there is i n s u f f i c i e n t

e v i d e n c e to enable y o u to r each a decision.

their names and the causes of d e a t h and p o s s i b l y their

important that we finish,                a part from the final            legal

direction,       on w h a t we are really here for, w h i c h is how

did these 95 individual people come to m eet their death?

         We are not interested in who is responsible, we

are interested in how those people                        died, so we will do

that after our break and then you can retire.

         N o w I am going to go t h r o u g h and remind y o u b a s i c a ily

of the peo p l e w h o y o u are g o i n g to be c onsidering and

to fi n i s h up w i t h a wa d of inquests,              95 of them.

         W h a t I a m g oing to give yo u - I have alre a d y

w h a t e v e r is m o r e c o n v e n i e n t for you.

         Do n o t i n s e r t the date w hen yo u are d e a l i n g w i t h

these a n d d o n ' t sign them until a f t e r I have h e a r d the

verdict,      okay,    a n d the c o n c l u s i o n an d then I will         tell

y o u w h a t we do,     ho w we are g o i n g to set a b o u t t hat whe n

the time comes.
         R e m e m b e r you are deal i n g w i t h 95 individual

Inquests,     individual people.          You apply your m i n d in respect

of each one of those persons and if you are considering

the p o s s i b i l i t y of .unlawfully killed you wor k your way

through the people in respect of w h o m I have said that

you m a y consider the issue and some you ma y find take

longer than others.          It is up to you.          I am not giving

you any advice on that,           you do w h a t e v e r you wan t and

however you want it.

         At the end of the day you are b r i n g i n g in a verdict

in respect of one of these people who died,                   not in

respect of anyb o d y else,        so eac h one has to be c onsidered

individually,       though of course yo u m a y find that some

beca u s e of their locations,         y o u m a y be able to say:

"Well yes,     there is a simil a r i t y there" but y o u still

have to think of e a c h one.

         T hese are the b lank ones.           I will pu t those there

n o w and in a d d ition to the Inq u i s i t i o n s w h i c h I will be

h a n d i n g to you, I gave you a schedule w h i c h lists the

names,    the ages,     the times of certifications,             the doctors

and w e c i r c u l a t e d that list to all the lawyers so you

all k n o w w h a t it is that the jury h ave got.

         Right,   I a m no t going to take y o u through the detail

of w h a t we call the summaries as to w h e r e the p e r s o n was

taken and y o u k n o w w h o was i n v o l v e d b e c a u s e yo u have h eard

 that and I don't t h i n k ’it is n e c e s s a r y for me to repeat

 it but it was all part of the evidence r e l ating to that

 individual.

         My objective is simply to remind y o u of the names,

 the medical cause of death,            addresses and occupations

 and matters of that sort,            indeed the dates of birth.

         Mr. King,     if I m a y just look at you for one moment.

W e have done our v e r y best to get these things right but

 of course it is possible,           despite every endeavour,             that

 there is a mistake.

         Now if w hen I go through it ei t h e r you,             your

 instructing solicitors or indeed the p a r t i c u l a r family

 hea r that there is an e r r o r then I w o u l d be grateful               if

 somebody got up there and then and d r e w it to m y att e n t i o n

because c o rrecting mistakes,           it ma y n o t s e e m v e r y imp o r t a n t

but I k now f rom e x p e r i e n c e it is v e r y v e r y i m portant to

families that the names a n d details are right,                    so if you

can    help m e on that.         As I say I have done m y b est but

I am conscious whe n yo u are d e a l i n g w i t h 95 d e c e a s e d

errors can creep in.

        The o r d e r in w h i c h I a m going to take t hem is the

      THE CORONER:        Wha t we have got on the form and if
I have m i s r e a d it I am sorry, 25th M a r c h 1966. That is
correct, is it, at Liverpool?

        MR. KING:        T hank you sir.

          THE CORONER:    M y m e n t o r tells me that I have made
another mist a k e w i t h Thomas Howard.        I have left out his
c a u s e of death, 1 (a) c rush asphyxia.

        N o w that is in fact all the people w h o m you are

going to be deal i n g with.            Can I pass them to you?

(FOrms handed to the j u r y )

        W h a t we are going to do now is I am simply going

to re-remind you of the core definition,                     legal definition,

because you will r e m ember that I have given yo u long

explanations and e l a b orations of these to try and m ake

it easier.        I d on't intend to do all that a gain beca u s e

I ex p e c t that     y o u will have it in m i n d bu t I think I do

need to re- r e m i n d y o u of the centre p a r t and I also n eed

to remind yo u of the fact that there are certain rules

w h i c h y o u have to, 36B w h i c h I r e a d to y o u an d there is

anot h e r one as well, R u l e 42.

         36B is the rule w h i c h requires that y o u m u s t not

add any riders, who, when, w h e r e an d ho w a n d n o t h i n g els e

and the o t h e r rule, R u l e 42,        is the rule w h i c h p r o vide s

t hat the In q u i s i t i o n m u s t n o t a p p e a r to det e r m i n e by

n a m e a n y b o d y w h o m a y hav e criminal    liability,       nor must

it d e t e r m i n e civil    liability,     so tha t is those two rules.

Y o u wil l r e m e m b e r that, w o n ' t you.

         Th e three v e r d i c t s w h i c h y o u are c o n s i d e r i n g are

u n l a w f u l l y killed.   T h a t has go t to be b e y o n d r e a s o n a b l e
doubt.    Accidental death            or   misadventure which if you are

considering it has to be on the balance of probability

a n d the open verd i c t is when on the evidence w hich you

have heard y o u are unable to reach a conclusion.                            You

m u s t reach a verd i c t for each and everyone of the deceased.

         You m u s t consider the o r d e r in w h i c h you consider

them.     You    have got to start w i t h the unla w f u l l y killed

because that is the h i g h e s t s t a ndard of proof and then

you wor k your w a y down.

         Once you have sat i s f i e d yourself on a verd i c t that

is it as far as that p a r t i c u l a r person is concerned.

         L o r d Justice Watk i n s set o u t the principal conditions

w h i c h y o u have to c o n sider a n d tha t is:

         "1. Y o u have to be sa t i s f i e d bey o n d reasonable
         doubt w h e n y o u are consid e r i n g u n lawfully
         ki l l e d that the       p e r s o n w h o s e cond u c t you
         are co n s i d e r i n g ha d a duty to have regard to
         the h e a l t h and w e l f a r e of the deceased.

          2. T h a t in the circu m s t a n c e s t here w a s a
          failure to do w h a t sh o u l d hav e b e e n done for
          the h e a l t h and w e l f a r e of the deceased.

          3. T h a t that failure a m o u n t e d to a substantial
          cause of death.

          4. T h a t the failure a m o u n t e d to recklessness.

          5. R e c k l e s s n e s s m e a n s t hat there was an obvious
          and serious ris k to the h e a l t h a n d w e l f a r e of
          the d e c e a s e d an d that the p e r s o n w h o s e c o n d u c t
          is b e i n g c o n s i d e r e d h a v i n g regard to his duty
          w a s (a) i n d i f f e r e n t to suc h a risk or (b)
          r e c o g n i s i n g tha t r isk to be p r e s e n t d e l i b e r a t e l y
          c hose to run t h a t risk b y d oing n o t h i n g a bout
          it.
                                                                                      51




       6. It must be emphasised, however, that a failure to
       appreciate that there was such a risk would not, by
       itself, be sufficient to amount to recklessness.

       7. You can only return a verdict of unlawfully killed
       if you can at t r i b u t e these ingredients to a single
       individual w hose conduct is being called in question;
       such an individual should on no account be named or
       otherwise identified."

        I just want to repeat one other matter wit h regard                         to

accidental death and             that is you should remember what              I told

you,    that it straddles           the whole spectrum from where you

say,    "Well,     nobody can be blamed," to the position where in

fact you may feel           that    there was negligence,            but it covers

the whole of that range and must be borne in mind.                            In

exactly the same way you must not,                      of course,    name anybody

b e c a u s e you would be a p p earing to d e t e r m i n e civil        liability

if you were to do that.

        Is it r easonably clear to you?

        When you go out,           once you are out you are out, but that

does not mea n to say you are on y o u r own.                    If you find that

need more d i rections or that s o mething is not c lear to you,

you bang on the door and the Jury O f f i c e r will b ring you

back and you can then tell me what it is that is c o n c e r n i n g

you and I will either deal w i t h it there and then if I can

or if I h ave to r e s e a r c h it I will r e s e a r c h it and deal wit h

it.

       Do not consult          the Jury Offi c e r or anybody else.                 All

c o m m u n i c a t i o n s a m o n g s t yourselves,   of course.      You can talk

Court,   in public with e v erybody who wishes       to be here,    here,

and to me.

       How the next thing we want       to do is to swear in the

Jury Officers,      and I am very fortunate in that the Crown

Court has kindly allowed       two of their people who are

experienced in looking after juries          to come and look after

you.

                    (The Jury Bailiffs were s w o r n )


       Now the next thing we need to do is to give you the

exhibits.      These are the complete set of the exhibits.            Ue

have not - you remember I said we were going to try and give

you the original photographs?           It has proved a jolly

di fficult task,     but if you find tnat you really need a

better quality one then bang on the door,           come back in,    and*

we will find you that p a r t i c u l a r one.    Certainly if you

think you need the best quality vou can get,              then so be it.

The o ther thing we need to do is to show you h o w to use the

video equipment.

       W h i l e we are waiting for tne video equipment,        this does

not c o n c e r n the jury so m u c h but it is of interest to

ev e rybody else,    I have no idea - and you hav e as m u c h time

as you need,    I am not putt i n g you u nder any time p r e s s u r e -

h o w long the jury is g oing to be.         It is a m a t t e r for you

in their verdicts you are available.

         (The Jury were     shown how to operate the v i d e o )

      Is that clear to you?

      Right,   ladies and    gentlemen,   it is over to you.

                   (The Jury retired at 12.33 p m )

     HR. KING:   Speaking from i g n orance totally, I noted
you did not address the jury on the need for them to reach a
unanimous verdict.   I don't know whether that is something
you would normally do.

they do not come back within a certain number of hours I
will bring them back and say they can r each a major i t y
verdict, but I did not want to put it into their heads that
there was anything other than a unanimous verdict.            Perhaps
I should have m e n tioned it, but my intention was to do it
the other way round.

          MR. HANNING:        Just before I and anyb o d y else goes to
secrete themselves, sir, may I enquire this, wit h respect:
clearly the jury has a long d e l i b e r a t i o n and a lot to think
about.            T here may com e a time this aft e r n o o n w hen an
inquiry may need to be mad e as to w h e t h e r there is any
r e a s o n a b l e prospect of their being able to d e l i v er-that
verdict today or w h e t h e r it would be then nec e s s a r y for them
to have to remain overnight.              Could you give us some
i ndication at what time you might think of m a k i n g that
inquiry?

          THE CORONER:      The answer is at about four o ' c l o c k that
I w o u l d w ish to make the inquiry.     I think it would be
p r e m a t u r e to make it any earlier than that.   I hav e no
idea, but I suspect wi t h Inquests of these lengths, they may
well want more time than that.            If they do say they are
n owh e r e near, and in fact when I get them back I will
p r o b a b l y talk about the unanimous verdict then, but if they
say they are nowhere near I will tell them they can go on
until 4.30 and then they are off to their h otel for the
night.

     MR. ISAACS:   Sir, on the q u e s t i o n of unanimity, or
otherwise, of verdicts, you m e n t i o n e d earlier that you would
at some stage wisn to give them a m a j o r i t y direction.    Do
we take it from what you have just said that having regard
                                                                     54




to the length that these Inquests have been going on for,
you w ould not wish to give them that direction today?

     THE CORONER:   I would not wish to give them that
direction today.   I think that would be inappropriate.    I
have it in mind that if I were to give them that direction,
if they haven't come back, of course, it would be around
tomorrow lunch time when I would have felt that they had had..
a complete day, but even then I would ascertain how they
were doing, so to speak.

     MR. ISAACS:   Just to h elp those who have arrangements
to make, if they should go to a hotel tonight, what time
from tomorrow are you likely to requ i r e their a t tendance to
deliver a verdict and, therefore, our attendance?

     THE CORONER:   I would have thought 9.30.   We want
them obviously to have plenty of time to think about it,            so
to speak.

     MR. ISAACS:     Certainly my understanding, of course,          is
that they do not c o n tinue to c o n sider their verdicts, at
least formally, whilst they are away from this building.
What they actually do, of course, is anot h e r matter.

        THE CORONER:     Yes.

        MR.   ISAACS:   The y will then be here   from half past
nine?

      THE CORONER:   Tha t is right.   Would you be happier,
Mr. King, if I got them back and told them they should reach
a unanimous verdict?     I do not think it is necessary, but I
am more than happy to do it if you would feel ea s i e r in your
mind.

     MR. KING:   Sir, the jury has n o w gone out.    I think
it probably is not a ppropriate to bring them back in so
quickly.   I raised it, sir, just in case - and I did it
with great diffidence - it may have slipped your mind, if it
had been part of your practice so to do, but I am well
aware, sir, that the p r a ctice in the Coroner's Court is very
much the practice of the i ndividual Coroner.

         TH E CORONER:    Yes.    I did c o n s i d e r the issue of
ma j o r i t y verdicts and I do not think I can really apply my
mi n d as to whether I should tell them a n y thing about
una n i m i t y at this stage.    I am very sorry, of course, that
eve r y b o d y has got to hang around but it is unavoidable.         I
cannot do a n y thing about it.       The last thing I want to do
is to try and put them under any pressure.                 I think it
wo u l d be very, very w r o n g to do that.

                            (Adjournment)
           (The Jury Returned        to Court at 2.06 p . m . )

      THE CORONER:          I u n d e r s t a n d you have a need for a

m agnifying glass?          (The Jury was provided w i t h a

m agnifying g 1a s s )      Is there anything else that you need*

whilst you are here?           I kno w we could have passed it in to

you through the door but I prefer             to do it so that it is

visible.

      A MEMBER OF T H E JURY:          Has it got    to be unanimous?

      THE CORONER:           Your question is has it got        to be a

unanimous decision and the answer to that is yes,                  it has.

I did not m e n t i o n it because I was going to tell you about

a lternatives      later,    but at the moment     the p o s i t i o n is that

I want a unanimous decision if it is at all possible,                     and

you should a p p r o a c h your task on that basis.

      A ME M B E R O F TH E JURY:      If we cannot get a verdict on

the first one or the second one,            does the last one have to

be unanimous?

      T H E CORONER:         They have all got to be unanimous,

w hi c h e v e r one you happen to be thinking about.           Is that

clear?     Okay,   off you go then.

                   (The Jury Reti r e d at 2.10 p . m . )

     T H E CORONER:        I am sorry to have d r a g g e d everybody
in for what is a trivial thing but I prefer that I do not
pass a n y t h i n g into the Jur y w i t h o u t it being d one openly
and in public.

     MR. KING:            Can I say, sir, it is e n t irely p r o p e r and
indeed e x p e r i e n c e shows if you do not fol l o w that pract i c e
on only trivial matters ultim a t e l y trouble can d e v e l o p
                                                                      56




     which one w ould not want, and certainly from those I
     represent it is preferred that everything is done in the
     open, sir.

B|        T HE CORONER:    I am relieved,        thank you.   We can all
     adjourn again.

                          (The Court A d j o u r n e d )
                      (The   jury returned at A . 10 p m )




     TrIE CORONER:   I have asked you to come back in because
I want to make an inquiry to find out what we need to do.
Is there any prospect that you are likely     to reach a verdict
within, say, the next hour or so?    No. In that cas e if
you would be kind enough to carry on until, say, A . 30, and
we will then make arrangements for a vehicle to be here and
it will convey you to a suitable location where I hope you
will have a reasonable evening.     Once you have left here,
you should cease thinking about the matter - certainly no
formal deliberations.    Take the evening off.     U a t c h TV.
Have a meal.    Do whatever suits you.     You have got t o s t a y
together.    You must not mix with anybody else.         That is
why the Jury Bailiffs are here in order to deal with that.
I would like you back for 9.30 tomorrow.       Will that be
satisfactory?

     As soon as you are back you can get back into your room
and then you just press on until we are ready to think
again.   I hope you have remembered your toothbrushes, w hich
I mentioned to you!      I suggest you carry on for about
another quar t e r of an hour.       The c oach will not be here
until then.    We have provi s i o n a l l y arran g e d it for A . 30, but
once it is h ere there is no reason why you should not go.
You have had a long, hard day.

     Is there anyth i n g any of you feel I have omit t e d to say
to the jury?

        MR. KING:   Sir,       there is an a d m i n i s t r a t i v e m a t t e r I
would    like to raise.

        T HE CORONER:        Wit h or without       the jury?

        MR.   KING:     It   would be better with o u t the jury.              ,

          THE CORONER:        Yes, all right.   All I was co n c e r n e d
a bout was that you did not want me to add any further
d i r e c t i o n s to what I have said to the jury wit h re g a r d to
this evening.

        MR.   KING:     Not at all,      sir.

     THE CORONER:   Very well, if you would leave us.       I do
not see any reason why you should come b ack into court
tomorrow morning.   I think you m i g h t as well go straight
into your room and start.   We will say a 9.30 start.

     T h e r e is one other thing I have just remembered.     In
order to avoid n o b o d y else b eing able to leave the building,
I will not accept a verdict or, indeed, do anything else,
between the hours of one and two.   That is so people can
have lunch.

                    (Th e   jury retired at 4.15 pm)

     MR. ICING:  Sir, in fact it was mor e than pure
administration but I did not want to give any clue to the
jury that it might be otherwise.

        Sir, it is just a concern which has been expressed to
me by my clients as to the approach of the jury to a
unanimous verdict.              As you know, sir, they have three
possible verdicts:             unlawful killing, accident/misadventure,
open verdict.        Sir, you very properly directed them that
they should first c o n sider unlawful killing, then move on to
accident/m i s a d v e n t u r e and then in the last resort, open
verdict.      Sir, it is the matter of their being unanimous
before moving on w h i c h is concerning my clients to this
extent, that if they are, for example, debating hotly
between themselves shall we say unlaw f u l killing, they
should not simply give up on that beca u s e they are split and
move on to the next verdict.              In fact they should be
striving for unanimity on the first verdict and only if they
reach a point that they cannot, and n e v e r will reach
u n a nimity on the first verdict, that they would m ove on to
consider the next.              Sir, if you u n d e r s t a n d what I am
saying.

      THE CORONER:          I follow what you are saying entirely.

      MR. KING:        And that there was a - a word you know
well, sir - perce p t i o n that it might hav e b e e n ^ c o n v e y e d to
the jury that because they have cot to be u n a nimous on a
verdict, that if they are in a p o s i t i o n whereby they are
just arguing about, say, unlawful killing, that they can
just give up on that and move on to the second verdict.
Sir, I m e n t i o n that n o w for your consideration.         The
impor t a n c e is that they should c o n s i d e r unlawful killing
first and strive for a unanimous v i e w before moving on.




          THE CORONER:         I must admit
                                                                         59




      THE CORONER:   I m ust admit I thought that I had made
that clear.   I admit I did not give them a specific
i nstruction about the need for unanimity until they came
back in the afternoon.

     MR. KING:        It was because of the absence of the link
between the d i r e c t i o n on u n a nimity and the way they
approached their verdicts that the perhaps lack of clarity
- not n ecessarily to the Jury, sir, but to those behind me
- has arisen.     I ment i o n it to you, sir, for your
consideration.

      THE CORONER:        Does anybody want       to make any comment?

       MR. ISAACS:     Sir, I think I can echo the remarks
that you were just making.          C e r tainly for my part I
thought you made it very clear indeed that they had to
consider the first possible verdict, then m o v e on to the
second, then move on to the third, only m o v i n g on to the
second and then on to third when they had come to the
c o nclusion that the first was no longer an option that
they felt was open to them, but if those instructing my
learned friend feel unhappy about it then no doubt you
will consi d e r that and c o n s i d e r w h e t h e r you nee d to say
an y thing else, though I mus t say it is a m a t t e r entirely
for you as to whet h e r you feel that any further d i r ection
is n e c essary because of any c o nfusion in the minds of
those who instruct my learned friend.

          MR. PAYNE:       Sir, may I just intervene to be helpful?
I would suggest that it would not be a p p r o p r i a t e that any
further dir e c t i o n should be given tonight in any event,
since there is ten minutes further d e l i b e r a t i o n and then
the Jury are going to go away until 9.30 t o m o r r o w morning.
My i m pression is the same as Mr. Isaacs, that your
d i r e c t i o n was correct, if I ma y say so, and I w ould
suggest that the most a p p r o priate thing to do w o u l d be to
have a look at the transcript w hen it is a v a i l a b l e and to
r e c o n s i d e r it in the light of w hat actua l l y appears in the
transcript, rather than relying on i mpressions w h i c h may
have been gained around the room.

          MR. HALE:      I see a point, and I d on't think it
favours anybody, it could go either way, and that is that
if they w e r e n e v e r able to r each a una n i m o u s v e r d i c t on
un l awful killing they w o u l d n ever m ove on to the next, so
therefore there mus t come a time w hen one w o u l d say to
them, "Don't hang on forever, a m a j o r i t y on the first,
w h i c h e v e r way", and if it wer e the m a j o r i t y w e r e in favour
of not finding u n l awful killing then, of course, they
w o u l d m o v e on to the next.   Tha t is the only point that
occurs to me.
                                                                         60




     THE CORONER:    Yes.  I think, Mr. King, I will think
about the point that you have mad e because I am very
anxious not to fall on a perce p t i o n point at the last
moment, so to speak.   On the other hand ....

       MR. KING:   That is why, sir, I have men t i o n e d it to
you,   for your consi d e r a t i o n in ....

     THE CORONER:   I think Mr. Payne's point is a wise
one.  Let's wait and see what is in the transcript.  We
will have plenty of time tomorrow.  If I think that it
needs amplification or amendment we can just get them back
in, it is no problem.  Are you content w ith that?

      MR. KING:      I am, sir.   Sir, the point was simply
that very properly you gave them the dir e c t i o n as to the
order in which they should consider their verdicts at a
d ifferent time from when you answered their question,
w hich came m u c h later, as to w h e t h e r or not their verdict
had to be unanimous, and it was merely the concern as to
the point at w h i c h they w ould mov e on to the second
verdict ....

      T H E CORONER:       You see the thing that worries me,
w hich is the point in a sense w hich Mr. Hale has made, and
this is why I need to consider it, is it is not for me to
tell them h o w they do their deliberations, beca u s e in
contrast to a normal, say, criminal trial w h e r e it is
either yes or no, they have got options in this instance
and in the end it is right, supposing that they w ere split
- I have got no idea - but say they were split six to five
on option one, w h a t are they to do?       Are they to come back
and say, "We cannot reach a verdict at all", or do they
say,   "Well, let's look w h e t h e r we can look at option two
and see w h e t h e r w e can r each unanimity on that".  So I am
anxious not to give them —           they have got to sort it out
amongst themselves as to what is what, but I will
certainly think about what you said and if I think it
needs amplification, I wil l be m ore than happy to do it.

          MR. KING:        Sir, could I just put the point again
very simply?            It is simply this, that given that you have
very properly invited them to strive - not .strive, but the
only verd i c t you can rece i v e is a unanimous verdict at
this stage, that they should be invited w h e n they are
c o n s i d e r i n g the first verd i c t to strive for that una n i m i t y
and that they should not simply mov e on to the second
verd i c t m e r e l y because on first c o n s i d e r a t i o n there are
d i f f e r i n g views w h i c h have yet to be thrashed out betw e e n
themselves, beca u s e in my submi s s i o n that w o u l d be an
i m p roper a p p r o a c h but it w o u l d be an easy trap to fall
into, because of course, putt i n g it very simply, the
unlawful killing verdict is o b v iously the m o r e di f f i c u l t
one to think through.
     THE CORONER:      I agree, yes.  Mr. King, I take it you
are quite content if I think about it overnight and we
deal w i t h it in the morning?  They are not coming back
today anyway.

     MR. KING:      I think, sir, it is r e alistic to*think
that they are not going to come back at 9.30 tomorrow
morning w i t h their verdict.

      THE CORONER:         Yes,    indeed.

     MR. PAYNE:   Sir, may I just add that the situation
where alternative verdicts are left to the jury does arise
in criminal trials?

       THE CORONER:        Does,    it?    T hank you.

     MR. PAYNE;     Yes. Certainly there can be a series of
counts on w hich the jury can return one verdict or
another.

       T H E CORONER:      Yes,    of course.

       MR. PAYNE:   So this situation is not unfa m i l i a r to
the criminal procedure and it is, in fact, covered in
various paragraphs in A r c hbold w h i c h perhaps I m ight make
a v ailable to you over the adjournment?

          T H E CORONER:       If you w ould be kind enough that w ould
be a con s i d e r a b l e h e l p to me.      T h a n k you very m u c h indeed.
I think we have got to be b ack here at 9.30.                     I don't know
w h e t h e r I will have the t ranscript by 9.30 but once I have
mad e up my mind if I do w a n t to talk to them any further I
will convey it to you.              T h a n k you all very m u c h indeed.

reasonable doubt;  then accident/misadventure - on the
balance of probability and finally open verdict.

     I also told you yesterday that I wanted you to reach a
unanimous verdict.   Indeed I still would like you to do so,
but it is probably right for me to tell you now, and I did
not want to do it at an-earlier*stage- and this is not an
invitation for you not to reached a unanimous verdict, but
if it were to be that you were unable to reached a unanimous
verdict I would be prepared to consider a majority verdict,
provided that the minority does not exceed two.    In other
words, at least nine of you must be agreed.    However,
please remember that in my judgment it would be infinitely
better if we were able to have a unanimous verdict from you.

     I do not want to know anything about your deliberations
at all because that is the whole point.   It is a matter for
you.   I am merely indicating to you that there is that
possibility, but do not use it if you can in fact come to a
unanimous view.   Is that all clear to you?   Good.

     Well, in that case there is nothing more to be said
tonight as far as I am concerned.   Why don't you leave us
again?   Again, like we did today, when you arrive go
straight to your room.   I cannot see a n y advantage in
coming in here and saying, "Good morning.      Carry on.
will not accept a verdict between one and two o clock, nor
will I accept any questions you might, but subject to that
we will be available whenever you wish.

     Was there anything that you wanted to ask me?          Yes,
all right, very well.

                 (The Jury retired at 4.21 ptn)

     MR. KING:   Can I just ask what the reply was of the
Member of the Jury to you when you asked him whether or not
there was anything.

     THE CORONER:      I understood him to say, ”W j have
resolved it."

     MR. KING:      I could not hear him, sir.

     TH E CORONER:  Yes,   that is all right. T ha t was my
understanding so I did not pursue it, because obviously
there had been something which they had been discussing.

     MR. MANNING:     I would agree wit h that, sir.

     T H E CORONER: Do you wish me to call them back so you
can hear it more loudly, Mr. King?   Bring them back.
Let's make quite sure I haven't misheard.
                                                              3




               (The Jury returned at 4.23 p m )

     THE CORONER:   When I asked you whether there was
something else you responded to me, but people could not
hear what you said.    I asked if there was anything else and
I understood you to say, "We have resolved it.”    Is that
what you said, or what did you actuallyrsay?

     THE FOREMAN:   No, you have given us some help.

     THE CORONER:   So I did not hear it correctly.   I am
glad I brought you back.    Very well then leave us.   I am
sorry about bringing you back but it was just as well
because I had obviously misheard you.

                (The Jury retired at 4.24 p m )

     I suppose in a way it means the same thing but I would
rather we knew exactly what they had said.

     Ladies and gentlemen, I am going to stay until half
past four.   They are not going to come back before then but
I will wait for them until that time.   We have had a long,
long inquiry, if you like, and it is good that they are
taking the matter seriously.  I am not at all surprised in
view of the interest which they have shown over the last few
months, but we will see you tomorrow at 9.30.

       THE CORONER:             I   have not com e back b e ca us e the Jury
have a s ke d me.        I want      them back for my purposes.

            (The J urv r e t u r n e d        to C ou rt at 10.31              a . m .)

       TH E CORONER:         I have a sk ed you to c ome back beca us e
I have bee n c h e c k i n g t hro ug h the t ra n sc r ip t s and look in g
at the I n q u i s i ti o ns - we have got p h ot o c o p i e s of those
and we found one or two m i n o r c o rr e c t i o n s w h ic h I want to
dr a w to your a t t e n t i o n on the typed v e rs i on so that you
can, if vou agree, adopt them and m ake the n e c e s s ar y
amendments.        Tha t is why you n ee d a sheet of paper so that
you know w h i c h of the ones I am talking about.                Some ot
them are just t y po g ra p h i c a l errors.

          You wil l r e m em b er wha t the I n q u i s i t i o n s look like and
vou will r e m e m b e r that they have got numb er s dow n the
side.        Th e first one w h i c h I want to d ra w your a t t e n t i o n
to is D avid Hawley, and on the second line w h er e it says
on the 19th, in fact it s ho ul d be the 18th.                      I op en ed tnat
on the 18th.             N one of this is a m a t t e r of m o m e n t but we
m i g n t as w ell have it right.             The next one I need to
m e n t i o n to you is J o s e p h Clark.          At the bottom, u nder
(5a), w h i c h is the r e g i s t r a t i o n part i cu la rs , we have          (
m i s s p e l t Ki r k b y ** it has to have a " k 1 in it, not             Kirby •
In the c ase of Henry T h om a s Burke, in the f if th                        there
is a typing e r r o r on his m i d d l e name.             It has an      e
instead of an "a".               It is c o r r e c t in all the o t he r places,
but it is not c o r r e c t there.             You decide, of course, but I
d r a w y our a t t e n t i o n to the errors.

          T h e n e x t one is P h i l i p J oh n Steele, and in p a r a g r a p h
 (5e) I have had typed in H i l l s b o r o u g h F oo tb a ll Ground,
 Sheffield.             T h e c o n v e n t i o n I have f ol lo w ed is that all the
 p eople who got to the h ospital, I have n am ed the p la ce of
 d e a t h as b e i ng the h ospital, and P h i l ip is one of the
 pe o p l e who got to the N o r t h e r n G e n e r a l Ho sp it al , so you
 may w i s h for c o n s i s t e n c y ' s sake to s u b s t i t u t e it.          I o ug ht
 to tell you that my n o r m al p r a c ti c e is to say " fo u nd dead
 at" the hos p i t a l , but I h av e g i v en this m a t t e r a lot of
 thou g h t and in the end I t h ou gh t it was p r o b a b l y m or e
 c o n v e n i e n t no t to us e that e x p r e ss io n, but you c an use it
 if you w i s h - "fo u nd dead", or " c e r t i f i e d dead", or just
 the nam e of the h o s pital, w h i c h e v e r it m o s t c o n v e n i e n t .
 T ha t does not a pply just to Philip, it a p pl i e s to
 e v e r y b o d y w i t h the e x c e p t i o n of Lee N ic ol w h o of c o u r s e
 did die u n d o u b t e d l y at .the hospital.                E x a c t l y the same
 p o s i t i o n a r i s e s w i t h r e g a r d to P h i l ip H am mond.       T hi s was
 a n o t h e r y o u n g lad w h e re for some r e a s on we put
 H i l l s b o r o u g h F o o t ba l l G r o u n d and if we f o l l ow the
c o n v e n t i o n it should say N o r t h e r n G e ne r al Hospital. T here
is one case w h i ch I c an n ot r e c o l l e c t no w where B eb i ng t on
is spelt w i t h two "b"s in the m i d d l e but I think if you
see it or I see it whe n we deal wit h it I will c or r ec t it
then.

     That is all the a m e n d m e n t s as far as you are
concerned.   We have got a few little a m e n d m e n t s on                   the
t^§nscrip,ts as w ell (see s e p a r a t e e rr a ta s h e e t ) .

       T he s e are not vital points but we m i g h t as wel l deal
w it h them no w so that when e v e n t u a l l y you are ready I do
not have to r ai se it then.

          TH E CORONER:            W h i le the Jur y are out can I just say
som et hi ng else a bout the d e a t h c e r t i f i c a t e s ?      I c ould do
this r ight at the end but I m i g h t                  as well take the
o p p o r t u n i t y n ow beca us e you m i g h t     wan t to know wha t the
p r o c e d u r e is.      When the I nq ue s ts are c o n c l u d e d I h av e got
to do a n o t h e r load of forms.              I c an 't use these
inquis i t i o ns , all this has got to be t r an s f e r r e d on to
a n o t h e r form.        T h os e are then sent to the R e g i s t r a r of
B irths and Deaths w ho in turn has                     to send them d o w n to
London b e c a u s e the de at hs h a v i ng taken p la ce m o r e than a
year ago, he has to be a u t h o r i s e d by s om eb o dy d ow n in
London.           T h e n they c ome all the way back to S h e f f i e l d and
the R e g i s t r a r then sets a bo ut p r e p a r i n g the d e a t h
certificates.

          Th e proc ed ur e, I u nd e rs t an d , is that he w ill then
c o n t a c t or send a let te r to you or to you r s o li ci to rs .    We
have tried to g ive him names and a d d r e s s e s so that he can
do that, and I have had a w o r d w i t h him and I t hink the
best a d v i ce I can give you is that if you have n ot h ea rd
by the end of six w ee ks - it ma y be that you w il l hear a
lot s o on e r than that but let's say six w e e ks - then get in
t ouch w i t h the R e g i s t r a r of B ir t hs and Dea th s h er e in
S h e f f i e l d and find out what has h a p p e n e d in cas e the
letter has g one astray, so that you can get your
c e r t i f ic at es .

a loud than a n y t h in g else.    We on the front row realise, of
course, that once the Jur y are out then they stay out
until they have a verdict.            The Ea s te r w e e k e n d approa ch es ,
sir, and I w o n d e r what is in the J ury s m i n d in r e l a ti o n
to the four day break?          I w o u ld not like them to feel that
they felt t h e y* w e re g oing to be i n c a r c e r a t e d for four days
if they c ould not come to a d e c i s i o n today.             Had it gone
t h r o u g h your mind, sir, to e x pl a i n that they could, of
course, if they c o u l d not r e ac h a v e rd i ct today r et u rn to
C ourt at any time over the w e ek e nd ?

          TH E CORONER:        Indeed.   I have not told them that yet
but if at the end of today they s till hav e not c om e bac k
w i t h a v e r d i c t then I will do the same as I did yest er da y.
A r o u n d 4 o ' c l o c k I wil l call them back, I will find out
wha t the p o s i t i o n is and then I will e x pl a i n to them that
we will carry on t h r o ug h Goo d Friday, and if n ee d be we
carry on t h r o u g h Saturd ay, Sunday, h o we v e r long it takes.

          MR FRASER:          C e r t a i n l y we u n d e r s t a n d that to be the
position, sir.            I just w o n d e r e d w ha t m i g h t be in the
J u r y ' s mind.     It is i m p o s s i b l e to know, but they will
r e a l i s e the w e e k e n d is c o m i ng up and we w o u l d not like
them, I am sure you w o u l d not, to feel u nd er any p r e s s u r e
b ec a u s e of that.

          T H E CORONER:           No, in de ed not.       I d o n 't r e al l y think
it is n e c e s s a r y for me to call them back and tell them
that.         Perh a p s I m i g ht     b ring it f or w ar d to 2 o ' c l o c k this
a f t e r n o o n if they         have not c om e back by then, and say to
them that there is no r e a s o n why - I am q u it e happy to be
here t o m o r r o w and S a t ur d ay if need be, h o w e v e r ^ l o n g it
takes.          I am c o n c e r n e d that if I say to them, " T o m o r r o w is
a B a n k Hol i d a y " , it may have the e x ac t o p p o s i t e effect.

       HR FRASER:          Sir,    I appreciate        that.

       T H E CORONER:         To   wha t you are     try in g to say.

           MR FRASER:           It is trying to m a k e the best of a
 d i f f i c u l t dec i s i o n, I u n d e r s t a n d that. It was just
 s o m e t h i n g that had o c c u r r e d to those who i n s t ru c t me and
it is s o m e t h i n g we w a n t e d   to c l e a r   the air about,          that   is
all.

          TH E CORONER:           O b v i o u s l y the Bank H o l i d a y may
c o n c e n t r a t e their m i n d s but if I b ring it to their
a t t e n t i o n it may have the e xact o p p o s i t e e f f e c t and that
is why I felt it was b e t t e r not to say a n y t h i n g at this
stage.          w h e t h e r it is the r i g h t d e c i s i o n or not, who
knows, beca u s e I do not k now wha t is in their m i n d s
either.           Does anyb o d y else h ave any views on this?

       MR. ISAACS:           I think the only v iew that I have,
sir,   is that b r i n g i n g them b a c k at 2 o ' c l o c k w o u l d be a
good   idea.

       TH E CORONER:          Yes,       I think    that   is p r o b a b l y   right.

       Ian Th o m a s G l o v e r
       Paul D a v i d B rady
       Barry Sidney B e n n e t t

      I h av e a l r e a d y r e m i n d e d you, and g iv en yo u the J u r y             s
fi ndings so I do not p ro p os e to repeat them.

        No w I e x p l a i ne d to you, la di es and g entlemen, that you
wer e not a l lo we d to add any riders to your verdict.
Indeed, I am not a l l o w e d to do that either, but u nd er
Rul e 43, if I' think there is any m a t t e r w h i c h I should r efer
to s o me o ne for their c o n s i d e r a t i o n then I am e n t i t l e d to do
that.        Wha t I p r o p o s e to do is that I do think there are
one or two matt er s w h i c h I think c o u l d u s e f u l l y be thou gh t
about by various bodies.                    Indeed, they may a lr ea dy have
thou gh t a bout them.             I m ak e no r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s w i t h r e g a rd
to them b e ca u se mos t of these are m a tt e r s of e x p e r t i s e as
o pp o s e d to m er e c o m m o n s e n s e and t he re may be p r o b le m s w h i c h
I am not expert e n ou g h to be abl e to d e a l with.                          H ow ev er , I
feel t here a re one or two m a tt e r s w h i c h I do w a n t t o d r a w to
c er ta in persons' a t t e n t i o n so they can a pply their m i n d to
them.        W h il s t I w o u l d not w i s h to add ri de rs or, indeed,
ma ke r ec om me n da t io n s, I just p ro p os e to o u tl i n e the m a m
topics w h i c h h av e o c c u r r e d to me as I h a v e bee n s i tt i n g
 listening, t og et h er w i t h you, to e v i d e n c e w h i c h we h av e
heard.

          T he first m a t t e r that I t hink c o n c e r n s me is t’          ne
p r o b l e m w h i c h I t hi nk was i l l u s t r a t e d by the fact that if
you h av e p eo pl e l o o k i n g in on e d i r e c t i o n p a r t i c u l a r l y
i nt en t ly to w a t ch an event, as indeed on e w o u l d get at a
f oo tb al l m a t c h or, indeed, at o t h e r m a j o r events, it may
p ro ve very d i f f i c u l t to turn them round, if I can use that
term, so that they us e e s c a p e r o u t es w h i c h are at the b a c k
or at the sides.                 T h a t is the first thing.

          T h e s e c o nd thing is that I know, b e c a u s e w e m a d e
in quiries, that a lot of w o r k has b ee n d o n e in c o n n e c t i o n
w i t h a i r c r a f t d i sa s t e r s , p a r t i c u l a r l y a r i s i n g ou t of the
M a n c h e s t e r air d is a st e r, on p e o p le e s c a p i n g from a e r o p l a n e s
in stress s i t u a t i o n s and w h a t h a p p e n s w i t h r e g a rd to g a t e s
and w he n they m o v e f o rw a r d a nd so on.                       A g r ea t d ea l of wor k
has b ee n d o n e by Dr. H a n n a h M u i r and o t h e rs at their
r e s e a r c h e s t a b l is h me n t .

           I t h in k it w o u l d be b e n e f i c i a l if on e c o u ld b r i n g
 t o g et h er i n f o r m a t i o n from d i f f e r e n t s ou rc es w h i c h may h av e
 a p p l i c a t i o n s in o t h e r fields and so I in te nd to w r i t e to the
 a p p r o p r i a t e a u th o ri t ie s , for example, the Fire S e r v i c e and,-
 indeed, Dr. M ui r and see w h e t h e r or not t h e r e isn t s ome
 s co pe w he r eb y i n f o r m a t i o n can be p o o l ed and perhaps
 i m p r o v e m e n t s m ad e w i t h r e g a rd to f u t u r e safety.
                                                                                 12




          The s ec o nd thing that c o n c er n s me is the Safety
C er ti ficate.         I am, of course, a ware that there is a n e w
one in force, and we have not been c o n c e r n e d w i t h that,
but one of the factors w h i c h we all b e c a m e a ware of was
not only that there w er e p r o b le m s on the t er races but that
there were p r o b le m s w i t h i n the t ur n st i le areas, and it
seems to me that some a d d i t i o n a l thought m a y b e is r eq ui r ed
to see w h e t h e r there is not some way of m o r e e f f e c t i v e l y
c o n t r o l l i n g ingress, b e c a u s e at the monient, of course,
there is no s ys te m of counting, as far as I unders ta nd ,
into the t u rn st il e area, so one is in fact left w i t h
e xa c t l y       the same p o s i t i o n as one was before, n am e ly that
you have to            estimate           the n u m b e r s w it h in that a rea by eye.

         W h e t h e r that is a s i t u a t i o n w h i c h can be o v e r c o m e or
not I do not know, but I do intend to w r i t e b ot h to the
L ocal Authority, as the e n f o r c i n g a uthority, and indeed
a lso to          the Club, to      ask them to apply their               m in ds to that
part of           the Ground. We hav e tended to think of si mp ly the
terraces and the pens but I think one has to go a little
further and think about the area without.                        T h er e may be no
solution, I d on't know, but I feel that it is a m a t t e r
w h i c h I w o ul d like to think I had d ra wn to s o me b o d y ' s
attention.

          With r eg a rd to the Safety C e rt if ic at e, I am of c ou r se
a w a r e that Lor d Jjustice T a y l o r spent a g r ea t dea l of time,
in fact m u c h m or e time, w i t h r eg a rd to r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s
 than I have done, and he did m a k e r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s w it h
r e g a r d to i ns pe ct o ra t es , but it seems to tne, and 1 intend
to w r i t e to the Home S e c r e t a r y on this, that w i t h a m a t t e r
suc h as sa fe ty in sport s g r ou n ds it m i gh t perh ap s be w o r t h
l o o k i n g at no t sim pl y an i n s p e c t o r a t e but p o s s i b l y an
h o m o g e n o us , n ational, l icensing, a pp ra is al , i n s p e c t i n g
o r g a n i s a t i o n or service, b e c a u s e at the mome nt , of course,
the Safety C e r t i f i c a t e s are i s su e d by local a u th or it ie s,
there are m an y of them, and eac h one of t hem has a
r e l a t i v e l y small n u m b e r of sports grounds.          H o w e v e r hard
the p eo p le w i t h i n the a u t h o r i t i e s may try and h o we v e r
c ompetent, their e x p e r i e n c e wil l be l i m i t e d and I w ou ld
like some thou gh t to be g i v e n to w h e t h e r it w o u ld not be
better in the i nt e re s ts of sa fe ty if a body of e x p e r t i s e
c o u l d be b ui lt up w h i c h (a) a pp l ie s m o r e u n i f o r m
s tandards, and (b) w o u l d be in a m u c h b e t t e r p o s i t i o n to
as s e s s r isk and so on at any p a r t i c u l a r stadium, so ny
i n t e n t i o n is to w r i t e to the Hom e S e c r e t a r y and ask him to
c o n s i d e r that.

          In a d d i t i o n such a b ody w o u l d hav e - and this is a
f u r t h e r p oi nt w h i c h I w i s h to d r a w to his a t t e n t i o n - or
m a y b e some o t h e r body, the f ac il i ty for e n s u r i n g that
t here is b o t h p r o p e r t r a i ni n g and the e s t a b l i s h m e n t of
c o n t i n u i t y of i n f o r m a t i o n _from one p er s on to another, in
o r d e r to try and e n s u re that p r a c t i c e w h i c h is good and
                                                                                            13




    sound is pas se d on and c o n t i n u e s to be a p p l i e d and be
    d eveloped, but even if s uc h a body was not set up, of
    course, w i th i n each o r g a n i s a t i o n that may be i n v o lv e d in
    s ta g i n g m a j or events w h e r e loads of p eo pl e c ome toget he r
    g r e a t ef f or t should, I am sure, be put into bot h training
    and the need for c o nt i n u i t y of some sort or another.

              T h er e is a n ot he r as pe ct w h i c h I w ant to w r i t e on - it
    all h a p p en s to be the Hom e Secretary, b ecau se it h a p p e ns to
B   be his d ep ar tment, i n c l u d i n g the first poi nt.                One has to
    ask o n e s e lf the q ue st i o n as to w h e t h e r or not the
    i n v o l v e m e n t of the P o li c e in the a c t i v i t i e s w i t h i n the
    S t a d i u m is a pr op er use of b ot h their trai ning, e x p e r t i s e
    and abilities, and I w o u ld like to s u gg es t to the Home
    S e c r e t a r y that this is s o m e t h i n g w h i c h nee ds, in my view,
    a d d r e s s i n g as a m a t t e r of r e l a t i v e u r ge nc y , to m a k e some
    d e c i s i o ns as to who, in fact, on the safet y side should
    have (a) the u l t i m a t e a uthority, (b) the e x p e r t i s e and (c)
    the r es p on s ib i li t y.

              It is a m a t t e r of c o n s i d e r a b l e r e gr e t to me to say
    that w hi ls t we w er e s it t in g d u r i n g these I nq uests, and
    w i t h o u t me m ak i ng any e ffort to kee p a b r e a s t of events, I
    read in the paper of one f o o t ba l l d i s a s t e r in South
D   Africa, w h e r e about 40 p eo pl e d ied as a r e su l t of c rush
    injuries.           T h e r e w er e at least two o t he r n o n f oo tb al l
    s i t u a t i o n s that I remember, one was a br oa d w h e r e n u mb er s
    of p e o p l e w er e i n ju r ed and killed, and a l t h o u g h in the
    event n o b o d y was s e r i o us l y hurt, just last S a t u r d a y in the
    town in w h i c h I live there was a c r u s h i n g i n c i d e n t at a
    footb al l match.             So a l t h o u g h it w o u l d be n i c e for me to
    say we hav e had all this inquiry, we h a v e d i s c u s s e d it and
    e v e r y t h i n g else, it w il l n e v e r h ap p en again, u nl e ss there
    is c o n s i d e r a b l e , c o n t i n u o u s v i g i l a n c e and p e r h a p s eve n a
    c h a n g e of a t t i t u d e w i t h r e g a r d to m at ches, I fear it will
    h a pp e n a g ai n and it w il l be, of c o u r s e --- well, you know
    h ow a wful it has been onc e but to hav e it a g a i n w o u l d be
    just that m u c h worse.                 H o w y o u s ol ve it - the onl y safe
    stadium, in my view, is an e mp ty one.                             As soo n as you
    b ring a s u b s t a n t i a l n u m b e r of p e o p l e t o g e t h e r you run
    risks, and w h e t h e r it is p o s s i b l e to hav e t e r ra c es w h er e
    p e o p l e s ta nd w i t h o u t r is k I h av e doubts.              So I intend
    a ga in to d r a w these t ho ug ht s to the Hom e S e c r e t a r y and see
    what, if anything, he can or w i s h e s to do.

              Finally, and I am c h e a t i n g a li tt le bit b e ca u s e this
    is not a c t ua l ly a s af e ty matt er , I do i n te n d to w r i t e to
    the Home S e c r e t a r y and ask h im to s e r i o u s l y a pply his m in d
    to the i n t e r - r e l a t i o n s h i p b e t w e e n c or o ne r s' i n q ue s ts and

          I w an t to turn to you, ladies and gentl em en .                  I want
to say first of all that you h av e had an i n fi n i t e l y h ar de r
task than I had imagined.            I k new it was g oing to be p r e t ty
hard for you but in fact it has b een harder.                         I w an t to
thank yo u for your p er s e v er a nc e , for y o u r interest, for your
atte nt io n, for your c o u r a g e in r e a c h i n g d e c i s i o n s and
a n n o u n c i n g them. I adm ir e you.       W h a t m or e can I say?           I
thank you.

        It is wit hi n my p o w e r to e x c u s e y o u from jur y s er v ic e
in Coroners' courts.             It is not in my p ow er to e x c u se you
from o t h e r courts, but as far as I am c on ce r ne d , s u bj e ct to
a p r ov i so w h i c h I w il l m e n t i o n in a m o me nt , I in te nd to
excuse y o u from C o r o n a l jury s e r v i c e for the r est of y our
lives.         I t hink yo u h av e d o n e y ou r bit.       T h e onl y p r ov i so I
ha ve is that if any of you do not w i s h m e to do that, p l e a se

w ant to e xc u se you if it w a s n ' t s o m e t h i n g you want ed , but if
I do not h ea r to you I w il l w r i t e a le tt er to yo u in due
course, or at least my J u r y O f f i c e r w i l l w ri te y o u a l e t t e r
to c o n f i r m that so y ou h ave got it.

          I w an t to re mi nd yo u that r ig ht at the o p e n i n g on the
18th of April, 1990, w he n you first c a m e together, I d r e w
your a t t e n t i o n to the fact that this w o u l d be s t re ss fu l,
that things m i g h t get to you.                  If you r e m e m b e r I r e m i nd e d
yo u that one of the g ood things was yo u had y o u r s e l v e s and
that yo u c o u ld s u p p o r t one another.                I did at that p oint
a l l u d e to the p o s s i b i l i t y that if e x t e r n a l h e l p was n e e d e d
b ec a u s e you had p r o b l e m s y o u r s e l v e s w i t h c o p i n g w i t h the
situa ti on , then one sh o ul d s eek it.                   I w an t to r e p e a t that
but I w a n t to add one or two a d d i t i o n a l points.                      W h e n we
hav e f in is h ed today yo u will, of course, be s p l i t t i n g up and
in that s en se you w il l lose the f e l l o w s h i p of the e l e v e n of
yo u w h i c h yo u h av e b u il t up o ve r s e v e r a l months.

          I do not w an t to s u gg e s t for a m i n u t e that y o u are
go in g to need any c o u n s e l l i n g or any h e l p or a n y t h i n g of the
sort, but you may do and there w o ul d be no s hame if y ou did.
If yo u do, r e m e m b e r t hat y ou r GP is the first port of call.
Yo u m a y not like him, d o n ' t go to him, but he s h o u ld be in a

d i f f i c u l t i e s that you may need, w i t h c o u n s e l l i n g and
a s s i s t a n c e and support.              If you do w i s h to take a d v a n t a g e
of that then the p er s o n to c o nt ac t w o u ld be
Mr. D avid Webber.                    He is the s en i or p ri n ci p al s oc i al wo rk er

          Wha t I want you to k no w is that you do not h a v e to be

feels no sense of e l a t i o n today, a s en se of relief, of

At 0900 hours on Saturday 15 April 1989 Mr
Peter Francis TOOTLE Senior, awoke his son,
Peter Francis TOOTLE, deceased, who was to
travel to Sheffield in order to attend the FA
Cup Semi Final football match that day.

Peter Francis TOOTLE, left Liverpool at 1030
hours and travelled to Sheffield with his
uncle Stephen TOOTLE and a friend, Colin
Norman FRODSHAM. They travelled in Stephen
TOOTLE'S motor vehicle, arriving in Sheffield
at 1230 hours. After parking the vehicle
they made their way to the ground and stood
on the Lepp+^igs Lane Bridge from 1300 hours
until 1440 hours when Stephen TOOTLE left to
take up his seat in the stands.

At 1445 hours Colin Norman FRODSHAM and Peter
Francis TOOTLE joined the crowd at the
turnstiles. GATE 'C1 was opened and both Mr
FRODSHAM and Mr TOOTLE entered the stadium
via Gate 'C1. They went along the tunnel and
into Pen 3 and with the pressure of the crowd
from behind ended up approximately 8 feet
from the perimeter fence. Mr FRODSHAM became
unconscious for a short time and when he
regained consciousness he found himself
further up the terrace. He could see Peter
TOOTLE lying on his back about five yards
away from himself. There was a police
officer, who as yet has not been identified,
attempting to resuscitate Mr TOOTLE. The •
officer was unsuccessful in his attempts and
moved on to assist other people. Mr FRODSHAM
was assisted from the terrace and
 subsequently attended hospital.

CIRCUMSTANCES

At about 0700 hours on Saturday, 15 April
1989, Mr James Stephen WILLIAMS saw his son,
Kevin Daniel WILLIAMS, deceased, leave the
family home with the intention of travelling
to Sheffield. He was to travel by train with
a number of his friends to watch the F.A. Cup
Semi Final football match at Hillsborough
Stadium. Kevin Daniel WILLIAMS had a ticket
for the match.

Andrew DUNCAN travelled to Sheffield with
Kevin Daniel WILLIAMS, Thomas James NICKSON
and Gregory FAGEN by train arriving at
Sheffield at about 1040 hours. Gregory FAGEN
left the others at the station. The other
three youths caught a bus from the station to
Hillsborough Stadium where Thomas NICKSON
left them.

Andrew DUNCAN entered the stadium with Kevin
Daniel WILLIAMS at about 1330 hours via the
Leppings Lane turnstiles. They initially
stood together in Pen 4 but after a short
time moved into Pen 3 . At about 1445 hours
Andrew DUNCAN saw other friends on the
terraces including Anthony Maxwell GRIER and
Stuart THOMPSON (Deceased Reference Number
 At about 1455 hours Andrew DUNCAN was still
 with Kevin WILLIAMS and although the crowd in
 the pen was tightly packed he was not too
 concerned at that time. As the match started
 he was pushed forwards down the terrace and
 did not see Kevin Daniel WILLIAMS again.

  Following the severe crushing in the West
  Stand terracing Police Constable 1790 Michael
  John CRAIGHILL went into Pen 3 and assisted a
  number of casualties. Police Constable
  CRAIGHILL assisted to carry a youth, he now
  believes to be Kevin Daniel WILLIAMS, from
  the gate in the perimeter fencing of Pen 3
  onto the pitch. The officer attempted
  resuscitation but without success.

   Derek William BRUDER is a Police Constable
   with Merseyside Police and was at the match
   as a spectator in the North Stand. He
   recalls seeing a person lying on the pitch
   near the Spion Kop/North Stand having
•^"convulsions. Mr BRUDER went onto the pitch
   and gave mouth to mouth resuscitation aided
   by a St Johns Ambulanceman who carried out
   cardiac massage. Mr BRUDER recalls that a
   friend of the casualty was with him on the
   pitch. Resuscitation was continued and they
                                                                3.




                                              were joined by a St Johns Ambulance woman who
                                              took over from Mr BRUDER. After a short time
                                              the St Johns Ambulanceman said that the

ADDENDUM


Michael Thomas HQLLINGHURST. an off duty
nurse, was a spectator at the match, and was
in Pen 4 at the Leppings Lane end of the
ground, when he became aware of the
increasing pressure being exerted on him by
the crowd. After being subjected to this
pressure for approximately 15 minutes, Mr
HOLLINGHURST became aware of a space being
 created around him, and on looking down to
 the floor of the terracing, he saw a man he
 now knows to be Paul William CARLILE. Mr
 HOLLINGHURST, saw that Mr CARLILE was blue in
 the face, and on not detecting a pulse, he
 tried to resuscitate Mr CARLILE, by heart
 massage and mouth to mouth resuscitation. Mr
 CARLILE failed to respond to the emergency
 treatment. Mr HOLLINGHURST then moved on to
 treat another casualty. (Now known to be
 David HAWLEY deceased reference 8 ).

Mr HOLLINGHURST has viewed photographs of Mr
CARLILE and his clothing taken in the
temporary mortuary and confirms from these
that Mr Paul William CARLILE is one of the
persons he tried to revive. He has signed a
Plan of the terracing where he found and
treated Mr CARLILE, Reference Number MTH/1.

CIRCUMSTANCES

At about 1410 hours on Saturday, 15 April
1989, Richard JONES, deceased, left his home
in Sheffield with his sister, Miss Stephanie
l inda JONES and Tracey Elizabeth COX,
deceased (Reference Number 19). It was their
intention to attend the F.A. Cup Semi Final
football match which was to be played at the
Hillsborough Stadium that day. All three
 persons had tickets for the terraces at the
 West Stand.

On arrival at the stadium they joined a
large crowd outside the Leppings Lane
turnstiles. After some minutes they entered
the stadium via Gate C and walked together
along the tunnel beneath the West Stand and
onto the terraces. Miss JONES is unable to
 say which Pen they entered but it has now
 been established as Pen 3 . She was with her
 brother and Miss COX as they entered the
 terraces but after a few seconds she was
 subjected to a surge of pressure which forced
 her towards the front of the terracjng. In
 the crush that followed she was separated
 from both her brother and Miss COX.

 Following the severe crushing in the West
 Stand terracing Police Constable 2220 Paul
 BROMLEY went onto the pitch and assisted
 injured persons. The officer saw a number of
 supporters carrying a man, now known to be
                                  Richard JONES, across the pitch on a
                                  hoarding. He assisted to carry Mr JONES to
                                  the rear of the North Stand where he
                                  attempted resuscitation but without success.
                      1           The officer was assisted to carry Mr JONES
                                  into the gymnasium where a temporary mortuary
                                  had been set up.

Pages 2 1 - 2 3       4-          At 1 6 0 0 hours Doctor Nicholas Andrew
                                   SFTVEt^RIGHT examined Mr JONES in the

                                   to Police Constable BROMLEY at the temporary
                                   mortuary.

                      6       .    The officer later escorted the body of Mr
                                   JONES to the Medico Legal Centre and
Page   29                          confirmed the identification to Detective
                                   Constable 638 Simon WEIGOLD.

                          7   .    On Monday, 17 April 1989, following
                                    identification by Detective Constable

                                 the presence of ethanol was detected. The

                                 supports the evidence that he entered the
                                 stadium via Gate C with his sister and Miss
                                 COX, deceased (Reference Number 19).

At about 1100 hours on Saturday 15 April 1989
Ian Thomas GLOVER, deceased and his brother
Joseph GLOVER left the family home to travel
to Sheffield with the intention of watching
the FA Cup Semi final football match which
was to be played at the Hillsborough Stadium
that day. Both men were in possession of
tickets for the Leppings Lane terraced area
of the ground.

At about 1430 hours the brothers arrived at
the stadium and entered through a turnstile
before going through the tunnel and into Pen
3. They took up a position in the centre of
the pen which at that time was packed with
spectators. Joseph GLOVER states that
following a surge in the crowd he and his
brother were pushed forward in the pen and
that he managed to get out onto the pitch via
a gate in the front perimeter fence. He then
 saw his brother, Ian, in a distressed
 condition standing in the crowd about four
feet from the front of Pen 3 .

About 20 minutes later Joseph GLOVER saw his
brother being pulled from the pen and onto
the pitch by two police officers who have not
been identified. Joseph GLOVER attempted to
resuscitate his brother who was then placed
on a temporary stretcher and carried across
the pitch by a number of persons ^includi ng
Police Constable 1100 Kostanti Josef FOJUT.

nurse who has not been identified examined
Ian Thomas GLOVER^/before he was carried into
the gymnasium where a temporary mortuary had
been set up.

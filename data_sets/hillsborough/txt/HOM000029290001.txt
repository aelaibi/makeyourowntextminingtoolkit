      NOTE


                                         DELAY




      Facts on the Core Bundle

1.    On 5th June, 1986 a letter was sent to the Chief Fire Officer and others
      indicating that the redrafting would shortly be completed (312). The
      report to the Panel on 6th May says that the conditions are "a cause for
      concern...... inadequate or inappropriate in same areas....." (314).

2.    On 7th July, 1987 (387) the Fire Service was written to with a copy of the
      new draft Conditions and they replied on 13th August (409).

3.    In September 1987 (417) the Panel received a report saying that the new
      draft Conditions were progressing steadily and it was hoped to submit them
      to the Panel for final approval in October.

4.    On 30th March, 1989 copies of the final draft circulated (481).   Therefore
       the apparent delay June 1986 to April 1989.

      Questions

      "Why the delay? Do v.e accept "inordinate delay"? Why were the Club not
      Involved earlier? Why did we not notify the Club that the conditions were
      subject tp review? How far do we now think the draft is satisfactory?
      Any further review?

      Comments

1.    The wording of the report in June 1986 was unfortunate it would be more
       accurate to say that the conditions whilst giving no serious cause for
       concern did contain same matters which required looking at.

2.    The reviewing task took much longer than I originally anticipated owing to
       a number of factors:-

       (a)   Between January 1986 and Decsnber 1988 there was an unusual amount
             of legislation giving rise to complex issues in the field of
             licensing. Dealing with new legislation led to work over and above
             routine work. Further, even with established legislation complex
             and unusual problems can arise frcm time to time. For the sake of
             convenience I term such work as "exceptional" and it is that
             "exceptional" workload which was increased substantially not only
             in relation to Safety of Sports Grounds Administration but in
             relation to other matters (see Chronology).

       (b)   I expected to receive at any time same indication of draft model
             conditions probably via the Home Office which would have helped in
             the drafting task. I finally confirmed at a Seminar organised by
             the Institute of Building Control > entitled "Safety at Sports
             Grounds" on 15th October, 1987 that the Hone Office was not taking
             any role in the drafting of model conditions.

Other Comments

The Club was not involved in the redraft of the certificate conditions as
there would be no point in doing so until they were reasonably well
finalised.  I recall mentioning the redrafting of the conditions at the
1986 inspections and inviting the Clubs to make comments on the existing
conditions if they wished to do so although I cannot find any record in
writing of this comment.

The new draft which was circulated in 1989 needs by reference to the
comments made by individual officers some further work and it is likely
that no certificates will be issued until after the interim report of the
Inquiry.

The Council has authority and power to to take action immediately in the
event of a perceived serious risk to spectators.

believe was          due to arrive at 2.Q2              pm    (1402),

We had been standing                 in the R a il wa y S t at io n a rea i o r      a considerable

length of time,             when a me ssage was           passed o v t h e         radio to the effect

that     a ssistance was          required at a store xml led the                  ’Gate wa y *

w hich was about 20G yards away froii^ne R a i l w a y Station,                           further along

H ali f a x Road.        Myself,       in c o m p l y   with several        other    officers,

proce e d e d to this          l o c a 1 1 oriV!m foot,      but as we a pp ro ac he o the

’G a t e w a y s    a call     ov\fr J m e     radio stated no further a ssistance was

re q u i re d .

My o b s e rvations whilst             in this area made rri^/Sware that hundreds                     of

Li v e r po o 1 su p po rter s were          standing ancL/si tt i ng around d r :i.n k i n g a 1 c o h o 1

from     cans?      almost     everyone        of themyftfas holding a four-pack             (beer/

After     only a few minutes              we    returned back       to Wads 1ey Bridge Rail wa y

S t a t 1o n .     Whilst     stood    there     I saw numerous Liverpool             supporters

walk i n g       down Halifax Road           in the dir e ct io n of the football            ground many

of them          carrying     cans    of beer/lager.

The    train arri v e d at about 2 pm (1400)                    ouj^two     serials were          positioned

a long    the exit       from the station and or^o                 the Halifax Road,         where

several          moun t e d officers      were waiting         to assist     in the escort          of the

supporters,          this     took    several minutes,          then we wa lk ed the        supporters

towards          the ground,     these       particular       s upporters were all well             behaved

and there were           no    incidents        to   report.

We a rr i v e d at the ground,               the Leppings Lane        entrance where         the

supporters we had e s c o r te d went                 through the outer           gate towards       the

turnstiles.

We then were           told to take up a position on Leppings Lane                        near      to tjae

br i d g e , whilst      I was       stood the r e rmme r ous       suppo rters we r e still

a r r i v i n g many of w h i c h were          still   drinking     beer    or    xa cje r , also many

knew where             they   could be     purchased.           It was       very apparent        that    lots of

people       had travelled           to H i ll s bo r ou g h without          tickets.

It w ould be approxirrtately £.4-'3 put ( '1445)                       when    I was aware        that Riors

and more         people were arriving,              hundreds          in fact.

I had      part        of a i.Tiessage over       the    ra^io that          indicated that the           game

was    g o i ng to be delaye d , and              in & kct      I told several           supporters       this.

I just       don't       know where a ill t'rysae supporters                  were     cursing from,      the

area at this time was                 congested.             I also    saw tfy n ,     peop 1 e stood waiting

near     the turnstiles were               being    lifted over           1)/ b fencing to a vo id what

a p p e a r e d to       be a crushing situation.                     were also several

y o a n ge s t e r s     climbing    over the wall           intjr the ground.

It w ou l d be           shortly after 3 pm         ( iVfljin w hen       1 heard a loud, cheer from

inside       the ground,         w hich    I assu m e d was the kick-off.                     There were      still

h undreds        of supporters         outside      the ground          pushing ^ w a r d s       the

entrances.

Several        minutes        elap s e d w hen    I heard a mesa^fe over                the    radio

not    certain but            I believe     the message                be similar        to HA i 1 available

o fficers attend              i mmediately       inside-f*he ground."                On hearing        this   I ran

towards        the turnstiles.             Fo 11 owing rne was PC 451 Cooper , whom f or the

rest     of this         incident     I was      in company with.              We    both jumped over a

turnstile          ran to the       rear    of the South S tand down through the seating

area     into      the    playing area,          at which       point     I could see          there

was      a large         crowd    problem at the             rear   of the Leppinqs L a n e end goal

posts. I went            immediately       to this area and             I saw thaj*-"peopie were

b e i n g c rus h e d o n the       perimeter       fencing?          also    u jjf the s i de— f enci ng ,

together         with PC Cooper           I stood on the smaLT wall                    near the    perimeter

fencing avid began               lifting    people       over t h jf f e n c i n g .     I lost    count      of

how many we got out                but they main^y             consisted of younger              people,      all

of w hich had eithr               climbed near          to the top of the fence,                 or had been

lifted up fay fellow supporters,                        we    carried on doing           this    for what

                                                                                             gpp 9g>

ieemed hours,         a lthough/!          realise    it w a s n ’t? when   it seemed that      the

m a j o r i t y of s u p p o r t s    w er s^out     of any further     crushing    problems.

Myseit     and PC Caro               together with some other           people?    carried a

,i,eenaq/? boy to                           a makeshift     stretcher?      in my opinion this

boy^was     dead.      I >5on ’t know who we handed the body to?                   but a police

officer     told me where            to    put the body.

We .returned to the            playing area and a ss is t ed         in giving first aid

whe re ev er we     could.

Later    on when almost all                the   injured were    taken away myself and PC

Cooper went        into the stand where              the   incident had occurred.         This    I

u nd er st oo d was ma in ly         to protect      the scene     due to several     groups     of

supporters       standing       nearby.          It was at this     time when a y outh from one

of the groups         threw some water             over myself and PC Cooper.           No ac ti on

was    taken with      regard        to this due to the fact          that   the supporters

still    in the stand were                in my opinion a ng ry and anno ye d and        in doing

an ything may have            caused further         problems.

Most    of the supporters             had by now left the ground?            the ones    that

remained were         spoken to?          and slowly and       carefully asked to       leave    the

ground?     this they did wit hout any                 problems.

We then made        our way to frJadsiey Bridge S t at io n a nd met other irisniflsrs

of our     seria1.       We    then went         to Clayw he el s Lane and were      later   stood

down.

           to took up a position at the Leppings Lane turnstiles this was to

           search fans prior to entering the grounct, I cannot remember all the

         searched.     I remember that many cans of beer,    lager, and pop were

         either taken from them or they handed them over as they approached us.

         The supporters were in my opinion generally speaking well behaved,

         there was lots of the supporters who had obviously been drinking but

         none who I saw were drunk.     There was also a couple of occasions when

         more supporters seemed to be entering the ground from what had been a

         steady or constant flow.

         After the kick off and all the supporters were in the ground I,

         together with my serial, attended in the ground,          stood at the rear of

         the tunnel which Leads to pens 3 and 4, a t no time did I enter the

                 e to most of the tunnel being full of sup porters, although the

                 area was fairly well    congested the supporters were well behaved

                 m the view I got there was no pushing taking place,

                 mately 10 to 15 minutes    later our serial attended at the gym

                 the ground and took our meal.      We later took up a position on

                 s Lane awaiting the end of the match,      the match ended and we

                 sed the dispersal of the Liverpool      supporters and as I remember

                 as no incidents to report.

         With reference to any gates being blocked or closed within the ground

           do not remember seeing anything       regarding this.

               Public House               on Halifa x         R o ad.      Many     supporters            had     to     be s t o p p e d a n d

               told     to    finish        off       the    cans     or    bottles         of a l c o h o l     they were

               drinking.           Most         did    so w i t h o u t    objection           but     som e     argued        the    p o in t

               about      being       stopped.              There     were     hundreds          of    discarded          bottles          and

               cans w h i c h       the L i v e r p o o l       supporters          had      left      on the       pavement.              At

               about      2.45pm a disturbance                      occurred        in the        car      park     of    th e    ’G a t e

I n n ’ and    with       other        officers            we    ushered          a group        of a b o u t         12 L i v e r p o o l

supporters          away       from     the        premises.             Apparently             a disturbance                had

occurred       in the          pub     between           locals       and       the L i v e r p o o l       lads        who were

the    worse       for    drink.            No     complaints            from      the    landlord              or    other

customers.              The    atmosphere             however         was       ’simmering''              and    th e    landlord

was    asked       to    close       the     bar.          This     he      did and       the     pub w a s           closed

without       further          incident.              Resumed         static         points       on H a l i f a x         Road,

3.05pm       (1505)       still        in    position Halifax                     Road    junction Claywheels                         Lane.

3.20pm       (1520)       PC    Goss        (A3)       informs        us     that     all       officers             directed         to

ground.        In       company        other          officers        to P e n i s t o n e       Road       entrance            and

entered       ground.           Radio            communications              appeared           to    be        scrambled.

Insp.     Townend         directed               us   to     the    ramp        giving      access          to K o p      end.        Two

male    bodies          were    laid        behind         th e m e t a l       railings         at       side       of K o p a n d P S

Cropley       (A1)       and    another            officer         were      dealing        with          them.

We    held    people          back     so    they        could      not      view     the       bodies          which      were       then

placed       into a n         ambulance.

Other     ambulances            were        trying         to    enter       the     ground       but       had       difficulty

because       of    the       amount        of     people        milling          about     in the a r e a .               Insp.

Townend       then       directed           us     onto      the    pitch where             a    cordon          of     officers

stretched          from       one    side        to   the       other.          I could         see       hundreds         of

Liverpool          supporters           milling            about      on     the     pitch.           A    lot a p p e a r e d

dazed and ma n y              were     in t ear s ,          anger       and      frustration              caused        t h e m to

supporters          were       ushered           back      behind        th e     cor don.        Sergeants              and

Inspectors          appeared           to        be a i m l e s s l y    milling         about        and        direct         r a dio

3.50pm         (1550)       A    group        carrying            the       body       of a w h i t e          male    on a b o a r d

were      having        trouble            and     I gave         assistance                to     carry       this    person          to     the

rear      of    the     stand.             When we          got       there       I could           see      over     SO    bodies          l aid

out    most       appeared            to    be     dead.          The       person          I ha<jl h e l p e d       to    carry was

about       35 years            old and was                obviously             de ad.          No/sign        of    life,       his

chest       appeared            to    be    crushed.              One       of    the       fans     who       had    helped        to

carry       the    body         attempted             mouth       to m o u t h .           (I got        the    impression             it w a s

his    brother.)                I told        him       it w a s       useless             as    the m a n w a s       obviously

dea d .        I then       returned             to     the      pitch and as sisted                      in    carrying          another

b o dy,     again       white         male       in 3 0 ’s .           Deposited                b o d y at     rear    of

Cantilever            stand          with     others            and an       officer             attempted           mouth       to m o u t h .

4.05pm         (1605)           Returned           to      pitch and             assisted           co r d o n .      The       situation

still       appeared            chaotic.              No    tannoy announcement                          was    made       to    the

crowd .         I got       the       feeling           that      had an an no un ce me nt                     been made

explaining            the       gravity          of     the      situation,                t he L i v e r p o o l     supporters              may

have      cleared        the         pitch and             given       the       emergency            services         a    clear        run.

F i nally an          announcement                 was      made       to    the       effect        t hat      the    match        had

been abandoned.                      Then Kenny             Dalglish             appealed           to    the      fans     to    co­

operate.

I waited          for    a Police             announcement                  but       it    never        came.

4.20pm         (1620)           Insp.       Townend             ordered          us    back       to C l a y w h e e l s        Lane     to

supervise          the      loading           of      bus e s .        The       serial          strength was              d o w n to

about       5 men.

In    c om pa n y PC        Braim          (A3)       spoke       to    drivers             giving        emergency             number        to

phone       and    requested               they       leave       as    s o o n as          possible.

We    were      subject          to a       continuous                tirode          of    verbal        abuse       and       threats

the    most       common         o ne      being        "Murdering               bastards".

It w a s       however          interesting                to    note       that       many Liverpool                 fans       returning

to    the      buses     had         been and           bought         packs          of    beer     to      take     on the        buses.

6pm    (1800)         all       but     two      buses          had    left.

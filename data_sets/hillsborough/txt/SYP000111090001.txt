             On S at ur da y     15 April          1989,    at 9 . 0 0 a m     I commenced duty at E c c l e sf i el d

             Police S ta t io n and was              then t r an sp or te d down to H i l l s b o r o u g h Football

             G ro un d where at         10.00am        I a t t e nd e d a briefing          for the Semi- Final

             Football       Match between Liverpool                       and N o t ti n gh a m Forest.     My duties

              for    that event were              on serial       19 and the officer             in charge       of that
                                                    rnmmmummmmmmm imum■   *

              serial was PS 32 3 P r o c t o r .              At about         11.00am after the          briefing

              together wit h the            rest of the serial                  I went to the L ep pings Lane                 end

              of the g r o u n d .      Our       duties were         oii^si^de the ground and were                to

              s upervise      the arrival           of the Liverpool                supporters    in and ar ou nd the

              turnstile area.               Upo n our arrival                 I saw a number of Liverpool

              supporters        outside       the ground a p pa r e n t l y waiting              to get    in.      These

              supporters were well                 behaved.          At about        12 noon the turns ti le s at

              that    end were op en ed and a trickle                         of supporters went        inside.          At

              this    early stage         there were a few s upporters                      stopping    others and

              asking     if they had any spare tickets.                             These   people were m ov ed on.



              B e tw ee n about      1.00 and 2. 0 0 p m the a rr iv in g               supporters      greatly
                                                                                                 PAGE       S
                                                                                                 R35

increased       in numbers       and it was notic ea bl e           how m a n y of them were

carrying        cans and bottles of beer and                          These    people were

prevented from going             into    the ground.         The    pavement areas a r o u nd the

L e p pings Lane      end were        thronged wit h Liverpool             s upporters and      I was

c ontinuously moving           supporters        from the      paved area and         in the middle

of the     road.      These    persons were d ir ec te d either              into the ground or

a way from it if they did not have a ticket.



At about 2 . 3 0 p m the queuing area for                the Leppings Lane            end was    packed

wit h Liverpool        supporters.            W it h other   officers       from our    serial    I

ente r e d the     crowd to try to ease what                 seemed to be becoming a serious

congestion.         By this      time traffic        had been stooged on L e pp in gs Lane

as Liverpool        s upporters were a pp r oa c hi n g         the ground      in mass.        M an y of

these     people    seemed obv io us ly the worse              for drink.       I could see that

m o u nt e d officers were           trying    to ease   the    crowd si tu at io n by

instructing        s upporters        to queue     in an orderly fashion and telling

those without         tickets        to get away from the           crowd.     Man y of the

supporters       d i sp la ye d a hostile        reaction to these           requests.       I myself

ente re d the      crowd to try to make             it more     orderly as by this time

there was a lot of            pushing     towards     the    turnstiles.        None    of the

Police ac ti on seemed to be able                  to alter     the actions      of the      crowd.



As the time got towards 3.00pm there were                          still   hundreds     of

supporters walk in g          to the ground from either               end of L ep pi n gs Lane.

It became       i n cr ea si ng ly    impossible     to direct       these    people and from

where     I was stood on the outside                of the queuing          crowd towards       the

roadway     persons      in the       crowd,    including Police Officers,             were     having

problems.        I tried on several             occasions      to get      into the    crowd to

split     it up but      it became       i nc re asingly      impossible      to penetrate       it.

A mo ng   the   crowd just a few feet from me                  I saw one youth. se|^^ng
        tickets and        I heard him start        the bidding       for a ticket at                       and

        w i t h i n seconds    I heard someone           offer him £3 5 . 0 0 and he m o v ed               on.



’       At about     or just a^te^r 3.00pm,              I saw that    *jV^^&ate that gives access

        to the N or th S ta nd anc^jnj^hen^ .^JJ^cy^^^^Jjates were ojjeHTed and this

        instantly eased the                       of the    crowd outside.        These    gates       from my

        reco ll ec ti on were only open for a few seconds.                     S up po r te r s were still

        coming to the ground after               the normal       kick-off    time and there was

        still    a crowd outside.             The supporters       that were outside       the ground

        prior to the gates            being opened were        in a very a gi ta t ed m oo d and           were

        clearly very a n no y e d that they              could not get       in on time.



        Some    time after 3 . 0 0 p m       I received a jjjacliQ message       that    requ ested all

        officers     to a tt e nd     inside    the ground at       the Leppings Lane          end.     I

        then ran through         ' A ’ Gate and into the N or th Stand and on to the

        pitch.     Whe n    I first      entered the      inside    playing area of the ground                I

        saw a mass     of     people     including Po li ce Officers          on the track       behind

        the Leppings Lane            end go al mo ut h and a ct ua ll y on the      pitch.       My first

>       impression was         that     there had been some sort of            pitch    invasion
     IX'
        There were many s upporters              climbing    over    the metal     fencing.       As    I got
Of
        to the front        of the terracing         it became      obvious    that a serious

    $   incident was        taking      place and I saw one man on the             pitch who was

        being    treated by the St Johns A mb u la n ce Service.                 The man a pp ea r ed to

        be dead.      S up po rt er s    continued to      climb over the fencing,             m an y of

        whom were     in a highly d i st re ss ed         condition and some        collapsed.          I

        could see that         the    crowd    in the    centre    pen were    being    crushed and

        pushed right        up to the fencing.            People were    climbing       over    each other

        to get out of the            pen.     The scene    rapidly became       chaotic wi t h what

        seemed to be hundreds               of Police and supporters          on the    pitch.        I was

        cont in uo us ly giving assi st an ce           to those who had got over          the fence
                                                                                                            PAGE       4
                                                                                                            R35

              and were      in physical         difficulties.       At some      time,    probably around

              3 . 3 0 and 3 . 4 0 p m    I saw that there were at            least twenty a p pa r e n t l y dead

              bodies     laying    on the       pitch and several       other     bodies were       being

              attended      to by Police,         supporters and St Johns.               At about    this   time   I

              saw that one of those              bodies was a man who          I now know to be a Carl

              Brown.      I checked him for           signs of    life but he was dead.             W it h the

              help of some of the Liverpool                 supp or te rs    I carried the body on a

              wooden     placard an d took         him to the g y mn as iu m where         I stayed until

w''           3. 3 0 a m the f ollowing         day when the decea se d was         i dentified by his

              father.      The    body showed no a pp arent          signs     of violence     other      than a

             mark     on this head.            I handed the body over          to the m o r t ua r y staff at

             W a t e r y Street.



             M y feelings at            the   time of the    incident       inside the ground were          of

             disbelief       and a thought         that   such a thing        c o u l d n ’t happen at

             Hi 1 Isborough.



              I have wo r ke d at H i l l s b o r o u g h for many years and have             policed several

             Semi-Final       matches.          I am norma ll y   involved      in the    policing       of the

                                                                               fa s '

Oft Saturday 15th April 19^9 at 9.00am I commenced duty at Icclesfield Police Itatiox
and was them transported down to Killsborough Football Ground where at 10,00aa I
attended a briefing for the ®eai-fiaal football match between Liverpool and Nottingham
Forest. My duties for that event were on Serial 19 and the officer in charge of that
serial was PS* 323 Proctor* At about 11.00am after the briefing together with the rest
of the serial I went to the Leppings Lane end of the ground* Oar duties were outside
the ground and were to supervise the arrival of the Liverpool supporters in and around
the turnstyle area, upon our arrival I saw a number of Liverpool supporters outside the
ground apparently waiting to get in. These -Supporters were well behaved. At about
12noon the tumstyles at that end were opened and a trickle of supporters went inside*
At this early stage there were a few supporters steppingothers and asking if they had
any spare tickets. These people were aoved on.

Between about 1.00 and 2,00pa. the arriving supporters greatly increased in nuabers
and it was notieable how many of the* were carrying cans and bottles of beer and wine
These people were prevented froa going into the ground* The paveaent areas around the
Leppings Lane end were thronged with Liverpool supporters and I was continuously
moving supporters froa the paved area and in the aiddle of the road* These personswere
directed either into the ground or away froa it if they did not have a ticket*

At about 2.3®pa the queing area for the leppings Lane end was packed with Liverpool
supporters. With other officers from ouf serial    I entered the crowd to try to ease
what seeaed to be becoming a serious congestion.    By this tiae traffic had been stoppedon
Leppings Lane as Liverpool supporters were approaching the ground in mass. Many of these
people seeaed obviously the worse for drink* I could see that mounted officers
were trying to ease the crowd situation by instructing supporters to que in an orderly
fashion and tolling those without ticket to get away froa the crowd* Many of the supporters
displayed an hostile reaction to these requests. I myself entered the crowd to try
to make it more orderly as by this tiae there was a lot of pushing towards the turnstyle.
None of the police action seemed to be able to alter the actions of the crowd*

As the time got towards 3»00pm. there were still hundreds of supporters walking to the
ground froa either end of Leppings Lane. It became increasingly iapossible to direct
these people and froa where I was stood on the outside of the queing crowd towards the
roadway    ^ persons in the crowd including police officers were having problems.
I tried on several occasions to get into the crowd to split it up but it became increasingly
impossible to penitrate it* Among the crowd just a few feet froa me I saw one youth selling
tickets and I heard him start the bidding for a ticket at £20*00 and within seconds
I heard somone offer him £35*00 and he moved on*

At about or just after 3.00pm. I saw that 'A* gate that gives access to the North Stand
and either 'B* or 'C* gates were opened and this instantly eased the density of the
crowd outside. These gates from my recollection were only open for a few seconds*
Supporters were still coming to the ground after the normal kick-off time*and there
was still a crowd outside. The supporters that were outside the ground prior to the
gates being opened were in a very agitated mood and were clearly very anoid that they
could not get in on time*

Some time after 3.00pm I received a radio message that requested all officers to
attend inside the ground at the Leppings Lane end. I then ran through *A* gate and into the
North stand and onto the pitch* When I first entered the inside playing area of the
ground I saw a mass of people including police officers on the track behind the lappings
Lane end goalmouth and actually on the pitch. My first impression was that there had
been some sort of pitch invasion. There were many supporters climbig over the metal
fencing. As I got to the front of the terracing it became obvious that a serious
incident was taking place and I saw one man on the pitch who was being treated by the
St Johns ambulance service* The man appeared to be dead. Supporters continued to climb
4   ■■

    over the fencing, many of who* were in a highly distressed conditio* and so*e collapsed.
     1 could see that the crowd i* the centre pen werebeing crashed and pushed right up to the
    fencing* People were cli*bing orer each other toget out of the pen* The scene rapidly
    became caotic with what seemed to be hundreds of police and supporters on the pitch*
     I was continuously giving assistance to those who had got over the fence and were in
    physical difficulties. At soae tiae, prbably around 3«30 to 3.40pa* I saw that there
    were at least twenty apparently dead bodies laying on the pitch and several other bodies
    were being attended to by police, supporters and St* Johns* At about this tiae I saw
    that one of those bodies was a man who I now know to be a Carl Brown. I checked hia
    for signs of life be he was dead* With the help of some of the Liverpool supporters I
    carried the body on a wooden placard and took hia      to the Gyanasiufli where I     stayed
    until 3«30a* the following day when the deceased was identified* by his father*
    The body showed no apparent signs of violence other than a mark on his head* X handed the
    body over to the Motuary staff at Watery St*
        feelings at the time of the incident inside the ground xk were of disbelief and a
    thought that such a thing couldn't happen at Hillsborough*
    I have worked at Hillsborough for many years and have policed several Seai Final matches*
    I am normally involved in the policing of the Leppings Lane area*

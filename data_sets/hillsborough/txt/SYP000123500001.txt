      case o f at that s i t u a t i o n we w e r e all st ill in a state of
      shock, o n e might say.

 0        MR. DYSON:            So you a c c e p t you did not tell him the truth

refer r e d t o the f i r s t one,        sir,   yes.

Whe n you s a y ’’the f i r s t o n e ” , wha t d o y o u m e a n ? - a . The first
gate I b e l i e v e d at tha t t i m e ha d bee n forced open, ga te C.
If you l ook at my s t a t e m e n t my i n t e r p r e t a t i o n was when the
first r e q u e s t for the g a t e s to be o p e n e d I said in my said,
’’Why d o yo u want the g a t e o p e n b e c a u s e it is bur st open
already?” .

 You a r e r e f e r r i n g to the f i r s t r e q u e s t ? - A. Yes.

 But that g a t e was shu t v e r y smartly,             was not it? - A. Yes,
 sir.

 And yo u kne w p e r f e c t l y wel l that it was not the influx of fans
 as a r e s u l t of tha t o p e n i n g w h i c h had caused the problem, did
 not y o u ? - A. Yes. t hat w a s not the m a j o r opening.

 And you k n e w t h e real c a u s e of the p r o b l e m and the casualties
 was t h e se c o n d o p e n i n g ? - A. yes, sir. that was the
 p ossi bi li ty .

 You see, I put t h e s e q u e s t i o n s to you beca u s e Mr. C u r t a i n and
 Mr. K e l l y ar e q u i t e c l e a r t h a t they w e r e told.    Mr. Curta in is
 clear that it was you who s a i d it, and Mr. Kelly is not
 c e r t a i n w h e t h e r it wa s you or one of you r colleagues.         At all
 events, t hey are bot h q u i t e c e r t a i n the y were told by the
 Police in th e co ntrol r o o m t h a t the c asualties had been caused
 by t h e g a t e b eing for ce d o p e n by th e fan s? - A. I would *g o as
 far as to say that.                I am t r y i n g to be helpful in recalling
 the e v e n t s at a m o m e n t of crisis.

 Why w e r e you bei ng so co y a b o u t t e l l i n g them what had
  h a p p e n e d ? - A. Th e r e a l i t y of the s i t u a t i o n is that shortly
  after the eve nt s had o c c u r r e d many pe o p l e were in a state of
  shock, and I thought i t - c o r r e c t to c o l l e c t my thoughts and to
. assess .the situation.              .1 d i d not e x a c t l y i n f o r m a t i o n a n d I am
. not .being d i s r e s p e c t f u l to Mr. K e l l y or the o t h e r gentleman;- I-■
  just t h o u g h t at that s t a g e tha t I should not .communicate fu-lly
  the s i t u a t i o n un til p o s s i b l y a senio r Off ic er of mine knew the
  situation.

 Did you k now that s u b s e q u e n t l y and as a result of what you had
 said to Mr. K elly that Mr. K e l l y w h e n he gave interviews to
 the media, of w hich he g a v e a num be r later that day, he told
 the m e d i a the re wer e in f a c t two theor i e s circ ul at in g as to
 the c a u s e of the disa st er , the f a n s ’ theory and the Policy
 theory, the fans' t h e o r y h a v i n g been that the gate was opened
 by the Po l i c e and the P o l i c e theory, as Mr. Kelly told the
 m ed ia and the world, the P o l i c e th e o r y being that the fans had
 force d the gate open.       Do you know he had said that? - A. I
 had no idea, sir.

. Thank you very much.

                             Cross-Examined         bv MR.       KALLIPETIS:

    Q. Mr. Duck e n f i e l d , f o l l o w i n g o n f rom that, as I un de rstand it at
       about q u a r t e r - p a s t - 3 ;you say you m a y h a v e g iv en the
       i mpr e s s i o n to Mr. K e l l y tha t the c a u s e of what had
       happ en ed was a g a t e b e i n g for ce d o p e n ? - A. Yes,
       sir.
B   Q.   Am I also r i g h t that at that time y o u kn ew that was not true?
         - A. In the o v e r a l l pi cture a gat e had been forced open.    Let
         me say this, m y initial p e r c e p t i o n that was accurate, but I
         did not say I had been asked for a u t h o r i t y to op en gates ana I
         had giv en it.

    G.   If you had g i v e n th e i m p r e s s i o n t h a t t h e cause of what had
         happened was of a gat e b e i n g fo r c e d ope n at 3.15. you would
         know that was not tr ue? - A. I was a sked for a quick
         assessm en t of t h e situation.

    G.        LORD J U S T I C E TAYLOR:           I wonde r, Officer, if you would
         just an swer th e question. -             A. I m a y have misled Mr. Kelly.

    G.       MR. K A L L I P E T I S :      Wha t you s a i d was not true? - A. In            the
D        final a s s u m p t i o n that    I had op e n e d the gate, no.

    G.    What you sai d was         not   t r u e ? - A.   If   I said it.    no. sir.   it   was
         not.

    Q.   In your s t a t e m e n t at the bo t t o m of pag e 7 you refer to C gate
         b e i n g burst open, and at the top of pag e 8 you say:

                  ".... but at that p oint a M o u n t e d Officer retrieved               ,-the
                  s i t u a t i o n and closed the g a t e " .

         That is right,           is not it? - A. Yes,           sir.

    G.   Did y o u speak to Mr. K e l l y before or after you declared a
         ma jo r incident? - A.. I think it w a s after,1 sir...

    Q. W ould you t u r n         to page 12 in your statement,           please:'

                  "The A s s i s t a n t Ch ief C o n s t a b l e (Operations) Mr.   Jackson

         Is that r i g h t ?      - A. Yes,   sir.

    Q.   You told him at that stage:

      on the -spur of the mome n t , yo u persisted in that deceotion
      throughout the af ternoon.          -  a . There was goo d reason sir

Q. You d i d n ’ t think it right even to tell the m wi t h i n the

   Did you th ink of that?             -  A. No sir, bu t at that time I
   had many things on my mind, not the lea st of w h i c h was a
   disaster, and it was a very tragic, v e r y serious
   situation, and I was acting in what I thought was the best
   interests.

Q. Did you tell           the As sistant Chief C o n s t a b l e       the truth?
   A. Yes sir.

   he was o b v i o u s l y co n c e r n e d as soon as the invasion               first
   started.     I'm sorry, that is a silly w o r d to use.                         As soon

Q. At that stage of course you already knew wh a t                         the cause
   had been. -  A. Yes sir.

               On S a t u r d a y     15th April       1989,     I a tt e n d e d the FA Cup S emi-Final                 at

                car to the game.

                I am a season ticket                 holder and obtai ne d my ticket                 from Anfield.              I

                paid £ 6 . 0 0 for         the ticket w hi ch was           for the L ep pi ng s Lane          standing

use    the       toilet we were subject to traffic delays, on/the M62 just

past Manch es te r.              This was        purely due to the volurfle of traffic                     on the

roads.           I w o ul d say we were             delayed for a b o u t / x w e n t y minutes.

B e t w e e n all       of us we      had a couple          of    cans an     beer   each about          twelve      or

f ou r t e e n    cans    in total.           T r a v e l l i n g along    I saw    people drinking         in

other      cars and vans.              This      is quite        nyrmal , I didn't seem to be

ex ce s si v e     to me.

We a r r i v e d     in S h e f f i e l d    just aftyir 1 pm,            and went    d ir ec tl y to the

Sportsman          pub,    about       15 to 20 flfinutes drive              from the ground.

We s ta ye d       in the       pub for about an hour and then                      left to go to the

ground.          XThe pub was          packaa out with L iverpool                  supporters and         locals,

eve ry on e was          drinking,          m i t not e x c es s i v e l y in my opinion.          Everyone

was    in good \sp.i r i t s . / l           had two     pints     in the     pub,    as did everyone            else

e xcept my farot\eiy«                  he was       driving.

W h e n we a r r i ve d      close      to the ground we            parked the        car   in Far Lane,

w h i c h was 5 m inutes              walk    from the ground.              We all    then w a l k e d    in a

group towards             the    ground.

The    only       police     I recall         seeing were         those     really    close    to the ground.

Prior      the that        I think          I may have      seen about        four    officers.

I w o u ld say there were about a dozen officers                               in groups       of three         or

four.        The     crowd w a l k in g       down the      road,    were     in good spirits        singing.

No one was           causing         trouble     people were a g a i n 7 in         good spirits.         No

police       o fficers       d ir e c t e d or escorted us down to the ground.                           By now

three      of the        group had          left,    to go to anfother         position       in the

ground.           We a r r i v e d at the        entrance        tty the    turnstiles      betw ee n 2 . 2 0        pm

an d 2.3 0        pm.

T here was         no queue,          it was     just a mass        of bodies.         There was a bit of

                     crush from behind se em ed to be worse.                              This was due to the volume                of

                            .e behind.        I was worried,            as        it began to effect my breathing.

                     Some    people were         in pain,        asking       the    crowd to          push back.

                     saw one steward.

                     I was      s tood with                       and                    just    inside    the turnstiles,

           I looked        round and        I saw a couple           of    pol ic em en and       possibly a steward

           s tood       by a large blue           folding     door.        This was     the door       i mm ed iately to

           the     side    of the     terrace        entrance       turnstiles.         As   I w a t c h e d one of the

           P ol ic e     officers     pulled the         gat^open.           I mm ed iately a lot of          people

           I w o u ld estimate           that about        three     or four     hundred       people      entered

           t h r ou g h this gate          in my view.         I then deci de d to move awa y as I

           r ea li se d things may/ ge t a little                   bit    packed.      As    I w al k e d a way    people

           people        ii\ the A u n n e l .     So we decided to go to another                    part of the

           ground,        as    I believe        that we w ould not get           in the terraces            behind the

           goal    .
           I did not           see any     police      officers h r        stewards at the entance             to the

           tunnel.         Nor    did,     I see any signsf directing                 me to my m at ch viewing

           I believe           the gate was        operhad^rat about S . 45 pm.

           I w al k e d    to the     left     to a gate       leading       to the west          stand.     This on

           previous        games     has    been m an n e d by stewards.               On this      game    it was    not

           m an n e d and       I made my way up into the West Stand.                        There was       one steward

           a nd    police       officer at        the bottom of the stairs.                  As    they were       checking

           other        peoples    tickets,        we w al k e d    past    them and up the stairs,                without

S'p'WJ)           looked full,        I went       up into the stand.

           I did not           see an yo ne      fighting     or    causing     trouble       inside      the ground.

           Nor was a nyone           drinking.

           I went        to a row of e mpty seats,                 and w hen    people       came whose      seats    they

           were we just           s qu ee ze d on w it h them.             I took my seat          just    before    the

players        came onto        the    pitch for the game             itself.     It was       now betw ee n

2.50     pm and 2.55        pm.

I could see about               ten to fift ee n feet of the front                    of the terraces.              I

i mm ed ia t el y saw that            it w^s ext re me ly        packed.       People were         climbing up

the front         fencing       trv jm g   to get onto the            pitch.     I could hear

people screamingyrfnd others in distress.

managed        t / r get over onto the pitch.                   I believe      that    the    police

   fjj^ r s     thought      that      it was a pitch invasion.

I k new that           it wasnt,       so why     couldnt they at the front                  see that     it was

a bad        crush.

Fans     that     got onto       the    pitch were        pleading w it h the officers                to do

something,            I don't know what.           The officers         began waving at the              crowd

trying        to get them to go back.

W hile       this was     going       on the     game had kicked off.             I believe         that w he n

the game        started the           crush got worse.            I didnt      see an acu'tai         surge    but

people at         the front were           really      crushed up agai ns t           the fencing.           There

were me,                         #nd
                                 £md                            sat up in the stand w at c h i n g what

was    going      on,

The game was            y fie n stopped.         I was    looking      to see    if my brother was

climbing        ovar     the fencing.            It was    then I noticed the gate at the

front        of X \he fence      open.        Pe op le were      panicking      trying       to get    out

t h r o u g b/ th e   gates.       I did not see who             opened the gates,            or   in fact     how

 jajEWT they had been open.

It was a mad            panic    in the       terraces although,           I didnt      see a ny o n e    die,      I

knew     people       had been killed.

I saw        people     rush onto       the    pitch,     and    people were      then d r a gg ed out.

Some     of these        people were          o b v i ou sl y dead.

P o li c e    officers     then made a line across                the mi dd le of the          pitch on the

half wa y      line.      I believe        the officers          formed a      line,    because       they

          thought      that       it was a pitch           invasion and there might                    have     been

          f i ght i n g .

          T here were a lot more                  police     on the       half way        line than those           down by

          do a nything.            But     there    seemed along ji&lay in them                    reacting        to what

          was   hap pe ni ng       in the        terraces.          Wh^m they did          react there          did not     seem

          to be any          plan to help.           O ff ic er s were           just    doing their own things              to

          help.      The       only thing         o r g a ni ss w by the         police    that day,        was    the    line

          of o fficers           across     the    pitctr.

          I attended           last years         garner, a n d there was a bad              crush then.            But

          o fficers      had t h i n g s o r g y ii s e d      better.           There was more officers who                 I

          b elieve were           checking / o u r       tickets        before you got to the ground.

                game.         They should have a l l ow ed          for 1 m s      and    had more officers

                a v a i la b le    to organise     fans.       LasJ/'years o r g a n i s a t i o n was     by no means

                good.         If they had have          done/jrt this year          like      last years,    I believe

                they may have           prevented some         of the deaths may be not all                 of them.            I

                believe        the FA S ho u l d bear sopfie of the           burden.         T hey did not
c a t

                a l l ocate enough tickets, as/to a llow L iverpool fans to use the bigger

                end of the ground.               E v e n y C h o u g h Liverpool    footbal      club had told them

                the a l l o c a t i o n wasnt     egraugh.

                in my opinion do tjjffe right thing. I believe that the crush outside

                was that bad peo/le may have been killed.    There was nothing else he

                could do.           It wasnt     the    fact   the gate was         opened.       It was    there was           no

                one    to direct        the fans away          from the tunnel           as   it was    obvious    the

                c oncerning          the H i l l s b o r o u g h disaster,               a nd        in particular        the     incident          I

                m e n t i o n about         the m o u n t e d    officer a s s a u l t i n g            the fans        in L ep pi ng s

                Lane. . I have              been shown the           copy of a v i deo                  reference MAP 9 and at

                tape     c ou nt er /t ime        1147 there         is an       incident              involving a police                 off icer

                on hor se ba ck        st ri king       out at the             fans.            So   far as      I am    co nc er ne d this

                is not       the     incident         that      I w a s describing,                  it is in the wrong (A/55ip^/

                location.

                The     incident        I w i t n e s s e d was      closer         to the           turnstiles an d well                 inside

                the     large      iron      perimeter          gates    to the          ground and           I think          it was

                p ro ba b ly earlier,             b e t we en    1430 - 1440 hours.                        I can not describe               the

                of fi ce r     i nvolved an d          I c er tainly           can not           identify the officer                    on the

                video as the           same       officer        I saw.         I do not w ish to                  persue an

HILLSBOROUGH ENQUIRY: COSTS

During our telephone conversation of 26 April you asked me to supply you with
an idea of the costs of the Taylor Enquiry into the Hillsborough disaster.  At
that time, and again now, I must emphasise that the costings I have arrived at
so far should be viewed as only a very rough estimate.

At present I am in no position to assess the likely cost of legal representation/
granted to relatives of the bereaved or injured who cannot afford to pay for such,
or the possible cost of the police investigation currently taking place.  These
costs are all liable to fall in 1989/90 and could range from £500,000 to £1,500,000
quite easily.  I have not yet, therefore, made any attempt at trying to cost these
likely elements of expenditure.

Those elements of expenditure which I have been able to cost, albeit with no
guarantee of accuracy, include staffing of the Enquiry team and secretariat,
research, travel and subsistence, printing of interim and final Enquiry reports,
general expenses (including accommodation), shorthand writers etc., and specialists'
fees.  My rough estimate of expenditure on these items is at present £ ^ 1 2 ,000 for
1989/90 and £ M l , 0.00 for 1990/91.
              68 , 69"?
I will, of course, keep you fully informed of any revisions or additions to these
estimates that I can make as and when further and more accurate information is made
available to me.

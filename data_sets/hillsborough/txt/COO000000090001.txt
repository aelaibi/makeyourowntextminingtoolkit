        FOOTBALL: PUBLIC POLICY ISSUES


     Committee considered a Memorandum by the Home Secretary and the Secretary o
  Z a tjb j £or the Environment   (H(89) 5) which reported on Government action to
 cuz#/l?9 6 Cfcball hooliganism and related football issues.


 THE HOfrS/'Spp&STARY said that there were various Government initiatives in
 hand, to c^£aj/£r£th the problems associated with football hooliganism, and
 further actfjo^^a^planned or under consideration.              The immediate priority was
 the completion<«: the passage through Parliament of the Football Spectators
Bill.    The proposed National Membership Scheme remained controversial, and the'
timing of its implementation was complicated by the publication, expected at
the turn of the year,^p£^)brd Justice Taylor's final report on the Hillsborough
disaster.    Other elemenEs/oJnthe Bill commanded wide public support, notably
■those on, restriction                  on the rQle of the Football Licensing
Authority in reviewing local^&^mXrity arrangements for public safety.
The Home Office had commended Lor££^stice Taylor’s interim recommendations on
safety to the local authorities a d & y f t e football clubs, and was monitoring
their implementation: he expected tS&»^jrd Justice Taylor would make further
recommendations designed to improve                      his final report.     Police
measures against hooliganism were improTy/fg^Mjolice liaison arrangements at
the recent England v. Sweden match had, fOT^j^afaiple, led to the avoidance of
some potential disturbances.          The new Nation;        iotball Intelligence Unit
would: help police co-operation efforts nationaufy''’
                                                    ’and internationally.
A continuing series of risky events lay ahead: re was essential to take what
steps could be taken to minimise the risks.             With this in m i n d , he would
welcome the Committee's suggestions and thoughts.


THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that he rfisjS            ^hat, following
enactment of the Football Supporters Bill, the football autiioi^ &s would
begin to react positively to the National Membership Scheme ar5>r &              3I work

towards making it a success.         Co-operation with the football autk             >s and
co-ordination of effort was the key to preventing trouble at footb^J
matches at home and abroad.         Only if this failed should more rad

considered.      In his view it was premature to consider pressing for cancellation
,^the England v. Scotland match or for the withdrawal of the English team
  pm the World Cup competition.       Withdrawal from the World Cup was not a
     'able option: it would not prevent determined hooligans from travelling to
       -o cause trouble, bit would attract serious criticism from genuine
fobfcbVl^f) supporters.


In d i s c u ^ t d ^ t h e following main points were made -


     a.       Tha\jfe<pBage of the Football Spectators Bill had been less troublesome
     than had^kt one time seemed likely.         This was in part due to the
     undertakings given to Parliament that there would be two further
     opportunities toRebate the'Football Membership Scheme before it was
     introduced.      The(Miftkster for Sport had also done an excellent job in
     steering the Bill j^x^gh.        There was no doubt, however, that many
     football supporters c^z6/ipsd adamantly opposed to the National Membership
     Scheme.     Moreover, it              that Lord Justice Taylor had received
     evidence that the introducp^j2>jj\of the Scheme would exacerbate problems of
     crowd control and public s^fet^l        Any criticism of the Scheme in the
     final report of the Taylor Ingti&n^, however guarded, would be seized
     upon by the scheme's opponents >V^$/t£pugh the Government would consider
     positively any proposals for impr^w^nijNthe Scheme, it was important to
     ensure that the ground was preparetr^r^ejecting suggestions that the
     Scheme should be abandoned.        It s h o u l ^ S w m a d e clear that the Government
     were firm in their resolve to introduceMsfie Football Membership Scheme, and
     that Lord Justice Taylor was not the finaJs^ arbiter on whether it should go
     ahead.


     b.       The shadow Football Membership Authority                 listing potential
      suppliers of the equipment necessary to implement \siTgJ^&eme.             Ministers had
     made clear that the Scheme would not go ahead unless t K # £ > e r e satisfied it
     was technically feasible.       The prospects of a wider Euz££           scheme had
      been set back by the failure .of the limited Dutch scheme .                  in the
      year.     Other European countries considering similar schemesN.              waiting tc
      see how the English and Welsh scheme fared before developing

      arrangements.

      c.      The proposals for further work outlined in paragraphs 16 and 17
      of the Memorandum were welcome.       It was important to encourage the
      further development of practical arrangements for co-operation between
      police forces at the national and international level, and to encourage a
           sitive approach by the police to the use of their existing powers.
            withdrawal of passports from notorious hooligans was impracticable: it
              eferable to concentrate for the present on implementing the
                  Part II of the Football Spectators Bill.


      d.,    Tns&e^ere dangers in pressing for the cancellation of football
      matches.\\The recent request by the Minister of Sport for the cancellation o
     .the Holland v. England match had been wise in view of the strong likelihood
      of trouble betwepft-vhooligans in each country.       It might also be necessary to
      give serious cdnsideration to whether the England v. Scotland international
      should go ahead n ^ C ^ L y , since the event was regularly marked by trouble,
      although there were indications that if both England, and Scotland
      qualified for the WorJy^ji^p^ the football authorities might themselves
      decide to cancel the fixtuj?^^\ Cancellation of fixtures should not,
      however, be seen as a g e n e ^ Q   lution.


      e.     In the face of what appeai        vsome cases to be irrational
     opposition to the Football Member           Scheme, it would be wise to
     emphasise the broad range of actioirwj^h the Government was stimulating.
     The positive initiative being taken               areas of police liaison,
     international co-operation and public s ^ k £ y should be publicised to
     avoid the impression that Government acti®h was simply a response to
     individual events.     The forthcoming Parliamentary debates would provide an
     opportunity for this.


THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL , summing up this partV&f^feFife Committee !s
discussion, said that the Committee were grateful to the                    for Sport
for the work he had done to' steer the Football Supporters                   ;essfully to
its present stage in Parliament.     .The Committee noted that L o x ^ p a ^ i c e   Taylor
had received evidence against the National Membership Scheme andSBip
there was a possibility that he might criticise some aspects of ±t\i
final report.    It was therefore important to ensure that the ground wa

    prepared to resist pressure for abandonment of the Scheme.      The Government
//^✓'Nshould make it clear that they were firm in their resolve to introduce the
    Sememe, and that Lord Justice Taylor could not be the final arbiter on it.
            also important to make the public aware of other Government action to
           aptball hooliganism and improve crowd safety.     The Bill's provisions on
    re&&fi)eW.on orders and on public safety commanded wide public support, and
    action/fe^og taken to improve international co-operation and police liaison was
    increasi^ly/successful.    The Committee endorsed the programme for future
    action and/^fe^further work to strengthen international co-operation outlined i
    paragraphs 10/4/^17 of the Memorandum.     They considered it premature to
    press for cancellation of the England v. Scotland international, or for the
    withdrawal of England from the World Cup competition.      The latter would in
    practice do nothing ta^grevent determined hooligans travelling to Italy to
    cause trouble, and w^ilcriattract wide public criticism from genuine football
    supporters.   The Conmitft(ee/jurl not wish to reopen the question of withdrawing
    passports from notorious l^tt&gans at this stage.      He would report the
    Committee’s conclusions to ^3>«£<£vime Minister.

              I am employed as a Senior F o re ma n Q u al i ty Control                   at             and I live

             at the given a d d r e s s .
                                             & A fT
              I am a Liverpool           Football      Clu b Supporter and on the              15th of April     1989

              130489    I t ravelled to H i ll s bo r ou g h Football             Club,   Sheffield,       to see

              the Liverpool  FC N o tt i n g h a m Forest FC semi final match at Sheffield,
                                                                ^ i r   \a b l3 r
              I t ravelled by car, my own, with a friend                  ^of

                        Liverpool,         I purchased from Anfi el d             previously a North Stand

              seating     ticket     for   row 7,      seat 58 and        paid £14,00.

              We set off at         10.00am      1000 on the   15th 150489 and drove to S h e f fi e ld
                                                                         C A T T C A ’fV'TC
              and did     not, stop an route.            We did hit a traffic jam on the end of the

              M53 and Glos so p turn off and a small                    traffic     jam on the A57 and the

              A62 8 junction,        a twenty minute         delay only.          I did not see any other

              su pporters        drinking alcohol        en route,        in fact    it was    quite     su rprising
                                                                                                              PAGE        2
                                                                                                              S2557

          because      last year you          could follow the         route with the beer             cans    that

          had been shed by the               farts.     This year was      different as         I think the

          fans    knew they would            be searched.

          Me a r r i v e d at S he f fi e ld at about           12 mid day    1200.      I collected my son

          who    is a student at Bath U ni ve r si t y and              I drove       to Tapton Nurses Home,

          Stone Ln,       Sheffield,        where      I parked and then travelled by bus                    into

          S heffield.        Upon arrival           in the City we went          to a cafe for         refreshment

          and    then we went           to the R a il wa y S ta ti on where       I knew we      could get a

          bus to the ground.

          U pon arrival        at the S t at io n       I saw a Police Con st ab le who,             when

          informed we were Liverpool                  Supporters,      d ir ected us to waiting
                          o r r
          transport,       a double        decker      bus.     Got onto   the    bottom    level      of the bus

          where we saw four O ff icers at the front.                       It w ould be about           1.40pm

          1340 by now        in plenty of time            for the game.          I a sk ed one of the

          O f f icers what       time     the bus was         leaving and he said "You w o n ’t get

          there    for the start.             The Liverpool        trains are      late.       The    bus w o n ’t go

          till    i t ’s f u l l . 1'

          The    bus was     empty at        this     time and    I d i d n ’t know    if the trains were

          late    or not but        I thought         I w ou ld wait a few minutes and               if necessary

          get a t a x i .      We d i d n ’t leave       for the ground until about 2pm                 1400 and

          there were only 25 to 30 fans on board.

          We were      s upervised        by two Offic e rs who escorted us directly to the

          L e p pings Ln t ur nstile entrance.

          At    no time did        I witness        any disorder,      fighting       or drunke nn es s       between

          my arrival        point and the ground.                everything was very happy.                  The    bus

          At the turnstiles              I saw no queues at all,           just a large mass            of    people.

          T here were Police Officers                               i foot but     no effort was made               to

          get the mass         into queues.                         y tight      but not d a ng er ou sl y so.

          No directions were              given at all         by the Police      present.       I did see          two

               Officers       outside    the N or th Stand seating            turnstiles     searching       fans        fo

               beer    etc    prior    to entry.         I d i d n ’t see any stewards.

                       my son and.                       got split      up from myself       so    I passed

               t hro u g h the turnstile without             too muc h d if fi c ul t y and waited          on the

               other    side    for them.

               The    only d i f f ic ul ty    really was     because of the mass           I had to g radually

               make my way towards             the turnstile which          is how we got split         up.

               I entered through the turnstile and handed                        in my ticket.        I did      not

               see any gates open other              than the turnstiles           or see any gate          opened.

               At some       time    prior    to ent ering    or having       entered the ground        I did

               happen to       look to my        right   towards     the terrace        turnstile    side and saw

               a few fans       climbing       over a wall.         I d o n ’t know whether        it was

               played that game          they woul d n' t     see     the match.        I expected    them to       be

               ejected,      having     passed th rough the           other side of the turnstile             I did

               see more Police O ff ic er s          ready for        searching,             and            pa s s e d

               through within a couple              of minutes        but only            was searched,

               Once    inside we knew we were              to split up a g ai n to our        respective m at ch

               viewing       points.     We a gr ee d to meet at a flood            light    pylon N orth Stand

               side Leppings Ln end.

               Once    inside       the ground     1 did know where         I wa nt ed to go and so          I didn’

               take much notice          of the     presence of signs and           I had no d i ff ic ul ty

               finding my seat m atch viewing                point,     there were       plenty of stewards

               inside     the North Stand.

               I d i d n ’t use or see the          tunnel    of    course,     using    the North Stand

               seating and          I did not see any disorder            or other       incidents    between

               entering       or taking my m at ch viewing             point.     I d i d n ’t witness any

               consum p t i o n of alcohol         in the ground.         Whilst    in the stand       I did have

               a cup of tea at a kiosk               w hi ch was foul and then I made my way                   to my

               seat with       no d if fi cu lt y at all.          This w ou ld be about 2 . 5 0 p m    14-50.           I

            s howed my ticket            to two stewards -at the back               of my aisle and my seat

            was    in front of them and to the                  right.

            At    this time       I noted that          there   were an awful         lot of empty seats

            a r o u n d me which made me think about what                      the Officer     had said about

            the trains.           I also    noted,       however,      that    looking    to my    right    towards

            the Leppings          Ln,    Liverpool       end,   and saw that         pens 3 and 4 were           very

            full    and yet       in the wings,          pens   1 and 6 were virtually empty.                    At

            about 3. 0 0 p m      1500 there was s ud denly a mass                 of fans    in the ga ngway

            next to my seat,             some    of them    I noticed had          complete    tickets      in their

            hands.

            Until     these      fans had settled down my view was                   blocked of the         pitch.        I

            looked then back to             pens 3 and 4 and saw fans                climbing over         the

            divide      fence     from pen 4 into          pen 5 an d also         over   the perimeter          fence

       2-   to the      pitch from pens 3 and 4.                I also        saw fans    climbing    from the

            back    of pens 3 and 4 and              into the West S ta nd seating above               them.          I
Nesr                                                -----------------------
            also    saw fans       coming       out of a gate to my right and to the                  right of

            that    standing       terrace.        I thought       then    it was    o ve rc rowded and      that the

            Police      had     let them out       to    relieve    it but the flow out seemed to dry

            up from that gate

            I w a s n ’t involved         in any form of crush nor did see any surge.

            As time quickly             passed    I saw someone,          a fan,    talk to Bruce      GR08ELAR,

            the Liverpool          goalkeeper.           I also saw someone          grab hold of HA NS ON the

            captain and          pull    him towards       the Leppings Ln end.              It was   then that a

            senior Police          officer       came onto the         pitch,    saw the     referee and the

            game was       stopped.        A few fans       then came over or through the fencing

            and many then          laid themse lves         down face         down onto the .pitch.        It was
                                                                                        IrT **</tsf< Z F y
            then     I knew      it w a s n ’t a pitch invasion.               I h,esard^>He tannoy then

            a nn ou n c i n g   ’Clear    the    p i t c h ’ several    times.      I think this      caused a lot

            of    confusion for everyone                particularly for the Police               not at the

            L ep pings Ln end.

            The   numbers         of fans spilling          out onto the          pitch     increased over a short

            period of time.              The     first    time    I knew there was           serious    injuries

            amongst        the    fans was when          I saw a male fan           in his twenties,       certainly

            not a k i d , he        came    towards       the N orth S ta nd from somewhere              out of a

            crowd     in the middle            of the     pitch.        I saw straight a way that          his    right

            ar m was up and that               the middle        of the forearm was           unnat ur el y bent,

            swans     neck fashion,            quite a lot of people              noted     it.

            N ow there was a policeman directly                         behind this man whose           left arm

            a pp e a r e d to be behind his back.                  The broken arm           certainly wasn't

            s u p p o r t e d as you w ou ld expect.              As    I w a tc he d the    crowd about me were

            incensed by this and as                 this man reached the              touch       line turned away

            from him and wa lk ed back onto the                        pitch.

            The   injured man then w al ke d unaided the whole                          length of the N orth

            S t a n d towards       the S pion Hop end.                I e xp ected this man to drop.

            At some        time a large          number of Officers,             Police Officers,        then spread

            themselves across              the    pitch,    near       to the    centre     line.

            Fans had a lr e ad y ripped up or off hoardings                          from sides of       pitch and
ca   ^t
                  were using some as stretchers, passing through the Police line.

                 Now I saw some Liverpool fans wi'Miout a board point towards the Notts

            through.         However,       I saw #£sme fans            in blue    tracksuits,        possibly ball

            boys,     at    the Notts Forest             end then tear down the boards and bring                       them

            over and through the                 lines.     The    crowd aro un d me were seeing all               this

            with me and were             becommirtg very angry but a pp l au d ed the actions                     of

            these fans.            The   point     I ’m trying         to make    is that even at        this    time

            the Police           it a pp ea r ed were      still       unaware    of what was going        on and

            treating        it as a crowd          control       situation.        There was even a line of

            P olice    the       length of the North S tand doing                  exactly the same.            So much

            so that        the    crowd were       shouting       to them       ’Do s o m e t h i n g ’ repeatedly.

            I did see a Senior Police                    officer       then go to the        line and take a few
                                                                                                        PA G E      6
                                                                                                        £52557

 o fficers       out    of the    line and took them towards                     the L ep pings Ln end.

 M o w he probably did the               right thing         because       the    rest of the Officers

 in the area of the              pitch were          in small      sca tt er ed groups       doing     nothing,

 w h i c h was    observed       by other       fans and       causing      them a great       deal      of

 distress and anger.               I later saw Officers               move       fans who were able

 b odied or trying          to move          them    into the N orth S tand seating.                  Now some

 of these        fans may have          been trying         to find friends or             injured     persons

 it certainly d i d n ’t help the general                      feeling      of hate/anger          that you

 could feel        welling       up and when one body on a stretcher                       or board        came

 past and then one of a child with                       its head         covered we knew then of the

 deaths.         I felt that       it was       time    to get out as            I a nt i ci p at e d trouble.

 Just     prior to that          one fan who was moved               into the N orth S tand from

 Leppings Ln end showed me a complete                          ticket an d stated that              fans were

 let     in without       tickets       being       checked.

 It was     then time       to    leave      so I went      to the floodlight w h ic h was

 p r e - a rranged but                 and           were    not    there.        I went    back    into      the

 stand to fetch |

 we then     left the ground             of our own accord.               This would be about 3 .30pm

 1530.      Having       left the ground we             passed group of four O ff icers who

 were     very distr es se d and had clearly been                        in a difficult

 situation.            Further awa y we         came across         some traffj^e Police,             possibly

  m o t or c yc l is t s who were getting a great deal of yabuse from fans. I

  must say that they behaved very well u r eter tjn e intense provoc at io n and

 At about 4.30pm           1630 to 5. 0 0 p m         1700 we      e ve nt ua ll y got to the         railway

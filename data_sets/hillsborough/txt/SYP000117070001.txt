             At 8,15 a.m.             on Saturday,         15th April,           1989,      I c o mmenced duty at my

              evident       that      people who         had    passed on their way to the                      ground were

              looking       for      something.          Later      in the    day some of these                 fans were

             asking        others        ma k i n g   their way to the ground                if they had any spate

             As    time went        by        I remember          saying        to Police (JonsT.a\bie Punt on that                                     if

             As    kick     off    time          drew    nearer         it      became        evident       that large                numbers            of

             fans were w a l k i n g             past drinking cans                  and      bottles      of     beer,, they were

             also    carrying          four         packs       of beer.

             At 2. 5 6      p.m.   a group            of fans        came       running        up the      road as             they got

             near    us     Police C o n s t a b l e            Pu n t o n       said to one of them "come on you'll

             At 3 p.m.          (kick         off    time)       there were          still        fans walk i n g           past             our

             large       crowd had g a t h e r e d at the L e p p i n g s Lane                          end of the             ground.              1

         •1.    At the          brief i n g we were           told of the fact that there was an

                evacuation             procedure         at the gro u n d           in case       it was        required,            this

                p rocedure         was       not explained,              so whe n      it was      requiredyl              was unaware

                of what          to do       in the      circumstances.

         S.     I feel          that    co m m u n i c a t i o n s    w o u l d have      been barter           if more            officers

                had been          issued w i t h         r a d i o s , this w o u l d hjtve kept more                      officers

                informed          of what        was     happening           inside/the        ground.

         3.     1 feel          that    on Cu p S e mi-Final              dawr when         large     crowds          of     people are

                e x p ected at the             ground all             o utlets where alcohol                can be            purchased

                s hould be         closed        preventing            its    purchase.

         4.           1 believe        that     fans     sjrouldbe        put      thro u g h a     barrier sy s t e m some

                distance          from t h e / g r o u n d where             all    tickets       should        be    checked and

                all     those wit limit tickets                      should     foe turned        back.         Perhaps            those

                that      could/not           purchase a ticket may                    be a l l o w e d    to w at c h the

                l a w          numbers       of fans a r r iving at the                   venue    hoping        to get            in at

I then moved       through      a side     gate      to the   entrance     which    leads    to the

back of the       South    Stand,      there    adjacent      to the     fence    at the    side of

also    a large    number      of people       sat    about   on the     ground.     I could see

that    they were      dazed    and    injured.        From that    time    on until       the   de­

brief,    I a s s isted with         the   injured     putting    them    into    a mbulances     and

also    ass i s t i n g with   the    evacuation       of fans    from the       ground.

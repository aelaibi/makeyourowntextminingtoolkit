up    to me       and     stated           t hat    people          would           die    outside           the    turnstiles

turnstiles.               We     then went              to    the    main           gates        at    the     lett      of     turnstile                B

appealed          to t h e       fans       to m o v e        back     and          give       the      people        near      to    the

this; a r e a       started           to    clear.            During           the       push     on the         turnstiles

several          f an s    climbed          the     wall       to    the        left        of    the     turnstiles             and        over

attended            in f r o n t    of       t hi s     stand,         I saw        t hat      several          supporters                were

already         on the          pitch,: s e v e r a l            of    them        ran    up    t.o m e      and. said,;

''Get ..'in t h e r e ,         there        are: p eop l e           dying        in t h e r e . " = We         ran       towards             the

way      towards          the     fencing          between            these        two.        I could          see    t hat         the

volume         of    people        was       so    great         that       it w a s      virtually             impossible                to

move.          We    started        to       lift       people         o ver       the    fence        and      into       the       next -

pen,      with       the a s s i s t a n c e          of    s ome      of     the     supporters.                I cannot

remember            who    else     attended               in t h a t       pen w i t h me.              I do      not      remember

how many            people        I assisted               out    of    that        pen,       but     I do      know       that          on

removing            some     of    them,          I could         nest f i n d a n y           s i gns     of    pulse,          or

breathing.                I saw     several             people         collapse           by the         railings           and       be

crushed         by the          people        behind          them.           I spent          about       half       an    hour          in that

p en ,    taking          people        o ver      the      fence       and        to a small            exit      gate         that       led

onto      the       pitch,        where       I handed            them        to    other       pol i c e       officers.                 At

this      t i me     I was        spat       at a n d       verbally           abused          by f a n s       who    s t a t e d that

attended,            appeared           to    have         consumed           l a rge     amounts          of    intoxicants.

Upon      clearing           the    front          en d     of    the       centre        pen,       I could          see       that       there,

was      approximately              twenty              p e o p l e laid,          either       unconscious                or    dead          on

the      terrace.            These           people        were either              removed          via     the      gate       in t h eir

pen,      or    lifted          over     the       fence         and    taken        out       through          the    gates          in the

pen      I was       in.                                                  ,

Upon      ensuring           that        there        was      no i n j u r e d      fans       left       within          that       stand,

                ambulance          services were                  in attendance.                 I saw          l aid         on    the     pitch

                several       bodies,            which          were    c o v e r e d by i t e m s         of       clothing.               The

                Liverpool          supporters                  were    tearing       down advertising                         boards        and       using

                t h e m as    stretchers                  to    convey       the    injure.# to            the          far    e n d of        t he    pitch.

                I made       my way          towards            the    centre       of    the    pitch and                joined Police

                Sergeant          Wright         and       several       of    our       Serial.           Whilst             stood with              those

                officers,          several            fans       approached          us    and       s a i d s' " Yo u         couldn't             give     a

                fuck    about          how m a n y         have       died    today,       all       y o u ’ re         interested             in     is how

                After     a p p r o xi m at e ly 20              minutes       to    half       an    hour,             Inspector           Dews

                direction          of       these         PSV's..       The    majority          of       the       Liverpool             supporters

                used.        As    we       were      no       longer     required         to    escort             the       farts,      we    were

POLICE CONSTABLE 122

ATTERCLIFFE POLICE STATION D2




At 8.00 am Saturday 15 April 1989, I reported for duty at Attercliff Police Station.

I expected    to work until approximately 8.00 pm that same evening.

At 8.30 am I attended at West Bar Police Station, for a briefing regarding the PA

Cup semi-final at Hillsborough.     The Sergeant in charge of me that day was Police

Sergeant 840 Wright, Serial 13.     Our duties were to attend at the Midland Station

and supervise the arrival of the Liverpool fans frcm both service and special trains

and to escort them to the ground, via PSV vehicles.      At this time I was partnered

with Police Constable 2118 Beaumont.

At approximately 12.20 pm we left the Midland Station on a PSV full of Liverpool

suporters and stayed on the PSV until we arrived at the Leppings Lane entrance to

the ground.     Upon our arrival at approximately 12.45 pm, I saw several thousand

Liverpool suporters, stood and sat outside the ground.        After all the fans had

disembarked frcm the PSV, we attended at the Police Rocm, to await the arrival of

the rest of our Serial.

At approximately 2.50 pm, Sergeant Wright received a radio message, requesting our

attendance at the Leppings Lane entrance.    Upon attending at the ground side of the

turnstyles, I saw several police officers, the ranks of which I do not know, looking

through the glass panel in the gates.    They seemed to be debating whether or not to

open the gates.    It was decided that due to the large number of fans outside, this

was not practicable.   As I made my way to the gate at the far left of the turnstyle,

Gate B, I saw several people sat on the floor and they appeared to be short of

breath.   Several people came up to me and stated that people would die outside the

turnstyles unless we did something about it.      I could see through the turnstyles
                                      -   2   -




that there were serval thousand people outside, pushing against the turnstyles.           We

then went to the main gates at the left of turnstyles B and to the best of my

knowledge this was open by the steward, to let myself and Police Sergeant Wright

through.     As far as I am aware no other officers followed us through this gate and

the gate was shut immediately after us.            As we walked round the corner, I could see

that the area up to the turnstyles and beyond the blue gates prior to the turnstyles

was anmassed with fans.      Myself and Sergeant Wright appealed to the fans to move

back and give the people near to the turnstyles rocm to move and breath.                   We

informed them that unless they did so there was a great chance that scmeone would be

injured.     At this time there were several police horses also in attendance.         As we

were shouting to the fans, scmeone behind me, I don't know who, shouted, "Let the

fans through this side gate."       There was then a sudden surge as both fans frcm

within the barriers to the turnstyles and those outside, moved towards the gate.

After abot 10 minutes this area started to clear.           During the push on the turnstyles

several fans climbed the wall to the left of the turnstyles and over the roof of the

turnstyles and into the ground.

Sergeant Wright then shouted that we were requested on the pitch infront of the West

Stand.     We re-entered the ground, via the gates that we had cane out of and gathered

the rest of our Serial and ran down the right hand side of the ground behind the

South Stand.    At one point our way forward was blocked by a gate, which needed to be

opened by a steward.    This took about 2 minutes.         We then ran down a tunnel and onto

the pitch, infront of the West Stand.             As we attended infront of this stand, I saw

that several supporters were already on the pitch, several of them ran up to me and

said, "Get in there, there are people dying in there."           We ran towards the stand and

entered a pen to the left of the centre stand.            We made our way towards the fencing

between these two.     I could see that the volume of people was so greatj^that it was

virtually Impossible to move.     We started to lift people over the fence and into the

next pen, with the assistance of sane of the supporters.           I cannot remember who else

attended in that pen with me.      I do not remember how many people I assisted out of
                                      -   3   -




that pen, but I do know that on removing sane of them, I could not find any signs of

a pulse, or breathing.    I saw several people collapse by the railings and be crushed

by the people behind them.      I spent about half a hour in that pen, taking people

over the fence and to a small exit gate that led onto the pitch, where I handed them

to other police officers.     At this time I was spat at and verbally abused by fans

who stated that it was all our fault.             Sane of the fans inside the pen in which I

attended, appeared to have consumed large amounts of intoxicants.          Upon clearing the

front end of the centre pen, I could see that there was approximately twenty people

layed, either unconscious or dead on the terrace.           These people were either removed

via the gate in their pen, or lifted over the fence and taken out through the gates

in the pen I was in.

Upon ensuring that there was no injured fans left within that stand, I returned to

the pitch.     I was then aware that the fire brigade and ambulance services were in

attendance.    I saw layed on the pitch several bodies, which were covered by items of

clothing.     The Liverpool supporters were tearing down advertising boards and using

them as stretchers to convey the      injured to the far end of the pitch.         I made my

way towards the centre of the pitch and joined Police Sergeant Wright and several of

our Serial.    Whilst stood with those officers, several fans approached us and said,

"You couldn't give a fuck about how many have died today, all you're interested in

is how much you're being paid."

After approximately 20 minutes to half a hour, Inspector Dews informed us that our

Serial was required to escort the Liverpool supporters to the PSV's and return them

to the Midland Station.     The PSV's were parked on Penistone Road.         We escorted the

fans in the direction of these PSV's.         The majority of the Liverpool supporters made

their own way to the Midland Station, as only a few PSV's were used.           As we were no

longer required to escort the fans, we were informed to return to the North Stand

for the de-briefing.     We attended in the North Stand and after approximately half a

hour, Superintendent Bates asked for officers to work public order patrol in the
                                     -   4   -




town centre.   Myself and several other officers, including Inspector Dews and Police

Sergeant 1415 Ashmore, worked the public order patrol in a Transit van.

At about 7.10 pm we were stood down and told to return to West Bar Police Station,

to await a de-brief.

At approximately 7.30 pm we were told to stand down.         I returned to Attercliffe

Police Station and went off duty at approximately 8.00 pm.

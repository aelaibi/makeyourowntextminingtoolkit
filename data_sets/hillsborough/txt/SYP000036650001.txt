            Dear      WPC



            Concerning              our     telephone              conversation                    about        Hillsborough,              Some

             Incidents             of    that    day are             a bit          sketchy             and     it    is as        if my m i n d         is

             trying       to       blot     them      out.           I will             try m y         b est    to    recollect           the       entire

            day

            We    set     off       for     S h e f f i e l d at             about       11 am.           There        we re       nine    of       us   in two

            Then      traffic            started         to       build           up.     We       eventually              s t o p p e d at     a    public

            for      s om e    30-45       minutes.                The        pub wa s         not       as     c r o w d e d as     it    had       been     the

            year      before.             We    left      the               pub    to    go    to       the     g r o u n d at      1.15      pm.        When

            we    arrived           at    the    ground            we        could       not       get    parked           in the      immediate

            vicinity.               We    had    to w a l k         about           a mile          and       a half,         to    the    ground.            We

            stopped           at    a shop       for      a       few m i n u t e s           to    buy       some     food and           then went

  queue           outside       the         turnstiles                         was                          enormous.^The                                                   Police      were         by    the

  moved           into    the      queue          in f o r c e                       and. t h e y                                                    should            have     held       people          b ack

  officer           in    charge           to     the      ground                                   officials                                                and       they     could        have         put    the

  part.            Fans      with         tickets          were                      forced                                           to                   scale       the     walls       of    the       ground

  to        escape       the    crush           outside.                             1 was                                     only                         asked        by    one    fan       if    I had a

  spare           ticket,       so        the     crush          could                                    not                         be a t t r i b u t e d                    to    t i c k let less           fans,

  pm.         It    had      taken 43             minutes.                                   It                  seemed                                     like       years.         Once       in side,

  the        police       were       two        to    a turnstile.                                                                   No                    stewards           were    evident             and    no

  we        thought       we    had        experienced                               everything.                                                                 No    way     was    t h at     true.

  This        was    something                 totally          out                         of                   the                         horror                   stories.          My      left       a rm w a s

I was        screaming           with       the    pain a n d           I thought          it was          going       to     break.             My

back     wa s     twisted         in all          ways       to    try a n d        save       my arm.            After       about         f our

minutes         of    this       I managed          to       put m y         arm    up    in    the       air.        All     of      the

people         screaming          and       pleading          for       help,,       I could          feel        bodies         under        my

feet,    but     was      absolutely              powerless             tp    help       them.        They        were      already

hand     side        fenc e .      The       crowd       rose       in a n t i c i p a t i o n        of a goal             but       could

not     regain        the    space          they    had       previously             occupied.               That      was       when       the

oxygen         was    forced       from my          lu ngs         and       many    lives       were        lost.          Another           fan

in f r o n t     of me       was       trying       to       scale       the       fence       but    kept        falling          back.

He    was      in his       late       forties          or    early          fifties.           I heaved           him      up w i t h        my

right        arm and        two    fans       caught          him       in the       gangway          as     he    fell       from         the

top     of     the    fe nce.          Eventually             I managed             to    scale       the     fence         and       was

We    car r i ed      him    to    the       f ront      of       the    pi t ch w h e re        othe r fans               and

a    policeman          took      him       from    us.           I went       back       into       the    gangway           to      help

another         f an w h o       was    lying       on       the    floor          crying.           As    I picked           him      up a

police         officer       told       me    to    l e a ve       him       there       but    I told        him where               to    go.

1 then went             behind         the    goal       and       pleaded          with       the    police          to    help

Eventually            one    young          officer          threw       his       hat    on    the       floor       and     took         off

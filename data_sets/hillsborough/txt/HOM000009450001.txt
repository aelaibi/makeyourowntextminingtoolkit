HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER:      CORRESPONDENCE FROM MR R EDEY

You   asked   Mr  Turney  for  advice   on Mr    E d e y 's letter   of
2 0 September by close of play tonight.   I attach a draft.

2.   You have already had a note from Mr Moriarty proposing a
reply to be sent to Mr Edey in response to his telephone
conversation with y o u . I assume that letter has not been sent
and the attached draft is on similar lines.

3.   In my opinion we should not be too concerned about Mr Edey.
He appears to misunderstand the law.         The Safety of Sports
Grounds Act 1975 already places a duty on local authorities to
issue a safety certificate for a designated sports ground on
receipt of an application.    The Act does not give any specific
supervisory responsibility to the Home Secretary and regulations
under section 6(2) of the 1975 Act would not give the Secretary
of State the authority to oversee safety certificates.           As
Mr Moriarty's note pointed o u t , there is no power under the 1975
Act for regulations made under it to change the provisions of
that A c t .  (Section 15A provides limited powers to modify
provisions of the Act as respects any specified class of sports
ground, but this falls short of permitting the introduction of
what would be in effect a new provision.)

4.   I do not think that other matters in Mr E d e y 1s letter
require a response.    Nobody was injured in the Preston incident
which merely revealed that the safety arrangements in the event
of fire were adequate.    The Sunday T im e s ' survey was carried out
over a month a g o .  We know that some clubs have had practical
difficulties with some of the recommendations and there are
possible  legal   difficulties over the agreements called for
between the police and football clubs which are currently being
addressed by the Police Department.     I do not think that you
should be called upon to respond to the other points in Mr Ede y1s
letter, which are largely expressions of opinion.

5.   As to the proposed application for judicial review, there is
little I can add to paragraph 6 of Mr Moriarty's note of
22 September.

Roy Edey Esq
Lower Flat
Field House North

HARROW
Middlesex    NA1 3ER




Thank you for your letter of 25 September to the Home Secretary.


I     am    sorry     that      you    were       not     satisfied         with       my     letter    of
18 September.             You say that it is simply not good enough to place
the responsibility for safety of spectators                                 at football grounds
on local          authorities, but           I have to point out that that is how
the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 is drafted.


The statutory power under section 6(2)                              of the       1975 Act does not
enable the Secretary of State to make regulations which would add
to    the        provisions     of    the    Act,       for   example       authorising          him    to
oversee safety certificates.                       That is why,            as I have explained,
the    Government          is   seeking       appropriate           powers       for    the    proposed
Football Licensing Authority in its Football Spectators Bill.


I    should        like   to    assure      you    again      about    the       Home        Secretary1s
concern over safety at football grounds                              and the importance that
he attaches          to a proper response by local authorities and clubs
for        the     recommendations           contained         in    Lord        Justice        Taylor1s
Interim Repo r t.              That response is being carefully monitored and
in the light of it and of the final report of the Taylor inquiry,
consideration will be given to the need for any further action.


When       you    spoke    to   me    on    the   telephone          you    asked       me    about    the
status       of     the   proposed         Football      Licensing         Authority.            Present
proposals are that the FLA will be an independent
non-departmental            public body.            Appointments            to    the       FLA will be
made by the           Secretary of State                for Environment            in consultation
with       the Home       Secretary        in respect         of those       appo intments which
have a bearing on the authority1s safety role.

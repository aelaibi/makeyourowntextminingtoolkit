    Dear Lord Justice

    RE:    ADLINGTON V DUCKENFIELD and MURRAY

    In early July 1998, the solicitors for these defendants wrote to the Crown Prosecution Service
    asking that we take over and discontinue the criminal proceedings against their clients which
    have been brought, by Ms Ann Adlington on behalf o f the Hillsborough Family Support
    Group.

    We have considered this request in detail.

    Mr. Duckenfield faces two charges o f manslaughter, one o f wilful neglect to perform a public
    duty and one charge o f attempting to pervert the course o f justice. Mr. Murray faces two
    charges of manslaughter and one o f wilful neglect to perform a public duty.

    We have considered the evidence, the representations made by the parties and all the
    surrounding circumstances o f the case. We have concluded that we should not intervene to
    take over any o f the charges.

    For your information I enclose a copy o f a press release.

     Dear Sir,

     RE:     ADLINGTON V DUCKENFIELD and MURRAY
             LEEDS MAGISTRATES’ COURT - 21 DECEMBER 1998

     In early July 1998, the solicitors for these defendants wrote to the Crown Prosecution Service
     asking that we take over and discontinue the criminal proceedings against their clients which
     have been brought, by Ms Ann Adlington on behalf of the Hillsborough Family Support
     Group.

     We have considered this request in detail.

     Mr. Duckenfield faces two charges o f manslaughter, one o f wilful neglect to perform a public
     duty and one of attempting to pervert the course of justice. Mr. Murray faces two charges of
     manslaughter and one of wilful neglect to perform a public duty.

     We have considered the evidence, the representations made by the parties and all the
     surrounding circumstances o f the case. We have concluded that we should not intervene to
     take over any o f the charges.

     For your information I enclose a copy of a press notice.

     Yours faithfully,

     Dear Sir,

     RE:     ADLINGTON V DUCKENFIELD and MURRAY
             LEEDS MAGISTRATES’ COURT - 21 DECEMBER 1998

     In early July 1998, the solicitors for these defendants wrote to the Crown Prosecution Service
     asking that we take over and discontinue the criminal proceedings against their clients which
     have been brought, by Ms Ann Adlington on behalf of the Hillsborough Family Support
     Group.

     We have considered this request in detail.

     Mr. Duckenfield faces two charges of manslaughter, one of wilful neglect to perform a public
     duty and one of attempting to pervert the course of justice. Mr. Murray faces two charges of
     manslaughter and one of wilful neglect to perform a public duty.

     We have considered the evidence, the representations made by the parties and all the
     surrounding circumstances of the case. We have concluded that we should not intervene to
     take over any of the charges.

     For your information I enclose a copy of a press.

     Yours faithfully,

          HILLSBOROUGH - BRIEFING FOR DIRECTOR

ISSUE

1.1   Handling the decision in the Hillsborough case.
ACTION REQUIRED

2.1   For information.
TIM ING

3.1   We have agreed that the decision will be notified to the parties and the court by
      no later than 18 December 1998.
3.2   Papers are currently with the Attorney General.
BACKGROUND

4.1   The background to the case is well known and is only set out here in outline.
4.2   In 1990, the CPS decided that there should be no criminal proceedings rising out
      of the Hillsborough disaster.
4.3   That decision was confirmed in 1997 following receiptof representationsand
      what was claimed to be new evidence received from the Hillsborough Family
      Support Group (HFSG).
4.4   Earlier this year, HFSG commenced a private prosecution against retired Chief
      Superintendent Mr Duckenfield and retired Superintendent Murray. The charges
      are:
      •    Manslaughter - against both
      •    Manslaughter - against both
      •    Wilful neglect to perform a public duty - against both
      •    Attempt pervert course o f justice - against Mr Duckenfield only.
4.5   In July 1998 the solicitors for the defendants formally requested that the CPS take
      over the conduct of the proceedings and discontinue them.
4.6   Following preparation of a detailed report by George Croston of Central
      Casework York, Mr Newell, Director of Casework Evaluation, has considered the
      case. He concluded that we should not intervene in relation to the manslaughter
      and wilful neglect charges as we are unable to say that there is clearly no case to
      answer.
4.7   As for the attempt pervert course o f justice charge, it is arguable that there is
      clearly no case to answer. However, Mr Newell’s view is that as the Service’s
      policy does not cater for taking over only part of a prosecution and as this is not
      the main charge against Mr Duckenfield, the charge should not be the subject of
      intervention.
4.8   The Attorney General is currently being consulted.
5.   KEY CONSIDERATIONS

     5.1   The decision is a sensitive one and will require careful handling.
     5.2   The attached table shows a list o f those who need to be informed, together with a
           note o f proposed action.
     5.3   Timing is critical. HFSG have made good use of the press in the past and there is
           every reason to suppose that they will ensure the press are notified immediately.
           Accordingly a press notice should be issued by CPS at the same time as letters are
           faxed informing the parties and others of the decision. (This is in hand).
     5.4   The decision is bound to be unpopular with the defendants. A challenge by way
           o f judicial review is possible. They may argue that we should be applying the
           realistic prospect o f conviction test.
6.   RECOMMENDATIONS

     6.1   Note the above and the plan attached..

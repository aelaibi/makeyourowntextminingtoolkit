As    the    da y       progressed                the      number        of       buses       being       parked          obviously

increased              over       the       period         of    t i m e , resulting               in the          buses        being

Whilst       this           was      going        on    thousands             of    football            fans       were        making          t h ei r

these       people           who       were       thronging             the       footpaths          on b o t h       sides          of     the

boisterous,                 singing          football            songs        etc,       though         no    trouble           wa s

As    the       da y    progressed                it    became          obvious          that      there        were       a    number           of

He    wa s     then       joined         by a n o t h e r      man who             strenuously             encoured                this

hindsight            what       I do       now,      must      have         beers at          the    rear       of    the          crowd       in

It was         at    this       time       whilst         s t i ll     in     the       cordon and          trying             to       placate

these        people        before          they      got     outside            onto      Leppings          Lane          itself          and       in

sight        of     those       who      were     still        outside             that       one    of    these          ’f a n s ’ t oo k          a

hustled           away     by     another         two      friends            or    fellow          fans.

At    t h i s po i n t , a y o u n g            man,       who       a p p e a r ed      to    have       severe          rib       injuries

and    hwo        was     crying         in a d e e p l y        distressed               way,       approached                me       from    the

direction            of    the       Leppings         Lane       stand.             1 took          him    to    o ne      s^de,          as    the
first        ambulance            had      js ut     arrived,,            sat    him      down,       and    tried        to       console

h i m as      b e st      I could.,           but    he w a s        too     distressed              to    think      rationally,

stating         that       people         all       around       him       had       died and         he    had    somehow

managed         to       escape         and    he    could       not       handle         the       fact    that      he w a s       alive

and     these        other        people        were          dead.

Having        done        what       1 could         for       him,       I then         left       him and a i d e d anot he r

fan who         was       injured         and       in    deep       distress,            and       I then      put      them       both       in

a    place      of       safety         to a w a i t      the    chance          to      get    them       into    one        of    the

people        who        appeared          dead,         or    were       unconscious               etc,    were      seen         fi rs t,

appeared            to    be     dead,

A    short      t im e     later,          I was         instructed             by a n      unknown         police        'inspector

Dear

As you will no doubt be aware the interim inquests concerning the
Hillsborough Stadium disaster are being resumed on 18th April 1990.
The first two days will be held at the Memorial Hall in the centre of
Sheffield and not at the Medico Legal Centre. On the first day we are
starting at 10.30 a.m.

It has also been possible to list the interim resumed inquest into the
death of
for                        April 1990 at                 am/pm
and this will take place at the Medico Legal Centre , Watery Street
Sheffield. Your legal representatives have also been written to.  If
any change with regard to these arrangements have to be made you will
be notified.

Attached to this letter is an information pack regarding location and
other matters which I hope you will find useful. If you have some
pressing query regarding the arrangements please contact the Listing
Officer at Furnival House, Sheffield. Tel.  0742 762342..

You will appreciate that there are several inquests listed for each
day. To avoid inconvenience to others and to endeavour to complete
each day's work my aim is to start at or as near as possible to the
listing times stated.  If you wish to be present at the inquest it
i-s essential that you should be at the location on time.

Having just stated how important it is that you should not be late
I also have to say that you must be prepared to find that the start
of the inquest could be delayed because for example another inquest
has over run.  Obviously I do not want to inconvenience you but I am
sure that you will bear with me if you are in fact kept waiting.

As space is limited at the Medico Legal Centre should you become aware
that a largish number, of relatives or friends may wish to attend the
inquest (say more than 12) please let my Listing Officer know and give
him an estimate of the numbers involved. He will then try to reserve
e;:tra seats for you in the court room.

Both I and the officers involved in the preparation for these inquests
are conscious that returning to Sheffield for the inquest is likely to
be upsetting for you. I recognise that this is inevitable and am
sorry that it has to be so. You may like to know that a considerable
amount of effort has gone into the arrangements for the inquest to
                             2ss or pain to you.

Dear

Because of the time for which the inquest into the death of your loved
one has been listed arrangements have been made to reserve and make
available to you one twin bedded room at the Rutland Hotel 452,
Glossop Road, Sheffield S10 2PY. (Tel. No. 0742 664411) for one night
on a bed and breakfast basis. You would not be charged for this
accomodation but obviously any charges for extras or additional
services above the bed and breakfast arrangements would have to be for
your account.

If other members of the family also wish to stay overnight in
Sheffield then they will have to make their own arrangements at their
expense.  Please note that because of events in Sheffield accomodation
may be scarce.

If you do not wish to take advantage of the accomodation referred to
above please let my Listing Officer know as soon as possible (Tel 0742
762342) so that the room can be released back to the hotel.




Yours sincerely,

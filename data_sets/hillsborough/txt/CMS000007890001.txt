                                        selected it is timely to
write to you and both assessors confirming your appointment to
carry out an Inquiry into the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster.

    The terms of reference are as follows:

     "To inquire into the events at Sheffield Wednesday
     football ground on 15 April 1989 and to make
     recommendations about the needs of crowd control
     and safety at sports events.”

     You will be assisted by two assessors: Mr Brian Johnson
QPM, Chief Constable of Lancashire; and Professor Leonard Maunder
OBE BSc PhD Sc D FEng FIMechE, Professor of Mechanical
Engineering at the University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne.

    This Inquiry has been set up as a Departmental Inquiry. The
option of establishing the Inquiry under the Tribunals and
Inquiries Act 1921 has been considered but, at least for the
present, set aside. I remain of the view that this is the right
procedure for this kind of Inquiry but it could be reconsidered
were you to form the view that your investigations were being
seriously hampered by lack of the powers which the 1921 Act would
confer.

    No terminal date for the Inquiry has been set, but         I have
asked that it should proceed with all possible speed.          The
possibility of your making one or more interim reports         exists
and, should you judge that to be feasible and helpful,         I should
welcome it.

    In conclusion, I renew my thanks to you, Mr Johnson and
Professor Maunder, to whom I am sending a copy of this letter,
for agreeing to undertake this urgent and important piece of
public service.

                                 \

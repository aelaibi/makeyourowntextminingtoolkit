I,     RICHARD WILLIAM BEADSLEY of
                               frlLL SAY AS FOLLOWS


I     was born on the 6th November 1959.                     I am presently             employed
as                                                                               I am a steel
worker        by        trade but was made redundant in December                    1987        and
then     worked           for        another     company   as a    steel    worker         on     a
temporary basis until the 31st March 1987.


I     have     been        a     steward or gatemen         for    Sheffield       Wednesday
Football           Club for the last 9 seasons.               For the first 6 seasons
I     was a steward and was almost always positioned at the bottom
of the steps leading to the seated area.                          There are two sets of
steps        leading           up to the seated area, but I was positioned                       at
the right hand steps which are nearest to C gate.                            For the last
3 seasons I have been a gateman for C gate.


It     has been the practice in recent years for the stewards                                   and
gatemen        to       be given a briefing at the annual meeting                        shortly
before        the        start       of each season.       Representatives          from        the
Police        and Fire Brigade attend the meeting to provide guidance
on     the evacuation procedures.                   At the start of the season I am
also     provided with a document known as "match day instructions
for staff" which I have read.


As     part of my duties as a gateman, I am fully aware that there
must     be        at    least one gateman available to man a                     gate.         The
normal        proceedure             is    for three gatemen to C gate             to     be     in
position           2    hours        before      a league match, and        to     remain        in
position        until           kick      off.    The other two      gatemen        for        this
season        have       been Malcolm Bain and Ian Marsh.                  We have        worked
out     a router whereby once kick off has started, two gatemen go
off     to    watch            the     game and one remains on        the        gate.         That
gateman       by the gate is then relieved after 15 minutes and                                 the
                                                   - 2 -


process        is    repeated.            Shortly      before half     time     all     three
gatemen        are        back in position and once play has                  been    resumed
the     process           is repeated again.           About 10 minutes        before       the
final     whistle,             the gateman at that time opens the gate.                     All
three     gatemen          then go off to hand back their jackets                     and    to
collect        their'      pay.        This basic routine is repeated                for    all
first     team       matches including FA Cup matches and FA                     Cup        semi
finals.


I     now turn to my involvement in the events which took place on
the     15th April 1989 at Hillsborough.                    I arrived at the           ground
at     about 11.20 to 11.30 am.                    I signed in and took my steward's
jacket     and       went        to C gate.         I was the first      gatemen       there.
Shortly        afterwards          Ian Marsh and Malcolm Bain arrived.                      From
about .11.30              am     to 1.00 pm the gate was left           open     about        18
inches.       The         gate should not be open but it is easier for                       the
gatemen        to leave the gate open to this extent to allow                          Police
and     other        club officials in and out.                  It saves us    having        to
continually           open and shut th~ gate.              The gate can be opened to
this extent and locked into position.


I     should        mention that the gates are always unlocked                       when     we
arrive         to     take up our posts.              The gate can be opened          by       a
simple        lever and it is not possible to open the gate from                             the
outside.


From     about        1.00       pm we had a Liverpool steward                with    us.      I
cannot remember his name.


We     knew     all the senior Police Officers at least by sight                             who
were     present           at or near C gate.           However, many of        the     other
Police Officers appeared to be new faces.                           It is normal for any
league     match           to     have     8   - 10     Police     Officers     behind       the
turnstiles           and        near     C gate.      About the same number          were     in
position,           and     as fans came through the turnstiles                  they       were
searched.
                                              - 3 -


We also allowed 8 or 9 Liverpool stewards through C gate.                                They
all     had       passes        from Liverpool Football Club         and    were         also
wearing           steward's jackets.          They proceeded to mingle with the
crowd     and        were helping to deal with any problems or                    to     help
direct fans to the relevant area.


Outside        the       gate,     there was a Police barrier.             This        was     a
simple        rail       blocking the pathway leading to the South                     stand.
The barrier was put in position at 90 degrees to the end of the
gate     nearest          to     the South stand.     At last years         semi        final
involving          the     same     teams,    the barrier    was     placed        at        the
opposite          end     of     the gate.    There were four       or     five        Police
Officers around the barrier.


There were no problems until about 2.10 pm.                       The gate was still
open     about 18 inches.             A Liverpool supporter wanted to pay                     to
get     in.       He did not have a ticket.           The Liverpool steward told
me     that       he would not be granted entry and he went                  away.            We
then closed the gate.


About     this time, I saw Liverpool supporters coming through the
turnstiles           and throwing the counterfoil of their tickets                       over
the     turnstiles             so other supporters could use them to               attempt
entry.


At     about       2.45 or 2.50 pm a number of supporters                   started           to
climb over the turnstiles.                   The first six or seven were ejected
through        our       gate     by the Police Officers.          However,        shortly
later the Police started to help fans down from the turnstiles.
I remember seeing one supporter with a broken arm.


The gatemen were told to open the gate at about this time.                                   The
order     was given by a senior Police Officer, an Inspector, whom
I     know     by sight but his name I do not know.                 He has a           beard.
The     gate       was     opened about 5 feet.        The supporters         who        were
outside        were allowed through the gate which remained open                             for
about         1    to     1%     minutes.     There were    six    or    seven         Police
                                                    - 4 -


Officers              outside           directing the supporters through the                  gate.
The        gatemen were then told to shut the gate by the                           same Police
Inspector.


1     cannot           remember         whether I was responsible for              opening          or
closing              the gate at this time.             The Police Inspector was about
2     to     3       yards from the gate.              I believe    that     about          300-400
supporters got through at this time.


Within           a     minute           or so we were told once again             to       open     the
gate.        I        heard      the      same voice     from behind       from        the Police
Inspector              to       open    the gate.      I cannot remember          whether          the
request              or order was repeated.             I have seen the photographs of
Superintendant                  Marshall      since     the 15th April and             I    do     not
remember              seeing him in the area behind the turnstiles.                          He may
well have been outside C gate.


As     the           order was given, I heard someone shout that                       we        would
have blood on our hands or words                        to   that effect if the gate was
opened.               Many      Liverpool supporters were milling about                      behind
the        turnstiles and some had said to us that if we did not open
the gate a riot would start outside, whereas others said if the
gate        was opened there would be trouble or bloodshed inside.


At     this time I had no idea of the numbers outside but I                                       could
hear        banging             against     the gate.        The supporters       inside          were
shouting and swearing at u s .


I     do     not remember whether I was responsible for                           opening           the
gate,        but           it    was pulled back and I then helped to                      pull     the
gate        fully           back.       We stepped to one side         as     the          Liverpool
supporters went past.


There        was no discussion with the Police over whether the                                    gate
should be opened.                      My job is to man the gate in the event of an
emergency                 and    to     open the gate before the final              whistle          is
blown.               If     the Police direct me to do something, I do it.                            I
                                              - 5 -


would        not     open        the gate unless told to do so by          either    the
Police or the Chief Steward.


The      supporters that came through headed for the tunnel,                        there
were        about 200 - 300 supporters behind the turnstiles and they
became        caught        up     in the people coming through C          gate.      The
 first       reaction        of     the gatemen was to have a laugh          and     joke
over        the chaos before our eyes.            The gate remained open for            2
to     3 minutes and certainly— not more than 5 minutes.                     An     order
was      given       to shut the gate but I cannot remember                the     Police
Officer        who     gave this order.         We kept the gate open about            18
 inches.       By     that stage there was nobody outside C                gate.      The
 supporters were still being allowed through the turnstiles.


At      last       years     semi     final   there     was    no' great    influx     of
 supporters.           Only        Police Officers had been allowed through             C
 gate.         I    remember        at 3.55 pm at last years semi          final     that
 there       were     no people outside.         I also seem to       remember       that
“'there      were a lot more Police Officers behind the turnstiles
 last years semi final.


 I     am     almost certain that the Police at last years semi                     final
 did        close the doors to the tunnel or stood outside the                     tunnel
 leading           to the central pen.        I have seen this done many            times
 before        by     the Police, once they realise the central pens                  are
 full.

 I     should        mention that the Police outside C gate told me                  that
 the        kick off had been postponed until 3.15 pm.                This       occurred
 at     about        2.50 pm or thereabouts.           In fact, I did not         realise
 that the game was underway at 3.00 pm.                       I remember hearing over
 the        Police radio that there was a pitch invasion.                  The     Police
 Officers           behind the turnstiles made off towards the South West
 pen.

 Shortly afterwards, a Liverpool supporter came up and said that
 he wanted to get his money back.                     He said there was going to be
no     football        played at Hillsborough today, and that therewas
likely     to     be     another Heysel.      I took him over   to the main
offices     but        when I got back to C gate I noticed people        being
brought     out        through the tunnel who were injured.      I   went      to
the     tunnel. The ambulancemen and firemen present told me                that
there was nothing I could do.


I     took drinks from the snack bar underneath the West stand                 to
people     in     the     area     between the rear ef the   stand and       the
turnstiles.            After     that,   I went on to the pitchand   I   was
amazed at what I saw.              For about half   an hour I walked about in
a daze.     I went home at about 4.50 pm.


This statement is true to the best of my knowledge               and belief.

           States

           I reside at the above address with my family.

           I am a member of South Yorkshire Police Special C o n s ta b u l ar y , my

           collar number being                   I have been in the SpecL&l Constabulary since

           •11th November       1987 (111187).       During my servic</l have always worked

           from A2 Sub-Division,            Stainforth.

           During my service I have not had occasion to work any football matches

           whatsoever.

           On Saturday 15th April            1989 (150489) at 2.00 pm (1400)                   I commenced

           duty at Stainforth Police Station.                 My duty for the day was mobile

           patrol,     Alpha 264,    in company with PC___          ______ .           Throughout that day

           I carried out normal         routine mobile patrol        duties.                A number of Police

           Officers were called upon to attend the Hillsborough Football Stadium,
                                                                             PAGE     2

         Sheffield,   that day.   However,   I remained on the A2 Sub-Division.   I

         had no contact whatsoever with Hillsborough Stadium that day.

                                                                            SIGNED

         we went        down there        first,        to the      left hand side            of the goal as we

         f ac ed the       pitch.         A fter    a few minutes              standing ar ou nd the enclosure

         appeared        to fill        up suddenly.             People were           pushing and swaying and               I

         felt    uneasy as         I n o rm al ly       sit down at matches.                   I looked at                and

         he    said,     ’D o n ’t w orry                 it will      settle       down soon,         its al wa ys    like

         him because                   was   getting       pushed.             By this      time we had m o v e d back

         t rying    to get over         the    perimeter       fence       but    the Police were            trying        to

         T he re were       piles     of bodies       crushed up and over                   the   barrier but there

         was   nothing       I could do to help because                    I could not move we were

         trapped.           I lost sight        of all my friends.                     My    left hand was          free

         stuck     up in the air and a girl was                     passed over             the top of us.            Prior

         to this w hen         I ha nd ed              over    I lost       balance and ended on the

         g ro un d but m a na ge d to scramble               back    up.



         I tried to get to              the front but          it was       impossible1.             I then went with

         the   crowd towards            the side      fence on my           left/hand side.                I don't       know

         how   I got out        I had given up s t r u g g l i n g , /            I was       exh au st ed but       I know

         a p o li ce ma n    pulled me over           the side ^ e n c e         and    I fell      onto     the steps             on

         the w a l k w a y and      landed flat on my/back.                  The       policeman who         pulled me

         out also       fell    off     the fence artX landed              on my foot.               I had    injured my

         back a nd was         carried t h r o u gt /t he      gate    onto the             pitch where       I lay,       I

         had   problems        bre at hi ng and a P o l i c e m a n stayed with me a few minutes,

         until     I s ta rt ed b re ath/ng again.                  I was    then seen by a young                   lad from

         the St Johns A m b u la nc e          I could not move             because          of my back       but    I

         s h o ut e d at him to go an d help someone                   else,       that       I was alright.               I

         told them        not to bother         w ith me and a st re tc he r                 but to help others,                   I

         was   told to stay there              but                  came and found me and he helped me

         to get     up.        I was    feeling       e xh austed and we m ov ed a few steps then                              I

         lay down again.               We    repeated this a few times                      until we got       to the

         advertising         boards at        the    side.      I felt a b s o l u t e l y e x h a us te d and

         shocked.           I was a ware       that    people were          running about            on the     pitch and

         they were        using boards as stretchers.                       There were a m bu la nc es              on the

         pitch.         By this       time            and            were also          there and               had

         w i t h him.

We sat at the side and fire me n                                 came to see       if we needed any help but              I

said      I was alright.                     We w ai t e d until           after    the tannoy from K e nn y

D a f ^ i l f t ^ a n d a tannoy to say the m a tc h was a b a n d o n e d and the                          crowds

had gone          before we             left.



We made          our way out,               having         heard on the        radio     that five    people      had

died.            I was        s h a t te re d and we             left by the       corner terrace and out

t h r ou g h the double                 gates at Leppings               Ln.



We w a l k e d back towards                    the       car and a w oman          carne out of her house and

took      us     in for a drink.                      We       tried to use her         phone   but all    the    lines

were      engaged.                 So after SO minutes we                   1e f t .     I began the drive         home

but b ecause               of my back           injury          I couldn't     drive     very well    so           took

over      the     driving.                 We drove            back .slowly because of the traffic and I

The    only       part of the               football            I saw was Bruce         G ROBBELAR and Peter

B E A R D S L E Y warming             up    in the goal            mouth    prior      to the game.        I saw    none

of the m a t ch a nd because                          of the s creaming and             panic and the fact         that

I could not see a ny th in g                          I did not know the m a tc h started.



I am w ill in g            to give          evidence            if required.

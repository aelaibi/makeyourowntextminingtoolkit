        I thank you for your letter of 26* August 1998 and note the contents thereof.

        My purpose in writing to you is to see whether you can offer any clarification that would assist
        us in     part of our submission to the Director of Public Prosecutions relating to the
        ownership of documentation arising out of the disaster. With this in mind, I enclose extract of
        a report written by Peter Wright, the then Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police, which
        was presented to a meeting of South Yorkshire Police Authority on 17* November 1989.
        You will note from paragraph 5.3 that on 15th August 1989, the Director wrote to the Chief
        Constable setting out his view that the matter should be the subject of a full criminal
        investigation. Are you able to provide me with a copy of this letter? If not, can you please tell
        me whose suggestion it was that Mr Geoffrey Dear be invited to undertake the investigation?

        I thank you for your assistance.


        Yours sincerely                                               r a SFW ORK

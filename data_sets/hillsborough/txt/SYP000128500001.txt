               SATURDAY 13th APRIL 1989 (150489)

               DUTY S am (0800) x 7.30 pm ( 1930)

               At S am (0800) on Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489),                     I paraded for

               duty at West Bar Police Station, Sheffield, where I was provided with

               a packed lunch.

               At 9 am (09GQ) the same day and date,                  I attended a briefing on        the

               fifth floor of West Bar Police Station where I was informed of                         my

               duties at the FA Cup semi-final football match between Liverpool

               On this day I was a member of Serial number 5 and the officer in

               charge of same was Police Sergeant 1379                  CLEMENTS.

               The serial was divided into pairs and I was accompanied by Police

               Constable 2413 WHALEY.
                                                                                          PAGE    2


Our d uty         cons i.s t e d of receiving the   No11ingham     Forest fans at the

Sheffield Midland Railway Station,                  searching same and ensuring that

they boarded public service vehicles outside the station.

I commenced duty at the Hidland Station at 10 am (1000).

At approximately 11.20 am (1120) the same day and date, together with

Police Constable 2413 WHALEY,               I boarded a double decked public service

the H i 11sborou g h Football Ground.

On route to the ground I observed that a number of public houses in

the Penistone Road area were crowded with football fans of both teams.

On arrival at the ground there was no reception by police officers and

following the advice of a senior officer,                  the fans were allowed to

alight from the public service vehicle and disperse outside the ground.

I then returned with the public service vehicle to the Midland Railway

Station where on arrival at approximately 1.10pm (1310) more fans were

collected and conveyed to the football ground.

At approximately 2.15pm (1415) the same day and date,                        I. accompanied

Police Constable WHALEY to the gymnasium at the Hillsborough Football

Ground where we were provided with a hot meal.

with the rest of the serial to make my way to the perimeter track in

front of the Leppings Lane Stand.

As I did so I observed that the game was in progress and I saw

numerous people on the pitch behind the goal.

On reaching the terrace I saw people in the crowded pens who were

obviously in great distress and I also saw people who appeared

1 if e 1e s s .

It appeared to me that pressure was being applied to the people at the

front of the terrace by the volume of people behind them.

Peop1e in the crowd were screaming to get out and 1 saw peop1e
                                                                        PAGE     3


climbing over others in an attempt to reach the fence at the front of

the terrace.

As a result I approached, a senior officer and requested that pressure

be released by removing people at the rear of the stand.

1 then attempted to pull people through an open gateway, however I was

unable to do so because of the volume of people wedged in the area.

As a result 1 then climbed up onto the fence and, together with other

officers,   pulled members of the crowd over the top of the fence.

Numerous persons were removed from the crowd in this manner.

When the pressure of people eased I was able to remove people both

a live and de ad f rom t h e ga t eway.

I assisted another officer in attempting to resuscitate a male person

with negative result.

Inside the pens I observed a large group of bodies near to a badly

buck1ed barrier.

when the pens were almost cleared of people,          I was instructed to join

a cordon of police officers which was formed across the halfway line

of the football pitch.

At 5 . 10pm (171G5 the same day and date,       I attended in the area of the

Mi dar.d Sta't ion the s cene of seve ra 1 di stur bances .

At 7.30 pm (1930) the same day and date, I concluded my duty at West

Bar' Police Station.

               I am a Police Constable in the South Yorkshire Police Force and 1 am

               presently stationed at West Bar Police Station,, Sheffield,

               At 9.00 am (0900) on Saturday 13th April                  1939 (130489),   I paraded at

               West Bar Police Station, Sheffield where I was informed I was working

               on D1 Serial 5 in relation to the FA Cup Semi finals football match,

               between Liverpool Football Club and Nottingham Forrest Football Club

               being held at the Hillsborough Football Ground.

               The duties of the serial were PSV escorts, that being escorting

               football fans from Sheffield Midland Station to the football grouna on

               buses.

               At 10.00 am (1000) that morning I commenced standby duties at Midland

               Railway Station in company with PC 2370 BROOKES.

               The first escorting of fans being commenced at 11.20 am (1120 > with tne
above officer.   These fans being Nottingham Forest supporters.

Enroute to the ground via Penistone Road,    it was noticeable that all

the public houses were crowded, with personage spilling out onto the

road consumi ng drink, as there appeared to be no room inside.

On arrival at the ground the fans were not received by other officers

but left to disperse on their own.    This was so even though I asked a

senior officer on Penistone Rd, as to whether the fans snould be

received and ushered into the ground.

Once the fans had left the bus, I    returned to theRailway Station        with

PC BROOKES.   On our arrival there   we later performed    a second PSV

escort to the ground at 1.10 pm (13 10) that day.      After which my serial

remained on standby in the gym at the Hillsborough Football Ground.

At about 3.04 pm { i!3Q4) that day all officers in the gym were

requested to make   our way to the perimeter track, my serial dio        so,   I

myself being accompanied by PC BROOKES.     On arrival there,    there

appeared to be a pitch invasion, however seconds later it was apparent             ’

persons had been injured in a crush behind the Liverpool goal, at the

Leppings Lane end of the ground.

Moments later the   game was stopped and I attended at the fence.I saw

that all the exit   gates were blocked by the sheer volume of people

attempting to escape the crush through the small exit way.

This was so to such an extent that it was necessary for 4 or more

police officers to physically drag persons out of the gates, however

this was an extremely slow process and it was obvious that persons were

being crushed to death behind the    security fence.      I continued to

assist in removal of persons from    gates exits and by assisting persons

to climb over the fence, with other officers.

It was obvious persons were being injured by physically dragging them

out of the crush forcibly, but this was necessary to save their lives.

1 saw people fall behind the fence arid collapse,      being trampled, and
crushed, however there was no way of assisting them due to the high

fence with the rearward fencing topping spikes being in place.          It

appeared people were still coming into the ground and were pushing                :
                                                                                  i
forward ignoring requests to move back or hold their position.          At this

point I saw a number of objects thrown by persons at the officers whichj

included myself on the fence.         Some of these persons appeared worse for

drink, and appeared unaware of the situation at the front of the fence

which was desperate, as people were panicing as they were being

crushed and some even fought to get out of the terrace.          It was obvious

to me that numerous persons were being killed or injured.          During this

time I was aware of PC 1379 CLEMENTS stating he was requesting         'Cutting

Ge a r? by radio for the wire fence, but none came.        I continued to

At this point police officers and football fans,         including myself,

managed to kick the fence and tear the wire mesh from the rails with

our hands.      Persons were then brought through the sides of the fence.

As this was done it was noticeable that some youths were worse for the

effects of drink, many were those who had pushed in from the back but

had worked their way to the front.         This was done without care or

r ega rd for   o the r pe rso ns .

The situation eased considerable when a number of police officers

pulled persons away from the fence, from the rear.         These officers

             communications and ordinary police officers had to use their own

             initiative on how best to deal with the situation.

             After the incident I eventually made my way back to West Bar Police

             Station with PC BROOKES.

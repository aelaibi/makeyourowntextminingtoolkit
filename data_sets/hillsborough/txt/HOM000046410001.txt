                              Dr Popper accepts that the cut off point

POPPER cont:              different view; I'm not saying that I m
infallibly right,what   I an saying is, that was the view I took,
and I did it to the best of ny ability at the time.

BECK.                    Although the Coroner appears to have
great discretion to conduct broad or narrow investigations of
contentious deaths, in practice the pressure is mostly in the
direction of conservatism. Better to be safe than sorry. But
barrister Tim Owen argues that the system can no longer afford
to rely on its inquisitorial purity. Controversial deaths, by
their very nature, beg to be looked at in a wider context.

0WEN.                     In controversial cases, the idea that
you can avoid, if you like, an adversarial contest or conflict
is absurd. There plainly are frequently different views about
culpability, whether proper care was given, and it's absurd to
^■inv that an inquest process can be shorn of that type of
controversy, and once you accept that the controversy exists,
then the current procedure is not a satisfactory one for
resolving it, because it leaves too much discretion in the hands
 of coroners, it keeps too much information back from people who
 have a legitimate interest in knowing about it before the
 inquest, and it leaves the jury and the coroner with too narrow
 a function, if you like, in returning the verdict, because the
 verdicts, as they are now returned, are simply too brief and
 don't disclose in clear terms the full circumstances in how
 somebody died, and what measures are necessary to prevent death
  in the future.

  BECK!                     21 years ago, the Brodrick Report looked
  at all aspects of the Coroners Court and made its recommendations
  - advance disclosure, legal aid and wider rights of appeal
  against verdicts were all put forward as ways of making the
  system more acceptable to both sides. They were largely ignored,
  as were the recommendations of a committee in 1986 which looked
  at the inquest system and suggested a way of dealing with
  controversial deaths. Evan Stone, QC was the chairman of that

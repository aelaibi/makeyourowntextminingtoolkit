    told             to    close,         but     we    were        worried          about           the    roof        giving         way.

    The          police          were      shouting            at    the       people           on    the       roof       to    get     down     but

    they             just     stayed        there.

    I took                200-300         tickets        on       that        day    which           was    fairly          quiet.

    The          police          were      on e i t h e r         s ide       of    t hat       turnstile             searching              peo ple,

    and          around          t hat     control           box.

    At      about           quarter         to     three          a man        came        to m y      turnstile                and    offered         m

    £.30.00 to                get    in the            ground.            A    police           officer           came      up a n a         asked     n

    if          he    had a t i c k e t           he    hesitated              for       a while           a n d was        then       sent      on    h

    checking                most     people.

*   He          was       a Liverpool             supporter.

    When             we    closed         the     turnstiles              we       too k       our    tickets           to a n        office      in

    I looked                across         to     the    West        Stand          and        could       see       that       people         were

North         Stand        and Soion             Kop       I saw a lad                on     the     f l o o r » he was              about           18-

wearing          a da r k b 3.u.e           “   T * s h 1 rt , and             turnup          trousers.,                He    seemed

alright          and       then       suddenly             started          to     h ave       trouble          breathing             he     Had

some      people           around          him.         I d ont          know      if      they      were       family,             friends           or

ju s t    helping           out.

As    this       man       had     trouble            breathing            one        man      came       across          avid g a v e       Him

oxygen         he     put       a mask          on    his     face        and      this        was       connected             to a o x y g e n

bottle,          the       man     giving            the     oxygen        was        an a m b u l a n c e m a n          of       some     sort.

He    came       r o u n d a bit            with        the      oxygen,           so      I left         him.

I stood          by       the    pitch an d             someone           came        along        with        an    empty

st ret c h e r «           X asked          if       i. c o u l d    help        and       went      with       t his         man    to     the

West      Stand           the    ma n was            not     in a n y      uniform.

There         was     a    lady       on    the       pitch with an                   injury         to    her       left          leg,      we       put

her      on    the        stretcher             and     t ook       her    to      by the          ramp,        n ext         to    the     gym.

I went         b ack       o nto      the       pitch        and     it    seemed            to    have        quietened             down a

I    saw a       lad       being       interviewed                  by    the      pre s s        and     he    said          he    had a        forged

the      forged           ticket,          arid that          they        were        letting            anybody          in by       turnstiles

he    also       said       it was          all       the     polices            fault.

Whilst         he     was       being       interviewed                  one     of     the       gatemen           ha d a         look     at       his

ticket         and        said     that         it was        no     forgery.                The     stub       hadn't             been     removed

from      the        ticket,          but       I could          see      t h at      it was         a    real       tick et.

We    went       to       the    office          under        the        corn e r       of     the       south       s ta n d .       But        I

                         J U D G M E N T
                     (As approved by judge)
LORD JUSTICE WATKINS:    On 17th October 1989, Jonathan Cooke, the

    applicant before us for judicial review, was 16 years of age.

   At about 3.00 p.m. that day, he was a passenger in a motor car

   driven by his mother.    Police officers believed on information

   received over a police wireless that she had been driving

   badly.    They stopped her car as soon as they saw it.      They

   asked Mrs. Cooke to alight.     It was alleged that she

   immediately became extremely abusive and the applicant got out

   of the car and attacked and injured slightly both officers who

   thereupon arrested him and took him to a police station at

   Harlesden.   He was charged with obstructing the police and

   bailed.   On 22nd November, he was charged at the police

   station with criminal damage, disorderly behaviour,

   obstructing a police officer and two offences of assault

   occasioning actual bodily harm (section 47) as to which he

   later on elected to be tried by jury.

         A committal hearing was arranged for 16th January 1990.

   The crown Prosecution Service   (the C P S ) , before proceedings

   commenced, withdrew before the court the two section 47

   charges and substituted for them two charges of assaulting a

   police officer in the execution of his duty contrary to

   section 51 of the Police Act 1954.    The solicitor of the firm

   acting for the applicant that day did not object to what

   thereby necessarily became a summary trial.     The applicant was

   asked to plead to the two charges and he pleaded not guilty.

         Shortly afterwards, the applicant's solicitors, having



                              l
                                                                       7
further considered the matter, wrote to the CPS asking why the

substitution of charges had taken place and why that had not

been brought about by the procedure laid down in section 23 of

the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985.

         As relevant, that states:     "(1) Where the Director of

Public Prosecutions has the conduct of proceedings for an

offence, this section applies in relation to the preliminary

stages of those proceedings.

         "(2) In this section,    'preliminary stage' in relation to

proceedings for an offence does not include       (a) in the case of

a summary offence, any stage of the proceedings after the

court has begun to hear evidence for the prosecution at the

trial;    (b) in the case of an indictable offence, any stage of

the proceedings after (i) the accused has been committed for

trial; or (ii) the court has begun to hear evidence for the

prosecution at a summary trial of the offence.

         ” (3) Where, at any time during the preliminary stages of

the proceedings, the Director gives notice under this section

to the clerk of the court that he does not want the

proceedings to continue, they shall be discontinued with

effect from the giving of that notice but may be reviewed by

notice given by the accused under subsection (7) b e l o w .......

         *(5) The Director shall,    in any notice given under

subsection (3) above, give reasons for not wanting the

proceedings to continue......

         "7.   Where the Director has given notice under



                              2
                                                                     8
 subsection (3) above, the accused shall,     if he wants the

proceedings to continue, give notice to that effect to the

clerk of the court within the prescribed period; and where

notice is so given the proceedings shall continue as if no

notice had been given by the Director under subsection (3)
a b o ve."

        Rules made under Magistrates' Courts Act 1980, as

extended by section 23, lay down as follows:       "3.   The period

within which an accused person may give notice under

subsection (7) of section 23 that he wants proceedings against

him to continue is 35 days from the day when the proceedings

were discontinued under that section.

        "4.   Notice under subsection (3),   (4) or (7) of section

23   shall be given in writing and shall contain sufficient

particulars to identify the particular offence to which it

relates; and, without prejudice to any other lawful method of

giving notice, may be given by post in a registered letter or

by the recorded delivery service,    in which case it shall be

treated as having been given on the date on which it is

received for dispatch by the Post Office."

       Mr. Eaton, a partner in the firm of solicitors acting

for the applicant, attended at court in order to deal further

with this matter on 11th April.     Before any evidence was

taken, he made an application to the court that it should

regard the section 47 charges as not discontinued.       He made a

series of submissions to the justices that day which were



                            3
                                                                  ,9
based upon the contention that section 23 contained a

procedure which governed and solely governed any kind of

attempt by the CPS to discontinue proceedings in a criminal

case.    The submissions which he made have been the subject of

a far more detailed analysis by Mr. Craig, learned counsel for

the applicant in this court.

        Mr. Eaton asked the justices on that occasion, they

refusing his application to regard the section 47 offences as

not being discontinued,   to proceed no further in any event

whilst he gave consideration to the making of an application

for judicial review.    He applied for legal aid on behalf of

the applicant.    That appears to have been granted.   An

application to this court was made.    It came before Pill J.

who granted the applicant leave to move.    He, on request, also

stayed all proceedings before the justices so that we are, in

December 1991, dealing with a matter which,   factually

speaking, arose as long ago as 1989.

        The decisions which are challenged in this court on

behalf of the applicant are, firstly, the refusal of the CPS

on 30th March 1990 and afterwards to serve upon the applicant

a notice of discontinuance in respect of the two section 47

offences;    secondly, the refusal of the Brent justices on 11th

November 1990 to treat the proceedings in respect of those

offences as continuing; and, thirdly, the refusal of the

justices on that day to stay the proceedings in respect of the

section 51 offences.



                            4
                                                                10
       The relief sought is (l) an order of mandamus directed

 to the Director or the C.P.S. requiring that there be served

 on the applicant a notice of discontinuance in respect of the

 section 47 offences,    (2)       an order of mandamus directed to the

 justices requiring them to treat those offences as continuing,

 and (3) an order of prohibition directed to the justices

 preventing them from hearing either the substituted offences

 or any other offences until after the disposal of the section
47 offences.

      The grounds upon which relief is sought are said to be,

firstly,     that by purporting to withdraw the section 47

offences and by refusing to serve notice of discontinuance,

the C.P.s. was, and is, acting in breach of section 23 of the

Prosecution of Offences Act 1985;          secondly,   the decision of

the justices to treat the section 47 offences as properly

discontinued was wrong in law and contrary to section 23; and,

thirdly, the justices were in error in refusing to order a

stay in respect of the substituted summary offences until all

proceedings in respect of the section 47 offences had been
concluded.

      Mr. Craig says that the issue here is as stated by Mr.

Collins Q.c.,    for the Director instructed by the C.P.S, in his

skeleton argument,    subject to a minor alteration.        Taking that

into account, the issue is this:         does section 23 of the

Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 provide a complete code for

the termination of a prosecution during the preliminary stages



                               5
                                                                     U
of a prosecution or does the prosecution retain a power (a) to

offer no evidence at committal hearings before examining

justices, and (b) to withdraw charges with the leave if

required of the court?     Was the applicant properly

discharged by the justices in respect of the two section 47

offences or, alternatively, were those charges properly

withdrawn?

      I ought to interpolate here that in the court record,

the section 47 charges are referred to as "discharged".    It

may be that a more appropriate word would have been

"withdrawn", but however that may be, it does not affect the

real issue here which concerns the effect of section 23 upon

the right of a prosecutor to withdraw a criminal charge.

      I think that it is not in issue that the CPS did not

avail themselves at all in the present case of section 23.      It

is equally clear,   in my judgment, that if they were not in law

bound to do so, the action they took and the justices'

reaction to that cannot be criticised.    Thus, the applicant

properly stands to be tried summarily for the section 51

offences and, of course, upon the other charges he faces which

are also only triable summarily only.

      That the CPS regard section 23, and the Director

likewise, as an addition and no more to pre-existing powers of

a prosecutor to discontinue proceedings is manifest from the

booklet of guidance given to the CPS by or on the authority of

the Director,   a part of which, paragraph 10, is relevant here.




                                                                12
                            6
 That states:     "The use by the Crown Prosecutor of his power to

 terminate proceedings whether by using the procedure under

 Section 23 of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 or the

 continuing power to withdraw or offer no evidence is, in many

 ways, the most visible demonstration of the Service's

 fundamental commitment towards ensuring that only fit and

 proper cases are taken to trial.     Unless, of course, advice

has been given at a preliminary stage, the police decision to

 institute proceedings should never be met with passive

acquiescence but must always be the subject of r e v i e w .......••

         Mr. Craig submits that this guideline wrongly states the

position in law because absent the section 23 procedure,       the

CPS has no residual power to withdraw a prosecution nor to

offer no evidence.     He says that, in any event, having regard

to section 10 of the 1985 Act, the Director has no power to

issue guidelines as to when a prosecutor may withdraw a

charge.     I say at once that I cannot agree about the residual

power.     Whether the guidelines issued are valid is, of course,

an altogether different matter.      As to that I know of nothing

which supports Mr. Craig's submission which I would not regard
as well founded.

         Mr. Craig's main submissions are as follows.    He

concedes that prior to the 1985 Act, the law governing the

power of a prosecutor to withdraw a charge, discontinue

proceedings in other words,     is clearly and correctly stated in

a number of cases to which he referred us.



                            7
                                                                13
         *n R» v» Redbridge Justices, Ex parte Sainty (1981)

R.T.R.    13, at page 18A, Ackner L.J. stated:   "Those

authorities account for the proposition to be found in

Halsbury's Laws of England 4th Ed. Vol. 29,      ___   paragraph

328, headed 'Withdrawal of Summons'.      it reads as follows:

'By long practice a summons may with the permission of the

court be withdrawn without an adjudication.      This does not,

however, as a rule, have the effect of putting an end to the

ground of information or complaint.'     It then refers in the

note to the cases in which a withdrawal of a summons has

occurred and the court has proceeded to consider the effect of

that in so far as it might be a bar to further proceedings.        I

am accordingly wholly satisfied that the suggestion that a

court of summary jurisdiction has no power to permit a summons

or information to be withdrawn is a wholly invalid point and

the justices were wholly correct in rejecting it."

         In R- v. Canterbury & St. Augustine Justices. Ex parte

Klisiatz, R. v. Ramsgate Justices, Ex parte Warren & O r s .

(1982)    1 Q.B. 398, Lord Lane C.J. gave judgment in the course

of which he referred to a number of authorities including R.

V- Broad (1978) 68 Cr.App.R. 281.     It was held in Klisiatz:

"1.   That justices could not question a decision of the

prosecution in committal proceedings to offer no evidence as

they had no material before them on which to do so and,

therefore,   the principle that a higher court had a duty to

consider and consent to the decision of the prosecution to



                             8
                                                                   14
 ° ^ er no ev idence on a count of an indictment was not

 applicable to committal proceedings before the justices."

       At page 411E, Lord Lane observed:    "Next,    it is

 submitted that the justices always have a discretion to

 prevent an abuse of the process of their court, and this, it

 is alleged,   is what happened on both these occasions.       We were

referred to a number of authorities on the powers of the court

to prevent an abuse of the process before them."        The Lord

Chief Justice then referred to well-known authorities and he

went on:   "I am prepared to assume that there does exist in

the justices an inherent power to act so as to prevent any

flagrant abuse of the processes of their court,      limited

necessarily by any relevant statutory obligation.       This power,

if it exists, would have to be exercised by the justices very

sparingly and only in the most obvious circumstances which

disclose blatant injustice.    There must be, somewhere, some

limit as to what can be done before the court, and in that

respect we were referred to R. v. Bennett ____       and to R. y.

lodmin Justices ---- "   He went on further to quote from part

of the judgment of Lord Goddard in the latter case.       It is

clear that that Lord Chief Justice was in no doubt at all that

justices have the power, although it must be sparingly used,

to resist an attempt by the prosecution to withdraw

proceedings which are before them.

      The most recent of the authorities to which we were

referred was R^_v. Liverpool Stipendiary Magistrate, Ex parte



                           9
                                                                    15
Ellison    (1990) R.T.R. 220.        In that case, the applicant was

charged with attempted theft of property from a motor vehicle.

At an adjourned date for hearing before the stipendiary

magistrate,    the prosecutor applied to lay an oral information

in substitution for the charge under section 1 alleging an

offence of vehicle interference contrary to section 9 ( 1 ) (ii)

of the Act of 1981.     The prosecutor's reason for doing that

was that the offence which was to be proceeded with in

substitution for that originally charged was triable only
summarily.

        Leggatt J., in giving judgment, with which Bingham L.J.

agreed,    said at page 226E:        "The key to the determination of

this case appears to me to be that a defendant arraigned in a

magistrates' court has in truth no absolute right to trial by

jury.     Whether he has such a right depends on the charge which

   preferred against him.        Until the more serious charge in

this case was withdrawn, the applicant enjoyed such a

prospective right, but in relation to the less serious charge

he did not.    To speak of depriving the applicant of his right

to trial by jury is, in my judgment, only a pejorative way of

making the point that upon reduction of the charge he ceased

to be confronted by a charge sufficiently serious to warrant a

right to trial by jury.     In the absence of bad faith on the

part of the prosecutor or of unfairness or prejudice to the

accused, the prosecutor's motive in making the substitution

was irrelevant.    The question is whether the substitution was



                                10
                                                                       16
in this sense a proper one.      The prosecutor's good faith has

not been impugned nor has any unfairness or prejudice to the

applicant been suggested, except in so far as £iie substitution
                                                  I
was made so as to have the case tried summarily.      That in my

judgment did not involve any manipulation or misuse or

process.   Whilst it is no doubt preferable that the charge

ultimately made against a defendant should be correct in the

first place, that cannot always occur. The prosecutor has said

on affidavit that the Crown Prosecution Service took the view

that the less serious charge was appropriate in this case.”

      What was said in Ellison, especially in the quotation

which I have extracted from it which is of relevance, does

not, Mr. Craig submitted, assist us because what was said

there was per incuriam seeing that the effect of section 2 3

does not seem to have been referred to the court.     Anyhow,      it

is clear that it was neither argued nor considered, so Mr.

Craig maintained,   and that would appear to be the case.

      The position is, he asserts, that section 23 swept away

all the power a prosecutor had previously to discontinue

proceedings.   So much is, he says, absolutely plain from

subsection (1) and made plainer possibly by subsection      (7)

which puts the power in the hands of a defendant finally to

decide whether proceedings should be discontinued.     Thus the

weapon once in the hands of a prosecutor to deprive by

discontinuance a defendant's right to trial by jury has been

taken away from him and not before time.     If, he went on, the



                            11
                                                                  17
 prosecutor by the time of trial has been deprived of evidence

 essential to continue a prosecution, he may, without recourse

 to section 23, go before the court and offer no evidence, but

 that is not the position here.   The evidence, including

 medical evidence, upon the section 47 charges is precisely

 that which would be offered on the section 51 charges.     Thus,

 the section 23 procedure alone can be resorted to by the CPS

 which will give the applicant the right to insist via

 subsection (7) upon trial by jury.

      To all of that, Mr. Collins responded in a series of

submissions which amount to this.     He maintains that section

23 is a valuable addition to the power of a prosecutor to

discontinue proceedings and was designed by Parliament to have

that effect.   That being so, all the existing power of the

prosecutor, as is clear from the cases to which reference has

been made, has been preserved,    if it was the intention of

Parliament, he argued, that those powers should be taken away,

it would have said so expressly in the 1985 Act, either in

section 23 itself or in some other section.    However, no such

express words are to be found in the Act and there are no

words used in the Act from which such an inference to that

effect can be drawn.   Therefore, section 23 is, he maintains,

coterminous with the common law powers.

      If that be right, then there can be no question but that

it is open to a prosecutor to use, when deciding whether to

discontinue proceedings, either the procedure under section 23



                          12                                   18
or, as was always open to him to do, appear before the court

and invite the court to allow him to withdraw the proceedings

in the presence, of course, of a defendant or his legal

representative.

      As to the consent of the court being necessary for the

purpose of allowing a prosecutor to withdraw proceedings,

reference was made to R. v. Broad to which I have already

referred in this judgment, but it has to be borne in mind that

what was said in Broad does not reflect what was clearly the

view of the Lord Chief Justice as expressed in Klisiatz. which

is to say that the power of justices to refuse to consent to

the withdrawal of a charge upon application by a prosecutor is

limited,   limited in the sense that justices must, out of the

reasons given by a prosecutor seeking to withdraw a charge,

find bad faith or other motive which would savour of an abuse

of the process of the court.

      Mr. Collins went on to submit that the reason why, in

Ellison, no reference is to be found to section 23 is simply

because the court there and counsel appearing before it must

have come to the conclusion that section 23 had no role to

play in the issues before that court and did not arise for

consideration out of the facts.

      The power to withdraw a charge is therefore, so he

contended, two-fold.   It is as is explained in the reported

cases and as stated in section 23.   One does not exclude the

other nor does one do away with the other.    Section 23 is a



                            13
                                                                 19
 very useful handmaiden for a prosecutor and will do nothing

 but good to a defendant as well because very early on after

 the initial charging of a defendant and the papers in the case

have been sent to the CPS, that Service can bring its mind to

bear upon the wisdom or otherwise of proceeding with the

charge,   if it comes to the conclusion that it should not

proceed then, in a common sense way, the CPS may resort

forthwith to the use of the sensible procedure laid out in

section 23.    That would avoid an appearance in court by either

the prosecutor or the defendant with a consequent saving of

costs, time and trouble.    That would, of course, still leave

it free to a defendant to use subsection (7) and to demand

that the proceedings continue.    He may do that if only for the

reason that he wants to bring the matter into court in order

that it should be ventilated there and reported so that the

withdrawal of the charge against him be given the maximum

publicity possible.

      In my view, Mr. Collins is absolutely right in all his

contentions.   It is for one thing inconceivable, I think, that

the court in Ellison simply overlooked section 23.    The law as

to discontinuance, offering no evidence and so forth is still

that as stated in the cases I have mentioned in this judgment.

      The reason for the introduction of section 23 is, in my

opinion, all too clear.    It provides a most useful pre-hearing

or pre-trial economically beneficial to everyone concerned

procedure which enables the CPS by correspondence and without



                           14
                                                              20
    a court appearance to dispose of a prosecution which, upon

    further consideration or reflection,    it believes should no

    longer be proceeded with.    The terms of the section all point,

    it seems to me, to a creation of a power additional to that

    already possessed by a prosecutor to discontinue proceedings

    whilst, at the same time, affording to a defendant the right

    to insist on the continuance,    if only for the purpose, as I

    have said, of making an appearance in court where his name may

    be cleared and publicity given to that.

          Certain it is, in my judgment, that whether section 23

    has been used or not, a prosecutor may go before the court and

    withdraw a charge, without or if required the consent of the

    court, and thereby discontinue proceedings.    He may also offer

    no evidence regardless of a defendant's wish that an existing

    charge or charges be dealt with and are not supplanted by

    others which would deprive him of his preference to be tried

    by jury.

          I would dismiss this application for those reasons.

HR. JUSTICE JUDGE:   I agree.

HR. LEWIS (for Mr. Collins):  My only costs application is that
    legal aid taxation be granted.

LORD JUSTICE WATKINS:   Yes, certainly.

            applicant cam e to the U nited K in g d o m from Pakistan and on M ay 27,1992


                                                                                                        23

   she married the seco n d resp on dent. It w a s an arranged marriage. On
   N ovem b er 5 ,1 9 9 2 she com p la in ed to the p o lice that h e h ad b uggered her
   repeatedly and w ith o u t her co n sen t d u rin g the five m o n th s of their
  cohabitation. She also said that in about June 1992 h e h ad obtained a
  pornographic v id eo w h ic h h e u se d to stim ulate sexu al activity. On
  N o v em b er 6, 1992 sh e w a s ex a m in e d b y Dr H o u sto n , an experienced
  fem ale police surgeon, and on N o v e m b e r 13,1992 she w a s re-exam ined bv
  Dr Barker, another ex p erien ced fe m a le p o lice surgeon. She w a s observed
  to be an A sian lady of slight b u ild w ith a p o o r co m m a n d of English. Dr
  H ou ston noted scratches on her right u p p er arm and the backs of both
  hands consistent w ith fingernail scratches less than a w eek old.
 Examination of the private parts d isclo sed on each occasion dam age
 consistent w ith repeated anal penetration over a p r o lo n g e d period. To both
 doctors the applicant m a d e it clear that the anal p en etration took place
    ithout her consent but sh e w a s n ot w h o lly consistent as to its frequency.
 She told Dr H o u sto n it h a p p e n e d three or four tim es a w e e k but to Dr
 Barker she said it h a p p e n e d at least w eek ly . To both doctors sh e m ad e one
 com plaint of other violen ce, telling Dr H o u sto n that on ab ou t N o v em b er 3,
 19b2 w hen she refused to h a v e intercourse her hu sb an d h ad d ragged her
 dow n the stairs, scratching her w ith his nails, then h e had grabbed her by
 the back of the neck and throw n her on the settee.
  ^Vhen the allegations m ad e b y the applicant w ere p u t to the second
respondent he chose not to reply, but w h e n the p o lice visited the
matrimonial h om e they fo u n d the porn ograp h ic v id eo. O n N o v em b er 24,
199_ the police subm itted the file to the C row n Prosecution Service so that a
decision could be m a d e w h eth er or not to prosecute.


3. The Cro:cn Prosecution Service Decision (Part I)

    What h appened then is clear from an affidavit s w o r n b y Mr N aun ton ,
 the H ead of the Police C om plain ts D iv isio n at the C ro w n Prosecution
Service. The evid en ce w a s r e v ie w e d and d iscu ssed by responsible
m em bers of staff, and on D ecem b er 1, 1992 it w a s considered by Mr
N aun ton w h o so u gh t to a p p ly to it the relevant principles from the C ode
for C row n Prosecutors w h ich w a s issu ed p u rsu a n t to section 10 of the
Prosecution of Offences A ct 1985 as a p u blic declaration o f the principles
u p on w hich the C row n Prosecution Service exercises its functions. The
C ode indicates that w h e n con sid ering w h eth er to institute p roceedings
prosecutors shou ld h a v e regard first to the ev id en tia l sufficiency criteria
and, if they are satisfied, to the p u blic interest criteria. For present p u rp oses
the evidential sufficiency criteria can be said to be sum m arised in the
question: is there a realistic p rospect of a conviction, bearing in m ind the
evidence available and th ose lines o f d efen ce w h ich are plainly open to, or
have been indicated b y the accused? The p u blic interest criteria are a
variety of considerations w h ich m a y m ak e it inappropriate to prosecute
even though there is a realistic p rospect of conviction. The interests of the
Q.B.D.                                           R. v. D.P.P. (Kennedy L.J.)       139

victim are an im portant factor, so is the likely p enalty. Paragraph 8(1) of the
C o d e states:

     "W hen the circum stances of an offence are not particularly serious,
     and a court w o u ld be likely to im p o se a p u rely nom inal penalty,
     C ro w n Prosecutors sh ou ld carefully con sid er w hether the public
     interest w o u ld be better served b y a p rosecu tion or so m e other form o f
     d isp o sa l s u c h as, w h ere appropriate, a caution. This applies
     particularly w h ere the offence is triable on ind ictm ent w h en C row n
     Prosecutors sh o u ld also w e ig h the likely p en a lty w ith the likely length
     and costs of proceedings."

  In relation to sexu al offences paragraph 8(6) of the C ode reads:

     "(a) W h en ev er tw o or m ore p erson s h a v e participated in the offence in
     circum stances rendering both or all liable to prosecution, the C row n
     Prosecutor sh o u ld take into account each person's age, the relative
     a ges of the participants and w h eth er or not there w a s any elem ent of
     sed u ctio n or corruption w h e n d ecid in g w h eth er, and if so in respect of
     w h o m , p ro ceed in g s sh ou ld be instituted.
     (b) Sexual assaults u p o n children s h o u ld a lw a y s be regarded
     seriously, as sh o u ld offences against adults, such as rape, w hich
     a m ou nt to gross personal violation. In su ch cases, w here the Crown
     Prosecutor is satisfied as to the sufficiency o f the evidence, there will
     seld o m be any d ou bt that prosecu tion w ill b e in the public interest."


4. The Lazo of Buggery

   Before I com e to the actual decision m a d e by Mr N a u n to n it is necessary
to sav so m eth in g about the offence o f b u ggery, and about the attitude to be
ad o p ted by this Court w h e n asked to rev iew a d ecision of the Crown
Prosecution Service not to prosecute.
   If an adult m ale has anal intercourse w ith an adult fem ale that is an
offence contrary to section 12(1) of the Sexual O ffen ces Act, 1956. Unlike
the situation w h e n b u g g ery is com m itted by adult m ales on each other, it is
no d efen ce that the w o m a n consented or that the act w a s committed in
private, and in d eed if she d oes consent sh e b eco m es an accomplice.
H o w e v e r if the offence is com m itted in private b y an adult m an on an adult
w o m a n w h o con sen ts the matter is un lik ely n orm ally to com e to the notice
of the criminal la w , and if it does, p ro v id ed that there is no element of
corruption or seduction, the penalty w ill probably be relatively m od est
(see, for exam ple, Bush (1989) 11 Cr.App.R.(S.) 295 w here the sentence, as
varied bv the Court o f A ppeal, w a s three m o n th s' imprisonm ent).


5. The Poieer of Review

  It has been c o m m o n ground before us in the light of the authorities that
this Court d oes h a v e p o w er to review a d ecision of the Director of Public
          140                                                                [1995] ] C r.App.R.

          Prosecutions not to prosecute, but th e authorities also sh o w that the p o w er
    ^    is on e to be sparingly exercised. A s recently as 1975 Lawton L.J. said in
          Sclvavajnn v. Race Relations Board [1975] 1 W.L.R. 1686 at 1697:

                 A s far as I k n o w , the courts h a v e n ever interfered w ith the exercise of
                the Director s discretion: but it d o es not fo llow that thev could not do
                so if he refused or failed to perform his public duties or acted corruptlv
                or unfairlv."

            Then in General Council o f the Bar, ex p. Per a v a l [1991 ] 1 Q.B. 212 w h ere the
         applicant so u g h t to rev iew the C ouncil's decision not to prefer a m ore

        this Court w as concerned w ith d ecisio n s m ad e by the C row n Prosecution
g       Service in relation to the p ro secu tio n o f juveniles, and W atkins L.J.
        suggested at p. /68E that a "rigorous approach" w o u ld be a d op ted to
        attem pts to obtain judicial rev iew of a d ecision m a d e b v the police or the
        C rown Prosecution Service. At p. 768G h e said:

             "It seem s to m e that a d ecision to discon tin u e p ro ceed in g s by the CPS
             can be equated w ith a d ecisio n by the p olice not to prosecute and is,
P           therefore, op en to judicial rev iew o n ly u p o n the restricted basis
             available to s o m e o n e , a ssu m in g he has locus standi, seek in g to

           That restricted basis w a s indicated by the Court o f A p p ea l in
        Metropolitan Police Commissioner, ex p. Blackburn [1968] 2 Q.B. 118, 136 in
        w hich Lord D en nin g M.R. said o f the Com missioner:

            attempted suicide; but there are som e p olicy d ecision s w ith which, I
            think, the courts in a case can, if necessary, interfere. S u p p o se a chief

     h a v e th o u g h t that the court cou ld counterm and it. H e w o u ld be failing
     in h is d u ty to en force the law."

   Salm on L.J. said of the latter ty p e of situation that it wTou ld be a clear
breach of du ty. It w o u ld be so im proper that it cou ld n ot a m ou nt to an
exercise of the d iscretion. W e w ere also referred to the d ecision of the Court
o f A p p ea l in Raym ond v. Attorney-General (1982) 75 Cr.App.R. 34, [1982]
Q.B. 839, a d ecisio n of N o la n J., as h e then w a s, on an application for leave,
reported o n ly as Director o f Public Prosecuiions, ex p. Langlands-Pearse [1991]
C.O.D. 92, and the d ecisio n of this Court in Inland Revenue Commissioner, ex
p. Mead [1993] 1 A ll E.R. 772. From all of those d ecisio n s it seem s to m e that
in the context of the p resen t case this court can b e p ersu aded to act if and
o n ly if it is d em o n stra ted to u s that the Director of Public Prosecutions
acting th rou gh the C ro w n Prosecution Service arrived at the d ecision not
to prosecute:

     (1) because of s o m e u n la w fu l policy (such as the hypothetical decision
     in Blackburn n ot to p rosecu te w h ere the v a lu e of g o o d s stolen w as
     b elo w £100); or
     (2) becau se the Director of Public Prosecutions failed to act in
     accordance w ith her o w n settled p olicy as set out in the Code; or
     (3) becau se the d ecision w a s perverse. It w a s a decision at w hich no
     reasonable p rosecu tor could h a v e arrived.
   Mr Su pp erston e s o u g h t to satisfv u s under all three h ead s but h e did not
su ggest anythin g like im p rop er m o tiv e or bad faith.


6 . The Crown Prosecution Service Decision (Pari II)

  H a v in g identified w h a t w e h ave to look for I return to the evidence as to
w hat caused Mr N a u n to n to d ecide as he did. It is to b e found in
paragraphs 5, 6, 7 and 8 of his affidavit, w h ich read:

     " 5 .1 w a s satisfied that the evidential sufficiency criteria set out in the
     C o d e w ere satisfied in respect of the offence of bu ggery allegedly
     com m itted b y C on his wife.
     6 . In con sid ering th e public interest criteria I had regard to:
     (a) paragraph 7 of the C ode, and in particular the w o rd s there
     attributed to Lord Shawcross.
     (b) paragraph 8(vi) of the Code. In the light of the w o rd in g of that
     paragraph I con sid ered the ev id en ce on the issu e of consent. In v ie w of
     all the circum stances, and in particular the absence of any
     corroboration of the com plainant's account on this issue and her
     failure to m a k e a com plaint over a lon g period, I reached the
     conclusion that the ev id en ce of lack of con sen t w o u ld not have been
     strong e n o u g h to offer a realistic prospect of a conviction had the
    142                                  ____________________ [1995] 1 Cr.App-R-

          offence required proof of lack of consent. I therefore considered that
.         paragraph 8(vi)(b) of the C o d e did not apply.
          7 . 1 also had regard to the fact that, b y virtue of the Sexual Offences
           Acts 1967, b u ggery in private b etw een m ales aged over 21 is not an
           offence, un less p ro ved to be non -consen su al. Because of this
           provision, I also considered w hether a p rosecu tion w a s required for
           bugger}' of the alleged offender's w ife in private, w h ere both parties
           w ere over 21, and w h e re the ev id en ce of lack of consent w o u ld not
B         have b een sufficient to offer a realistic prospect of a conviction had the
           person b u ggered been male.
           8.          A pproaching the case on the basis that the alleged buggery could
           not h ave been p roved to h av e taken p lace w ith o u t the com plainant s
           consent, 1 concluded that in all the circum stances the complainant's
           grievance could be m ore appropriately dealt w ith in the matrimonial
           court, and that the public interest did not require the institution of
C         criminal proceedings. I w a s also aware that the police w o u ld consider
           w hether disciplinary p roceed in g s w ere appropriate.

    7. The Applicant's Submissions
      Mr Supperstone subm its that there is ev id en ce in those paragraphs of
   the adoption of an u n law fu l policy, n am ely a p olicy not to prosecute \\ here
   b u ^ e r v b etw een adults of different sexes m ay h a v e taken place with
D consent. Secondly, Mr S u pp erston e subm its that Mr N aun ton d o es not
   seem to have acted in accordance w ith the p olicy as set out in the Code. The
   applicant com plained that she w a s the victim of n on-consensual b uggery
   and that there w a s n o evid en ce su gg estin g she ga v e her consent. So w h en
   in paragraph 5 Mr N a u n ton say s he w a s satisfied that the evidential
   sufficiency criteria w ere satisfied in respect of the offence of b u g g e n
F allegedlv com m itted it w o u ld seem to follow that Mr N au n to n considered
   that there w a s a realistic prospect of a conviction of b u ggery w ithout
   consent. If so, the public interest criteria w o u ld be likely to militate in
    favour of rather than against a d ecision to prosecute.
      But it seem s clear from paragraphs 6, 7 and 8 o f the affidavit that in
   reality, despite w hat he says in paragraph 5, Mr N a u n to n w a s not satisfied
   of the evidential criteria in relation to the offence alleged. H e w a s only
F satisfied of the evidential criteria in relation to so m eth in g different, nam ely
   consensual buggery, an offence not alleged, so-the approach w a s to so m e
   extent distorted and not in line w ith the C ode. Lest it be thought that I am
   m istaken in referring to con sen su al b u g g ery a s s o m e t h in g different, it
   should be rem em bered that in R. r. Courtie (1984) 78 Cr.App.R. 292, 1984]
   A.C. 463 the H o u se of Lords recom m en d ed that lack of consent be alleged
   in the particulars of the count in the indictm ent, w ith consensual buggery,
G if appropriate, b ein g alleged as an alternative in a separate count.
    A lthough the circum stances w ere different in that case because that case
    w as concerned w ith b u ggery b etw een m ales, the principle, as it seem s to
     m e, still applies.

                                                                                            28
Q.B.D.                                          R. v. D.P.P- (Kennedy L.J.)       143

   Mr Supperstone's third s u b m issio n is that in s o far as Mr N aun ton w a s
not satisfied that the ev id en tia l sufficiency criteria w ere m et in relation to
b u ggery w ith out con sen t h is d ecisio n w a s perverse because it failed to
have regard to the apparent credibility of the com plainant, to the m edical
ev idence and to the d isco v ery of the p ornographic v id eo. It also had regard
to an irrelevant factor, n a m ely the la p se of time before the complaint w a s
made. Mr Su pp erston e su b m its that it is hardly surprising that the
applicant w aited for five m o n th s b efore she com plained. She w a s n e w ly
married and in a strange country, u n a b le to speak m u ch English, w ith few
p eo p le to turn to, and p o ssib ly feelin g s o m e concern about her status as an
immigrant. All of th ose m atters w o u ld h a v e been o b viou s to Mr N au n to n
had he thought about th em w ith o u t reference to any affidavit w h ich came
into existence after he had m a d e his decision.


8. The Respondent's Subm issions

   For the Director of Public P ro secu tio n s Mr D en nis invited us to focus on
the lack of corroboration in respect of the offence alleged, n am ely b uggery
w ithout consent. H e su b m itted , in m y v ie w rightly, that the m edical
evidence and the d isco v ery of the pornographic v id e o give little indication
as to w hether anal intercourse took place w ith or w ith out consent,
although Dr H o u sto n d id ob serve a pain fu l red sector of the anus and red
splits in the anal skin fold s. She w a s also unable to test the tone of the
internal ring of m u sc les b eca u se of the pain p rod u ced b \ spasm and the
patient b ecom in g distressed. N o d o u b t b ecause of the process of healing
those injuries w ere less apparent w h e n Dr Barker exam ined, but for m y
part I d o find it a little difficult, albeit n ot im possible, to envisage a w o m a n
a<?reein°; to acts of b u g g ery w h ich p ro d u ced such painful results.
  °A s Mr D en nis p oin ts out, Mr N a u n to n could not regard the injuries to
the arm and h a n d s as significant becau se the applicant herself w as
inconsistent as to h o w th ey wrere c a u sed and Mr D en nis subm its that there
w ere features indicating that in fact this lady did consent to b uggery. She
w as at the material tim e nearly 30 years of age. W hen, according to her, the
 first act of anal intercourse took place she w as in her sister's h om e and so
 her sister w o u ld h av e b een nearby. That is apparent from the affidavit of
 the applicant sw o r n on March 9,'1993 but w hether it w a s k n o w n to Mr
 N au n to n in D ecem b er 1992 I d o n ot k n o w because w e d o not have before
 us any statement w h ich the applicant m a d e or m ay have m ad e prior to that
 date. Mr D ennis also p o in ts to the la p se of time before a com plaint w as
 m ade.                                                                          .
   Mr Dennis, sup p orted b y Mr Egan for the secon d respondent, subm its
 that having d ecided that n o n -c o n se n su a l b uggery could not be proved Mr
 N aunton w as entitled to consider w h e th e r or not to prosecute at all and to
 w ei^ h in the balance the p en alty likely to be im p osed , the devastating
 effect on the accused of such a p rosecu tion and the fact that in law the
 complainant w o u ld be an accom p lice. Mr Egan rem inded u s of w hat was.

Puhlofer [1986] A.C. 484 and b y Lord L ow ry in R. v. Secret ant of State for the
Home Department, ex p. Brind [1991] 1 A.C. 696 about the n eed for courts to
exercise restraint w h e n discretion has b een v ested in others, and Mr Egan
points out w ith force that s o m e of the m atters n o w relied u p o n by Mr
Supperstone w ere not before Mr N a u n to n in late 1992, or are matters w hich
could not be relied u p o n in a criminal trial.


9. Conclusion

    In m y ju dgm ent this is one o f th ose rare cases w h ere the Director of
Public Prosecution's d ecision is s h o w n to b e fla w ed because Mr N au n to n
on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions did not approach the
question w h ich he h ad to d ecid e in accordance w ith the settled policy of
 the Director of Public P rosecutions as set out in the C ode. A lth o u g h
bu g g ery w ith out con sen t and co n sen su a l b u g g ery are both offences
 contrary to the 1956 A ct they are in reality separate offences and here only
 the former w as alleged, but the prosecutor's approach w as, as it seem s to
 me, to so m e extent c lo u d ed by the latter. Initially at least, as it seem s to me,
he should have disregarded it. H e w o u ld then h a v e h ad to bring his m ind
 fully to bear on the qu estion o f w h eth er the evidential sufficiency criteria
 w ere satisfied in relation to the m ore serious offence. In other w o rd s, he
 w o u ld have had to ask h im self if there w a s a realistic prospect of a
 conviction. H e w o u ld h a v e h ad to look at the ev id en ce available and
 consider those lines of d efen ce plainlv o p en to the accused. The accused
 had, up to that time, ch osen to rem ain silent but there w ere, as it seem s to
 me, looking at the m atter from Mr N a u n to n 's standpoint, tw o possible
 lines of defence. First, the accused m ig h t d e n y ever h avin g had intercourse
 per anum. That w a s a p o ssib ility w hich , so far as I can see, w a s not
 considered at all by Mr N a u n to n , and of course if h e h ad considered it the
 question of corroboration w o u ld h a v e b een easily satisfied. Instead he
 assum ed that the secon d resp o n d en t's line of d efen ce w o u ld be to adm it
 b u ggery but to assert that it w a s consensual. In those circum stances it
‘seem s to m e that Mr N a u n to n erred in that h e failed in accordance w ith
 paragraph 4 of the C o d e to "have regard to an y lines of d efen ce w h ich are
 plainly o p en t o . . . the accused." W hat con clusion Mr N a u n to n w o u ld have
 reached if he had had regard to b oth of the lin es of defence to w h ich I have
 referred instead of to just on e of them , as w e ll as to the fact that the second
 respondent had not as yet in d icated w h a t his line of defence m igh t be, is
 not a matter w hich in m y ju d g m en t sh ou ld be speculated u p o n in this
 court. The decision is on e for the Director of Public Prosecutions not for this
 court. Accordingly, u n less there are co m p ellin g reasons to d o otherw ise, I
 w o u ld set aside the d ecision and remit the matter to the Director of Public
 Prosecutions for consideration in the light of the judgm ent of this Court,
 and of course in the light of all that has h a p p en ed since the original
 decision w as m ade. It fo llo w s of course from w hat I have said that I need
Q.B.D.                                          R. v. D.P.P. (K ennedy L.J.)      145

not deal w ith Mr S u pp erston e's su b m issio n that the decision under
challenge w a s the result of the application of an u n la w fu l policy, although I       ^
am far from satisfied about that, but h e is entitled to say that the decision
w a s unreasonable in that it failed to have regard to a material
consideration. Primarily h o w e v e r I base m y d ecision on w h a t seem s to
have been a patent failure to act in accordance w ith the settled policy as set
out in the Code.


10. The Decision Letter

   The decision n ot to p ro secu te h a v in g been taken, the applicant w as
inform ed by a letter d a ted D ecem b er 9 ,1 9 9 2 w h ich w e have read. To say as
Mr N a u n ton d o es that "perhaps the letter could h a v e been m ore helpful is
an understatem ent, and it is s o m e relief to m e to k n o w that the standard
letters and explanatory n o te are b ein g revised, but frankly it seem s to m e
that this applicant, w ith her poor co m m a n d of English, sh ou ld have been
told of the decision either directly or through an interpreter in w ord s that
she could understand.


11. Oppression

   On behalf of the seco n d resp on dent Mr Egan subm its that even if the                ^
decision w a s flaw ed w e sh ou ld let it stand in justice to the second
respondent becau se he w a s told in D ecem ber 1992 that h e w o u ld not be
prosecuted and did not learn of this application until July 1993. Shortly
before the decision w a s taken it seem s that so m e m em b er of the applicant's
family m ad e an approach to the press, and the applicant, h a\ ing shared a
roof w ith the second resp o n d en t for so m e considerable time after she
com plained to the police, has resisted his petition for divorce w ithout                  g
cross-petitioning, all of w h ich it is subm itted sh o u ld w eig h against
reopening the d ecision w h eth er or not to prosecute. But in m \ judgm ent
those masters are of com p aratively little w eig h t at this stage w h en the
applicant could still if sh e w a n te d com m en ce a private prosecution and has
s h o w n s o m e indication of d o in g so. W ere she to d o so the Director ot Public
 Prosecutions m igh t or m ig h t not feel constrained to take it over and offer
 no evidence, but for p resent p u rp oses the im portant matter is that the               F
 second respondent cannot claim to h a v e been m isled into thinking that he
 wa* free of all jeopardv. I sav n o th in g as to w hether if the second
 respondent is s h o w n to h a v e m a d e a d m issio n s after D ecem ber 9,1 9 9 2 m
 the belief that he w a s n o longer in danger of b ein g prosecuted by the
 Director of Public Prosecutions those ad m issio n s w o u ld be admissible if
 such a p rosecution w ere n o w to be launched. That m ay be n matter for the
 Director of Public Prosecutions to consider w h e n the matter is returned to
 her becau se in m v ju d g m en t the order n o w m u st be for the decision under
 challenge to be set aside, and for the matter to be remitted to the Director of
  Public Prosecutions for further consideration.

 Applications dismissed.

 30 July. The court refused leave to appeal to the House o f Lords but certified, under s
  1 (2 ) of the Administration o f Justice Act 1960, that the following point o f law o f general
 public importance was involved in the decision: whether a magistrate, in exercising his h
 discretion whether or not to issue a summons on an information laid by a private
 citizen, is entitled to take into consideration that ( 1) criminal proceedings have been
 already instituted by the Crown Prosecution Service against the same defendant arising
 out o f the same facts and (2 ) i f a fresh summons is issued the Director o f Public
 Prosecutions will have power pursuant to s 6(2 ) o f the Prosecution o f Offences Act 1985 j
 to take over the conduct o f the case in order to abort it, or whether the magistrate’s
 discretion is so confined that i f the offence in respect o f which a summons is sought was
 committed or is suspected to have been committed within the area, and the application

     m ent, would have had to choose between being loyal to their union o r breaking thc                          .illcction or ill will. Thirdly, that no one, be he judge or minister, should dispense
     law. M r Jackson's reference to thc antiquity of the law may have led some to think                          with or suspend thc laws and their execution w ithout the consent of Parliament. Thc
     that the law was obscure and out o f date. It was neither. Refusal to obey union                             Hill of Rights (1688)' says so. Now thc law docs not enforce itself. Someone has to

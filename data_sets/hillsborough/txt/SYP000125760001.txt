 HAPPENED AND WE WERE ABSOLUTELY CRUSHED TOGETHER. PEOPLE WERE DYING BY US AND
 MYSELF AND MY SON HAD TO CRAWL OUT AND MANAGED TO GET OUT TO THE BACK. I
 THINK IT WAS MAINLY BECAUSE THERE WAS NO CONTROL AND NO ORGANISATION. THERE
 WAS NOBODY TO DIRECT US ONCE THROUGH THE TURNSTILE NOT BY POLICE NOR
 STEWARDS.     I WENT TO THE MATCH WITH MY 26 YEAR OLD SON

IT TUUK US HALF AN HOUR TO GET IN FROM WHEN WE ARRIVED, THERE WAS A LARGE
CROWD AT THE TURNSTILES, WHEN WE WERE THERE THE POLICE WERE FRISKING PEOPLE
AT THE TURNSTILES BUT THEY STOPPED THAT AFTER ABOUT 15 MINUTES, THERE WAS A
POLICEMAN STANDING ON A LOW WALL SHOUTING FOR THE CROWD NOT TO PUSH, I THINK
THE ATMOSPHERE WAS PANICEY THEN, I THINK THAT POLICEMAN CALLED FOR THE
MOUNTED POLICEMAN WITH A MOUSTACHE, THAT WOULD BE ABOUT 20 PAST 2, HE WAS
QUITE AGGRESIVE BUT DID CLEAR SOME SPACE WITH THE HORSE. THE MAN IN FRONT OF
ME GOT IN WITHOUT A TICKET BY PAYING 20 TO THE MAN ON THE TURNSTILE.WE WENT
THROUGH THE TUNNEL BUT CAME BACK OUT AGAIN BECAUSE THE STAND WAS TOO FULL,WE
WENT TO THE LEFT AND STOOD ON THE STEPS AT THE BACK OF THE NEXT PEN SO WE SAW
THB CRUSH HAPPEN,NO ONE RELISED IT WAS SO BAD, A SAW A YOUTH PUSHED BACK ITO
y m CROWD BY A POLICEMAN.I DON'T THINK THEY RELISED IT WAS SO BAD BECAUSE
THEY WERE MORE WORRIED ABOUT CONTROLL RATHER THAN HELPING PEOPLE.ALSO IT TOOK
ABOUT 15 MINUTES BEFORE ANY AMBULANCES ARRIVED.

RAIL AND TOOK ME AND OTHERS TO ANOTHER GATE NEAR TO THE SOUTH STAND AND TOLD
US TO GO THROUGH. THESE GATES ARE NOT THE ONES THAT WERE SHOWN ON TV. THE
POLICE OFFICER TOLD ME TO GO IN, I TOLD HIM THAT I'D GOT MY TICKET AND HE
SAID "DON'T ARGUE JUST GET IN". ISAW THE BIG OUTER GATE BEING CLOSED ABOUT 2
MINUTES TO 3. I THEN FOUND A MATE WHO TOLD ME THAT THE PRESSURE OUTSIDE HAD
EASED AND HE HAD WALKED THROUGH THE TURNSTILES WITHOUT ANY PROBLEM. THERE WAS
HARDLEY ANYBODY STANDING ON THE VERY LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE TERRACE, THAT'S
WHERE WE STOOD. WE GOT THERE JUST AFTER KICK OFF. I NOTICED PEOPLE CLIMBING
OlifiR THE FENCE AND DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING, I THEN REALISED IT WAS
       I SAW A BIG MAN BEING PULLEDOVER THE FENCE, THEY HAD TO WORK ON HIS
CHR3T. I'M GLAD THE POLICE OFFICER RAN ON TO THE PITCHAND STOPPED THE MATCH.
THE OTHER POLICE OFFICERS WERE STANDING JUST WATCHING, THEY DIDN'T WANT TO
HELP. IT WAS ABOUT 12 MINUTES PAST BEFORE AN AMBULANCE CAME ONTO THE PITCH. I
SAW ONE IDIOT RUN ACROSS TO THE OTHER SIDE WHICH IS WHY THE POLICE LINED UP
ACROSS THE CENTRE OF THE GROUND BUT PEOPLE WERE TOO BUSY TRYING TO SAVE
THEMSELVES.
I ONLY SAW ONE PERSON THAT WAS DRUNK, THAT WAS BEFORE THE MATCH.
LAST YEAR THE POLICE ASKED FOR TICKETS EARLIER BEFORE YOU GOT TO THE GROUND
THAT WAS MUCH BETTER. LAST YEAR THE POLICE LINED UP AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE
MIDDLE PENS STOPPING ANYONE ELSE GOING IN, THIS YEAR NOBODY WAS STOPPING THE
PUBLIC FROM ENTERING THE CENTRE PENS. ALL IN ALL IT WASN'T THE POLICES FAULT,
THEY WERE JUST BADLY DEPLOYED.

MY FRIENDS AND I WERE WALKING TOWARDS THE GROUND AT ABOUT 2PM, THE POLICE
TOLD US TO DRINK UP BEFORE WE GOT TO GROUND, THE POLICE CAME ON HORSES AND
TOLD US TO GET TO THE GROUND OR GET ARRESTED. THERE WAS A GROUP OF LADS WHO
HAD NO TICKETS BUT WERE TOLD TO GO ANYWAY OR GET ARRESTED , THEY WERE WALKING
AWAY FROM THE GROUND, BUT HAD TO DO AS THEY WERE TOLD. WHEN WE GOT TO THE
GROUND THERE WAS A BIG CRUSHED CROWD AT THE GATES. ONCE WE WERE INSIDE THERE
WAS NO STEWARDS INSIDE TO TELL US WERE TO GO, EVEN WHEN I WENT IN WHICH WAS
QUITE EARLY. I DIDN'T KNOW I COULD GO TO LEFT OR THE RIGHT SO I STAYED WHERE
I WAS.     TWENTY FIVE PEOPLE WENT ON THE COACH.

HAVE PERMISSION FROM A SENIOR OFFICER TO OPEN THE GATES. HE CLOSED THE GATE
AFTER WE HAD ENTERED. THIS TIME WAS ABOUT 2.48PM. INSIDE WAS NOT CROWDED, I
COMFORTABLY WALKED TO THE STAIRWAY, I DID NOT SEE ANY SIGNS TO DIRECT PEOPLE.

MIDDLE TERRACES WERE FULL AND THE TWO END TERRACES WERE EMPTY. THERE WERE
PQMCE

SHIPPED IN WERE NOT AWARE OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED. BEFORE THIS I HAVE BEEN TO
SHEFFIELD FC I HAVE NOTICED THEN THAT THE TWO MIDDLE TERRACES ARE ALWAYS

THE RIGHT THING BECAUSE PEOPLE COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED OUTSIDE. WHILST
OUTSIDE MY FRIENDS PICKED UP 2 PEOPLE WHO FALLEN OVER. WHEN WE WERE IN THE

 Q54

 IS    THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL

 TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 THERE WAS INSUFFICIENT TICKETS ALLOCATED TO LIVERPOOL FANS AND THEY

 jfcfe GIVEN THE WRONG END OF THE GROUND.

 THE LACK OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE POLICE INSIDE AND OUT OF THE

 GROUND.

 THERE WERE NO STEWARDS TO DIRECT YOU INSIDE THE PENS.

 THERE WERE NO LOUDSPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENTS ADVISING PEOPLE OF THE SITUATION

 OR WHAT TO DO.

 WHEN WE ENTERED THE GROUND THERE WERE NO SIGNS OR STEWARDS DIRECTING YOU


Q2U

 WHERE TO GO

      IRE WERE POLICE STANDING AT THE FRO:                     TAND LOOKING DOWN

 INTO THE PENS, WHO SHOULD OF HAD A GO'                        VERCROWDING

 WHICH WAS HAPPENING AT AN EARLIER |sTA^

 IT IS MY BELIEF THAT WE WERE ALLOCATED THE LEPPINGS LANE END TO AVOID

 ’P A S S I N G 5 THE FOREST FANS, HOWEVER,   THE COACH WE WERE ON ACTUALLY

 DROVE RIGHT AROUND THE GROUND WHICH APPEARS TO RIDICULE THE ORIGINAL

 IDEA OF SEGREGATING FANS.

 G52



 •
 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?



 G53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS H A N D L E D ,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 DELAY IN GETTING PEOPLE OUT AND NOWHERE FOR THEM TO GO.          CERTAIN POLICE

 D I D N ’T KNOW WHAT TO DO.    I D O N ’T BLAME THE POLICE BECAUSE WHAT WAS

 HAPPENING OUTSIDE THE TURNSTILES THE GATES HAD TO BE OPENED TO STOP

 INJURIES THERE.

 PEOPLE WERE NOT INFORMED OF THE EXTENT OF THE INCIDENT FOREST FANS KEPT

 CHEERING AND SHOUTING.        LIVERPOOL FANS DID GO TOWARDS THEM.    SO WHEN
                                                                                  PAGE   9

 THE LINE OF POLICE WENT OVER THE PTICH IT WAS ONLY TO STOP TROUBLE.

 FOREST FANS AND OTHERS WERE NOT AWARE OF THE SITUATION IF THEY HAD HAVE

 BEEN THEN THE LINE OF POLICE COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER UTILISED.

 GS 4

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS

 HANDLED,     AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 JUST THAT THERE D I D N ’T SEEM ENOUGH POLICE INSIDE THE GROUND WHEN

 G34-

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL

 TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 DIRECTION OF A LOUDSPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT.

 G52

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO.


Q19

 G53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THE POLICE/STEWARDS WERE TOO SLOW IN GETTING PEOPLE OUT. PEOPLE WERE TRYING

 TO GET OUT OF THEIR OWN ACCORD OVER THE BARRIER ON THE PERIMETER OF THE

 ^pCH   AND THE POLICE WERE FORCING THEM BACK.      IT SEEMED TO TAKE AGES BEFORE

 ANY OF THE POLICE REALISED THAT THERE HAD BEEN A SERIOUS DISASTER.          IF THE

 PEOPLE IN THE WEST STAND HAD NOT PULLED PEOPLE TO SAFETY A LOT MORE PEOPLE

 WOULD HAVE DIED.

 AFTER THE GAME WAS STOPPED IT WAS FIVE OR TEN MINUTES BEFORE A POLICE

 MANAGED TO GET INTO THE PEN AND HE STARTED SHOUTING       TO US TO GET   OUT VIA

 A GATE SITUATED IN THE RAILINGS BETWEEN PENS 2 & 3.

 THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME I REALISED THAT        THERE WAS A RAILING RUNNING THE

 LENGTH BETWEEN PEN 2 & 3 AND THAT THERE' WAS A GATE.

 AS I STOOD IN THE CROWD I PRESUMED THAT IT WAS ONE LONG TERRACE IT W A S N ’T

 iftlL THE GAME HAD STOPPED THAT I REALISED THE COMPLETE TERRACE WAS SEGREGATED

 INTO SECTIONS.

 THERE W A S N ’T ENOUGH   MEDICAL ASSISTANCE FOR THE DYING AND INJURED.     THE POLICE

 SEEMED MORE CONTENT TO K E E P ’THE fANS AWAY FROM THE FOREST END THAN HELPING

 RELIEVE THE EMPTYING OF THE PENS.'        ■,


Q20

 G54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?
                                                                                FAur.  1

 THEY IGNORED THE COMPLAINTS FROM LIVERPOOL FC REGARDING THE ALLOCATION OF

 TICKETS.    OUR FANS SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE KOP END AND NOTTINGHAM THE

 LEPPINGS LN END.

 I D O N ’T THINK THAT THERE ENOUGH       POLICE ON DUTY IN THE GROUND IN THE AREA

 BETWEEN THE TURNSTILES AND THE ENTRANCE TO THE TUNNEL AND NO STEWARDS TO

 ASSIST IN LOCATING OR DIRECTING FANS TO THE EMPTIER PARTS OF THE

 TERRACES.

 PEOPLE NEEDED DIRECTING INTO THE TERRACES.          THE PENS 3 & 4 WERE OVER

 CROWDED AT 2.15 PM <1415).        ANY FANS WHO CAME IN AFTER THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN

 DIRECTED INTO THE EMPTIER PENS EITHER SIDE OF 3 & 4.

 I THINK THAT IF POLICEMAN HAD BEEN SPACED OUT IN PENS 3 4 4 PERHAPS THE POLICE

 ift'LD HAVE BEEN MORE AWARE OF THE OVERCROWDING         AND TIGHT CRUSH.   THEN THE

 TUNNEL COULD HAVE BEEN CLOSED PREVENTING ANY FURTHER FANS ENTERING PENS 3 3-4.

 THERE WAS NO COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE CLUB         AND THE FANS AS TO WHAT WAS

 ACTUALLY HAPPENING.

 THE LOUD SPEAKER SYSTEM WAS INAUDIBLE UNTIL KENNY DALGLISH          CAME ONTO THE

 LOUD SPEAKER AND THEN THEY WERE QUITE AUDIBLE.

 Q54A

 DID YOU ATTEND THE FA CUP SEMI FINAL AT HILLSBOROUGH IN 1988?

 R - YES BUT I WAS IN THE NORTH STAND, THE TERRACES DID APPEAR TO BE

 CROWDED BUT NOT AS BAD AS 1989.          THE MATCH WAS BETTER POLICED OUTSIDE THE

 GROUND AND ON APPROACH TO THE GROUND.

Q18

 Q52

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO

 •
 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THE MATCH HAVING BEEN STOPPED SUPPORTERS AND POLICE WERE JUMPING INTO THE

 CROWD TO LIFT PEOPLE OUT.         OTHER POLICE D I D N ’T SEEM TO BE DOING ANYTHING.

 TOO MANY INJURED AND DEAD PEOPLE WERE LEFT WITH FANS WITHOUT POLICE BEING IN

 ATTENDANCE.      SOME POLICE AND FANS DESERVE MEDALS.        THE LINE OF POLICE ACROSS

 THE PITCH.      WHY? WHERE WAS ALL THE MEDICAL SERVICE.        I SAW A PHOTOGRAPHER

 TAKING PICTURES OF PEOPLE CRUSHED AGAINST THE FENCES IN PEN 4.            MYSELF AND

 < ^ T H E R SUPPORTER GAVE HIM SOME VERBAL ABUSE HE WAS THEN SURROUNDED BY 4

 P . C ’S.   WE WERE ADVISED TO S T O P .   WE DID.   A COMMOTION STARTED AGAIN AND THE

 SAME PHOTOGRAPHER WAS BACK.



 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICAL INQUIRY?

 1) PLENTY OF POLICE WERE ABOUT BUT I WOULD SAY THEY WERE IN THE WRONG PLACE I

 ORDER TO PREVENT THE SITUATION OUTSIDE THE GROUND.

 2) POLICE COULD HAVE BEEN AT THE GATE INSIDE THE GROUND BETWEEN THE TERRACE

 TURNSTILES AND THE WALL FROM THE BACK OF THE STAND.            ALSO BY THE TUNNEL.

 3) WHERE WERE THE STEWARDS IN OR OUTSIDE THE GROUND I DIDN'T SEE A STEWARD

 UNTIL AFTER HANDING OUT WATER.

 4) THE FENCES RUNNING FROM BACK TO THE FRONT OF THE TERRACES.

 5) KICK OFF COULD HAVE BEEN DELAYED.

 SOME OF THE POLICE WERE WALKING ABOUT WITH A COMPLETELY WRONG ATTITUDE

 AS THOUGH     THEY WERE ON AN ORDINARY        PATROL,   AS THOUGH NOTHING WAS

 HAPPENING.     YOU COULD SEE SOME WERE IN A STATE OF SHOCK.            IT SEEMED AS THOUGH

 SUPPORTERS WERE RUNNING THE SHOW.          THE FIRST FIREMAN TO ARRIVE D I D N ’T HAVE

 ANY BOLT CUTTERS,      DID THEY GET THE WRONG M E S S A G E , THEY D I D N ’T HAVE ANY

 OXYGEN,    THEY CAME FROM THE KOP END.        IT WAS ONLY WHEN THE SECOND GROUP OF

 FIREMEN ARRIVED DID THEY HAVE THIS EQUIPMENT.             COULDN'T THEY HAVE ARRIVED

       THE LEPPINGS LN END.

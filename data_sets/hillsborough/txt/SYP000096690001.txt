HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER 15TH APRIL, 1989

I have to report that I have been investigating the behaviour pattern of
Liverpool Football Club Supporters at matches played away from hone. I
have limited this enquiry to the 1987/88 and 1988/89 Football Seasons.

There have been a number of areas which I have looked at including the
behaviour of fans on the day of the disaster. I have categorised the
various enquiries and will outline the sailient points under each heading.

1.      POLICE REPORTS CONCERNING LIVERPOOL AWAY MATCHES WHERE PROBLEMS
         HAVE BEEN ENCOUNTERED WITH LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS ___

1.1     Everton versus Liverpool, the F.A. Cup Final played at Wembley
         on 10 May 1986. There was a capacity crowd of 98,000. Over
         1,000 fans were ejected, many without tickets or in possession
         of forged tickets. 25 Police Officers were injured.

1.2     Tottenham Hotspur versus Liverpool on 28 November 1987. Enquiries
         with New Scotland Yard Public Order Branch and having seen the Police
         Report on this match, it was declared 'all ticket1 with a capacity
         crowd of 47,363. A total of 10,311 Liverpool Supporters visited
         White Hart Lane out of which 2,000 Liverpool Supporters were
         locked out of the ground. This group caused policing problems
         in that shop windows were broken in Tottenham High Road but they
         ware eventually tlispersedinto an underground statical.; I    t'    r

1.3     Watford versus Liverpool on 13 February 1988. This match was
         declared 'all ticket' with a total crowd attendance of 23,838
         which included 6,200 Liverpool fans. 1,500 Liverpool fans, some
         of whom had been drinking, arrived without tickets. Given that
         it would have presented severe policing difficulties and problems
         were the 1,500 fans allowed to disperse and run the town of
         Watford and frequent local public houses, consultations between
         Club Officials and the Match Commander ended in a decision to
         allow the fans into the ground on payment.

1.4     Liverpool versus Wimbledon the F.A. Cup Final played at Wembley
        on 14 May 1988. Again there was a capacity crowd of 98,000, 92
        fans were arrested, 85 of them from Liverpool. Over 3,000 persons
        were ejected from the Stadium for possession of either forged
        tickets or no tickets^ at all. The Stadium authorities recovered
        478 forged tickets. Seven Police Officers ware injured. The
        majority of those rejected were Liverpool fans and the majority
        of forged tickets were presented by Liverpool supporters.

1.5     Southanpton versus Liverpool on 24 September 1988. This match
        was declared 'all ticket'. 150 Liverpool fans arrived without
        tickets. Those fans were isolated outside the ground and again
        because manpower would have been soaked up by allowing the fans
        to roam Southanpton, they were allowed into the ground on payment,
        after discussions between the Match Corrmander and Club Officials.

1.6    Arsenal versus Liverpool on 9 November 1988. The Match Commanders
        report that a capacity crowd attended the match with approximately
        6,000 fans being locked out of the Stadium. The kick-off was
        delayed for 15 minutes to allow the fans to get into the ground.
        Many of the locked out fans attempted to climb or break into the
        Stadium. Reinforcements had to be called in. Not all of the
        locked out fans ware Liverpool supporters.

1.7    Southampton versus Liverpool on 12 December 1988. This match
        was also declared 'all ticket'. 750 Liverpool fans arrived at
        the ground without tickets. Many related a story of being unable
        to purchase a ticket from the Office at Liverpool because it had
        not been opened to sell tickets for a sufficiently long enough
        period. The ticketless fans were isolated and although the situation
       was tense for a while the Southanpton Football Club agreed to
        open a turnstile and after payment allow all the fans into the
        ground.

1.8    Millwall versus Liverpool on 29 January 1989. The match was declared
        'all ticket', with a crowd of 23,615 of which 2,900 were Liverpool
        supporters. Several hundred Liverpool supporters attended without
        tickets and forged tickets were being sold outside the ground.
        No otter problems were encountered.

1.9    Hull City versus Liverpool on 18 February 1989. This was an F.A.
        Cup Round and a particularly troublesome match for the Section
        Ccnmander in charge of the Liverpool fans. Forged tickets were
        in evidence and a nuriber of fens arrived without tickets. There
        was evidence that the majority of Liverpool fans had been drinking
        heavily. 100 ticketless fans outside the ground rushed a gate,
        when it was being opened by Stewards to allow someone to leave
        the ground, and at the same time Liverpool fans inside the ground
        also rushed the gate and attempted to pull it wide open. With
        the assistance of Mounted Officers the situation was eased but
        ticketless fans outside, when the turnstiles were closed, shouted
        comments to the Police Officers that if the turnstiles were not
        opened they would rip the gates off and 'nobody closed doors on
        Liverpool supporters'.

1.10   Norwich City versus Liverpool on 1 April 1989. This match was
        declared 'all ticket' but information was received by the Club
        that 1,272 tickets allocated to Liverpool had not been sold and
        would be returned to Norwich on the team bus on the day of the
        match. A number of Liverpool supporters arrived without tickets
        and gave varying reasons for not knowing the match was 'all ticket'
        or that they had come from areas distant from Liverpool. It was
        decided to sell the 1,272 unsold tickets returned by the
        Liverpool Club to get than into the ground. All the tickets were
        sold although it is believed some Norwich supporters also
        benefitted this way and got into the ground.

1.11   Wimbledon versus Liverpool on 13 May 1989. This match was declared
       'all ticket' with a capacity crowd of 14,730 of which 6,473 were
       Liverpool supporters. Enquiries with the Public Order Branch
       at New Scotland Yard reveal that Liverpool F.C. was allocated
       6,500 tickets which were sent with a request for supporters to
       be advised by means of local radio and the press that the fixture
       was an 'all ticket' one. Some 4,000 unsold tickets were returned
       to Winbledon F.C. On the day, nearly 6,500 Liverpool supporters
       attended the game, excluding a number who entered the home supporters
       parts of the Stadium. It was clear that a large number of
       Liverpool supporters attended without tickets despite publicity
       before the match. Turnstiles were opened to facilitate those
       supporters who had come without tickets.

1.12   Everton versus Liverpool on 20 May 1989. This was the F.A. Cup
       Final played at the Wembley Stadiun, seme 5 weeks after the
       Hillsborough Disaster. The report from the Section commander
       tends to show that Liverpool supporters had not learned from this
       disaster. Ticketless fans caused considerable problems for the
       Police and when they were clearing the area of those fans, bottles
       and cans were thrown at them. Just before the end of the game
       all gates to the Stadium were opened in preparation for the exodus.
       An equalising goal was then scored by Everton which resulted in
       an influx of fans who had been leaving and also those still around
       the ground without tickets. All managed to get into bays around
       the Stadium to watch extra time.

2.     WITNESS STATEMENTS WHICH SHOW HOW CERTAIN LIVERPOOL FANS INTENDED
        TO GET INTO THE MATCH                      '

2.1    Julie Dawn SHELLEY is a part-time barmaid who assists behind the
        bar at her Aunt's licensed premises, The Matilda Public House,
        Matilda Street, Sheffield. From mid-day on the day of the disaster,
        she had a conversation with three to four male persons who described
        themselves as Liverpool supporters. They told her they had come
        from Liverpool on the train, had no tickets for the match but
        it was their intention to go to Hillsborough and gain entry.
        They further told her that it was easy because they had done it
        previously and there were other Liverpool fans who had come down
        with than without tickets who were going to get into the ground
        as well. They left the public house by taxi to the ground between
        2.30pm and 2.45pm.

2.2    Garry TAYLOR who is a retired Sales Director was drinking in The
       Sicey Public House, Sicey Avenue, Sheffield, some l h miles from
       the Hillsborough Stadium on the day of the disaster. Whilst in
       the premises he heard a conversation between three men sat nearby.
       Tvro of the men spoke with Liverpool accents and he assumed they
       were supporters of that club. He heard than talk about Leppings
       Lane and that they would meet up with others outside the Leppings
       Lane entrance. They would organise as many other people as possible
       to cause whatever trouble they could. If enough trouble was caused
       the gates would have to be opened. Mr. TAYLOR concluded that
       this had happened before and the person doing the talking appeared
       confident that this action could be forced. More detailed evidence
       can be read in his statement.
                                -4 -

2.3   Peter Kevan MARJORAM is a Conpany Director who visited The Pheasant
      Public House, (Xightibridge, some 2% miles from the Hillsborough
      Stadium, on the day of the disaster. He arrived at 2.35pm to
      find numerous persons both inside and outside the public house.
      He would estimate that 25 of than were Liverpool supporters.
      He got into conversation with two of them. They did not mention
      tickets, neither did Mr. MARJORAM see them in possession of one.
      At 2.45pm he mentioned to the two that they were leaving it late
      to get to the ground and one of than replied 'Don't worry about
      that, we know either a gate will be open or opened'. Both men
      laughed at each other. The tw o left shortly afterwards.

2.4                 xs a                    who was also in Hie Pheasant
      Public House on the date ot the disaster and was joined by Mr.
      MARJORAM sometime, he says, after 2.00pm. He corroborates that
      one of the two Liverpool supporters he and Mr. MARJORAM were talking
      to said words to the effect that they were confident of getting
      into the ground because the gate would be open or opened. The
      manner in which this remark was made did not suggest that they
      intended to force entry into the ground. He describes the two
      men as decent persons and they did not say that they had tickets
      for the match and he did not see them in possession of any.

2.5   Statements from the four witnesses are attached to this report
      under Appendix 'B'.


3.    SCHEDULE SHOWING EVIDENCE THAT CAN BE XSIVEN FROM WITNESSES REGARDING
      LIVERPOOL FANS -ATTENDING TOE MATCH WITHOUT TICKETS

3.1   There is ample evidence of fans arriving at this match without
      tickets to get into the Hillsborough Ground. Attached is a schedule
      showing that 25 Police Officers have submitted reports showing
      nunerous fans without tickets, fans asking for spare tickts, fans
      asking for the tickets of those arrested, evidence of fans coming
      to the match expecting to buy tickets from touts, evidence of
      fans having tickets snatched, evidence of seeing stubs from tickets
      being thrown back into the crowd and evidence of persons complaining
      of having their tickets stolen.

3.2   Hie 25 reports submitted showing this evidence appears to be only
       'the tip of the iceberg'. Further reports are still being processed
       from other officers which will no doubt contain a lot of similar
       material.

3.3   Further evidence in relation to this matter can be given by civilian
       witnesses listed under Appendix 'B'.

3.4   A schedule showing the report number, the time, location, the
       officer involved and a brief surrmary of what he could say is
       attached to this report under Appendix 'C'.

4.    EVIDENCE OF THE BEHAVIOUR OF FANS AT THE SEMI FINAL MATCH BETWEEN
      NORWICH AND EVERTON PLAYED AT VILLA PARK ON 15TH APRIL 1989

4.1   A statement from Chief Superintendent Mellor, the Match Commander
      at the Semi Final match played the same day between Norwich City
      and Everton at Villa Park, showing the behaviour of the fans,
      especially those supporting Everton, together with two of his
      Mounted Officers is attached.

4.2   Whilst the evidence does not have any bearing on the match played
      between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough, or the
      fans who attended the match, the Everton supporters behaviour
      at Villa Park shows a remarkable coincidence with the Liverpool
      supporters at Hillsborough which may indicate some Liverpool
      characteristic.

4.3   Statements from the three Police Officers are attached and have
      been listed under Appendix 'D'.


5.    OBSERVATIONS AND COMMENTS

5.1   It does appear that there is a nucleus of Liverpool supporters
      (unidentified) who do travel to matches played away from Liverpool
      without tickets and cause severe policing problems. At the end
      of the day, rather than soak up Police manpower, it is felt better
      to allow them into the ground, if possible, rather than them cause
      havoc in the town, their team is playing. Whilst there is no
      direct evidence to support this, the fans do appear to know this.
      In the case at Watford where numerous ticketless fans arrived
      they did imply that if they were not granted admission to the
      ground they would go into Watford and cause havoc.

5.2   The evidence in the attached reports etc., has been gathered from
      rreterial in possession of the South Yorkshire Police. Given the
      opportunity to read and study the many civilian statements taken
      by the West Midlands Investigation Team, it may be that the
      evidence to hand could be enhanced further.

5.3   Since the 1 January, 1989, the F.A. Cup match played at Hull and
      the F.A. Cup Final played at Wembley both show a similarity in
      crowd behaviour to that displayed on the date this disaster occurred.

 RE:    LIVERPOOL FOOTBALL CLUB - HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

 Attached hereto is the Football Match Summary relating to the match
 played between Watford and Liverpool at Vicarage Road, Watford on
 13 February 1988, the total crowd attendance being 23,838 this
 included 6,200 Liverpool Fans.

 Together with Superintendent HOWLEY I was responsible for policing
 this particular game. I was responsible for policing outside the
 Football Stadium. Prior to kick-off it became apparent that approx­
 imately 1,500 Liverpool supporters had arrived without tickets. The
 game, which had been declared 'All Ticket' at Police instigation, was
 well publicised prior to 13 February. The majority of all fans
 attending were in possession of tickets. Some of the 1,500 fans had
 been drinking and were somewhat noisy although I am bound to say the
 behaviour was generally good. The prevailing weather, without doubt,
 assisted the policing of the crowd and after consultation with
 Superintendent HOWLEY I decided to’hold the 1,500 supporters in the
 Cardiff Road area at the bottom of the walkway giving access to the
 Stadium. Given that it would have presented severe policing
 difficulties and problems were the 1,500 fans allowed to disperse and
 run the town and frequent local public houses. After further consul­
 tation with Superintendent HOWLEY and Club Officials it was decided
 prudent to let these fans into the arena upon payment. I was aware
 that there would be sufficient room in the Stadium to accommodate
 these fans because of the shortfall on sales of tickets in Liverpool.
 I was also conscious of the fact that previously Liverpool fans had
 attempted to enter the ground by forcing open gates. The match was
 relatively trouble free there being 2 arrests of Liverpool supporters
 and 14 ejections of Liverpool supporters.

 At the match briefing officers were told of the strong possibility of
 visitors arriving without tickets and seeking access to the Football
 Stadium.

           FOOTBALL LIASCN OFFICER AT LIVERPOOL,   3.T. POLICE,
           & FOOTBALL CLUBS - ACCURATE ESTIMATE OF NC*s GIVEN,
           The estimated nurtber of visiting supporters was such that it was necessar’-- to make
           the match ALL-TICKET, Despite publicity soree 1500 Liverpool Supporters turned up
           without and were kept in a holding area some 500 yards from the ground until a few
           minutes before kick-off. It was decided prudent to allow these "^500 entrance to
           the ground rather than have them in the Town Centre.

         (b) Inside Ground:
                Minor difficulties at start of match with large numbers of none ticket holders
                trying to get into the ground quickly.




         (c) Immediate Vicinity of Ground:
                Some pushing and shoving around the turnstiles*               Much of it good naiured.




                Ot •"»!?.■ Locations:
                A holding area for none’ticket holders was established ixi Cardiff Pd to prevent
                Problems at the turnstiles. This was possible because of the fenced walkway
                leading to the visiting support area. By not allowing none ticket holders to
                enter the walkway, they were kept away from the Trour.d until it vs3 clear that
                they could be admitted.
8.   COMMENTS ON POLICING TACTICS

     i.e. Escorts, Turnstile Searches, Control of Licensing Laws etc.:


         Searching carried out at turnstiles. Escorts to Shuttle Trains from Stadium
         to Watford Junction. Large number of Liverpool Supporters travelled back into
         London on the Local trains* No problems.

         The tactics of establishing a holding area for those non-ticket holders was a
         success and will be done at future all-ticket games where this is likely to
         prove a problem.

                            Near k ick o ff tim e i t was d e c id e d by Superintendent
              IOMPSON that an approach would b e made to tho club to open a
          c j s h tu r n stile to allow th e s e fen s a c c e s s .

                                The main reasons fo r t h is w ore that:

                                1.       Manpower on th e day was lim ite d to G P .S .U .s and
                                         tho crow d had e x c e e d e d th e p r e v io u s L iv erp o o l

                                         that 150 fans wandoring in th e town, fru strated
                                         at not gettin g in to th e m atch, could h a v e soak ed
                                         up manpower, w h ich would h av e been b e tte r
                                         committed at the ground.

Late arrival of fans 'estimated 30 to 40 thousand arrived after 7pm.

Radio reception on Force radios intermittent.

Intelligence from TO 20 Arsenal FC and Liverpool FC indicated a crowd
of 45,000 to 50,000.

A crowd of 54,000 inside the ground and approximately 6000 locked out
was beyond the police resources employed as per grade ’B ’ matches.

The presence in Gillespie Road of a considerable number of fans before
the turnstiles opened prevented police removal vehicles operating and
therefore parked cars added to the obstruction.

Turnstiles at Gillespie Road ran out of change causing delay and further
congestion in Gillespie Road.

Fans ignored Police instruction to form queues not enough Police present
to enforce instructions.

Kick Off delayed by me until 8pm but many of the locked out fans attempted
to climb or break into the stadium.

The only police available to police outside the ground after kick off
were Mounted Section and Dog Section until reinforcements arrived from
West Ham FC match and Commissioner’s reserve.

While Mounted Branch, Dog Section and local officers were splendid ’Aid
serials' generally seemed overwhelmed by the situation and were not as active
as one would hope.

Searching at turnstiles had to be abandoned because of crush.

There were few problems inside the stadium during the match.

Due to late kick off and extra time match finished at 10.20pm in nil nil draw,
therefore fans only interested in getting home and the dispersal prsented
no problems.

Future Plans
Due to Arsenal's successful season and Tottenham's failures crowds are larger
than expected at Highbury therefore policing levels are to be reviewed.

For evening matches Commissioner’s regulations will have to be 3 hours before
kick off instead of 2 hours to enable vehicles to be removed before crowds
arrive.
Turnstiles will be opened earlier and Arsenal are to supply a PA System xnto
.Gillespie Road to assist in directing fans to correct queues.

 More Barriers will be used in Gillespie Road to operate queues.

           For the Attention of Chief Superintendent T.^.WATN


          Dear Sir,


                                         Re: Letter dated 7th June 1989
                     On Saturday 12th December 1988, I was on duty in uniform as the
           Superintendent in charge of the First Divisior. Football League match between
           Southampton and Liverpool at the Dell, Southampton; kick off 1500 hours.

                     The match was an ’all ticket’ match in that entry to the ground for
          Liverpool fans would only bo allowed if they arrived with a ticket already
          purchased.

                     At 1345 hours it became obvious that a large number of fans
           supporting Liverpool did not have tickets.

                    Our strict and rigid policy at the Doll has always been that fans
          who arrive without tickets will not be allowed entry and that the Club will
          not open a turnstile.

                    However, on this occasion there were about 750 Liverpool fans
          without tickets. Many related a story of being unable to purchase a ticket
          from the office at Liverpool because it had net been opened to sell tickets
          for a sufficiently long enough period.

                    Therefore, 1 got all 750 into an orderly queue and Southampton
          Football Club opened a turnstile and charged them all £5 per head entry
          instead of tne usual £3.50.

                    The situation was extremely tense for a while and we had to use much
          tact andgood humour to avoid a situation of serious disorder.

                    We were helped by the fact that we sti.31 had room inside for those
          750. Had that not been so then controlling those locked out would have been a
          major problem.

8.   COMMENTS ON POLICING TACTICS

     i.e. Escorts, Turnstile Searches, Control of Licensing Laws, etc:

     All the Liverpool Coaches attended the meeting point at Sower Bridge as arranged. They
     were escorted to the ground without any incidents. Several hundred Liverpool Supporters
     from the London Area attended without tickets. An unknown male obviously “from Liverpool
     was selling forged tickets in the car park for £15* Several persons obtained entry to
     the ground with these tickets but several were noticed at the.turnstiles and the holders
     refused entry. The seller was not located. Apart from the supporters who attended by
     Coach, the rest arrived via service trains and by their own means. In the main* "they
     were well behaved. Because of the position of the Turnstiles i.e. only at each end of th<
     ground, the main problems were getting all the Millwall supporters into the ground befori
     the start. Many arrived late the worse for drink. The game took place with only minor
     incidents. Considering Millwall were well beaten, not too ouch was thrown onto the pitch,
     Some damage Was caused inside the ground when Millwall supporters forced their way out
     into the car park. Lack of lighting in the Car Park was again the main probleo together
     with all the debris lying about. The Liverpool Supporters who had attended by train
     were escorted to the railway station and seen off to London without any problews. To lool
     back on the day, a total of 32 persons were injured. The Dog Section suffered the most,
     with Seven Officers injured One with serious back injuries. Following many games without
     any disorder, this one game showed that the Hooligan element is still present waiting to
     strike. The main targers being visiting supporters, their coaches and Police Officers.
     The Chief Superintendent from Liverpool attended the fixture                 as an observer together
     with Inspector CLOW the F.L.O. $ad a Sergeant. We were unable to offer them any decent
     hospitality but they seemed to understand. I think they also appreciated the problems in
     Policeing First Division fixtures with a Third Division ground surrounded by waste land®

              HULL CITY V LIVERPOOL, SATURDAY 1 8 .2 .8 9
              F A COP 5 th ROUND MATCH - VENUE BOOTHFERRY
              PARK, HULL, KICK OFF 1500 HOURS

              Further to the general report sent on the 8 June 19$9 with regard to
              a summary of the day’s events, I submit my observations as to the
              conduct of Liverpool supporters at the turnstiles a$ the North East
              corner of Boothferry Park, Hull which are used by avfay supporters
              wishing to enter the ground.

              I was the Sector Commander responsible for the North East turnstiles
              and the two designated areas allocated to Liverpool!supporters,
              these being the North Standand the enclosureon th£ northend of the
              East Stand which areconnected by a large gateclosd to theperimeter
              wall of the playing area, allowing free access to ai4d from the two
              areas.                                              1

              Prior to the match I was engaged outside the turnstiles, all of which
              were open, admitting Liverpool supporters upon production of a match
              ticket (this being an all ticket match).

              Forged T ic k e ts                                 j
                                                                 i
              It was discovered that many fans had several batohe^ of tickets all
              bearing the same serial number, there being severalidifferent numbers
              used.   Some of the tickets appeared to have been pointed and others
              were poor quality photocopies, all being of a similar colour to the
              genuine tickets (yellowish).   The fans stated they!had bought them
              close to the ground and in Liverpool from touts.   ^rrests of the
              sellers were made by officers other than my Sector £taff.
                                                                  Ii
              O ffe r s o f Cash

              I was approached, as were my staff, by Liverpool fails with £10 or
              £20 notes held in their hands asking if we could possibly get them
              into the ground.   They were informed this was not possible and
              several made attempts to several different officers*

              Behaviour of Fans

              The general behaviour of the fans at the turnstilesjwas peaceful but
              it was evident that the majority of the Liverpool f^ns had been
              drinking intoxicants heavily.

    The fans formed up at the turnstiles and were marshalled into orderly
    lines with officers carrying out good hearted searches.

    I was informed by Stewards from inside the ground tiat several
    fans had jumped over or crawled under the turnstile land entered
    the North Stand.

    There are 2 wire meshed gates between the turnstile* and fans who
    had entered the ground were passing their retained ijialf of the
    tickets to fans outside who tried to gain entry alleging they had
    lost the other part of the ticket or had it snatched from them.

    The crowd were physically pushed back from these gates at which
    point the fans inside crumpled up their retained paift of the ticket
    and threw them out of the ground for fans outside t<i> pick up.

    Then, shortly before the kick off time, I had my baik to the wire gates
    observing about 100 fans who were without tickets aijid had gathered
    close to the turnstiles.

    From their conversation they were of the opinion thit we would let
    them in the ground shortly after kick off.   They wire informed this
    was not to be the course of action we would take and they would not
    be admitted without tickets.   From the replies I farmed the opinion
    that this was an expected course of action and had happened at other
    grounds.

    These fans then started to rush towards me at which point I noticed the
    gate had been opened by a Steward to allow someone to leave the ground.

    Fans from inside rushed to the gate attempting to piJill the gate wide
    open and appeared to be trying to lift it off the hinges which they
    could not do because of restraining pins through th^ hinges.

    A short struggle ensued and with the help of Mounted Officers fans
    were bodily thrown and pushed from the gate and we Managed to re-
    secure the gate.   Prompt action by my staff and Club Stewards
    prevented the gate from being fully opened and only la small number
    of non-ticket holders entered the ground and ran into the crowd
    knocking fans out of the way in their efforts to miiigle with the
    standing crowd.   I instructed my officers not to piirsue these
    fans.                                               i

    After this the Mounted Section pushed all fans without tickets onto
    the car park.   I then lined officers from the Dog Section with their
    dogs on leads across the front of the turnstiles and the Mounted
    Section allocated me two officers, one to each wirejgate between
    the turnstiles to preserve a sterile area.   After all fans with
    tickets had entered, the turnstiles started to clos4, at this
    point about 30 fans in the over 30 age group staggeifed, they had
    obviously consumed a lot of drink and started to shd>ut comments
    to the effect that if the turnstiles were not opened they would
    rip the gates off and nobody closed doors on Liverpool supporters.

      At this time I only had two officers outside the ground.   We calmed
      them down, checked their tickets and they entered by a turnstile.

      During the match I received a report that due to ttempts to reach
      in and steal stock from the refreshment hut it hac been closed and
      fans in the North Stand round the hut were startirtg to damage it.

     I requested fans to back off from the hut so that my officers could
     supervise an orderly purchase of refreshments and the hut would re-
     open.   Despite several requests there was no mov<dment even though
     there were areas away from the hut.   I therefore used uniform
     officers who in the end had to bodily fight their way into the
     crowd to prevent fans banging and pulling at the vooden end of the
     hut.   After a bitter struggle we managed to bodil y force than away
     and preserve a sterile area around the refreshment hut.    At no
     time did any of the fans assist in clearing the ar ea, they acting
     in a mindless way pushing towards the hut.

     Holdback after the Pinal Whistle                  ■
     It is the policy of the Humberside Force to allow home supporters to
     leave the ground and holdback the away supporters to prevent any
     confrontation on the car park or around the ground

     This was the case of this date, announcements were made over the
     public address system to this effect.

     The holdback is achieved by a cordon of uniformed officers across the
     entranceway from the two areas.   After a short titoe I could see the
     fans at the back pushing the fans in front of them forward and
     pressure started to build up at the front.   Verb;>a’l requests were
     made to fans at the back to ease back and stop pu:siring, this was
     totally ignored and they just pushed all the more from the back.

     It was obvious to me that fans at the front were bieing crushed and
     there was a danger of them being seriously injured! along with police
     officers engaged on the holdback.

     I instructed my officers to ease back and allow ths fans to leave in
     an orderly manner.   As we started to move back a Large cheer went
     up from the away supporters and a big surge forwa;rd broke through the
     cordon.   The fans then rushed out in an uncontro.oiled manner, best
     described as a herd of wild horses knocking their w n supporters out
     of the way.   My staff were unable to prevent this because of weight
     of numbers against us.

     At no time was any request by myself or my officerte willingly followed
     and various degrees of force had to be employed to achieve our
     requests.

        "I was the officor In chargo of the policing uf the Norwich City
    Football Club versus Liverpool Football Club football match at Carrow
    Road, Norwich on Saturday, 1st April, 1909.

         It la usual procedure to categorisc football matches as of high,
    medium or low priority in our pre-season planning. This match had been
    categorised as high priority even before the result became of greater
    significance in the Division One Championship Competition. The Carrow
    Road ground capacity is 26,812 and for this reason it was also decided
    that the match would have to be all ticket, a fact which would be well
    publicised in advance.

         Carrow Road offers limited options for the accommodation of
    visiting supporters and the total available space, taking into account
    the need for segregation and accomnodating home club members, is 5,000.

         There is terracing behind both goals at the football ground. The
    River End terracing is part of a 51% membership scheme and, therefore,
    always occupied by home fans. The Barclay StBnd terracing is divided
    into 4 enclosures to limit lateral Bnd forward movement and segregate
    opposing factions. Hie pens are numbered 1 to A, pens 1 and 2 are
    always occupied by home fans, pen 3 at medium and low priority matches
    remains empty and pen A is for visiting supporters. In addition there
    is another area of terracing, the Triangle, which faces obliquely across
    the pitch and is adjacent to pen A and seating in blocks F, G and H
    normally taken up by visiting supporters. Pens 3, A, the Triangle and
    blocks F, G and H were allocated to Liverpool supporters for this match.
    A,800 tickets were sent to Liverpool for sale in advance.

          Access to the visitors enclosures is through turnstiles at the
     rear of the Barclay Stand which are completely independent of the
     access points available for home supporters. The rear of the Barclay
     Stand borders the main A.A7 Norwich to Great Yarmouth trunk road.

                                                                    C ont'd   I

        It was obvious, owing to Liverpool's recent success that there
   would be a large, if not capacity, crowd for this match. Local Interest
   was also very high and policing arrangements included the highest level
   of policing for any match during the season. This level was 313 officers
   including Special Constables.

           Thursday, 30th March, 1989, I saw the Norwich City Football
   Club Chairman, Mr. Robert CHASE, at the football ground. He told me
   that ticket sales for the match x*ere not selling as well as expected in
   Liverpool, lie had been told that 1,272 tickets would be returned and
   would be brought to Norwich on the club coach on Saturday. Mr. CHASE
   suggested that pen 3 now be allocated to home fans as pen 4, the Triangle
   and the seating could accommodate the reduced away support, I told him
   it wouid be imprudent to take that decision in the light of experience
   which showed that Liverpool always attracted considerable national
   support. The probability being that many people would attend who either
   could not obtain tickets because they were only on sale at Liverpool or
   unaware that the match was in fact designated as all ticket. 1
   suggested that the decision be delayed until the morning of the match
   and 1 would then consider the situation with regard to pen 3, although
   because of access and egress to thiB enclosure for home fens it was
   most likely that the space would still be allocated to Liverpool
   supporters.

         P11 Saturday, 1st April, 1989, there was a significant crowd
   assembling outside the Carrow Road Football Ground by midday. Almost
   all were Liverpool supporters and the majority had tickets. By 1300
   hours there was a considerable crowd gathered, a number of whom did not
   liave tickets. Many said they were not aware it was an all ticket match
   and others that they could not obtain tickets because they came from
   areas distant from Liverpool. I decided, therefore, to open 2
   turnstiles and sell the returned tickets, after agreement with the Club
   Chairman, to Liverpool supporters for access to pen 3. All the
   tickets were sold in this fashion and there is no doubt that some home
   supporters benefitted in this way. They were, however, met by officers
   just inside the ground who directed them to accommodation reserved for
   home supporters. The visiting fans were quite well behaved and formed
   orderly and quiet queues outside the ground. They did not arrive late
   and all supporters were in the ground by 1500 hours.

        The visiting fans were quite boisterous, generally good humoured
   and totally partisan in their support for their team to the exclusion
   of all else, I attach a copy of the match sutrauary which was forwarded
   to the Merseyside Police on the 3rd April, 1989, and indicates the
   problems that we had faced. A video tape of this match is available
   if required, I attach a copy of the Carrow Road ground plan."

         (a) In transit: Most of the Liverpool supporters came eaxly and queued in an orderly
            fashion until the turnstiles opened at 13'55h*'s. Not much drunkness was in
            evidence. The local public houses were quite empty.




         (b) Inside Ground: Both sets of Fails were very well "behaved. One arrest for criminal
            of the toilet window by the C.C.T.V. but on the reran of the video after the
            match it was not clear that the arrested person { though clearly involved in the
            daraage with another person ) committed the offence. Ke was released without
            charge. Two other arrests in the home end one for threatening behaviour and
            one for drunk and disorderly a Chelsea supporter.

        F.C. was allocated 6,500 tickets which were sent with a request for 'supporters
        to be advised by means of local radio and press that the fixture was an all-
        ticket one. Some 4,000 unsold tickets were returned to Wimbledon F.C? despite
        this, policing arrangements were based on intelligence reports that 4,500
        or more-;Liverpool supporters could be expected. On the .day nearly 6,500
        Liverpool supporters attended the..game, excluding a, number, who entered the
        home supporters parts of the stadium. It was clear that a large number of
        Liverpool supporters attended without tickets;, despite publicity. that the         _.                     ^
        game was an all-ticket one and adequate tickets were available -for sale in,

        M.P-?£
On inspecting the area I found that at Turnstile ’H ’ a small section of
fencing, secured by scaffold clips, had been slackened so that a signifi­
cant breach of the fence could be made, giving access to the circulating
corridor.   From the enquiries I made it appeared that this hod been done
by fans during the night, no doubt intending to apply pressure at the
right moment to gain wentry to the Stadium.

information was passed to officers under my corrmand by an unidentified
Liverpool police officer, that he had heard fans planning to rush the
'H*, *J' and *K' turnstiles. This confirmed my own view that these were
the most vulnerable areas and therefore the most likely to be attacked.

As time progressed, I noticed that there were more people in tiiat area
suffering the ill effects of alcohol and tension was beginning to increase.
This culminated in a number of fights at the 'pinch point', the narrowest
point of the concourse, outside the Stadium Offices.       The fights were
caused apparently by tlxj sale of tickets by 'touts'. Although well known
touts were not evident, there weaned to be a number of people selling
one or two tickets.    The fans were keen to attack such people and yet
also to buy the tickets at inflated prices.

By 12.30pm, the crowd was building up generally, but especially so outside
turnstiles 'H\ 'J' and 'K'.      Because this area is confined, l had to
put in a cordon of police horses and foot police between the T.V. compound
and turnstile 'H' to prevent the danger of crushing.

Outside of the cordon, there were more outbreaks of disorder among fans
who had been drinking and I personally received a blow to the head whilst
assisting one of my officers in making an arrest.

Ihe turnstiles were Jat^ in opening because a lorry was still—carrying
out some work in the circulating c o r r i d o r - This lorry could only make
an exit through a gate at the side of turnstile 'K '. it did this just
before 1.15pm but caused quite severe problems with crowds waiting for
the turnstiles to open.   The gate stuck when it was only half open and
a lot of effort was required to prevent a large nuirtoer of illegal entries
to the Stadium.

Once the turnstiles opened, 1 expected the crowd to ease considerably
and to reduce the complaints of crushing I was getting from people in
the crowd.   That people were obviously pressing forward and causing a
crush in these circunstances, in the wake of Hillsborough, ariazea me.
I was more amazed, however, to find that the crush was not diminishing
as I expected-it to at turnstile 'H'.    This was because of ticketless
fans forcing their way through the turnstiles with ticket-holders and
having to be removed through exit gates, slowing down the whole of the
operation.
Whilst a lot of illegal entrants were removed, I believe an appreciable
number were not. The most intense crush was at turnstile KI , which had
had a fence weakened during the night, and m my mind must have bee p
planned by a large nurrioer of fans hoping to breach the security of the
fence, if they were unable to get in through the turnstiles.

By 2.30pm, the number of people going in through turnstiles 'H , J and
•K' had reduced greatly.   This had been achieved by having tickets for
turnstile 'H* accepted at 'J' and 'K* turnstiles and filtering people
       at tie cordon and allowing only those with tickets through. Many people
 *    were reluctant to produce tickets, fearing that they might be snatched
       from them.     They took the trouble to secrete them in shoes, socks and
       other places, which node it difficult when production was demanded. The
       m ut e r of street robberies for this event are much higher- than for similar
       events.

16.   There were now seme 300 people on the outside of the cordon who did not
       have tickets but were still anxious to find a way into the.Stadiun. Rather
       -than leaving the         as a fixed target, I decided to commence a sweep
       of •t’N* concourse, pushing these fans ■towards the Royal Tunnel and away
       from the vulnerable area.

17.   When tie sweep from the other side, turnstiles JA' to *E', reached the
       Royal Tunnel, the crowd which nuntaered about* 500 began throwing bottles
       and cans at police. A 'number of arrests were made during the ccnpletion
       of the sweep.

18.   Despite tte sweep, small pockets of ticketless fans returned to the concourse
       during the progress of the game. At about half time, there was a detennined
      •attenpt by about 200 to gain entry through gates and windows at the stadiun
       Offices and turnstile *H’. This was successfully repelled.

19.   Just before the end of the game, all gates to the Stadium were opened
       in preparation for the exodus. At this stage, Liverpool were in the lead
       ard fans were starting to leave.     However, the equalising goal was then
       scored by Everton. This resulted in an influx of fans who had been leaving
       and s i c n those still around the ground w i t h o u t tickets. All managed to
       get into bays around the Stadium to watch extra time.

20.   The nuntoer of arrests, 76 on the outside of the Stadiun, does not fully
       reflect the magnitude of misbehaviour by drunken fans. Father a balance
       is struck in deciding whether arrests can be made without seriously reducing
       the nurtoer of police left to control the crowd.

21.    On this occasion, there was a rapport between the Liverpool a n d E v e r t o n
       supporters.   Had this not been the case, I believe nuch greater disorder
       would have emanated frxan the section of fans determined to gain entrance
       to the Stadiun, regardless of the cost in any terms, to others.

22.    Having described a lot of bad behaviour on the part of sane fans, I
       say that the majority were well behaved and concerned for the sa ety
       themselves and others.

 _                April        this y e a r        (150489)      my Auntie         was    by    herself           in the       pub,        so   I
 I
                   went        down       to h e l p    her    out.

 I                We     opened        the     pub at        about    11.30am      <1130)       and       business         was     quiet.
 IB
                   At     12 m i d d a y      (1200)        about     3 or 4 L i v e r p o o l      supporters            came        into      the

 I                pub,        they     ordered their            drinks      and    stood       by    the       bar,    talking         to me,

 _                they        i n f o r m e d me    that      they were Liverpool               supporters             and    t h e y all        had

                   Liverpool              accents,          they were     dressed        casually          not      in the       Liverpool

 I                colours         although          I think      one was        wearing        a Liverpool             scarf.

                   Whilst         they were            in the    pub t h e y w e r e      well      behaved           in g o o d      humour        and

 _                They        were     polite       and      talked     to me     on a n u m b e r        of    occasions,            in

between          serving        customers              from    the       conversation                I had w i th        them       I

ascertained              that     they had             travelled          on the          train       from Liverpool                to

Sheffield          with        other        Liverpool          supporters             and a l t h o u g h         none       of    them

had    tickets           for    the     semi       final       match        it was         their          intention          to    go to

the    Hillsborough               ground and             gain       entry       into       the       stadium.

They    e v e n a s k e d me           to    go    to    the       ground with             them a nd            I said       that       t hey

would       not    get      in w i t h o u t       a ticket,             but a l t h o u g h         I cannot          exactly

remember          how     they       said        that    they were             going       to     get      in    they    said       it

would       be    e a s y as      they       had done          it b e f o r e        and       there      were        other

Liverpool          f an s      who     had       come    d o w n w i t h them,             without          tickets          who were

going       to    ge t    in the        ground          as well.

Also    in t h e         pub at        the       same    time       there were             a    small       group       of

No tti ng ha m Forest                f ans       but    they       d i d not     have          any    conversation                with

myself       or    the      Liverpool             fans     and these            people          left       the    pub at          about

1.30pm       (1330).

At    about       1.43pm        <1345)           I was     asked         by the       Liverpool             supporters             to

call    t h e m a taxi            to    take       them       to    the H i l l s b o r o u g h           football       stadium,

the    first       two      occasions             I tried          to    phone       for a taxi             the       line was

engaged.           I eventually                  got    t h r o u g h at       about       1.55pm          (1355)       and       booked

a    taxi    for       them with a               company       c a l l e d C i t y C a rs,            I think,          this       taxi

eventually             a r r i v e d at      about       2.30       (1430)       to 2 . 4 5          (1445)       and    took       the

Liverpool          supporters               to    the    ground.

During       their        s t a y at        the    pub     I am         unable       to    sa y      exactly          how much          they

consumed          in     the w a y of a l c o h o l i c             drinks,          but       they were          drinking

steadily          al l    the     t ime      they       were       there.

The    group       of L i v e r p o o l          supporters             were    aged       in t h e i r         mid    twenties,

well    presented              in c a s u a l      dress.           I had       no    doubt          to    believe       that what

they    told       me a b o u t        not       having       tickets          was    not       tru e.

I left       the       pub at a b o u t           4.30pm       (1630)          that       day     and made my way                  home.

supporters            and     traffic          was      light.        I saw        that     the P o l i c e       had        blocked

off     the     side       roads       to    protect          residents*           parking,          and     I saw,          I think,

about      50      policemen           in    t hat are a.

Having        time        in h a n d    before meeting                my    friends,           I s t o p p e d at        the

the     pub a n d         ordered a          half       pint    of    lager,        and     sat      down     in the          bar

1o u n g .

I sat        jus t    to    the     right        of     the    main     entrance.              There       were

approximately               fifteen          people          in the     pub.        The     r o o m has       'bays*          around

its     circumference               and      I sat       at    the    end     of    one     of    the      ’bays*        nearest

the    entrance,            with my          back       to    the    next     ’b a y ’ .       Sitting        b e h i n d me w e r e

three      men,       who     were      already          there       when     I arrived.

After      a few minutes                I became             aware    of    their        conversation.                 I can n o t

now     remember           the    exact        words,         but    I gathered            first      of all        that       they

were     football           supporters,                intending        to go       to     the    semi-final             at

Hi 1 1 s b o r o u g h .

As    I went         to    sit    down       I had       noticed        that       these       three       men were           as

follows:-

1.     fiid t h i r t i e s ,       black        or     dark    brown       hair,        cut     slightly         longer           than

normal,         w i t h a d ar k        moustache.              He    was     wearing          black       lea t h e r       hip

length        coat,        dark     trousers.

2.     Mid      twenties,           light        sandy        hair,     cut    very        sho rt,      but     not      a    c r ew

cut,     clean        sha v e n ,      wearing          red sweater,           crew        n eck a n d a        pink         shirt

collar        worn        outside,          l i gh t    grey    trousers.

3.     Mid      twenties,           hair       light         brown and        cut    ear       length,        wearing          a

tweed        sports        jacket.           I cannot          describe        this       m a n as w e l l        as     the

others        as     he    sat    farthest             away    f r o m me.

As    I listened            to    this       conversation,              I heard          this     older       man      (no.        1)

talking         to    the     others,          saying         that    they     should          not w o r r y      about        not

                                                                                                                                        645

having          tickets.              T h e y would meet                 up w i t h     "the       o t h e r s ” outside

Leppings             Lane       entrance.              They would            organise             as    many     p e o p l e as

possible             to    cause       whatever             trouble         they       coul d .         If e n o u g h       trouble          was

caused          the       gates       would        h a ve    to be        opened.            I gathered              t hat    this       had

happened             before,          and      this m a n      seemed           confident              t hat    this       action        could

be       forced.

The       sandy         haired        man      (no.     2)    asked         how     th e     "others” would                  know       to

meet          up at       the    right         time.        (No.     1) T h e       other         man    said        if t h e y        got

there          for      about        £.15pm        (1415)      he k n e w m o s t            of    the o t h e r          lads a n d         they

could          quickly          be    got      organised.             He     said       "We've          got     to    get     as       close

to       the    turnstiles             as      possible."             He     said when             the       gate was         opened,

they          would       force       their       way       through        to     " the      back       of     the    goal " .

At       this     point         one     of     the     three men           noticed           I was       listening,               and    they

glared          at me           in a n       u n f r i e n d l y way. I h u r r i e d l y          drank             the     remainder

of       my    drink       and       l eft     the     pub.        The      time       would        then       be a b o u t       12.20pm

(1 2 2 0 ).

I was          in the           pub for about                ten           to     f i f t e e n m i n u t e s . I was         able       to    see

these          m e n as         I walked          from       the           bar to m y        seat,        a n d as I s t o o d         up to

lea v e .
          *
I kn o w that              these       men were             Liverpool           supporters              because           nos.     2 and 3

had Li verpool                  accents.              No.    1 had a n E a s t             Midlands/Nottinghamshire

accident.                 They       spoke       of    the L e p p i n g s        Lane       end a r r a n g e m e n t s          as    though

they were               well     aware         that     t his w a s        their        team's          end     of    the     ground.
     «

I did          not      place        too m u c h       importance            on     the      conversation                 I had        heard,

and       went       to    play       g o lf .        On my way           home      in the         car       I heard         on    the

radio          t ha t     there       had      been an        incident            at    the       semi-final,              and

thereafter                the    conversation                became        more        significant              to me.            The

course          of      the     public         hearings        of the           enquiry           currently           being

conducted               by J u s t i c e       Taylor,        prompted            me    to    tell       this        to    the P o l i c e .

I must          say       that       I gained          the    impression               that       the P o l i c e         were     being

           unfairly       blamed      for    this    cour s e    of    events.

           On    the    day a ft er    the    Hillsborough            tragedy,     I discussed        with      a golfing

           friend,                           what    I had      heard    rfi the     pub   on   the   previous      day.

           He    suggested     I tell        the P o l i c e    about    it,   but    I did     not   do   so

           immediately.

                                                                                                 G.   TAYLOR     SIGNED

                  At    1 * 3 0 pm      (1330)     Saturday,            15th April,             1989       ( 1 5 0 4 89 )     I finished        work

                  at    the     above      s ite     and    together          with an           employee,           Mr

                  for     a neighbour.               After       collecting            this,       myself         and                    t rave lied

                  along       Halifax         Road     towards          an address             at P i p e r     Road,         Longley,        where

                  we    were       to    drop    the      furniture         off.

                  At    t his      time    we    were      in a                                    truck        belonging           to the

                   company.

                  As    we    approached           the     junction         of D o e       Royd       Lane,       on our        left,        1 saw

                  that       the     pelican       crossing         at     t ha t   junction           has      turned         to   " re d     as

                  there       were       people      at    the    crossing          waiting           to     cross.           I pulled        up at

                  the     crossing         in the         nearside         lane,       and      the    two      elderly         female

pedestrians                began       to    cross       from        left      to    righ t      in    front          of    us.

H a l i fax R o a d         at    t his      point,          the     road      is a dual             carriageway                road w i t h

two    lanes         on     either          side.        As       the    two       pedestrians             passed          in f r o n t       of

the    van        I became            aware    of a          car a p p r o a c h i n g      the       crossing             from     behind

in t he       offside            lane.        I could             see    the       vehicle       clearly           in the w i n g

mirror        and       it w a s       travelling             at     high      speed       with       the    driver             apparently

unaware           t ha t    the       lights       had       changed          to    red a g a i n s t       him.           The    vehicle

was    within           5 0 yds        of    the    crossing             when       it    began       to    brake          suddenly.

There       was      no     screaching             of    tyres          but    the       vehicle       dipped           considerably

onto    the        front         suspension and                   came     to a n a b r u p t         halt       at     the      s ide    of

my    van     in the            offise       lane.           At    one     point         I was       extremely             worried

that     it w o u l d           not    be a b l e       to    stop       in time          and    put       out     my      hand     to    try

and    attract             the    attention             of    the       two       pedestrians          shouting             to    them        to

stop    where           t h e y we re.

After       the      vehicle           had    stopped             they managed             to    c r oss     the        carriageway

and    I looked             down       from    the       cab       into       the    vehicle.              It w a s        a dark        grey

coloured           family         saloon       either             an E s cort        or M o n t e g o       and       contained 5

mates,        Z    in the         front       and       three        in the         rear.        T h e y all          appeared           to    be

dressed           smartly         in    casual          clothing           with      no a p p a r e n t      football             favours

or    clothing             on    them.        However             I di d      see    what       appeared           to      be    red

scarves           in the         vehicle.           All       the       occupants          except          for     the      driver        were

drinking           what         appeared       to       be H e i n e k e n         lager     from      green          Heineken

cans.         The       driver         was    slightly             obscurred             from my       view        by      the     roof       of

the    vehi c l e .

As    s o o n as        I looked            down    the       front        seat      passenger             seemed          to    t ake

offence           and      began       shouting          numerous             swear       words       at me.            I could          not

hear     what        he w a s         saying       due       to    the     window         b e in g    closed          but       iw was

easy     to       lip      read w o r d s      s u c h as          " F uc k       off".      I began          to w i n d         my window

down     to       say      something          to    him        but      the       lights     changed          to      green        and    the

vehicle           set      off    at    speed       pulling             away       from    us    quite        quickly.              I was

    very annoyed              with      the o c c u p a n t s          of       the       vehicle       and       it was     obvious          to

    me   t hat      they      had      been        drinking           heavily             and    displayed           an aggressive

    attitude         towards           myself          and

    I continued             our     journey,             dropping                               at    the    S i c e y H o tel     Public

 House,          Sicey Avenue,                    Shiregreen.               I then          returned          to O u g h t i b r i d g e

 where        I then          called          into       the P h e a s a n t          Public          House       on J a w B o n e Hi 12.

 On      my arrival              there        I saw        numerous            people           both    inside       and     outside          of

 the      pub.        These         people          were        clearly         not        regulars         at     the    pub a n d     due

 to      their       accents           I took          it that         they         were     Liverpool             supporters          on

 route        to     the    S emi       Final          at H i l l s b o r o u g h .          It w a s       2.35pm        (1435)       when        I

 a r r i v e d at       the       Pheasant             pu b l i c    house          and     I would         estimate        t hat      there

 were      25 Liv e r p o o l           supporters              p resent.

 I entered            the     bar       of    the       pub a n d         saw       two     colleagues            drinking        at    the

 ka r ’                                  and                               ■        I joined          them and                 bought         me

a     pint.          I then       became           aware        of    two m e n           behind       me    who     were     drinking

shorts.             From      their          accents          it w a s      obvious             they       were    Liverpudlians

and      I began         to      talk        and     j ok e     with       them.           The       time    was     now 2 . 4 5 p m

(1445)        and      I said          to     them       something              to    the       effect       that     they     were

leaving          late       to    get        to    the     ground, for               the    3pm       (1500)       kick     off.

One      of   the      two       men    then         said       to me /'Don’t w o r r y                 about       that,     we       know

either        a gate          will      be        open     or    opened".              At       this,       both men        laughed         to

each      other.           This        statement              struck        me as          being       very       strange:         I wa s

p u z z l e d as      to     how       they        c o ul d     be    so    sure       that          they would          f i n d a g ate

or    gates        open      at    such a           late        time.          Neither          men made          any men ti on         of a

ticket        or     showed        me    a ticket.                   I have         attended           numerous          football

matches         at    Hillsborough                  and       other        grounds          and      the    statement         from      the

man      made      me w o n d e r       how       he     cou l d     be    so       sure     that       they would          find a

gate      o p e n at       that      late         time.         After          my    initial           thoughts          on the     matter

I dismissed            it     from       my mind and                 continued             drinking          with my

colleagues.                The    two m e n            then     left       the       pub at          2.45pm       (1445).         As    they

I           left    they        shook     t he     hands      of             and                   It w a s      apparent         to me

            that                and                lad a l s o       been   speaking         to    the     two       men    p r i or    to my
I
            arrival.

            Following           the    n ew s    reports        of    the   disaster        and     circumstances                of     it,
I
            the    statement           made      by    the L i v e r p u d l i a n s    in the      Pheasant           Public House

I           the    day    before        came       to m i n d a g a i n .         It a g a i n    struck        me    as    being       a

            very    strange           statement         from a supporter                attending          a m a t c h at        such a
I
            late    time.         It    became         apparent          from     the   news      t hat a g a t e          at   the

            ground       ha d    been     opened        to a l l o w      late     comers        into    the     ground         and     I
I
            conjectured           that       the      statement          made     by the    man and          the      opening          of   the

I           gate   was      connected.                It was       for    t his    reason        I contacted           the P o l i c e

            and    reported           what      this    man     had      said     to me    prior        to a t t e n d i n g     the match,

                    I am       e m p l o y e d as a                                        by

                                                                                                                                      Sheffield.

                    During        the      morning      of S a t u r d a y     15 A p r i l      1989      (150489)          I was    working
                         *
                    at    the a b o v e       development          unt i l     approximately               12.3 0 p m    (1230)       when    I

                    left       and    visited        the W h i t e   Hart        public         house      which    is       situate    at    the

                    junction          of O r c h a r d S t r e e t      and    the    main       road      leading       to

                    Stocksbridge.                I had a r ra n g e d         to m e e t    a friend           called                          at

                    the       public       house.                  1s                      and     he    is    sometimes        employed          by

                    my    company          on a s u b - c o n t r a c t   basis       as a n d w h e n w o r k          of    that    nature       is

                    required.

                    When       I a r r i v e d at     the    public       house       I saw        the     landlord,

                                          standing      at   the     entrance         and       he w a s      obviously        vetting                  f

                    I was       aware       t hat a s e m i - f i n a l       football          m a t c h wa s   being        played     later

                                                                         S47

 that day at the Hillsborough Stadium and the White Hart public house

 is positioned on the main road leading from Sheffield, over the

 Pennines,    to Manchester and the North West of the country.       This

 public house is regularly frequented,      on match days, by football

 supporters.

 I went outside the public house and I would estimate that about 80

 persons were within the bar area, a mixture of football supporters

and local people.

I easily ascertained that the football supporters were from Liverpool

as I could tell by their accents.

These people were behaving in an orderly manner and there was no

trouble.

The premises were very full and I was subsequently joined by my

friend                   y e had a couple of drinks and due to the

premises being busy we decided to visit the Pheasant public house

which is situated on Station Road at Oughtibridge and is a short

distance away from the White Hart public house.         The reason we chose

that public house is due to it being located on a quiet side road off

the main highway and we assumed that football supporters may not have
     "ft

found it.

_____________and myself arrived at the Pheasant public house at about

1.15pm (1315) and we discovered that these premises were also being

used by Liverpool football supporters.        The premises consist of 2

rooms,     the loung bar which is comfortably furnished and the public

bar which is used for games etc.       Outside the premises there is a

ter raced/paved area where benches and seats are used by c u s t o m e r s

wishing to remain outside.      The terraced area was busy and I quickly

ascertained that a large number of the people outside were Liverpool

football supporters.

We entered the premises via the front door and turned right into the
                                                                    PAGE
                                                                    S47

lounge bar which was very busy and contained a large number of people

which included the regular customers and Liverpool football

supporters.       The supporters were in the main well behaved although

several were rather noisey but nothing unpleasant.       I believe that I

overheard the landlord "Brian" say that several of the supporters had

booked a table at the premises for a meal and that this was a regular

occurrence whenever Liverpool were playing at Sheffield.

         and myself were enjoying a drink and we struck up a

conversation with 2 Liverpool supporters who were standing at the bar

next to us.            and myself were wearing our working clothes and it

would be obvious that we had been working on a building site as we

were covered in cement dust and other debris.      They asked us what our

occupations were and it soon became apparent that they were also

employed in the building industry.      The men are described as foilows:

1.    Male, white about 30-35 years, medium build, 5*7 tall,    light

      brown hair, collar length.

2.    As above.

I cannot describe them further other than they both spoke with

Liverpool accents.

One of them stated that he was a joiner and the other being a mason/

pa v ie r .

At about 2.00pm (1400) my employer,                     arrived at the

premises and he joined us in the lounge bar.

We continued to talk to the 2 Liverpool supporters about the building

industry and I believe the conversation related to payments of

craftsmen as it is part of any duty to work our payments for sub-

cont ractors.

At about £.30pm (1430) I asked the men if it was about time they

were leaving as it was a considerable distance between Oughtibridge

and the football ground and I would estimate the distance at about
                                                                              PAGE    4
I                                                                             S47

           two and a half miles.
I
           We told the men that they would have to park their car in the

           vicinity of the Texaco Filling Station, near to Middlewood Hospital,
I
           and walk to the ground from there.     One of the men said words to the

I          effect that they were confident of getting into the ground because

           the gate would be open or opened,     I am not sure which word was used.
I
           (Open or opened) The £ men did not appear to me to be potential

           trouble makers and they appeared to be decent people.      I didn't hear
I
           them say that they had tickets for the match, nor did I see any

I          t i ckets.

           The manner in which one     of them said that the gate would be open or
I
           opened did not imply to     me that they were going to attempt to force

           entry into the ground.
I
           The E men with whom we     had been speaking left the public house at

I         about E.40pm (1440) and      at that time the public house was almost

           vacated by all the Liverpool supporters leaving only the locals inside.
I         As far as I can recall there was no trouble at the premises.

              • Followed by briefing for Ci'D officers               (D e i .   S u p t . McKay)

1 was     then engaged on general           supervision duties,

F r o it: about    i pm I was outside the Leppi ngs Lane turnstiles with the

pick-pocket            squad.     Crowds were building steadily but they were

constantly being            ‘moved on* by m o u n t e d -ofticers,    ie enter the ground

or move away.

Numerous       people were asking for         'spares'    (tickets for sale).              A

number of them were the worse for drink.

Approx.      2pm        1 overheard a group of four or five Liverpool                 supporters

(aged 30-40 years)               discussing whether to go into the ground or go for

a drink.          They     decided   it was too early to enter the ground and

w a 1k e d a w a y .

Approx.      2 . 10pm      Radio message asking for C1D officers to attend at

the gymnasium,            person arrested.     I made my way to the gymnasium and

found two men had been arrested in possession of cannabis.                              Also in

the gymnasium at that time were several                  people reporting thefts.

CID officers were dealing with these matters.

Approx.      2.3Qpm        I walked round the back of the North Stand to the

Leppings Lane end intending to go outside to rejoin the pick-pocket

squad.       When I        arrived at Gate A I was told by the Stewards that they

were unable to             let me out   through the gate due to the heavy crush

outside.          People    coming through the turnstiles were              complaining to

uniform officers about the heavy congestion of fans outside.

I returned to the gymnasium.

Approx.      3pm       Listening to radio transmissions         it appeared there were

fatalities         in the ground and it was decided to clear the gymnasium                            in

prsparati.cn for use as a temporary mortuary.                   Shortly afterwards

bodies were being               carried in to the gymnasium on stretchers,

advertising hoardings and bodily,                A uniform officer was              instructed

to remain with each body.                I then liaised with Detective

Superintendent McKay.        Shortly afterwards    I accompanied Det. S u p t .

McKay to the Police Control Box in the ground where we spoke to

Detective Chief Superintendent Addis.           He then accompanied us back to

the gymnasium.

deceased and missing       persons to be transported to H am me r ton Road

Police Station.       Some time   later   I travelled with the first   coacn

load of persons to Hammerton Road.          On arrival,   arrangements had been

made for them to be accommodated at Hillsborough Boys Club.             I then

returned to Hammerton Road and liaised with Det, Supt. McKay and

o t ne r officers   etc.

Approx.   9.30pm I returned to the football        ground with Detective

Superintendent McKay and examined the terracing at the Leppings Lane

end.   The Chief Constable,       H.M. Coroner,   and others were   present at

this time.

I               At 9am on the above date I reported to Ecclesfield Police Station

                where   transport was waiting to take officers from F£ to Hillsborough
I
                Stadium.     At Hillsborough 1 was briefed along with ail other officers

I               on duly.     I was one of ten constables             in serial     19 under the direct

                supervision of PS 3£3 P ro cto r .          Our duties on this date were outsiue

I               the ground in Leppings Lane near to the turnstiles which were to be

                used as access points         into the ground for all Liverpool            Supporters
I
                with the correct ticket.            Our brief was to receive fans at that

                location and to maintain order and also to assist where                    possible and
I
                if needed,     serials working on the turnstiles at Leppings Lane.                    I was

 I              in possession of my personal            radio.


 I
                At         that date we received a further briefing at the rear of the

                West Stand which is at the Leppings L a n e e n d of the ground.                <his

                                                                              l '\   /


officers were aware of specific duties under          his command outside                the

Loppings Lane end of the ground.        We were    instructed to carry out-

selective searches of fans outside the ground and to search any

vehicles that were      carrying Liverpool     supporters and depositing them

at the ground.      Serial   19 then went outside    the ground to the area of

Leppings Lane adjacent       to the turnstiles and the mouth of the

official    car park at the rear of the South Stand.          It was evident at

this   point that    large numbers of Liverpool     fans were already in the

area, many of them asking       if tickets were available and also asking

for directions      to any local   pubs that might be open.       At   1£ noon the

turnstiles    into the ground were opened and some fans began to enter

in an orderly fashion.       Other fans were not     interested in entering

the ground and were milling arouna in Leppings Lane             in quite   large

numbers many of them drinking from lager cans etc.              Up until about

•1.30pm there   did not appear to be any serious problems          in Leppings

Lane despite the fact that many fans          (hundreds   in m y estimation) .did

not have tickets and were drinking.           From 1.30pm onwards maintaining

any sort of order either at the turnstiles or in Leppings Lane                itself

became very difficult.       Officers from serial     19 were    constantly
       *
trying to remove fans without tickets from Leppings Lane.               This task

was quite    impossible as droves of Liverpool       fans with tickets were

arriving.     The pavements and the road way were         completely blocked and

I was made aware that traffic was to be stopped from entering

Leppings Lane.       Shortly afterwards a special train containing

Liverpool    fans was arriving and the fans would shortly be arriving                      in

Leppings Lane.      By S.30pm the situation in Leppings Lane had

deteriorated to such an extent that 1 would say it became everyman

for himself.     There was so much nastyness from some fans towards tne

Police that a colleague of mine PC S 5 3 0 Lockley commented that he had

never seen a situation quite       like it.     Fighting broke out in Leppings
                                -                                                              PAGE      3
                                                                                               R7

i_ane at about 2.35 pm some fans were arrested.                        People were      coming up

 to me ana showing obvious forged tickets,                       some of t neiri were me re

 photostat      copies of originals end this had createa a lot of

an ta g o ni s m amongst supporters.              At   about £ .45pm the double gates

situate to the left             (as you look from outside the ground)                  of

turnstiles          number one were opened to ease what was obviously a crush

51    those turnstiles.             Myself and PC 3135 Surnlees went with Inspector

Sykes ana ether officers and eventually                       closed these gates to prevent

any other       persons from entering             the ground using that method.                I was

tnen aware that         problems were           being encountered at turnstiles A to G

arm the       crush there was unbelievable.                 I went to the perimeter            gates

situate fifteen yards               in front of the turnstiles ana tried to close

one of them to prevent any more                   persons    from getting near         to the

turnstiles.          These gates were forced open fay fans wanting to get to

the turnstiles.          The gates were           pushed Wise open and fans began to

scramble       through towards the turnstiles.                  Double exit gates just              in

the official         car park were opened to ease the pressure of the                         crush

outs ide,      one young male fan had already been lifted from within the

crowfl and. handed over the top to police officers and fans were

scrambling up the outside wall                   to get    into the g r o u n d .    The opening

of these gates         caused many people to rush through and lots of people

m     Leppings Lane saw the opportunity to gain entry and did so.                               I

then heard a Ioud speaker announcement                      t e 11i ng fans to get off the

pitch.        (I thought a pitch invasion had taken place).                         A radio

message was         passed for all available              officers   to go onto the pitch.

1 did    so   ana    assisted       at   that   location.

From first       taking up the point,       noticed that there was already a

 steady flow of spectators          entering Leppi ngs Lane from this           roundabout

and heading towards          the ground.        There were,    throughout   the time at

this     point a large number of supporters asking other                 supporters    if

they haa any spare          tickets.     A large number of Liverpool         supporters

enquired a b c ut a pub near        to the severs arches where          they had beers

told to n*ee t t o purc hase      spare t ickets for t h e ma t c h .

We were also asked by a great             number    of supporters of all age groups

where the nearest          "pub" was that was open.           They were all advised that

to m e       best of our know!edge all          public houses    in the area were

closed.        A great    number of supporters were       carrying 4 packs with

them.        The majority of the       people    carrying 4 packs arm asking for

directions       to the public houses were all          in groups      of 5 to ten p e ople.

ihroughcut the tour at Leppings Lane Roundabout there was                     no

a gg r ess i on shown by the supporters who appeared to be                in good spirits

and    looking forward to the game.             It was noticed that from about

1.30pm a growing number of the persons with 4 packs were                     seated on

wails    m    Leppings Lane     close to the junction with Peni stone

Road.     There appeared to be no problems             with these as there were a

number of officers          i rs the vicinity with them,        and also a highly

visible      presence     of officers   in the area.

The attitude of the supporters towards               us was very jovial       in fact

comments were       passed to the effect that they were not used to Police

officers       (Bizzys)   smiling and talking to them.

During    the tour at Leppings Lane Roundabout,               whilst    there had been

continual      flow of spectators       both towards    the Liverpool       side of the

ground and Notts.         Forest end,    as far as    I am aware       there were no

P ro 1 1 e m s wi th control of the crowd and no aggression shown towaras

the Police or opposing s u p p o r t e r s .

At ap p ro x i ma t el y £.30pm I noticec that 2 officers along with Sgt.

P e a r s o n and Inpector Millett began to stop traffic from entering

Lappings- Lane from the r o u n d a b o u t .

A u 2.4Uprfi the same date myself            and PC 2735 Wade       relieved the 2

officers ana stopped all traffic               from entering Leppings L a n e , to the

an n o ya nc e   of many motorists.         Inspector Millett had informed us that

there was         problems at the Leppings Lane entrance to the ground and

that due to the large volume of spectators                     in Leppings Lane    no

vehiexes         could get through.        Service    buses were advised of the

si t u at io n and they took alternative             routes.    To the best of my

know l ed g e    the youths who had been sat on m e             walls with their 4 packs

must     nave    set off towards the ground after              I took up traffic    control

at   the end of Leppings L a n e .

o .U U        she area seemed desertea of supporters so we began                  to w a l k to

our Phase £ position.

As   1 a pp ro a ch e d the ground there appeared to be a large number of

supporters walking away from the ground towards Leppings Lane

Roundabout.

A xo t of iocax          res iaents were   complaining about the problems           caused

by the      large number of supporters          that had been there and the             large

amount      of   cans and fish and chip wrappers thrown into their g a r o e n s .

upon     re a c n m g   the Leppings Lans entrance        I was   informed that there

nad been trouble           inside the ground and that with other serials,                 had

to cordon off the Leppings Lane              entrance to the ground.        At this time

there were a large number of supporters                 leaving the ground and

walking      up towards Leppings Lane R o u n d a b o u t , they were     visibly shaken

ano upset and some were snouting aouse                 to Police officers.        Virtually

im me d i at e ly our serial was called into the ground to the rear of the

West Stand,         verbally as radio cornmuni cat i ons appeared incoherent as

though a lot of people were trying              to pass messages       together.

I went     into the area at the rear of the West Stand via                ’C * Gate where
                                                                                                PAGE         4   f

I immediately saw meci cal staff giving attention to a boy in whe fe«(

of an a m b u l a n c e .    There were a large number of injures persons

scattered about this area with Police                      officers and civilians

a t i n ' s inis t e n n g first- aid,    ihe area   was    in to tdi    conr us io h «is o *<>i- f

for auibuiances to get t h r o u g n .          Along with olher officers              t-s-e centre

part of this area was cleared to allow access for a m b u l a n c e s .                         I was

then told to stand with other officers forming a cordon around a

number of bodies             lay on the floor at the perimeter wall.                   At    tms

time    1 had no       idea at all wnel        nad happened,          ai i orders were ylv e n

verbally as the radios were sliii                    unreaoafoi. e.     mere    were        a«ir y £

police officers and ambulance staff trying to give first aid and aiso

towards the fire service officers who ha a arrived.

An instruction was given to clear everyone front that area,                              ana the

majority of tne youths were escorted out of the Leppings Lane

entrance,       these       leaving under      protest,      It was quite obvious            i,hat an

incident of a particularly serious nature had occurred and it was

notea that a lot of the officers there let a lot of the you Ins                                  leave

the area that woulo have been arrested for public oraer of fences

         company with PC £733 Wade whilst      it was announced that the game had

         been abandoned and for everyone to leave the ground.        The majority of

         the    people   left this part of the stand in silence others thanked the

         officers for their help whilst      one or two continued to be abusive.

         Once the stand was      cleared along'with PC Wade I went   into the seating

         area and with other officers,      conducted a search for property with

         negative    result,

         I then left the ground and met up with the rest of my serial        outside

         the Leppings Lane entrance,     where we were called into the main stand

         for the de-brief.

         Whilst awaiting for a de-brief      I heard an inspector say that he had

         been kicked whilst giving somebody mouth to mouth and that another

         officer who had been checking for a pulse had been kicked in his hand,

             PC    2668            E    M    FLETCHER             A2    THORNE




             Commenced                 duty       at    8.15am         from     home       station             to    parade          for    duty       8.45am

             at    Doncaster                 for       transportation                to    Sheffield.                 Travelled             to       Sheffield

             in    double              decked          S.Y.P.T.E.          bus       on    hire.




             Arrived           at       Hillsborough                for    briefing             in       North       Stand       attached             to

             serial          29        with       PS    1561      Reynolds,           PC    1280          Hebdidge,             PC    3145       Punton,       PC

             214        Caulson,             PC    2840       Pearson,          PC    1169       Kerr          and    PC       2915       Severn.




             Following                 the       briefing         engaged        on       duties          at    Eskdale          Road       and

             Shenstone                 Road       off    Leppings          Lane,          preventing                unauthorised                parking

             with        barriers                arriving         approximately                 11.05am.              At       that       time       Liverpool

             fans        arriving,                many       with      packs     of       beer       —    lager.           Remained             in    that

             area        mostly             in    company         with     PS    Reynolds                on    foot       patrol          along       Leppings

             Lane        between             the       two    roads       above.           As    time          went       by    the       volume       of

             spectators                 arriving             grew,      many     asking          for          directions             to    Public          Houses

             and        it   was        apparent             to   me    that     a    large          number          of    them       did       not    have

             tickets           for          the    match.           I must       have       been          asked       at       least       50    -    60    times

             if    I     had       any       spare       tickets.

                                                                                                                                                               R24



There      were           groups             of    fans       walking                up       and       down       Leppings            Lane        asking

others          for       tickets,                this       went          on       from       the          time       of    my    arrival             at       the

point       until          just          before             kick-off.                    I    saw       several             instances             of

spectators                purchasing                   tickets             I       think           25       was    the       asking          price.




The    mood          of    the          fans       arriving                was       generally                happy/boisterous/singing,

obviously             looking                forward             to       the       match.              I    did       not    see       any       bad

behaviour             as       such          but       as    time          got       nearer             kick-off             there          were          still


many      asking           for          tickets.




From      about           2pm       I was          with          PS       1561       Reynolds                standing             in    front             of    a

private          garage             area          almost             opposite                Eskdale          Road          just       after          I    think

Bickerton             Road.              This          was       a    result             of    a    complaint                from       an       elderly

couple          who       were          washing             their          car       in       the       garage          area       regarding                   fans


using       the       garages                as    a    toilet.




From       that       point             we    could          see          down       Leppings                Lane       to       the    bottom             at       the

roundabout                at       Penistone                Road,          during             that          time       there       was       a    continuous

stream          of    fans          arriving,                causing                problems                for    traffic             on    the          road,

one       fan    was       spoken             to       by    PS       Reynolds                for       deliberately                   walking             on       the,


road       in    front             of    a    bus.           The          mood       was       generally                good       natured                and

enthusiastic.                       There          seemed             to       be    no       let       up    of       numbers          arriving                and

about       2.50pm             I    made          the       point          to       PS       Reynolds             that       there          was       no       way

could       they          get       into          the       ground             for       kick-off,                and       for    them          to       do    so

the       kick-off             would          have          to       be    delayed.                 About          3pm       I    heard          on       PS

R e y n o l d ’s      radio             that       there             was       a    large          crowd          at    the       turnstiles                   and


apparent             trouble             there.




As    a    result          together                with          PS       Reynolds,                PC       Bradley          and       PC    Severn             we
                                                                                                                                    PAGE
                                                                                                                                    R24

went    directly             to    to       the    turnstile             area,       large       numbers          of    persons

there,       I saw       some          climbing          up    over       the       wall    into       the       ground       and many

of    them    running             up a n d        climbing          over       the     turnstiles            themselves.                 The

time    then would                be a b o u t      3.05pm          just       after       the       main    bulk       of    them       had

been    let       in    through             the    gate       which       had       been    opened.              Not    knowing          at

that    time       that          the    gate       had    been       opened          I prevented             several          youths

from    climbing             over       the       turnstiles             and     moved      others          to    the    other          side

of    the    gates       in f r o n t         of    the       turnstiles.                 Remained          there       and       several

•fans*       leaving             the    ground          then    informed me                that       there       were       serious

problems          inside,          one       described          it       it as       being       worse       than       the       Heysel

disaster.




Many    people          leaving             the    ground       now and             the    general          attitude          n o w was

of    anger       and    sheer          hatred          towards          the P o l i c e ,       many       threatening

officers          and    calling             us    murderers,             the       main    were       very       hostile          towards

u s r so m u c h        so       that       I was       afraid       for       my    own and          other       officers

safety.           Many       of    them were             in t e a r s .




About       3«20pm       I was          in d e s p e r a t e        need       of    the    toilet,          so    I went          into

the    ground          and walked             down       the    side        of      the    North Stand             to    the       toilet,

there       were       large       numbers          leaving          the       stand       by    them,       while       in       the

toilet       (alone)             I was       subjected          to       a barrage          of       threats       and       abuse       from

about       30 men,          3    or    4    told       them    to       leave       me    alone       as    it w a s        not    my

fault,       if    they          had    not       done    this       I f eel         sure       that    I would          have       been

assaulted.              On       leaving          the    toilet          I walked          around       the       back       of    the

West    Stand          trying          to    find       a way       on    to     the      playing       area,          but    not

continued.     Some coming up and asking me where the nearest pub was,

I remained there until we were stood down and asked to regroup in the

North Stand.     From there I walked with my serial to Claywheels for

food and subsequent transport back to Doncaster.

Back of North Stand packed with men urinating against the wall when shouted

at by myself, carried on regardless.              At this time my attention was drawn to

back of turnstiles for North Stand where Police Constables from my serial

had come through the turnstiles. Entrance gates 'A* were shaking violently.

Fans coming through turnstiles drunk and hostile shouting ’THEY’RE GETTING

KILLED OUT THERE, THERE’S GOING TO BE ANOTHER HEYSELS,’ and screaming for

gate ’A ’ to be opened.

Gate     ’A ’ opened and crowd surged forward through the gate.               The gate was

closed again only seconds later.

Back on turnstile duty only a few Liverpool fans coming through suddenly a

crowd appears at main gates to turnstiles which are closed.                 Only people now

attempting      to   get    in are    very drunk      Liverpool   fans.   Turnstiles    closed

scuffling breaking out between Liverpool fans and in one occasion a drunken

Liverpool fan lashed out at a Mounted Officer with a broken bottle. Suddenly

Special Inspector beckons wildly at me.                I ran to gates 'B     where I saw an

obviously dead boy being put in an ambulance, passed a near naked dead man

at gate      ’B ’ and into the area between gate              'B ’ and the tunnel for the

 terraces.      In this area approximately 10 dead people were strewn about.

 I checked these to ensure they were dead then assisted with the injured

 people some of who were also lying in this area.                 I then, after seeing the

 arrival of ambulance crews, ran through the tunnel to the terraces where I

 was met by a wall of Liverpool fans, looking over them I could see the pitch

    had been invaded, people around me in the tunnel began moaning, I assisted

    to escort   these      people   out   of   the   tunnel   where   if they were     injured,

    directed ambulance crews to them.

    Myself and Police Constable 809 carried the body of a young fair haired boy

    in a Liverpool shirt and light trousers in the lane running adjacent to the

River Don, we then went onto the pitch.

People were being carried away but no bodies were on the pitch.

Attention   called   for   Leppings    Lane    terraces   where   Liverpool   fans were

attacking another Liverpool fan who they say was picking up belongings from

the terraces and putting them in his pocket.

Called by another officer to go to Leppings Lane.                 On the way assist to

remove bodies from back of terrace tunnel to lane running adjacent to the

River Don then form cordon helping fans to leave ground, stream of urine

running down from North Stand like a waterfall.

Fans leaving ground violent and asking if the match is off.

Ambulances convey bodies away.

Liverpool fans leave, then instructed to go to North Stand for de-brief.

Throughout these events I felt nothing, I just helped where I could.

It seemed as though nobody really knew what to do but help with the dead and

injured.

I have worked at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club on numerous occasions and

usually have policed the same turnstiles without any trouble.

 I              At 9.00 arn on Saturday,                  15th Apr i 1 , I commenced duty at Ecclesf ield

                Police Station,             where      transport was available for tra nsp or tat ion a own
  I             to the Sheffield Wedne sda y Football Ground.

                A briefing was given fay Chief S u p t . Duckenf ield in the North Stand
 I
                ana        1 was    part of a serial           together w ith 9 other officers               under     the

 I              command of PS 323 Proctor.                       Our duties were           to be in Leppings Lane.

                P ri o r     to comrrienc-i ng our a u t i e s , after            tne   initial      briefing was
  I             completed,           a further       briefing was given by inspector Sykes to our

                Serial,        out 1 ini no our overall             cut i e s .
 I
                We       then took up our          position on Leppings Lane,                     on the footpath which

  I             runs        in front of the turnstiles.

                The        volume of spectators             increased as the day went on.                  People were

  I             CU it   tending at this         location,        requesting the           location of     public

                houses.            One named the " Be e- hi ve 11 was mentioned in particular.

                M any       supporters were sat ana stood arounc on Lappings i_ane, who had

                no intention of entering the ground until as                                late as possible.

                P'sany were drinking ai ccncl                  from both cans ana large bottles,                   ho w ev er ,

Officers         it was     impossible to do anything about             it.    I was

continually attempting to keep both tne footpath and roadway clear of

spectators who were just intent on standing around.

A couple of coaches arrived at the Leppings Lane end of the ground,

whs. ch was unplanned and these were emptied and the fans dealt with

accordingly.           Some alchonol was brought on one of these coaches and

the driver was            immediately verbally cautioned.

Assistance         in clearing the road and paths was given by mounted

officers from time to time.

By about 2 pm the amount of people in the area had grown and by now

many people were stood around drinking and generally obstructing                                 the

hi g h w a y .

At 2 .35 pm a large fight broke out on Leppi ngs Lane arid together with

PC 212G Thorpe we arrested a youth each,                      who were fighting with each

other.

An attempt was made to take the prisoners to the Police Room via                                 'A'

Gate,     however this was impractical               due to the large crowds outside

the turnstiles.               We then went down Vere Road to the Police Room,

whilst we were going down Vere Road,                    fans were, jumping over the

barriers and asking to buy the tickets of those arrested.

This had been the general                order of the day.         Many fans were wandering

around wanting to buy tickets,                  obviously many people had attended at

the ground without tickets.

At o ne point one fan approached with an obvious forged t i eke t,

photocopied,          which he had paid          20 for.

The    prisoner was booked in and I then attended at the Gym to do

paperwork.

At about 3 pm all available officers were                      requested.

I attended         in Leppings L a n e , there was then a large spill                  of fans

 gale   I saw fans laid on the floor,           distressed.      1 assisted as best i

 could and then went towards the tunnel which gives access to the

 terraces.       Officers were at this location tending victims,                I went on

 to the terraces and assisted            in trie pulling back of the fencing in

 order to assist people to get out.

 1 saw many        bodies    laid one upon another on the t e r r a c e s .     The

 majority of which appeared            aead I then assisted with other officers

 in picking        up maybe half a dozen bodies and passing them              through the

 fencing to other officers.

 I do not know who          1 passed them to,     nor can i describe any of the

 bodies    1 dealt with.        All the bodies     I moved were from the floor on

 the te r r a c e s .

 i   regularly work at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and always                     in

 tne same     location,     i_eppir»gs Lane cn coach reception.          I worked the

 same semi-final        last year.

Eventually we were taken from the terraces and resumed.

prevented from go i ng into the g r o u n d .           "ihe pavement areas around the

Leppings Lane end were thronged with Liverpool                      supporters and I was

continuously movi ng supporters from tne paved area arid in the middi, e

of the     road.        These   persons we re directed either         into the ground or




At about 2.30pm the queuing area for the Leppings Lane end was packed

with Li v e r p o o i    supports r s .    Wit h other of f icers from our serial               I

entered the         crowd to try to ease what seemed to be becoming a serious

congestion.             By this time traffic: had been stopped on i_e ppi ngs Lane

as Liverpool        supporters were approaching the ground in mass.                       Many at

these    people seemed obviously the worse for drink.                    i   couici     see that

mou n t e d officers were trying to ease the crowd situation by

instructing supporters to queue in an orderly fashion and telling

those without tickets to get away from the crowd.                       Many of the

supporters       displayed a hostile           reaction to these requests.              I myself

entered the         crowd to try to make          it more orderly as by this time

there was alot of pushing towards the turnstiles.                        None of the
     *
Police action seemed to he able to alter tne actions of tne crowd.



As the time got towards 3 . 0 0 pm there were s t i 1 a hundreds or

supporters walking to the ground from either end of Leppings Lane.

It became      increasingly impossible to direct these people and -froro

wnere    I was stood on the outside of the queuing crowd towards the

roadway     persons       in the crowd,       including P o n c e   Officers,        were having

problems.        1 tried on several           occasions to get into the crowd              io

split    it up but it became              increasingly impossi Ole to penetrate             it.

Among the crowd just a few feet front me i saw one youth selling

tickets and I heard him start the bidding for a ticket at                              H O .00 and

clearly very annoyed that tney could not get in on time.

 3*30 and 3,40pm I saw that there were at least twenty apparently dead

  bodies    laying on the pitch and several       other bodies were being

 attended to by Police,       supporters and St Johns.      At about this time I

  saw that one of those bodies was a man who 1 now know to be a Cari

 Brown.      I checked him for signs of life out ne was dead.        With the

  he 1p of some of the Liverpool     supporters     I carried the body on a

 wooden placard and took him to the gymnasium where           1 stayed until

  3 . 30am the following day when the deceased was        identified by his

  father.     The body showed no apparent signs of violence other than a

  mark on this head.        1 handed the body over to the mortuary staff at

  walery S t r e e t .



  My feelings at the time of the       incident    inside the grouna were of

  disbelief and a thought that such a thing          couldn't happen at

  Hillsfaorough.

sheets by fire service.

1'hen sent with 10 other officers and told to try and clear of f the

fans from the bridge and Leppings Lane entrance                                                 in order that                  the

large        number     of fans still            in the ground            could Be                  clear,

wnxlsl         doing    this at was noticeo tnat f ans were very aousive ano

a g g r e s s i v e towaras Police and most                    swore using words                              like:

"Fucking Police had Miners                      now had us.";            ‘'It’s all                     our f a u l t s . ”

"Get       the fucking         press out of here."
Fans w anted to hang about                 near the entrance   looking for friends,

relatives        and were very reluctant            to move even a few feet further.

Whilst    in the ground entrance               the cordoned fans were    reluctant to

move    to al l o w    in the ambuiances and kept wanting           to look uehxnd the

cordon and were           very abusive        towards   both services and in fact were at

times    obstructive.

A f t e r all   the fans we re cleared from tne ground ana nearly entrance,

was told to return to ground ana take up seats as                    in briefing,      which

was done.         N oticed then it was 7.10 pm.             Between E .1>6 pm and 7.10 pm

was totally unaware of time although all                    time was kept busy.       Several

fans wanted to make             complaints against Police and were          imormea     to

contact     their      local    force seemed very odd that        in a i i tne   panic ana

co rtfus ion fans        could even inink of sucn a t m n g .

Fans even tried obstructing ambulances                    from getting   in at the

i_e ppi ngs uane       entrance and on arrival           of eacn aracuiance fans haa to

be moved and actually asked personally to allow the ambulances                         m.

It a p p e a r e d at times as though they didn't want heip.

Fans were seen to be actually attacking Police Officers who were

carrying        bodies    both d e a d 'and injured from inside the grounu.

O b s e r vations     from m y s e l f «    Each and every Police Officer        i saw acted

and did everything             they possibly could to help tne situation.

La r g e numbers       of Police Officers were           totally unaware of wnat was

Happening and          radios should have been           issued to at least every

officers.

It was riot at all           possible to make any organised plans whilst              the

incident was          ongoing and everyone did what they tnought             possioie       to

help,    officers actea on own initiative*

11 was obvious           from an early s tags we 11 bstore tne rna ten tnai           ^ne

ma j o r i t y of fans would have            pur chased and. consumed a considerable

amount of alcohol.

Also from tne amount of fans asking directions            to pubs   it appeared

that   they had no intention of being at tne ground at a reasonable

time   in order to make an or tieriy e n t r a n c e .

There was hundreds of fans without tickets hanging about the Leppin

Lane area.

Vast amounts of fans had made their own way to Sheffield ana arrang

to meet up with other        friends   in various pubs ansa   had not come    as

part   of any    organised party or supporter groups.

Finally,   I felt that whilst stood outside after the           incident on

Leppings Lane whilst the fans were going out tney were very abusive

and threatening towards all officers.            On more than one occasion I

felt   that 1    was going to get a ‘smack in the face from a f a n ’ and

having been      told that we were to expect abuse,       had to take   it.    Had

any officer made the slightest         remark   re a fans verbal abuse then a

separate   incident    could have been sparked off       in seconds.    1 felt

very threatened and humiliated at having to take such abuse after

            Around 9.30 am we arrived at Hillsborough ana a briefing was held in

             Followinq t h e? o n e f m g              took a oieal break: and at approx irna

             11.00 am the serial was deployed to our respective                        points     I was

             allocated the road barrier at Leppings Lane junction with Jhenstone

             Road,     together with PC 1169 Kerr and PC 2840 Pearson.

             As the day progressed supporters walked along Leppings i_ane towat ds

             ine Leppings Lane entrance with the numbers increasing a*                            the t-i.ise

             passed.           Numerous     supporters were a r m K i n g      t rom cans a?iu were

             carrying as many as four cans which I assumed they were                           consurnmy

             prior to enter ing the ground whicn was appro;-; /5 yaf d^                             .

             A complaint was received from a resident of Shenstone R o a d                          (believed
                                                                                                  R

No. 51)      to the effect that youths had been urinating against his

house wail        therefore several walks along the road were made and

several youths were            prevented from walking down the                   road.

As trie afternoon progressed the amount of people                            passing towards tne

gates      increased greatly,         the majority of people appeared to be in a

good mood with the occasional                  singing and snouting group.                  At 2.30 pm

approximately the supporters walking past showed no signs of slowing

down and several          people who were sat on walls of local gardens had to

be ushered towards the ground in an attempt to get them inside prior

to the start of the match because                      it became     increasingly obvious that

there was no way that they would be inside before 3 pm.                                  Many people

simply moved a few feet away and stopped again for no apparent                                       reason

in fact many made no attempt to get into the ground until                                 the last

minutes at 2.45 pm people were still sat outside a nearby fish shop

eating and drinking           cans of beer/'lager.

It was obvious that many had been drinking although they were not

drunk to the falling down stage.

From rny position at the road barrier                      1 saw numerous        people cl imbi ng

over a wall near to the turnstiles, this continued for about 1/4 of
     *
an hour until a Police Officer who .1 believe was a Special Constaole

(wearing a flat          cap) appeared on top of the wall,                    even then people

continued to climb to the top of the wall,                          this   incident occurred

sometime between 2.30 pm and 3.00 pm.

A large number of supporters were walking away from the ground,

mingling with           approaching supporters and asking for any spare

Approximately           3.00 pm rny attention was drawn to the Leppings Lane

entrance by a           request to attend there regarding public order,                          i

cannot recall where the request originated.                            1 attended the entrance

together with PC Kerr and PC Pearson,                 as a arrivea the m & jority of

the Police      present were either mounted branch on horseback or bpeciai

Constables,      numerous supporters were climbing over the turnstiles,                            i

pul lea one youth back and was instructed fay a Police                       Inspector who 1

ao not know to close the turnstile doors,                    this was done and the crowd

of supporters       present were moved back to the               road side of the main

gates which were tnen closed.                I remained on the outsice of the main

gates.     On my arrival at the entrance               initially the       large gates into

the ground were        closed,

At this time I was unaware of what was happening                       inside the ground,              I

was not in possession of a personal                 radio.     After a short while 1

heard conversation relating to people                  inside the ground being

injured,    an ambulance arrived ana was directed into the ground.

Numerous     people were still mi 11 ing around outsice                 the gates wnen a

fire tender arrived,          conversation was then heard              relating to 3

fatalities,      people then slowly started to leave the ground,                       further

ambulances      then arrived together with other fire tenders,                      by now

people were      leaving the ground          in large numbers many were shouting

abuse at Police Officers saying               it was our fault for opening the gate

and accusing       the Pol1.ce of killing          people, the atmosphere outside the

g o U-n g. was s o t e n s e w 1 1 1i t n s o b v i o u s signs of hia t red to w a rd s un e

Police that      1 was fully expecting an assault against me ana other

officers.

Word was now being          passed around that there were numerous deaths and

supporters were talking about bodies being ail over.                          Some of the

supporters were obviously             injured and when offered help they refused

it and just became abusive towards the officers,

1 remained outside the ground in an attempt                     to Keep trie road clear

for emergency vehicles,            I returned to the Nortn Stand sometime                  later

when trie around had been cleared.

 1   had no contact with any deceased      persons at all.

 1 cannot say what time      the turnstiles opened to tne      pubiic cut can

 say that 1 was not aware of any problems outside the Leppings Lane

 e n trance w h i ch I could see fro:;': my point.

 I have    performed duties at previous major events at Hillsborough and.

 nave always ceen in the      locality of Leppings Lane tnere have been no

 serious    incidents at previous events I have attended.

 From my    observations 1 would say that the major    cause    of   the incident

 was the    fact that so many people arrived late arid had no        intention of

 entering the ground     in good time.     They had consumed large amounts of

 alcohol although only a few were obviously drunk,           and there were

 hundreds of supporters      present witnout tickets who usually still try

 to gain entry any way they can.

 1 was also asked by supporters where the nearest        pub was.

seen on T.V.       that the wall     inside had col lapsed and that many were

seriously injured.           Other traffic mobiles   then began to arrive and it

was    decided that 2752 would stay with the barrier and I would go into

the ground to assist.

I entered the ground at about 3. IS pm from the entrance between 'tne

i\o rt h Stand and the Spion Hop.

1 was directed to join a line of officers across the centre of the

pitch.     In front of me fans and police officers were            intermingled,

the major ity of fans seemed to be d aired but there was the occasion

when I saw fans shouting at officers and pointing at them,                  but otnsr

fans    tried to calm them down and lead them away.

The fans in the West Stand were           pointing and chanting and people were

climbing from the stand into tne terrace.

The fans behind us were fairly quiet and seemed to sense that

something was amiss.

A scuffle began in the area below the P o 1ice control             bok and as we

moved forward it appeared so did the crowd and a cry rose,                  so we were

ordered back by one Senior Officer           in front of the line.

Standing on the line,           the ground appeared to be absolutely packed and

1 felt that the cheer from the Spion Kop wouio nave brought the fan is

out of the Liverpool           terraces and onto the pitch.

We were then directed to leave the ground and deal with crowds

leaving the ground.

T h ere was no t roubi e with crowds after t h e mate h at t n e junction of

Fielding Road and Peni stone Road,          although I received a number of

c ugs t iu n s a 1o n o the line of w n s re was ins nearest   pub / oft   i.i >-e n ce .

junction witn Leppings Lane ana Peni stone Road North,           outside tne Old

Owl Service Station,           Our duties were to keep rival   fans apart.     The

Liverpool    supporters arriving from tne West arm the Nottingham Forest

supporters    c oming to the Spion Kop end.



Close to the ground it was fairly quiet to begin with,            but as lunch

time approached more and more farts came to tne ground.            I was

approached by a number of fans during this time who were all               looking

for tickets to buy.        In Serial 30,    there were two people who had

personal    radios,    the Serial Se rgean't, noiice be rg e a n t Ashton had one

allocated to him at the ground and Police Constable 243 Landers,               who

is a Community Constable,          had his with him.   Police Constable Landers

was on duty only feet away from me when I heard a message             come over

the radio that there was trouble at the Royal Public House which is

near   to the ground at the Nottingham Forest End.



From where    I was    positioned    I could see up from the roundabout      up tne

road towards    the railway station where tne Liverpool         supporters were

arriving.    There was by now a constant stream of supporters walking

from this direction down towards the ground.            At a point about

halfway up the hill       I could see that a large number of poeple were

standing    in the street outside a public house.         I do not know the

name   of it, but     I also   saw that all the coaches that were arriving

were   being directed to a parking area near to this pub.



At about 2 .CO p.m.      the flow of supporters was becoming more and more

on the edge of the forecourt of the Service Station.             i became    aware

     tnat                  there was a problem at the turnstiles at the Leppings Lane End.

someone shouting       avtr the fans singing,       requesting        the gams be held

up for 15 minutes; to allow the fans outsiae             to get       in.     1 Dei ieve

this   request was     turned down.      I then heard someone saying that

people at the       front of the crush were getting          injured and           that one of

the gates was       becoming damaged.      I then heard tnat         it was        going to oe

necessary to open the gate         in order to relieve the pressure at the

front.      I then heard the order to open the gate,



After a few seconds       I heard that all available           officers were to

attend on the track around the side of the pitch,                    at which we started

to make our way to the Leppings Lane E n d .            1 never heard anything

else on the      radio after that,      out when we got to the L e p p i n g s Lane

end. turnstiles,      I heard that ambulances had been requested,                    we were

told to for"! a c o r d o n outside tne g r o u n d .   At    this    time we had no

idea what had       happened    inside. There were still a number of fans

outside,     some   of them drinking, some of them had tickers which

they       showed to us ana asked if they could go in.



An ambulance then arrived and stopped just              inside the gate.             I then

saw a youth being       carried out of the ground to the ambulance.                    i saw
       *
the ambulance man trying to resuscitate him,                 but they then just         left

him and went back to get another youth who              1 saw with a resuscitator

on his face.        We were all then told to go into the Ground.                    As we

walked past the ambulance,         1 could see the youth inside,              he looked

as if he was dead.



As we walked around a waii         into the yard behind trie west titan a we

were   confronted iiy the sight of people          lying on the floor wx in other

people      resuscitating them and attending to injuries.                   mere    were a

number of fans also who were walking a b o u t , swearing ana snouting at

us and Police Officers who were already           in the ground.      I saw one fan

pushing a Policeman about and shoaling,           ”i I ’S YOUR FUCKING F A U L T “ .

As we neared to the tunnel wiiicn leads onto the terracing other fans

vvhi ch were   coming out of tne ground shiouted at us,         it's too    late now

and started swearing,



As    1 entered onto the terracing      1 saw that there was several         hundred

people milling about on the pitch.          I then made my way onto the pitch

via one of the perimeter fence g a te s , I think        it was number 4.          1

then saw people      lying on the    grass near to the goal.        As I ente red

onto   the pitch 1 ranbehind the goal to         where   I saw people      passing

bodies out through a hole         in the fence onto the pitch.        Further aleng

I then saw a large number of bodies         piled up on top of each other.                  I

could not say how many there was as legs and arms were all tangled

up.     I then saw that a man who was conscious was trying to free

himself from the bodies.         So along with another officer who had

arrived with a pair of step          ladders,   I climbed up the fence and leant

over the top of the fence.           Although Icould reach the hands of tne

man, 1 could not get a grip   of rum avid ne could not move as he was up
     *
to his thighs in the  bodies, the weight of which held him fast.   i.

As fans    pulled at    it from the inside,     myself and a senior officer who

had a white band on his h a t , kicked at it from the outside.               On

getting   the hole     larger   1 helped to carry a fan from the terracing

onto   tne pitch.      He was   passed to us by fans who were on tne

terracinq,

were      being pushed about and hif by some fans but it was not possible

to hear what was said.                           The bodies         1 saw piled up were all just

behind tne goal                    to tne left as you stood on the                        pitch looking at tne

stand and they were all                          right at         the front of the terracing,,                    right

The youth who                   I had been passed,               I helped carry to the sice of the

left goal            post,         but there was no room to put him down so whilst three

others held him I helped to take the goal net down which made more

room.         I then went back to the hole                           in the fence where               I assisted to

carry another male youth on to the pitch.                                         He was     passed to me by

fans from the terracing.                            The youth was motionless,                   but very warm an id

was      blueish          in colour.            On finding a space to lay him down myself and

ano t he r Police of ficer s tar t ed t o t ry and re v ive him .                                     1 searched f or

a pulse but could not find one.                                  He appeared to be dead.                     Someone

then came and took over from us.                                  I think it was an ambulance man.                            I

was then asked by a woman Police                                  Constable to try and              find some

oxygen for a person she was resuscitating,                                        so 1 found       a medical

person who was going around.                               Ail    the time        I could see         people,         fans

All      the time people were running about shouting and crying,                                                 trying to

find persons they had lost.                              I was then approached by a man who haa

removing        persons from the seated areas to prevent any further

trouble.        Once outside the ground I never saw any further                   trouble and

the Li ve r poo 1      fans all    left the area.



At about 6,20           p.m.in our Serial,     we went to the Road Traffic

refreshments.

             On Saturday 15 April          1969 I commenced duty at 9„QGan! at Ecclesfieia

             Police Station,          from where    I was transported with other Officers                      to

             the Hillsborough Football             Ground,, where a full briefing subsequently

             took    place.

             I was detailed to Serial           19 together with PS 323 Proctor and ten

             other    constables.       Our duties were initially outside the ground,                          at

             the Leppings Lane entrances,             supervising arriving Liverpool

             supporters,          receiving and searching arriving            coaches, and general

             public order duties.           This duty was in fact tne same as 1 and many oi

             my colleagues          perform at most football matches at Hillsborough,                         has

             been well tried and tested,             ana myself and,       1 am sure,             the ctnsr

             I arrived with my serial at the Leppings Lane enc. of the ground at

             some time shortly after          "il.QOam.     We were met by Inspector Sykes who

             briefed us on our          particular duties.        We then went out into Leppings

             Lane and took up positions             in the vmouth*     of the entry to the ground

                            F F ngs Lane    turnstiles,     alongside Leppings Lane                  roaa it,s£

             On reaching -Leppings Lane            1 immediately noticed that              there were

             already a large number of Liverpool               supporters       in the area,           some

             walking around,          some stood around in small groups,                 The turn stiles

were not open at this                 point.        Frow the outset,                  1 had cause to converse

with many supporters,                 ail of whom at this time were very ami cable.                                 I

was    continually approached by supporters who had arrived early arm who

were a s k i n g     one of a limited number                      of question,          namely - Where was

the nearest          pua or Deer-off?               Where         could they get something to eat?

Where a particular entrance to tne ground was? Did                                          1 know where any

tickets       could be bought?

Ail    tne supporters were in good humour,                               and were dealt with

accordingly.              They continued to walk around or gather                             in groups,      the

numbers bui 'iriing steadily all the time.                                 More and more fans arrived

and    it soon became noticeable that many had been drinking,                                        many were

in fact walking around near to my location carrying several                                           cans or

bottles of beer, and openly drinking from them.                                        On   ''normal' match

flays 1 am certain this i n itself would not have been tolerated by my

serial,       but the point was reached where there were simply too many of

them acting          in    this manner.            There was the occasional                   loud   mouth who

appeared worse             for drink,         but again as time went on,                     these   became more

and rriore noticeable.

1 cannot        recall      the exact time that the turnstiles were opened,                                but I

can rtfcall ’Ghat when they were,                           there was no apparent             rush by the

supporters         in tne area to get into the ground.                                They were stood about

in groups of increasing s i z e , ana then they began taking up positions

on nearby walls,             sitting and drinking beer etc.                            There were many

people who had obviously arrived without tickets,                                       they were openly

approaching          other     people and asking to buy tickets.                             These   people

were     in fact a         continual        nuisance', and were being                   repeatedly asked to

I can re'ca'i i a Police of f i c:er &houting out over a veni cIe loudspeaker

to the- c r o w d , advising to stop pushing,       but the advi ce was   ignored,

i recall thinking       that there was soon going to be injuries          it the

pusning dian'i step, although from my position I coul d n ‘t set if

there were any persons being injured nearer to the turnstiles,

j. can recall      that there was a point when there was a sudden surge

forward by the crowd,       obviously by movement near the turnstiles.               I

c°u*d not see what had caused this but I assumed that a gate had been

opened to relieve the pressure.         Had this not been done,         I do believe

that serious       injuries or damage would have occurred outside the

entrances.      Also at this point I can recall         large numbers of

supporters    rushing to the entrances from Leppings Lane.             I saw them

run across    the    road from a wall where many were sitting or stood near­

by,   fty own belief     is that these people did not have tickets,          and

that on seeing the sudden rush into the ground,               realising that a gate

had been opened,       they too joined the   rush.     This obviously added

considerably to the numbers entering the entrance at the same time.

Supporters    continued to enter the ground,         but shortly after 3.DOpm,           or

hearing    radio messages    requesting urgent assistance        in the ground,      I

went wit h o t her officers    into t h e ground,    onto t he p i tc h , near Ihe

Leppings Lane terracing.

1 first of ail       thought that a pi ten invasion had taken place,         but it

was soon apparent that the incident was much more serious.                 As soon

as it was apparent that people were getting seriously injured in the

crush on the terracing, with other officers and supporters,                I first

of all    recall    trying to break down a strip of the perimeter fencing

to the    right of the goalmouth i n order to get to a person who,            if not

already dead,      was very seriously injured.        This was eventually done,

the man lifted through tne broken fence.             He was   carried onto the

pitch ana attended to by otner officers.             I believe he was     dead at
                                                                                          R64

   this time.

  r rorii viiis pc i nt i assisted in helping all           present    i rs lifting obviously

  dead people f rom the ter rac:i ng , and also assi s t i ng injured peopie

  or,to the pitch.      i cannot say how many dead bofii.es 1 helped remove

  from the terracing,         but I believe     it must have been i n double

  figures.      On three occasions       i assisted other officers who             1 could

  not name,     in attempting to resuscitate           three people,      two young boys

  ana a. man of about 2b-30 years.            I can recall       thinking that they were

  aireaay dead but efforts,         nevertheless,       continued unsuccessfully to

  revive them.      1 eventually assisted other officers,                and also

  supporters,    in ca r ry i n g t hre e a ppare n 1 1y dead y o u n g me n f r o m t h e

  Pitc h at the Le p d i no            n d 7 'Co ine irea near ‘la the gymnas iurn.

  u j.d nut stay witn any of these bodies,            other officers        remai n e d , and ]

  Cuj-ild not identify any of them.

 y ^ r e mai ned inside the ground,      on the    pitch,    until most of the

  supporters had left the ground.             I was   completely stunned by all that

  had happened and could not         initially understand how it could have

  happened.     i was not in the ground when the incident began,                    but      it is

  my opinion that,     being present outside          the Leppings Lane entrances,
         A
  it was extremely lucky tnat no serious              injuries had occurred outside.

Although not many fans were building up in these areas at                                  this time,

which appeared to be of beer or cider and many were seen to be

drinking from and carrying                cans of beer and lager.                During the course

of the day I was asked by several fans directions to nearby public

houses which were open and in particular The Fox Public House,

F oxhill R o a d , whi ch received publi city 1ast year                     in relation to tne

amount of alcohol           consumed by 'the fans.

             to. fans     congregating outside these                 licensed premises

demanding access which was                refused by the           licensee as I believe he

was   closed for the day.             However,       a short time later I was approached

by 4 youths from Liverpool who asked directions                            to The Bee Hive

Public     House.      1 tola them not to bother as he was                     closed but J. was
       *


told they were friends of the licensee and were expected there by him.

The build up of fans            m    the Leppings Lane area obviously increased as

the kick off time approached and numerous                          persons were seen in

possession of alcohol mainly cans of beer and lager,                                Requests for

directions       to public houses           continued during the afternoon.

I recall that at the pre-match briefing we were told that the train

from Liver poo l was due            to a r r i v e a I wa o.s i e y B r ic g e Sta t,ion at c. ucprsi

Leppings Lane then became blocked oy the masses of fans making                                    tneir   (

way to the qround ana although many were drinking and carrying                                    cans

of alcohol       the banter between mvself and the fans was friendly and

Although towards kick off time the masses thinned, consiaerabiy                                            there

were still         fans walking and running along L e p p m g s                    Lane to the

During the afternoon I was asked by possibly 7 or 8 fans                                       if 1 knew

the    location of any ticket touts for them to buy tickets.                                       I was not

aware of any xn the area.                    This seemed strange             in so much as the

numerous         ticket touts,          who as tne kick off approached were almost

giving tickets away to the fans.                        This year I axso saw numerous -fans

asking         other fans          if they had any spare tickets.                 un eacn occasion

-the answer was no.

"fe'the kick off approached 1 was not near the Leppings Lane

turnstiles which we were told at the briefing would be ope nets at "\d.

Once     tne fans had cleared in Leppings Lane                         I began making my way                   to

€ 1ay w|-see 1s Lane for a meal, when I was cev xated to go                               to une i_eppinu

Lane     turnstiles.               This would &e shortly at ter L.uOpm                  tna t day.

On m y arrival at that location a short time                            istsr, 1 saw numerous

officers         in that area but few fans.                  I found radio transmissions at

that time from ground control almost unreadable due to the noise

being made by the spectators.                       In addition        to this,       constables           were

not    issued with radios and had to rely on supervisory officers                                           Co pa

on messages           to them.

A short time after                  this 3. was told to go to the rear of the west

    assistance we could until a fleet of ambulances                                 began arriving at the

 seen.

There were a lot of people (maybe 20 in total) asking for ’The Sportsman’ which I

did not know where it was and there was a gradual increase of people coining from

the ground side asking if any pubs were open.         Some Liverpool fans did get into

The Gate public house through the side doors (door men on duty).

All who enquired were told most public houses were closed for the day but those

who enquired still made their way away from the direction of the ground and up

Penistone Road North.

The supporters' train arrived at Wadsley Bridge at 1.50 p.m. (some 15-20 minutes

earlier than expected).

About 800 - 1000 supporters who all made their way under separate escort down

Leppings Lane to the ground. This crowd was orderly and I saw no incidents at

all.   Little singing - well behaved in general-

Traffic was now building up and it was noticed a lot of the spectators were

carrying drink. The time now about 2.10 p.m. Some were drinking from ^ packs and

others from large bottles.

Pedestrian traffic now was fairly heavy and a lot were sat on the walls drinking

before making their way to the ground.

At 2.15 p.m. approximately instructions received via radios to close Leppings

Lane to vehicular traffice - DONE.

Coaches were      still   arriving but   these were now parking on Halifax Road      as

Claywheels Lane was full. Very few cars.        Pedestrian traffic now very heavy.

Obvious that some had no tickets as they were in a group asking for tickets.

The general behaviour I would describe as good. Some had been/were drinking, many

were not.   By this time all making towards the ground.    Could hear over the radio

of problems at Leppings Lane end and at a certain time, I believe after the match

had started, an instruction "ALL AVAILABLE OFFICERS TO THE GROUND".          My few

serials were soon gathered together and we made our way to Leppings Lane side of

the ground.

On arrival could see a large group of Police Officers and argument taking place

with supporters.    I thought this was a public order situation and I formed a

cordon across the turnstiles to keep spectators away.     The turnstiles were closed

but people were arguing that they had tickets and were demanding entry.        These

were kept back and it was some minutes later when people were leaving the ground,

directing abuse to the Police, that I realised something else was drastically

wrong.

I entered the ground itself behind the West Stand. A large number of people were

injured, some were obviously dead.   Others were in a state of shock.    People were

tending to the injured. After the initial shock, I remember giving first aid to a

youth who had obvious internal injuries.

I cannot remember if the radio was working at this time - but I do not recollect

hearing any transmissions.

Together with another officer I moved the injured youth, who was conscious, to

the sterile area behind the West and South Stand.       I remember a doctor arriving

                                                                           RlftO




and I said I wanted the injured prioritising.      This he did.   I noticed another

doctor certifying the dead.

Initially, the ambulances were slow. They would find it difficult getting through

traffic and pedestrians.

One would arrive and the injured near the turnstiles would get on - although thej

were not the more urgent cases. This was eventually overcome and with rnor*

ambulances now arriving all the injured were removed.

The dead were then removed and the officer dealing with the dead taken with it.

 Heard a loud cheer from the ground which 1 took to be the teams

  coming out onto the field and at this time there were still                      literally

  hundreds making their way towards             the ground.

 Shortly afterwards        1 heard over the radio that there were               problems at

 Leppings Lane entrance but by the time my serial arrived there,                         the

  trouble appeared to have been resolvea,.

Saw    in the first few yards onto the pitch three people oe i ng carried

After this had been sorted,          assisted one more       person on the field who

wasn't    seriously injured and then one who was at side of wall near

gymnasium.      He was      complaining   of rib pains but after getting him a

cup of water from an ambulance he appeared okay,                 so left him and

returned to outside of ground at Leppings Lane entrance arid rejoined

I
       At 9.00am (0900)      on Saturday,   15th April,   1989 (150489)   I commenced

        duty at HamcTierton Road Police Station, my duties on that being one of

       a number of CID officers, who were to work under the direct control of

       Det.    Insp. Towell as part of a       Pickpocket Team.

       At 9.45am (0945) that same day           I attended the    Sheffield Wednesday        ._

        Football Ground and together with other officers I was briefed in

        relation to the forthcoming Semi Final football match between Liverpool

        FC and Nottingham Forest FC.

        At   11.30am   (1130) that same day,    I commenced observations regarding

        the pickpockets in the Leppings Lane turnstile area along with Det.

        Sgt.   McSioy, Det. Con. Hallam, Det. Con. Locking,        a further team was

        also operating in that area, those officers being Det. Sgt. Smith,

        Det.   Con. Lilley and Det. Con. Lindsay.

        At that time our brief was to identify travelling pickpockets and if

        possible to carry out a surveillance on those persons.

        Due to this Det. Con. Hallam was in possession of a wallet alarm, and

        the remainder of the team were to be in a position in order to

        respond to a signal to be given by DC Hallam.

        On taking up our positions in          the area of the    Leppingt Lane turnstile

        and paddock area, the area was          very quiet and    the crowd being sparse.

       numerous         coaches      and P u b l i c     Service          Vehicles           came   along        that    roaa

■     search       of    persons     leaving          the    vehicles        was       undertaken.

        I recall        seeing     two    coaches           arrive       at t h e      same    time,       two    officers

I     approached          one    vehicle      and      the     remainder          of     the    serial      6    or 8

■     years.        However        I must       say    that      I had several               arrests       take       place

    and believe that this may have drawn strength away from the reception

    party.

    At this time there were no problems and no real cause for concern

    involving public disorder.

    It should be pointed out that Mounted officers were operating in the

    Leppings Lane turnstile and paddock area, the number of officers

    being two sergeants,       one of those being a South Yorkshire Officer,

    four Police Constables,        two of those being male Merseyside officers.

    The Merseyside officers operating in the area directly:in front of

    the Paddock and turnstiles.                               ~   "

    At around 1.15pm (1315) together with the other members of the

    Pickpocket Team,      I walked along Leppings Lane,      due to reports of

    pickpockets operating further along the road, at this time numerous

    people just hanging about,          sat on the pavement leaning against the

    walls,   sat on the p a r a p e t   of the bridges, many of these people were

    dr inking from; cans and bottles ~o£ assorted int ox i-cant s «_;        .

    I even recall seeing a very attractive young lady with two friends,

    drinking from cans of lager.            In the space of approximately half an

    hour I saw this one girl            open and drink four cans of lager.

    At around 1.30pm (1330),            together with Det.C.on. Hallam and remainder

    of team,     I walked down Leppings Lane in the direction of the

    roundabout,     the observations went       as far as the chip shop situated at

    the junction of Leppings            Lane and Bickerton Road, at this location we

     loitered.     The crowd at this time was .-q.uite dense, stilL numerous fans

    approaching     people including myself and asking to buy tickets, many

     of the fans    in the area the worse for drink, quite a lot of litter

    mainly beer cans.
     Whilst walking back to the original observation area in front of the

     Paddock area,     I identified one particular fan as being a ticket tout,

     I approached him,      enquired how much he was selling the tickets at to

for    the       two    males.

Det.    Sgt.          McSloy,          DCs          Locking              and    Askew moved                off     from     the     area        which

we    had       now    taken          up,       w h i c h was             directly          adjacent             to   the     roadway           and

is    on a       lip    which          affords                a     view which             is    slightly             elevated          and     looks

football             stadium.

After       a    short        time,         t   h   e    entire           observation               team       re-joined           in     the

aforementioned                   area,          the          c r o w d at       this       time       now     being       v e r y .dense            a n d r.

it     seemed         that       from       the          area           near    to    the       shop        some      considerable

distance             away     right         up          to        the    ground       was       totally          blocked       by        people

moving          towards          the        ground.                 By    this       time       vehicular             traffic           had    ceased

and     the      entire          carriageway                       was    blocked          by       people.

Whilst          stood        with       DCs             Hallam          and    Lilley        and       looking         down       into        the

paddock          area        which was                   nowtotally                 full     with          people and-strll                   more

walking          towards              the       ground,             I saw           groups      of     young       men      pushing           i nto

 the    crowd,          the      majority                 of t h e s e          being       the       worse      for      drink,         I saw

 several             carrying          and          drinking              from       large      2     litre        bottles         of    both

 lagerandbeer.

 At    this          time    I noted                that          the    Police        horses          were        moving     amongst               the

 dense          crowd       in    front             of       the    paddock           area       to    alleviate            the     situation.

 My    impression                of    the          situation                 was    that       the       c r o w d was     becoming

 desperate             due       to    having                no    tickets           and    with       no     h ope    of     getting

 tickets,             also       the    fact             that           the    ones    who       had       tickets        would         miss        the

 start          of    the    game       due             to    large           amount       of    people          trying       to    gain        entry

 to    the       stadium.

 I     cannot         recall          the       time,             but     whilst        stood         at     this      location          a Police

 Landrover             came       along             the       Leppings              Lane,       with       blue       light    and       two        tone

 horns          operating,             the          vehicle              stopped        near         to    wherewewerestood.

    I looked both down and up Leppings Lane and the area was totally

    blocked in both directions with people moving towards the football

    g ro u n d .
    I was now stood to one side of the Landrover with DCs Hallam and

    Lilley, and whilst there we were joined by a uniform Inspector,

    identity unknown.

    PC Buxton the driver of the vehicle, alighted and stood on the body

    of the vehicle and whilst doing so he was using the vehicles PA

    system,        repeatedly stating ’Please stop pushing there are people at

    the front being crushed*.                    I noted several                            large groups of young

    Liverpool        fans, who were pushing            into             the crowd and making some


I   headway towards the turnstiles, these fans pushing others out of the

    way.
     I spoke to several               fans saying ’D o n ’t go forward,                                 stay back’.    Many

     ignored this.
     At   this     point   I    saw    several    people    c   l   i   m   b   i   n   g    on   the    fences   around   the


     paddock area.             Once climbing into that position those people were then

     helping others up onto the fence tops.                                     I then saw one fan climb over

     into the actual ground, he was                  then       followed by others,                           I then saw

      Inspector Bennett appear on the roof of the turnstile area.                                                     I saw

     the officer assist several fans to climb into the ground area.

      It was obvious at this stage that many people were being crushed at

      the turnstiles,           people were not moving through the actual turnstiles

     and I recall thinking that I couldn’t see any Police helmets at the

      tur nst iles.
      Both PC Buxton and the unknown uniform Inspector were now using the

      PA system,       repeatedly asking the               crowd                to stop pushing and that there

      was    people being crushed.                I recall one of the officers stating that

      game was going to be delayed.                   The people still approaching the

      ground and turnstiles were taking no notice whatsoever and w e re




                                                                                                   ^     I

continuing to push forward,

The Mounted officers strength had been increased, and saw that those

officers were attempting to get nearer the turnstiles to enable

people to gain entry to the ground.      Still no one taking any notice

and still more people pushing forward.      At this time there was no

other obvious Police manpower deployed in that area.

I observed the Police Mounted Inspector,     obviously shouting at the

crowd,   I noted that his horse seemed to be going under due to the

people pushing against it,the front of the horse started to rise with

the rear end disappering from view,      it appeared that the officer was

falling backwards,    however, somehow he regained his footing.

The mood of the crowd was now very desperate and becoming more and

more hostile.

The anger of the crowd now being directed at the uniformed officers

present,   I noted several    people coming towards both PC Buxton and the

Inspector,    pushing at those officers, saying do something,   stop the

pushing,   sonie of these men were crying in what I believe was     __

frustration at the situation.

PC Buxton who was continually using the PA system then directed the

Mounted officers to form a line in front of the Paddock area,       this

was   partially successful,    five Police horses completing the line,

however as the crowd pushed forward the horses were pushed towards

the ground.

PC Buxton still attempting to reassure the crowd stating that they

would all get in and to stop pushing.

X   recall seeing Inspector Bennett who was still on the roof of the

turnstiles and was still pulling people onto the roof.

By now I couldn't actually see the turnstiles due to the vast sea of

people and still no sign of Police helmets.       PC Buxton still

attempting to reassure the crowd.

Whilst      stood        at      that     location          a    large           roar       from        within       the       ground,           it

appeared         to     rr.e t h a t     the     football         teams           had        come       onto       the    pit c h ,        this

being      around        E.55pm          (1455)       the       mood        of    the        crowd       being       desperate,

more     and      more       fans       pushing       forward,              still          many     carrying             both        cans    and

bottles         of    drink.

Together          with       the       other      officers            of    the       observation               team      knowing           that

Whilst       walking           down       that     road     another              large        roar       from       within           the

ground       was      heard.             I noted that football                             fans    were        running         up     that

road      in t h e       direction          of     the     Leppings              Lane        end,       those       fans        obviously

coming       from Liverpool.

Having       walked           down       that     road     and        i nto P e n i s t o n e           Road,       I n o t e d that

there       was       very       few     spectators           in t h a t         area,        together             with        the    o t her

officers             I then went           into      the      gym.

At     3 . 0 5 pm     ( 1 5 0 5 ); or     thereabouts             whilst              in    the    gym        having, m e a l ,

information              was       received         that        the     crowd          was    on        the    pitch       and       that        all

available             uniform          personnel         to      attend          that        area.            Together          with       both

D C ’s L o c k i n g        and     Askew        left    the      gym and              took       up a        position          near        to

the      entrance           to     the    pitch,        however,            having           been        there      only        a    short

 time,      together             with     the     other         officers              1 was        instructed             to    return           to

 the     gym     to    await          casualties.

Whilst          in    the     gym      1 was       informed           that        there           had    oeen      deaths           in t h e

 ground         and    was       told     to     clear      the       gym        by    Chief        Inspector             Beai       and     to


 make      it     ready       to      receive        corpses.

 The     bodies         then       began        to a r r i v e    within              the     gym,       the       first       person

 having         been      carried         into       that       area was              thought           to    be    dead       however           it

 was     found        tha t      he    w a s n ’t dead          and        therefore              was    moved       to    one        side.

 The     area        within        the    gym was         now     ready           to        receive          the    bodies           and    t h ose

 that      were       brought           in w e r e    blue       in the           f a c e,        many       obviously           dead,       some

 of     which        were      still       being      attended              by    first           aid    personnel.                  I notea

that    several         of     the    bodies        (deceased)             had       vomitted and            soiled

themselves          and       I recall        seeing      one     which          had       blood        coming      from     his

head    body       orifices

All    the    deceased          which       were     brought          i nto      the       gym w e r e      accompanied            by

Police       officers,          some       being     carried          in    on m a k e s h i f t         stretchers          and

others       actually          being       carried.         I recall             seeing          one     female          Police

officer       and       some    spectators           struggling             with       the       body      of a     small        young

male,    I went          to    her     assistance          and      took        hold        of    the     boy a n d       carried

him    into    the       main    h all      and     placed       him       on    the        floor       along     with      the

many    others,          the    female        officer       then       stayed          with        the     deceased.

Many    of    the       bodies        I saw    obviouslyhad                broken          limbs         and many         were        in

some    form       of    state        of   undress.

Together       with       other        officers       mainly          CID       F1     personnel,           I moved         amongst

the    bodies       and       Police       officers,        instructing                    the    officers          to    stay    with

the    deceased          and    to m a k e     a brief          description                 of    the     body and         to

search       the    body       for     both    personal           effects            and     identification,                I

handed       the     officers          plastic       bags       and      labels.

Having       completed          this        task,    again        together             with       other     F1      CiD

personnel,           I searched             several       bodies         placed            them     into     body        bags,

making       sure       that     the       head was       the     first          thing       to    be     seen      once    the       bag

was     opened,         the    bodies        were    then       lined        up       in    rows     of    twelve,         the

attending          officers           were    again       instructed              to       stay wi t n       the     deceased.

I cannot        recall          the    time    but       it w a s     some        considerable               time        later

certainly          after        six    o'clock       tlSOO),          I was           instructed           to    convey         the

lo 'the L e p p i n g s   Lane entrance,   "ihere appeared a I a I of confusion

witn both sets of supporters as to which entrance tney should be

going    in and invariably,        I was being asked to which entrance tney

should be going.            As the time for the kick off    closed in the crowds

outside     the Leppings       Lane entrance    grew rapidly and from my location

I coulci see jostling          amongst the crowd trying to gain entry          throagn

the turnstiles.            Many older people were    passing me and stating that

they had no intention of trying to get              in through the Leppings Lane

entrances as they were being pushed and jostled and made very

uncomfortable.            All these persons appeared to have tickets for the

game.      I continued to man the barrier to this junction and this

particular       duty was becoming more and more difficult due to the

volume of persons           running from what appeared to be other entrances             to

the ground down Vere           Road to the Le ppi ngs Lane turnstiles,         None of

T-hese persons seemed          to have the slightest knowledge of where they

Many were approaching me placing their tickets              in my hand and asking

me where they should be gaining entry.              At the same time the        crowd

outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles had swelled dramatically and was

becoming more voiciferous and pushing towards the large gates

situated at this end of t h e         ground.    The supporters at this end

smaller     but there was an atmosphere of agitation outside,

 fit u"ie junction of Vere Road and r e m s t o n e               Road North,     there   is a

 fir.ri ana c m p snop on one side and an off-licence                      on the other       side.

 From quite            early m          the day,    large queues had formed at both shops.

 A ,i.arga percentage                  of supporters of both clubs were drinking as they

 were walking along and carrying cans of beer.                         I saw one youth

 drinking from a seven pint party can of beer.

 it was aiso apparent that both sets of supporters were                           intermingling

at L:oth sides of the ground,                       mainly I think by accident     having got

z i ? ® a.n£* iooking for their way into the ground.

^fJrougnout the day,                   I did not see any problems involving         rival     sets

ol- supporters.                   Ihe mood of the fans going to the match was good,              and

i. Sc;w no animosity from them towards either the Police or fellow

s up po rl e r s .

i was» approached by several                       persons from about E pm asking where

tnere were            some public toilets.             I diu not know of any and tola them

said that            it was too early to go in, obviously because                it would stop

them from drinking.                     1   was also approached by several      obvious

Liverpudlians asking where the ticket                       touts were as they had not got

tiCKets.            Only one admitted to travelling without a ticket,                   the



At about- 'd.»2 0           pm    i joined two officers PC 2 0 2 6 Ayres an a PC 2 0 4 2 Drury

There was still            the odd Nott irwham Forest supporter mixed in wiln tne

Liverpool          fans.       Many were asking for directions to thei r particular

 part of the ground,              having no idea where they were going.          ihese

 [jeo p 1 e took up mo s t of our time .

 At about, ~cL«        pm it was brought to my notice           Insw people    couiQ not

 get to the turnstiles at Leppings Lane end for the North or west

 Stands because of a crush of people whicn had built up.                       i was toici

 by several        supporters ail brandishing            tickets who were asking       if they

 could gain entry anywhere              else.     I did not notice the      crush of people

 build up and did not realise anything was wrong until                      I was tola.        A

 few people,        mainly women or persons with children asked if they c o m a

 get out of the way nearby until                 the   crowd had cleared,     I mentioned

 the   proDiems to an Inspector wno was walking                 past us — not our

 inspecter and         1   ao not k now w no n e was.       he went o t i in the direction

"of.? "the turnstiles.            I could see that there were Police officers there

iwJ'-Jti the crowd.            I could see the mounted officers above the heads of

 the crowd.          I did not appreciate the seriousness of this crowding

 until about four Liverpool              supporters at separate times s a i a that         it

 something was not done about              it,    there would be another H e y s e 1

 along tne road towards the turnstiles.                   Tnere were still     in evidence

 a lot of cans of beer.

 A short time after              I first noticed the congestion,       I saw that      it 'was

 beginning to clear.               i was not aware of the reasons why it was

 clearing.          I did not hear any radio messages           but with the noise of

 the crowd and being              constantly in conversation with someone,          it was

 easy to miss what was being said.

 It seemed to me that the congestion cleared some minutes before                         the       <

 kick off although it is difficult to tell as                   1   can only juage from

 the noise of the crowd inside the ground.                              I could tell by the noise

 o-    the    crowd     mat      the match nac slarled.                There was no crush outs ide

at this t i m e .          There were over a hundred people                     in Leppings Lane who

Wtt-e making          no eft ort te get           intc 'trie ground a no who obviously did not

1 heard a radio message shortly after the game had started asking for

ail available officers                 to go into the ground.                 My job was to prevent

any harrassment               of the    residents nearby and as there were a lot of

people outside            the g ro un d, I did not consider,                  myself or any of my

seriai       to be available.              In any case,         1 was only in contact with two

s-iad i known what was actually happening                          inside the ground,                my

decision might have been different.                            From listening to the messages

on    the radio,         1 was none the wiser as to what was going on.                                    I heard

a call for an ambulance because someone was seriously injured but was

stiil      unaware of the situation inside                      the ground.

bhortj.y after          the incident developed,                 a few people started leaving

the ground.            i was asking thorn what was happening.                         At this time they

fire    engines and ambulances started arriving                            in Leppings Lane and

shortly afterwards               I heard on the          radio of the need for a mortuary,

it was o m y          then,    perhaps £0 minutes after,                 that    I realised the

seriousness           of what had occurred.               It    was too late &y then                 to be of

any help inside the ground and in any                           case, a lot of people were

leaving the ground requiring                    supervision.           Some of them,          mainly

teenagers wno haa been drinking were snouting and swearing at the

Police officers            present that         it was all our fault.                Many were              crvim

None of the Police Officers                       in my view responded to the abuse they

were    getting from the small                    percentage of the supporters          leaving the

ground.              All these people were           ignored.     To have re-acted to them

         On Saturday             15 April        1969 I was on weekly               leave day and was                  in

         pot session of a ticket                    for the FA Cup Semi-T i.nai tie. at Hi i j. s d o ro ug n ,

                tnd and due 'to other                 com mi tments did not leave home until 2.30 pm.

         At about 2.43pm I was                    crossing Dykes Hali Hoad near to The Beehive

         public        house where          1 saw a large gathering of Liverpool                             supporters on

         the front car park,                    most of whom were still drinking ana in a rowdy

         mood,      I would estimate                that there were about 50 outside                         the premises

         1 continued to walk to the ground ana as                                 I reached the junction o+

         Leppings Lane/Catchbar Lane there was a heavy build up of Liverpool

         supporters           rushing to the ground.                      As I walked along            I was approached

         by at least ten of the supporters who asked if I had a ticket to sell.

         As    1 got to a point near the ioridge the crowd was                                    packed solid from

         the turnstiles               to the      roadway ana being swelled in numbers all                                  the

         The incod was hostile ana derisive                          chants were ueing made as to tne

completely overwhelmed by the sheer                    volume of supporters ana their

(approx. £1.50 p m ) .     As he was uaing sc,              supporters on the ground were

hurling abuse at him about the situation,

I continued-down Vere Road towards Penistone Road where I saw
                1
supporters urinating            in genneis between trie terraced houses and also

going       into those back gardens           looking to gain entry to the ground via

the per irueter fences abut ing trie gardens and the ground.                            1 went on

to the Peni stone Road entrance and in startling                           contrast there were

no queues art anv of the turnstiles and ay about 3.03pm i. had gained

there 'Had --fafee-n-a pitch invasion.

As the s-ittrstion deteriorated' I decided that the match would not

continue,       but not grasping         tne full extent of it i walked home

                 On    Saturday,            15   April,           1989       <150489)             I was       on    duty     at    Hillsborough

                 Football          Ground.             I    came       on    duty       at    about          fe.45am(0845)             that        date       and

                 travelled            to    Sheffield             from       Barnsley             by    my    own     car.        I arrived              at

                 this       time      there       were          several .Liverpool                     supporters           wandering              around.                      |

                 At    9 . 4 5 a m (0945)         I   attended              at    the        North        stand       and     joined        my      serial,                     3

                 At    10.30ani( 1 0 30)              both       myself          and    PC    2711       Patterson           went        back       to    m y ’

                 Liverpool            were       in    and       around          the    Herries              Road area.            Past food

                 mobiles         were       ready          to    sell       refreshments.                    After     collecting              my      coat        we

                 proceeded            to    Leppings             Lane       from       Penistone             Road     and    onto        the       junction

                 with       Fielding         Road          and    Leppings             Lane.

                 Upon       arrival         we    set       up    barriers             at    about           10.4 5 a m (1045)          in o r d e r      to

                 stop       vehicles         parking             in    the       road       which       didn't        belong        to    residents                    and


                 to    control         the       flow       of    pedestrians.

                 By    this      time       Liverpool             and       Nottingham             fans       had     begun       to     arrive          and

were    asking           for     directions              to    public           houses       and       off-licences.                 We

tried        to    explain        that        local       p ubs      were           closed       or    only       open      for      local

residents.               This     did        not    deter          t h e m as       many     stated          that       it w a s        early

and    they        would       walk      a    mile       or    so     for       a    drink.

At    this        time     the    mood        of    the       fans        was       very    cheerful          and       jokes were

being        made    from        al l    quarters.                 During           the    next       four    hours          the

following           events        I remember              took        pla c e        but    not       necessarily             in

chronological                 order.

There        was    ticket        touts        standing             on L e p p i n g s       Lane       between Vere                 Road

and    Fielding            Road      and      reports          ^ere        circulating                back    to       us    t hat

tickets           were     changing           hands       for       between           thirty          and    fifty          pounds.

Inspectors           and       ranks         above       were       in a b u n d a n c e         outside          the       ground       early

on    but     as    th e      strength         of    people           increased             senior          officers          were       in

less     abundance             than      b e f o r e . ? Sgt.             Mpzley          attended          several          times^Jo

check        if we       had             problem          and       remained              with    us    a few minutes' each

time.         Also       an    Inspector            of    whom        I have          never       seen       before          came       to o u r

barrie'rs          several        times,       early          on    bui     never          introduced             himself          or    spoke

Fans     were       arriving            u p Lej^pings L a n e               (Liverpool                fans)       and were

carrying           bottles        and        cans    of       beer        and       lager.        Several          by       this     t ime

were     the       worse       for      drink       a n d at        one     point          two    fans       of    about       EQ years

were     asleep          on    the      pavement          in L e p p i n g s          Lane       opposite          Fielding             Road

and    were        in a s t a t e        that       I could           only          call    drunk       and       i n c a p a b 1e .

As    time        progressed more                  and more           fans a r r i v e d          and many wfre                very

boisterious,               throwing           food       and       litter a r o u n d            as    well       as    swearing and

chanting.

Fans     were       turning          up* w i t h o u t        tickets           and       were    asking          other       fans       if

they     had       spare       tickets.             This       at     the       time       sounded          like       'Spurs*          a n d we

about       2    hours.

By    1.3Dpfri ( 1 3 3 0 )             there          were        hoards        of    people          on L e p p i n g s       Lane    and

many       asking           for      toilets           as        there       was     already          massive           queues       forming

outside          the        turnstiles                on L ep p in gs          Lane.

At    about          2.10pm          (1410)           I remarked              to P C       Patterson              that    the    train

carrying             Liverpool              supporters                 was    just       pulling         i nto      Wadsley          Bridge

Railway          Station.                  Traffic           was       using       Leppings           Lane        and    fans    were

walking          in a m o n g s t           the       traffic           because          of     their       sheer        numbers       they

couldn't             possibly              keep       to     the       pavements.

Club       Stewards              from       Sheffield              Wednesday             persistently               tried       to    park

their       cars           in F i e l d i n g         Road,        which       by     now was          already           full    with

residents             c a rs.          At    one           point       I was       told       by a C l u b         Steward       to    ’F u c k

Off*       for       not        allowing          him        tc/""park.         .The       general          behaviour           from    the

stewards             was        poor       and    I would              have     expected          better           from    them       towards

us.        If    they           treat       us a s          they       did what          would        they        treat    the       fans

like.           Many        used an          excuse              that    their        boss       had     given          them    permission

to    park, w h e r e            they w anted                and were          not       slow     to     drop       names       of    certain

Inspectors                 in    the       force.            However          they       left     and       found        suitable

The    time          by     now was          about           2.20pm          (1 4 20 )     and    we     had       dealt       with a ^ o t

of    people          who        were       not       very amused wi t h                   both       the        Police    and       stewards

at    the       turnstiles.                  Many           Liverpool          and       Nottingham               Forest       fans    showed

us    tickets             and were           generally                 convinced           that       they        had    gone    to    the

wrong       entrances.                     Many,       and        I would          say     to    be    conservative,                 about    500

people          stating            that      they           had    tickets           for      seats      in t h e        North       stand and

because          of        the     prefix         letters              before        their       seat       numbers,           had    been

told       that       they         had      to    go        into       the    football           ground           via    the    turnstiles

to    get    in.

By    about          2.45pm          <14 4 5 )           the           crowds          were      so     immense       outside             the

turnstiles                in L e p p i n g s             Lane           that          I remarked             to PC    Patterson                that     no

People       were          pushing          that                  much       that        people         were       retreating             back       towards

sell    their             tickets.              Police                  horses           were       in a t t e n d a n c e      and       seemed        to

be    having          little          effect                     in    controlling               the     crowds.

Fans    were          climbing             over                  fences          and     walls         but    I couldn't             say       whether

it    was    to       avoid          being           crushed                 or       because          they    had    no       tickets.

On    entry          towards          the       ground                  several              fans      from Liverpool                had       obtained

Nottingham                Forest          scarves                     and    hats        were       kicking         and    throwing             them       down

Some    fans          came       out       of    the          ground           and       remarked          that       a   pitch           invasion

was    in       progress.              These             were          Notts.           Forest        supporters.               Over        t he      n ext

to    ask       them       questions             as          to    what         had happened.                    We    got      the i m p r e s s i o n

that    there             was        trouble         within                 the g r o u n d a n d         a message            had    b e e n sent

quickly          that          there       was       a       distinct              smell       of     burning         clutches             from       the

cars.           I looked             back       up       the       road        to       see   my      colleague           Graham           Patterson

and    several             other         officers                 waiting           around.

I    returned             back        to    the      barrier                 at the       top       of F i e l d i n g      Road      with

Leppings          Lane          and    asked             Graham              if he      knew w hat was                going      on.

Naturally             he       d i d n ’t have               much       of     an       idea.

was    terrible                and    these were                   people           dead,       but       she     d i d n ’t f i l l        in a n y

I really              felt     threatened.                 We       were       alone,          no    radios        to      call    for       h e lp,

to    keep        Leppings           Lane       open       for       the       emergency             services.              While       I moved

the     barriers             out     the      Liverpool              fans          did    nothing          to h e l p       only       jostled

and     insulted             us     as    well     as      push          the       sergeant          away.

During           this       barage        a woman          ran a c r o s s           the       road     from Shentall                  Road       and

said        to    us    that        a man       had     collapsed                  in her       house.           I m m e d i a t e l y PC

Patterson              a n d fhyself a t t e n d e d                at             Bhentall          Road     to      find     a man

having           an    epileptic            fi-t! in her             house.              I remembered my                   first       aid       and

put     the       man       in a     recovery           position               while          I tried       in     vain      to    ring          for

an    ambulance.                  Eventually            I got            through          and       about     20      minutes          later        an

ambulance              attended           and     took      th e m a n             who    I only        k n o w as

from        Halifax          away        to H o s p i t a l         who       was    still          in d e e p     shock.          He       had

rung        home       to    say     he     was    fine         and       after          ringing        off      went       into       an

epileptic              fit .        I obtained a                telephone                number       from       him and          said       I

would        try       and       ring     home     for      him.

We    then        went       back        onto     Leppings               Lane       to    find       our    serial          and    enquire

what        we    could        do,       if a n y t h i n g .            We    came       across        Sergeant            Mozley          and
                                                                                    PAGE
                                                                                    R220


informed him that we had some property which was handed to us

pe rs onally    in the day to hand to central            control.

We then went      into the ground still not aware of what had occurred.

Pr operty was handed to a sergeant             and we then looked for a

telephone.       I remember looking through the passageways              under the

North    stand and seeing debris scattered on the floor.

I proceeded      towards    the gymnasium in order to find a phone and once

inside    I was met by a mass of people           standing around.       As I walked

through I was      aware of bags of clothes and directly behind I saw one

body on the floor apparently being searched.                  Curiosity got the better

of me and I noticed rows of dead bodies with no real outside

injuries.       I wasn't aware       that   they were dead at this time.       I just

remember    feeling numb.          I eventually   found a phone and tried to get

an outside      line    to no avail.    As I hung the phone up a policewoman in

the police      room went hysterical        and I knew something was wrong but

what    I didn't know.      I proceeded with PC Patterson to Claywheels Lane

where    I awaited the rest of our           serial.    Eventually retiring from

duty at 6.45pm         (1845).    On my way back to the car I remembered seeing

  h eli copter hovering over the ground.               Once alone   in my car and

travelling back home I remember              listening to Radio Hallam.       My mind

is blank    from thereon         till I arrived at Barnsley District Hospital.

Not aware      how I got there. ___________________________________________

Ihe serial was           identified in the order as             Being   under Sub Sector b ,

-ana 1 was      responsible              to Inspectors Purdy and Sykes,        whom 1 reported

to on arrival al the ground.

At   10.00 am a briefing was conducted                     in the North Stand by Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield, S u p t . Murray and Insp. Beal.                          At the

conclusion of this,              arrangements were made with Inspectors Sykes ana

Purdy for a. briefing of 'the serials,                     at the Leppings Lane end, at

1    am     at t,he r e a r     of       the West Stand.

Ihe serial -.-was then provided with a snack meal and a drink and I

collected a personal                 radio ana earpiece.        Tne   radio was checked and

w a s in wo rk i n g o r d e r .

At   1   "i.LiD am all    tne    serial want         to trie rear of the west Stanc where

insp.      Sykes briefed         the serials         as to their specific duties ana           the

security of- persons             entering the g r o u n d .     1   advised officers as        to

of drunks. 7 ; -

Following tTtis briefing the majority of the serial                        remained at the

rear of the West Stand as no turnstiles appeared to be open -for the

North Stand.   However a short while later 1 would say approximately
      «
V1.20--23 one turnstile opened so 2 officers were deployed to that

one.       There being quite a number of officers outside the ground at

this time and very few fans.

Around 11.45 ant all             the turnstiles for the Nortn Stand opened so the

whole serial was deployed outside on the turnstiles.                           2 Officers to

each ana the           remaining         2   and myself   initially stood in the triangular

area formed by the turnstiles wall,                       the adjacent shop,    ana the

perimeter fence,              the gates of which were opened and. pinned back.

At this time there were only a few supporters arriving at a I i m e , and

officers wree sometimes                      under employed with searching.      As   is normal

2 or 3 officers were deployed together with the coach reception teams
  on Leppings Lane             itself,          I abelieve

  Durmq        this eariy period I made arrangements                             for black dustbin bags

  to be firought to collect                  items seised or disposed of by fans enterino

  the grourrn.            Normally quite a number of fans are                         in possession of

  cans of soft             drinks on entering               the ground,       these are not               permitted

  in the ground.             They are given the opportunity to drink or dispose of

  twe cans.             Also where fans have cans of alcohol                       the same applies

 except       they are informed to dispose not drink them.

 A snort while after, we had obtained the bags and labels for property

 between 4 turnstiles                for the same use as the baas,

   n ^ L i ci.i j.y ^    j. h ave   s taste cl t h e r e   were? v e r y   few    fans   a f r ■v f>ri fr s-is

Liverpool and the officers were able to make searches                                          of virtually

every p e r s o n arriving at the turnstiles without                               causing any delays on

entering.           O-rGfrr-ty queues were formed but they amounted to perhaps 6

° r 6 st one -or two turnstiles,                      all    the entrances were not used by the

fans at this time.

During       this early period there were no great                           problems with the fans

oi    L«eir behaviour.,              fhe majority consisted of middle aged and family

yroups,        there were       light hearted exchanges with them,

*" * om           early stage a problem started to arise which                                 later on grew

quite      consi.oer.ably.          The North Stand was. reserved for Liverpool

Supporters T-.wi t h. brown tickets and the turnstiles although numbered

were also         .bettered A also adjacent                 to the turnstiles wre plaques

brown     in colour about             15" x IE" at about head height.                          From this

period onwards numerous ticket holders                            came up to me confused as to

where     they should enter the ground.                        They did not appear to

understand the significance of the colour coding.                                     A further           cause of

confusion was the             layout of the actual                ticket.         Numerous       people asked
                                                                                         PAGE       4
                                                                                         R237

      for entrance X,Y,          M etc these being the gangway not the entrance,              but

      tne iayout of the ticket           is such that the gangway,           entrance and row

      etc were a 1 3. in the same size          print.     Further   confusion was also

      causea &y ticket noiaers not knowing whi ch colour                 related to w m c h

      entrance,,       i.e. brown North S t a n d , Red West Stand,      Blue Leppings Lane

                         As a result an increasing number entered the area in

     front of stiles for the North Stand who wanted other areas of the

      g ro u n d .

     As time progressed the number of persons arriving at the ground

     steadily increased.            They were arriving on foot,        by coach and service

     bus.       initially they were searched and seen by the officers on coach

     reception and then came towards us,                 quite a number started to arrive

     as time progressed in possession of and smelling of alcohol,                     as a

--S=gS‘S3't^'5u ^t the dustbins at the s i d e turnstiles started to fill w i t h e m p t y

                   • cans of beer. I instructed about 4 or 5 personally to place

     part full         cans   in the bin.     I did however see other officers        engaged

     on both North ana west Stand turnstiles                 instruct fans to put cans arm

     bottles         into the bins.    As the numbers steadily increased the

     officers made more selective searcnes of persons entering.                      Orderly

     queues were formed and there were no great                p ro b 1ems   in respect of

     maintaining         them apart from the confusion over tickets,

     However         on about 3 or 4 occasions     I requested a mounted officer to

     sweep the area in front of the turnstiles                in respect of numerous

     groups of youths who arrived without tickets and those who had arrived

     and did not want to go in, or were waiting for friends with their

     tic k s t s .

     On occasions         there were about iou or 60 persons milling about and on

     one occasion upwards           of 100.    The youths without tickets were

     generally 'sB-ci4 age group and the ones              1 spoke with were generally

     in groups of 4 or 6 i n number.             Haunted officers then entered t m s

      area and cleared, these g roups -out of tne area ana away from the

      turnstiles.

      Ihis   continued from approximate iy 12 noon to 1 would estimate          1330      to

      i3Vj> with a steady flow of fans gradually increasing.

     At   ''i3bu hours PC. Wilson and PC Palfrey made £ sepsrate arrests         in

      respect of possession of cannabis.          the officers who had been engaged

     on coach reception were brought bae.k and continued with searching,

      ihe procedure       carried on for some    considerable time after the arrests

     tne numbers gradually increasing but we did not appear to be having

     any great      difficulties apart from those already mentioned with which

     j. thought we were         coping.   Once the turnstiles were fully manned and

     officers were engaged in searched and queue           control.   I adopted a

     position about         10— 15 feet m   front of them checking tickets and

     monitoring      those not making their way      into the ground and non ticket

■;-£'S^io3,.ders etc.

- - -i -fcar>not say exactly at what time it was. but 1 could estimate between

     2.20 and 2.30 pm the area in which I was working suddenly became

     deluged      in a large number of fans the whole environment seemed to

     change abruptly from having organised queues and turnstile entry to

     b e i n g* overwheiroed.     she whole mood seemed, to change and tn« make up

     o+   the    crowd changing from mixed ages and sexes to a predominantly

     male and younger ones.           Tne proportion of people under the   influence

     of alcohol      also   changed and increased,   at a conservative   estimate     1

     would say 30         had had a considerable amount to drink.      The numbers

     who were      confused and agitated of the tickets were considerable.            I

     was virtually inundated with enquiries at which entrance            they

     wantec.      This was adding to the congestion as those who were at the

     wrong      turnstiles were trying to get back out into Leppings Lane.            As

     the numbers        increased   I was gradually forced further away from the

     turnstiles      towards the perimeter gates and felt     completely   isolated

 form other           officers,    the only _of f i cers 1 coui.il see wore mounted on

 Leppings Lane           itself.     At one stage       I saw      officers engaged on West

 &l'a n ^ ^ur ns 1 1 1 es a11empt m g       to c 1o %e one        of the per :i.meter gates to

 ease the crush on tnose turnstiles,                    they managed           it once but had to

 open it again.

 the numbers of fans              seemed unending and it was virtually a river of

 tans flowing          towaras     the turnstiles.         At this     point     I saw a number of

youths haa c i imt-ed onto the metal                 partition between West Stand

 turnsliies and tne Leppings Lane terracing they were making their way

aiong the top of it and over the wall                      into the ground.          I would say

about      ten or      tw e n cy c iimesc o ve r as     £ could    see a t t his t i m e .   I

radioed control at             tnis time ana received a reply that they would see

wnat     tney could g o .          A short while      later    1 saw Inspector Bennett

     u -■u o n tu p o t 1 1 ie w a - I a s s is 1 1 n g m o re f a n s over.

As    tne numbers        increased the presence           inside the area between the

perimeter       fence and the turnstiles became                    immense. In fact at       one

stage together with some other supporters                          I feared we would be

crusned behind the             perirnter gate if it gave way,              this being because

it was      locked open with a pin on the floor and. a bar across the top.

ihe pressure was such               that tnis top bar was flexing and bending at

times ana we feared if it gave way ws would be crushed between the

gale on the fence.              The numbers of fans continued to rise and there

appeared no end to them               .   As I was talking to a fan regarding

tickets 1 felt a spray of what 1 thought was water ano a push from my

left.       ihe man at my side then said "You were lucky that                         can just

missed your head"              I saw that he, a man dressed              in a whits trench

coat was covered in a liquid.                  He then said something about they're

    through the crowd like a knife forcing a bow wave of pressure to the

    side,       1 would   estimate there were about 20 or 30 in the group ana

    they were      chanting and waving their arms            in the air.        1 could see

    that a fair        proportion had ctlms in their hands.              These were not the

    only ones with beer cans             I saw during this        period,   but due to the

    c.r u s n anci s he e r we ig ht o f numbe r s t he r e was    i x t t ie i co u i d qo a pa rt

    froiTi    try and calm the ones near me down,

    Ait hough 1 knew the re should be quite a number of officers around 1

    did during this period feel very isolated and at this time                         could see

    no one apart from 1ns p . Benett on the wall,                  some mounted officers          in

    the      crowd on Leppings Lane, S u p t . Marshall           on the bridge     parapet and



    to the s n o p .

    f'ly raai o at     this 'time seemed to be working?           but as often not and i

    could hear shouts to open gates but due to the noise and officers at

    one stage      trying to close the perimeter gate it is hard to say if it

    was them or the radio.          Shortly after that my earpiece became

    detached during the crush and I cannot               recollect any other

    t r an smissions.

    The situation was then as I have described and appeared to be getting

    worse with confusion over tickets,             fans pushing and shouting etc and

    1 was      literally at times fearful        of my life if I had fallen over.                    1

    was unable to make any headway            through the crowd to check to see                 if

    the officers        on the turnstiles were alright as 1 could not see or                     get

    to them from        where   I was.     The next thing that happened was that Gats

    « opened, whicn        is situated to the left of the N o rtn Stand

    turnstiles.         It was then as if someone had let the plug out,                  the

    pu shing a n d crushing      in t he area in f ro nt of thes e tu r ns t i1e s

    virtually a sated with large numbers surging through- that open gate and

    into the North Stand area.

It was at this point that PC £S?33 Wadsworth joined me and said that

they had had to climb through the turnstiles                                 for their safety.                The

crowd then eased off completely and the queues at the turnstiles

returned with                 an elderly gent who had been stood with me for safety

near the fence joining a queue ofafcout 20 at the right hand

turnstile and                 by 'this 1 1 n*e Gate A h ad cioseo again.                   i w o u i d say        it

only         remained open for 4 or 5 minutes                       at the most.

Shortly after the gate had closed ana the queues                                   reformed a number of

officers          ran from Leppings Lane and in through the turnstiles.                                       I

could hear nothing on my radio but heard one of them shout that there

ha d be e n a p it ch i n vasion a nci all avail a Lie a s s is t an ce wa s required

inside.           Together with PC Wadsworth and other officers                                1 entered the

tne back of the West Stand towards the corner with the South stand.

As we         ran past the tunnel              entrance to the terracing and in the area

at the back of the stand I can say that there appeared to be nothing

untoward and there was really quite a marked absence of people                                               in

this area.

As we went to the pitch via the rear of the Police Controi                                               1 gathered

We entered tne playing area from the South Stand and 1 am virtually

certain that the game had stopped at this time but                                    1 cannot be sure.

I looked across the Leppings Lane end and could see officers                                               stood on

the fencing gesticulating to the crowd to move over to the                                               left and

to move back.                Tne terracing area itself appeared f u l l .                          i went to

approximately       10 officers together and went to gate £ which was

open.       As we went to enter the gate I saw a young girl being           carried

over    cue head of the fans and towards the g a t e , tome then shouted thai

she was injured.           It was at this point that     I realised or started to

realise tnat something drastic was wrong.              When the girl had cleared I

entered i-'en E via gale E and we formed a cor'dors to push the fans back

ciway from     tne gate ana made our way towards tne railing fence

separating Pen d from 3.           As i reached the fencing ana looked over

into Pen 3 the       crowd seem to part and move back away from the front.

i cu u id ■-;■ f- see whciu 1 can only aescriDed as a huge        pi ie of bodies

stacked 4 or 3 deep in palces» laid on thefloor at the rear of the

perimeter wall.        They were as deep as the 2nd step up on the

terracing about hai f way along         1 could see a youth stuck out from the

bodies wno appeared to be t rapped by his legs with the bodies up as

far as his waist,          he was shouting frantically for help.

I remained in Pen d and PC 609 and 2913 climbed over into the central

pen 3 to render assistance as were other officers who had entered the

central     pen.    ‘ihose officers and some of the fans then passed the

injured and dead to myself and other officers and fans and we passed

them tut onto the field where further first aid could be given.                  I

cannot say now many were dead or injured but             I can recollect   passing

only d or 3 wno were         cons ci ous over and well   over B--1 U who were

eitner unconscious or dead.          As we 11 as by this route I saw people

being   carried towards the rear of the terracing and out onto the

pitch via gate 3.

When I first       looked into Pen 3 the only place 1 saw bodies or injured

persons was behind the pe r imete r wall ana in front of the broken crowd

barrier on the terracing.          I did not see any injured cn the floor or

 Cue Nasi o t-dtiii, again          initially the reason for it was not apparent,

 but      it soon became evident they were being used as makeshift

 s t,r e tchers.      1 then went into Hen 3 with othe r officers and he 1ped

 l-’dsi   these onto        ine pitch.       At this time           it was apparent that numbers

 ot    tne fans still         aid not realise what was happening as some must

 nave     thought we we re going to arrest those taning the hordinqs d o w n , s

 tiicy had to be           told forcibly by other fans what was happening.

j3&|L,thfen remained        in the pen and kept the fans away from the clothing

saggfe,-belong ins which were-piled at the front of the terracing.                                  At some

stage a Scenes of Crime Officer entered the pen in plain clothes and

started to photogrpah the scene.                      The     crowd went       literally wild and

surgeti 4 a rwards to get hold of                 h i m ,f rom what was shouted                I believe

    ta cn    serial    had their own responsi.Diiiti.es                 in addition to the main

    objectives of the day.

    At    ID. ID am myself and my serial had our first meal.

    At    11.10am I deployed my manpower                in Middlewood Rd from ninto Rd to

    Wads ley Lane.        Officers were deployed           in pairs as follows.                                         PC 2158

    Cran and PC 2862 Taylor were             responsible for the shop frontage which

    was     positioned     i n tne middle of Middlewood Rd for tne area I was

    responsible for.            PC 703 Thornton and PC 1698 Martin were positioned

    on the upper end of Miudlewood Rd to its junction with Mi nto Rd and

    PC 2993 Nugent and PC 1758 Winfield had r e s pons ib i 1 ity for the lower

    end     of Middlewood Rd upto its junction with Wads ley Lane.                                                   I doubled

    up with PC        469 Shaw and patroled the full                  length of                          the road.I

    doubled up        with tne officer due to being one man down onrny detail.

    Numerous Liverpool           fans had already started to arrive and it soon

    became apparent         that the busiest stretch of road would be Middlewood

    Rd frem Wadsley Lane to Catch Bar Lane.                      This stretch of road is

    preduiTii nent iy shops ana take away fast food premises.                                            There were a

    large amount of L i v e r p o o l    fans       in tnis area.

    As    I patroled along Miudlewood Rd large amounts of fans were

    arriving.         I was asked two main questions.                       In fact only                        two

    questions?        the second always         followed the          "1st.

    If the fans were walking the question was                       restricted to                           ’Where              can 3.

    didn't know the area.

  Wcra soon spread between fans as if by telepathy where both off

  licences ana public, houses were situated.

 we -art j.vfcu bdCK ai, tne local ion tne drunken fans had left tne area,

 i no oicea tnat the majority of the fans were the worse for drink and

 many were drunk and staggering.                      1 also noticed that very few people

 intoxicating drinks              including,        Carl's berg Special Brew,      Guinness,

at this junction.                About £. 15 pm I heard a radio transmission that

  there were a group of people a t trie pub 11 c house already for                  causing

  trouble.     Putu i c Order- vehicles were deployed.          I again made the

  comment that      it would be nice    if these fans caused any damage,              it

  would be to the pub.

  Many fans were standing about and         it became apparant        that they did

  not have tickets.        I was approached    dv    many youths asking       if I knew

  where     they could get some.       1 saw and heard many saying.           "Have you

  got any spares*        I also heard quite a       few people say    'Come    on w e ’II

  get   into the ground with the crowd they'll            let us in".     When 1 heard

  these     and similar    comments 1 remember thinking       5You've got      another

  thing     coming mate,   obviously you haven't been to Sheffield             b e f o r e ’.

 Up until 2.30pm pedestrian traffic going towards the ground had been

  light.     At 2.30pm as if by someone       pressing a button the situation

  had reversed.        Everybody now was heading for the ground.              Looking up

                         pedestrian traffic grew and grew.           At first the

        r.ie.nt was blocked but then half the road was covered with

. Liverpool    fans.     The vast majority of these people were the worse for

  drink.     Many still    carried four packs of beer and lager.              I couldn't

  imagine    how they were going to consume such quantities              before

  entering the ground,       particularly as many were unsteady on their

  feet.     I remember thinking quite naively          'This lot has no hope of

  getting    in,   in their condition'’.

    positioned myself       on the   corner of Wads lev Lane and Middlewood Rd

  so they would see a uniform presence as they came aown the hill.                         1

  looked to my rear towards Leppings Lane and I saw the                 road completely-

  blocked up with pedestrians.          I deployed PC Thornton to stop ail

  vehicular    traffic going down L e p p i n g s Lane ana senc it aii         cown

 Mi d d 1ew ood Rd.

 As the crowd continued to come down Wadisey L a ne              i had occasion to

    particular        1 spoke quite severely ic one youlr; who was holding an

opened caraf of red Canadian Wine about his language and behaviour

towards       two girls walking               in the opposite           direction,,      The

suggestions made were obscene and totally disgusting.                                    As he made
                              ■J

these     remarks he was holciing his                   penis ana shout 1ng          'Su c k    this you

fuck’ing whore !                   When I approached him ne immediate ly appologised to

me blaming the drink and saying he wouldn't do it again.                                        Remembering

fir Du ckenf ie 1ds comments he was severely warned but allowed to

continue.             I remember thinking how each person 1 spoke to about their

behaviour        suddenly became very ameanable                     obviously because they did

not want             to be arrested prior to the game starting.                       The drunken

pedestrians                 .continued and 1 even saw two youths               carrying a third with

his arms over their shoulders.                       He was being half walked                  and half

dragged.              I said to these youths                "There’s more     chance of a snowball

surviving        in.heli _than you nave of getting                      into the ground'.           One

As    I looked down Leppings Lane                     1 could see a large amount                of fans

congregating                near to the corner where            the turnstiles were.              It was

obvious       that- th.e...crowd sat on the wail opposite to the turnstiles did

not have ticket-s. . I saw each person asking for tickets go down to
            j
the ground and I heard one say words to the effect of ‘come on we'll

get    in*    I dieln't understand this because to me it was obvious no

At L.bi>pm tne pedestrian traffic was still heavy but                                 *t was mainly

confined to the pavement.                         I allowed PC Tnornton to stop point duty.

to delay the kick off by              IS mins -to   allow fans      to get into tne

or so away from the Control Room which i s situated at m e                          L.eppings

Lane End.

It soon became appa rant that there was some sort of trouble at the

turnstiles.          I thought of deploying some of my manpower to assist but

many fans were- still making their way to tne ground.                         tiue to their

condition II felt          it my duty to remain in my position "Co protect

About 3 . 10pm fans started to come out of the ground very upset and

very hostile    in particular to the Police,             We were sworn at and many

assisted them with this.                    I could see that a lot activity was going

on in pen         3.            I could see a PC kicking at the wire                     mesh to              force an

at a shallow snoie across tne pen.                           1 went     towards tne lower midciie

part of the        pen at the bottom corner                    closest to pen d. r 1 saw a mass

of boQies       strewn out on the floor many laid across other bodies.                                           1

could see that the colour -of' their faces were purple and there was no

signs of life.                  I examined many bodies trying to find one who was not

dead or who had some form of life.                           This was to no avail all appeared

dead all were             purple.

backside.         I did my best to pull them back up.                          I felt so sorry for

him as he couldn't have any dignity in death.                                This body was handed

     fans.     I feared for the safety of, trie PC's and other officers there.

     My feelings were that         of great sorrow.       Having examined so many

     bodies being unaole        to offer any life to them.        What a waste.     i

     would have     liked to have aone more but so would m a n y       others.          n^ve

     to accept that        x citi all   1 could under the circumstances     but 1 still

     feel    guilty because     1 was there w h e n 9 5   people died ana i car.no * say

     that    1 did not save a life personally.            I must recognise that by

     ensuring the      catagorised injured,     went to hospital     as soon as

T    passible      I may   have done such a thing or been part of a team to save

     After    the incident      occurred virtually no radio transmission were made

positions           at       turnstiles                   A       to G,       PC    1002      Wild       and myself              and      PC      1278

Lang     and       PC       3232       Burton             took          up    positions            at    turnstiles              A    and       B.

When     the       turnstiles                   opened             there          were      not    many       fans       outside           the

ground        and       prior          to       entering                the       ground      were       subject           to a       search          and

were     then       subject                to    a    further                search         once    inside          th e    ground.               Due       to

this     double             searching                of       fans            I anticipated               that there             would          be s o me

objections              or       adverse             comment                  regarding           this     but neit h e r            were

forthcoming                 at    this          time.

As    the     morning             progressed                      and        the     number        of    fans increased                   I saw

several        fans          attempt             to       gain          entry       to      the    ground           v i^   turnstilesA                    and

B,    only     to       be       told       by       the          turnstile           operator           that       they        were      at      the

wrong       turnstile.                     They       then           had      to    force         their       way    back        towards             the

o t h e r .t u r n s t i l e s         on       Leppings                Lane       e nd .     Around          1.00pm        (1300)          the

number        of    fans          outside             the          ground          had      greatly        increased             and      we      then

had    to     be    more          selective                   in o u r        searching.                Around       2 .30pm          (14,30>         a

few    fans        cimbed             the       perimeter                w a 11     and      were       stood       on     the       roof       of    the

turnstiles              A    to       G;    they were                   instructed            to    get       down and           were       ejected

from     the       ground             by    other             officers.

At    this     time          there          were          several             hundred         people          hanging           around          the

area     of    the          turnstiles                and          due       to    the      amount       of    fans        now       entering

the    ground           were          asked          to m o v e          from       that      area       to    allow        fans          in.

Several        people             who       had       entered                the    ground         complained              that       people          at

the    back        of       the       crowd          were          pushing          towards         th e      front,        and       that        the

Police        should             be    aware          of          this.

At    this     I    looked             through                the       turnstiles            towards          Leppings              Lane,

although           my       view       was       restricted                   I    could      see       officers           on    foot       and       on

horseback           who          appeared             to          be a t t e m p t i n g      to    control          the        surge       towards

the    turnstiles.

People        were          now       struggling                   to    enter        the     ground          and     in    fact          were       being
J|                                                                                                          R398


       pushed        into       the       wall        and       turnstile               entrance       itself.            Many       fans    were

 ■     now    complaining                 t hat       someone          would        be    injured,           and    all       officers           at

 ■     the    turnstiles              should           go       outside.            All    fans       were     informed           that

       officers           inside           had    a    task           to    perform        and       that    officers           outside

 ■     would    be    doing           everything                 possible           to    alleviate           the       problem.

       Around        2.40       pm     I saw          that        several          fans        had    again    climbed           the       outer

 ■     wall    and    were           on    top        of    the       turnstile           entrance           roof,       they     were

 ■     instructed          to        get      down.             This       they     flatly       refused           to    do.      I   saw        two

       youths        on    the       roof        showing           their          tickets        to P o l i c e      officers          they

 ■     were    again        instructed                 to       get    off        the    roof,       but    again        refused.

       By    now     many       fans        had       congregated                 around        the    turnstiles              and    several

 ■     officers       including                 myself           were       being        surrounded           by    fans       who     were

 ■     being    abusive              towards           us       because           they    had    been        subjected           to    the

       crush       outside           the      turnstiles.                    Fans        were    now    being        allowed          into       the

 ■     ground      without            the       ticket           stubs          being     torn       off     (this       I presumed              was

       to     allow       quicker           entry)          and        these       were        being    passed          to     fans    on    the

 ■     roof    who    in       turn        began           to    throw          them      over       the    wall        to    fans a w a i ti ng

Jjjj   entry.

       It    had     now       got     to     the      stage           where       searching           was    impossible              due    to

 ■     the    amount       of        f an s     congregating                    inside     the       turnstile           area     and

       together           with       several           other           officers           we    attempted          to     clear       the

 ■     many    fans        appeared              to    be       losing          their     tempers.

       I    formed        the    opinion              that before                too      long       a Police           officer would                 be

 I     physically          assaulted,                  and       due       to     the     fact       that    only        s e r i a l 14     was

       deployed           in    that        area,          had     an       officer        been       assaulted           then

 I     assistance              would        have       been       very          limited         and    the    situation              got    out

 ■     of    hand.        Thankfully                  this       did       not     occur.

       Whilst        speaking             with        several              fans    I was        approached           by      a man     who

everything                possible.              At       this        he l ef t       and       went         into th e         ground

without         formally               identifying               himself             to me.

Fans      were       still           congregating                rouno          the       area       inside         the       turnstiles                and

I made         several            request           for       them      to      move       away        to a l l o w       people          to       g et

fans      entering              the     ground.               I saw fans              climbing               over the          turnstile                and

entering         E        at     a     time      but      was       unable           to    prevent           t h is d u e      to    the       number

of      fans    around            the       turnstiles.                 These         people           just     disappeared                   into

the      crowd.

turnstile            G    suddenly            opened           and      fans         began        to    surge        into       the       ground,

several         officers               from      t he     serial           ran       towards           the    gate        and       I joined

them      in a n         effort         to    close           the     gate        (I w a s        of    the     opinion             that       the

gate      had    been           forced        open        by    fans)             but      this        was     impossible.

As      the    fans       surged            i nto    the       ground,            many         chanting         as    they          ran,       I

turneS         and       saw a         gap    in t he          centre           of    the        fans    and        people          moving          to

the      left    and        right.            People           were        screaming              and    shouting,              I went             to

that      area       with         other       officers              and      found         that        people        were       on       the       floor

having         tripped            or    been        pushed          over        in    the        rush    to     get       into       the

ground.          These            people         were         quickly           put       on     their       feet     and       moved          away

to      the    side       walls         away        from       th e     rush.             Not     one    person           complained                to

me      about    being            injured.

'i he    majority           of       the     fans        went       towards           tne        tunnel       leaaino           to       the

Eventually               th e     gates       were        cioseu,            some         fans' w e r e       still           coming          through

the      turnstiles               but      the      numbers           outside             were       greatly         reduced.

Most       of    the     fans       had       gone       into-the             stand        and    the       rear       was    almost

clear       with        just       a few          fans       milling          around.

invasion.               Access       to       the       pitch      was        gained        via       the       gate       leading        from

Some       officers           had    climbed             the       perimeter           fence          in a n         effort       to a s s i s t

people          over     the       fence.           I went          over        to    the       perimeter             fence       covering

against          the     perimeter                wail       and    fence,           I would          estimate             that    about           40

to    50    bodies           were    laid          up    against           the       wall       on,top          of    one    another.

still       breathing              but       it w a s        apparent           that       many were             dead.

attempting              to    get    inside             to    rescue          the     injured.

I    looked        towards          the       centre          north        enclosure             and     saw         that    part        of       the

perimeter             fence        had       been       pulled       away,           allowing          fans          greater       egress

onto       the     pitch.           I then          climbed          the        fence       of    the       centre          south

enclosure             and     began          to    sway       on    t he      fence        hoping        that         this    would           g iv e

way    and       afford        greater             entry       into        the       enclosure.                 The    fence       did        not

he    was    instructing                officers       to       form a       line        either       side        of       the    gate       to

allow       for    quicker          evacuation             of    the       injured and              dead.

I formed          one    of       the    lines       and    assisted          in     the       evacuation,                 handling

many    bodies          none       of    which       I can       describe.

A f t e r all      the       injured          and    dead       had b e e n       removed           from       the     enclosures

from    the       serial.

Several          fans    were       going       round and             shaking        officers             hands,           thanking

them    for       what       they       had    done.

angry and o th e r s o b v io u sly d is tr e s s e d by som ething.
                                     -4-
As I approached the gate in front of the turnstiles, a few paces behind
Inspector Hudson, I saw a LFC fan attack him and try to punch him.            Hudson
managed to restrain the youth who was upset and crying, I assisted him and
pulled the youth off and took him away from the scene.         During the struggle
I received an injury to my right foot; it was not serious and the bruise
only lasted a few days.        I tried to calm him down but he kept shouting
"There is fucking dead bodies in there".        I   released the youth   to the
custody of friends and returned to the main         gates.


I had NO personal      radio so I was unaware of the circumstances of the
incident however I assumed        there had been some sort of crush, perhaps a wall
collapse.    A mass of people were pouring out of the gates-at Leppings Lane.
Most of them did not know what had happened either and seemed mostly
concerned with the fact that they had hot gained entry or wished to know if

the. match was abandoned.


However quite a few of their number informed me that some supporters had
been crushed because of a massive surge or that a gate had been opened by
the police or stewards.        I was on my own now so I tried to move fans out of
the path of oncoming emergency vehicles; the progress of which they were
hampering.    I sensed that something very disasterous had happened from the
mood and tears of      fans.    I continued to try to clear the roadway but the             ^
mood of some fans      was very aggressive fuelled by the fact that they were
heavily under   the influence of intoxicants.       I was jostled and abused by
these drunken   fans and whilst attempting to move a large congregation from
the path of a fire engine, I was punched on         the right shoulder by an unknown
assailant and jeered and insulted by the rest of the group.         Some   still had
beer cans in their hands.


The situation had become potentially very violent with all the violence and
abuse apparently directed at the police.        I was still in the dark about the
incident or requirements as I was on my own without a personal radio.             After
the task of keeping fans off the road became fruitless and dangerous to my
personal safety, I looked further down Leppings Lane and saw my serial in
their transit   van.   PS 2207 Shaw saw me and got me back into the van.
Crowds of LFC   fansjeered and rocked the van as they passed.        Several      police
motorcyclists parked across from us became very vulnerable to attack by fans
and after a few close calls had to move on.         The fans shouted "Murderers        to

us and other officers as they walked by.


The Sgt in the van had a personal radio but the reception and communication
was very bad.    Inspector Robinson got out of the van to go to police control
i                                    *.    ■

                                               -5-
    to find out what assistance we could render or if our vehicle could be of
    any use.    We heard over a domestic pocket radio that fans had been killed.


    Inspector Robinson returned and stated that our van was needed as an
    ambulance and that we were needed to assist at the mortuary area, situated
    in the gym.    We left the driver with the van and walked through the extreme
    left hand gate at Leppings Lane and down along behind the North stand
    towards the g y m .


    I-'Was detailed by the Inspector to go to the gym to ask if any more numbers
    were needed inside.     Luckily a Sergeant on the door stated that there was
    enough help but asked that we keep fans looking for lost family/friends as
    well as sightseers away.     Our serial along with some men drafted in from
    Barnsley formed a cordon along a line between the corner of the North Stand
    and some outbuildings parallel to the stand.


    We allowed only stretchers bearing the dead and injured through as well as
    Police, nurses, doctors, ambulancemen and other officials.        Some fans
    carrying IPs were allowed to take them through.       Ambulances reversed up to
    our cordon and IPs were taken away.        Many fans approached our line in a very
    distressed state inquiring after lost party members.        Many became aggressive
    and violent at not being allowed to look through the dead and injured for
    them.    Again many of the most aggressive and violent fans had been drinking
    and still smelled heavily of intoxicants.        At one point I received a kick
    from a fan being refused access, to the back of my left knee.        He was
    removed after a struggle with sober friends and other officers.


    InspectorRobinson and PS Shaw then asked members of our serial to assist
    with a makeshift casualty desk.       I took details and descriptions of those
    missing from fans and asked them to return to their transport in case the
    missing person was looking for them.        Some were bussed down to Hammerton
    Road Police Station to give info to the Casualty Bureau.


    At about 1800 hours, serial 49 was asked to return to their van at
    Claywheels Lane, pending further assignment.       Reunited with the van, we had
    to attend several times at the Northern General Hospital to deal with fans
    fighting with pressmen.     Other Officers were present at the scene and we
    acted as back up.     We were eventually stood down at 2000 hours.     I had a
    meal at Claywheels and went off duty at Ecclesfield Police Station at 2030

    hours.                                                     _________________________

Continuation o f statement of      ______________________________




At 1^50 hours I was present in Trinity Road when all the Norwich Supporters had

entered the ground and Trinity Road was clear of pedestrians. The mood of the Norwich

Supporters was jolly and co - operative. I then ordered two of the six Officers

posted to "K" Block to patrol Aston Park and with the other k Officers I coved from

"K" Bloc k to "l"_Block, Where a request had been made for core Mounted Officers to

assist with the queue due to a large amount of Everton Supporters who had just arrived

at the turnstiles at "L" Block. Upon arrival at "L" Block I four.d that all 10

turnstiles were being used and there was a queue some 6 0 yards in both directions

from the turnstiles along witton Lane. At 1500 hours when the Kick Off commenced

the crowd outside "L" Block surged towards the turnstiles and I ordered a wedge of

horses to be put into the crowd to relieve the pressure on the turnstiles and avoid

any injury to any person in the queue. Many of the supporters at "L" Block had been

drinking and the smell of alcohol in the a.ir from the crowd was strong. The Everton

Supporters at "L" Block were unco — operative but they all gained access to the

ground by 1 5 1 5 hours. I then made my way along Litton Lane to S&S Block turnstiles

and saw that the last of the Lverton Supporters were just gaining access to the

ground by kc.-S turnstiles, at this time it was about 1 5 2 0 hours. Upon my arrival *t

"3L-S" Block I was informed by the Mounted Officer in Charge at the turnstile, Folice

Sergent             ;hat the Lverton Supporters who gained access at "BaS" turnstile had all

arrived in the 20 minutes before 1 5 0 0 hours.

PART II OF THE FO OTBALL S PE CT AT OR S A C T 1989                              r
I wo ul d be grateful to k n o w what your p r es en t thdughts are on the •
i m p l e m e n t at i o n date for the restriction o r d e r ^ p r o vi si on s in Part II
of the Football Specta to rs A ct 1989. The joint paper w hi ch Douglas
Hurd and I put to H C o m mi tt ee last Se ptember gave a target date for
com pl e t i n g the ar ra ng e m e n t s for the i m p l em en ta ti on of Part II of
"early in the N e w Y e a r". I do not think that your D ep ar tm en t - or
this one - has been so specific in public but, in the. contex t of our
p r e p a r a t i on s for the W or ld Cup Finals in Italy-in June and July, it ,
w o u l d be highly, d es ira bl e for Part II to be in place in good time
for it to b e g i n to have an effect before the end of the domestic
season in .early May“                    ~~                         ----- — —
                                                                    ;

You will be aware that we are d ev ot in g co ns ide rab le effort to
p r e p ar in g for the p o s s i b i l i t y of h o o l i g a n i s m among Br iti sh and
E ng li sh supporters in particular,, at the W o r l d Cup Finals. C olin
Mo y n i h a n had exte nsi ve me et i n gs in Italy last mo nt h and will be
v i s i t i n g Sa rdi nia before the finals. Of fi cia ls of our two
Departments, together with the Forei gn Office, the Sc ot ti sh Office,
the pol ice and .the football authorities, are pu rs u i n g all the
p r e c a u t i o n a r y a r ra ng em en ts that can be taken both here and in Italy,
to reduce the risk of trouble. Of course, we cannot prevent
disorder, e s p e c i a l l y among those who de c i d e . t o go to Italy without
tickets, but I think it is essential that we do e ve ry th in g we can by
w a y of p r e p a r a t i o n and p r e c a u t i o n in advance - and are seen to have
done so..

That is w h y I felt that I should write to you about Part II of the
Act, n o t w i t h s t a n d i n g that it is your re sp on s i b i l i t y rather than
mine. I u n d e r s t a n d that your officials have had helpful pr el im in ar y
dis c u s s i o n s with the Italians about the id en ti f i c at io n of
"co rr es p o n d i n g offences", under Part II. If those di s c u s s i o n s are
successful, it will certainly be helful that anyone convicted of a
c orresponding offence in Italy should face the p o s sibility that he
(or she) will be banned from attending subsequent matches abroad
(and should b e T i a b l e to a d i s c r e t ionary ban from matches in this
country~wiTeTT:Xire membership scheme is in place). But it is also very
important to the credibility of our efforts in p reparing for the
World Cup that restriction orders should be available to the courts
in dealing with offenders at matches in this country before the end
of the present season, so that the Act will prevent at least some
convicted hooligans from actually travelling to Italy.

I hope that it will be possible for you to bring Part II into force
s ig nificantly before the end of the s eason.

I am copying this letter to the Prime Minister,        G eo ffrey Howe,
Douglas Hurd, James MacKay and Malcolm Rifkind.

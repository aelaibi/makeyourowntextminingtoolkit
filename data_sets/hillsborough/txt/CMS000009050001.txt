            Dear

            Thank you for your recent letter to the Prime Minister which
            has been passed to this department in view of our
            responsibilities for the Safety of Sports Grounds Act.  I
            apologise for the delay in replying to you.

            Your view that all seated accommodation at football grounds
            will not solve the problems of crowd safety and control has
            been noted.  However, it is a view which the government does
            not share and which does not equate with the views expressed
            by Lord Justice Taylor in his Final Report on the Hillsborough
            Stadium disaster.   He recognised that there was no single
            solution to achieve total safety and cure all the problems of
            crowd control.  However, he was satisfied that seating does
            more to achieve these objectives than any other single
            measure.  Furthermore this is in line with the policies of
            both FIFA and UEFA.

            You also expressed your concern over the cost of introducing
            all seated accommodation at football league grounds,
            particularly those in the lower divisions.   However, the cost
            incurred by these clubs may not be quite so severe as it might
            initially seem.   As you may be aware the Chancellor announced
            in the recent Budget that the government would be reducing the
            pools betting tax,therefore making available
            £100 million to the football industry over the next five
            years.   The Football Trust expects to provide clubs with a
            further £75 million over the next ten years, in addition to
            almost £26 million provided each year by television and pools
            companies.   Consequently there is a considerable amount of
            inoney available to football clubs to make the necessary ground
            improvements.


                                                                      Yours sincerely

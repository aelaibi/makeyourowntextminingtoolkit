Thank vou for your letter of 23 December 1998 on behalf of your constituent,
            about the publication of material considered by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith
in the course of his scrutiny.

I am sorry that you were disappointed by my letter of 7 December 1998 indicating
that we were not placing the material in Liverpool Central Library.

In my statement to the House on 18 February announcing the outcome of the
scrutiny, I undertook to place in the House of Commons Library as much of the
evidence considered by the scrutiny as possible, including all the police statements.
This we have done and the material is available if Members wish to arrange for their
constituents to view it.

At the same time, in response to a request on their behalf, we provided copies of
the police statements to the Family Support Group. This was possible because
there was minimal additional work and cost involved in producing an extra set of
copies at that stage. Unfortunately, that is no longer the case and it would be
a large and costly exercise to copy all the material again. Also, following the
completion of the scrutiny, the police statements were returned to South Yorkshire
Police, whose property they remain. It would, therefore, be for the Chief Constable
in the first instance to consider whether to release the statements now that the
scrutiny which I established has ended.

I realise that)__________ yvould like to have access locally to the statements but we
have tried to be as helpful as possible by placing this material in the House of
Commons Library and providing a copy to the Family Support Group which, although
I recognise does not represent all the families, has been the main body representing
the families. I am sorry that I cannot be more helpful and I can only advise you to
arrange for your constituent to view the material in the Library of the House.

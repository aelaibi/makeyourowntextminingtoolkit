                  At 2 . 2 6      pm    (1426)      I a s s i s t e d PC C o l e y               to a r r e s t     a       m ale     in       possessio

                  two    cannabis          r e e fers.          This    y o u t h was            later      taken           to        the     charge

                  office.           I returned            via    the    rear            of of    the S o u t h S t a n d a n d         saw n u m e r o u

                 Liverpool             fans     congregating            outside            the     turnstiles            in L e p p i n g s    Lane,

                 m a n y wer e y o u n g         p er so ns      who    were            swearing        c o n t i n u a l l y an d   their          breath

                 smelled          strongly        of a l co ho l.          Many           of     these      were        the same persons              1

                 had e a r l i e r       s e e n on the a p p r o a c h e s               to     the     ground.

                 The     c rowd s u r g e d       towards         the     turnstile              p u s h i n g an d      shoving       an d

                            -\
refused       to    for m      up    in an orde r l y manner.

I saw s e v e r a l       young       boys       no more         than     14 y e a r s      of age       b e i n g crus h e d

against       the    turnstiles             at B and         actually           saw Insp.             Purdy     pick up a

lad and       pull       him    out.

The L i v e r p o o l     fans       still       pushed      forward         and      towards          a metal       shut t e r

gate.        They    w ere      repeatedly            told       to r e f r a i n     but       again    refused.            I

saw the       gate       bowing       and heard         a Superintendent                    shouting          to officers

to open       the    gates.           I considered               this     the    right          decision        as pers o n s

were    becoming          trapped.

The    gates       were     opened         and    there      was     a surge          forward          of n u m erous

Liverpool          fans,       many       of whom were            drunk     and       aggressive.               They      all

made    their       way     down      the    central         tunnel        into       the       terracing.

A few m i n u t e s       l ater      I heard         a message           on I t h i n k         a Tannoy          system

requesting          all     police         onto    the pitch.              I mad e         my    way    towa r d s     the

pitch    via       the    Police          control      room.         I was       about          to go onto          the

pitch    when       Insp.       S ykes      d i r e c t e d me      to    the    tunnel          on    the    L e p pings

Lane    terracing.

I arrived          about       3-05       pm (1505)         to    find PC        3217       Wadsworth           giving

first    aid       to a female.

Alongside          this     female         was    a male         aged     about       25 years,          I checked           him

for a p u l s e      and       c ould not         find a n y t h i n g ,        he    appeared          dead.

I then       assisted          PC W a d s w o r t h    wit h      the     female       before          going       into    the

rear    of    the    tunnel          with    other      off i c e r s .         I removed             a m ale      who was

obviously          dead     from      beneath         the    tu n n e l    having          been       dragged       there        by

supporters          and     as I did so I saw a t e e n a g e                        boy    laid       face     down

underneath          this       man.       The     youth      was     removed          by    other       officers          and

taken    to    outside          an exit.

I again       went       into       the    tunnel     and        assisted        other          officers        to remove

b odies,      all    m ale,         several       appeared          to be       dead.

Despite       c o n t i n u e d jyl^eas from m y s e l f             and     other         officers          for    the able
                                                                                                    PAGE
                                                                                                    R386

b od i e d fans      to make a clearance mos t                refused and       in fact jostled

police       o f f icers       carrying    bodies about.        Fans     were    contin u a l l y

s w e ar i n g   and dir e c t i n g abuse at my s e l f and         other      officers.

On     leaving     the     tunnel      I assisted       officers    to   form an emergency

ambulance         bay a n d to sort an e m e r g e n c y        priorty    list    of   casualties.

I saw a total            of ar o u n d 40     c a sualties     together    w i t h 8 or 9 dead

bodies      all    laid        on the mai n d r i v e w a y   leading    to the    directors        suite.

Throughout         the     entire      incident at       no stage    did   I hear any

i n st ru ct io ns     to officers         given    by any senior        officer.

         I was watching the program called "second tuesday".
                                    THE DISASTER AT HILLSBOROUGH
Following the camera down the tunnel,I thought to myself,you missed it.
■Roll the clock back a few years to before the " Football Hooligan " days and rethink the
scene,standing on the terrace,the crowd suddenly starts to surge.No fence,just a wall,a
small wall like the one that took the power surge at Hysel stands infront of them.Someone
steps over the wall and Police Officers start to restrain the crowd,then Bang.
The power surge that only checked itself because it jammed in the tunnel,would go straight
over- the top of them.;
I think it might be in the interests of all members of society to do a simple re-run with
just, the wall, the results might jshock you.
Every ground in the country has a wall,advertising hoarding around it.
How many other surge points await the public's Discovery?




                                              Yours sincerely

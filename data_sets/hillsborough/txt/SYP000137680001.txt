    .3rd Januwy 1991


    Dear Sir,
    O S: HB8DMBD mCOEgTS - UfolVIDtJAIi OUBBIBS

    We write further to our letter of the 19th December 1990 to provide you
    with a summary of outstanding queries which have been raised by families
    in connection with deceased individuals.
    In a number of instances, family members are seeking amendments or additions
    to the Vest Midlands Police Summaries.      We ere enclosing copies of the
    relevant documentation but for your ease 'of reference will summarise
    the amendments/additionb and queries below:-

    Amendments/Additions to Weet Midlands Police Summaries
    1- Christopher Edwards
        The Summary indicates that a number of named officers attempted to revive
        Christopher. The Edwards family would like more information as to what
        Christopher’s condition was when the various Officers attended him and
        also what time these attendances tcok place. The family would like the
        Summary emending to reflect these details and we enclose a copy of the
        specific question of the Edwards' for your consideration. It may be
        that the various Officer’s statments may provide the information the
        Edvards' desire.

    2. James Gary ABPlnall
       The Aspinall family are concerned about what happened in the time between
       James being identified on the pitch, ie. 15.27, and being certified dead
       at 15.45. Is there any other visual evidence which may account for the
       missing IS minutes and can the summary be amended to reflect to this. A
       copy of Mrs Aspinall’s letter of the 15/11/90 is enclosed for your
       information.
04/01 '91   09:36   FAX 0742 726247        MEDICO LGL CNTER                            @003




                                         -2-


   3. Jonathan Owens
      The Owens family would like the Summary amending to reflect that Jonathan
      together with hie friends i Peter Birckett and Michael Robertson* were in
      a snooker hall between 11.19 end 13.15 on the day of the tragedy. This
      information was contained in a statement given to the Vest Midlands Police
      by Hr Robertaon.
       The Owens family also dispute P.O. Parkes' account when Jonathan joined the
       crowd outside Leppings Lane at 2.40pm. Video evidence timed somewhere
       between 14.45 and 14.50 showed Jonathan and hie friends standing in
       Leppings Lane and making no attempt to join the crowd. Can this
       discrepancy be clarified *? y o u will note that in our letter of the
       19th December 1990 we requested that P.O. Farkes be called to give evidence
       and it was with this issue in mind that we made this request. A copy
       of Mr and Mrs Owens*letter dated the 15/10/90 enclosed for your information.

   4. Adam Edward Soearritt
      Adam1a father, Edward has been attempting for some time to discover what
      happened to Adam before he was sighted in front of the Spion Kop at 15.25.
      The Summary (paragraph 5) gives the impression that P.C. Harr&tt saw Adam
      pass between Pens 4 and 3 at around 15.05 and therefore, leaving some 20
      minutes unaccounted for. However* the release of P.C. Barrett’s statement
      statement show that in fact the sighting took place between 15.22 and IS.SO.

        Mr Spearritt would like the Summary amending to reflect these timings.
        He would also like to know if other sightings were made of Adam prior to
        P.C. Harratt1s other than the unconfirmed ones at 15*08 and 15.09*

    5. foillip John Steele
       The Summary indicates that Mr John Liam Soyle gave assistance to Phillip.
       The Steele family would like if possible to know what time this assistance
       was given and the Surasary added to accordingly. It maybe that the answer
       to their question is contained in Mr Boyle ',fl statement end we would
       respectfully ask that you consider releasing a copy to ourselves. We enelose
       a copy of Mrs Steele’s letter of 12/11/90 in this regard for your
       information.

    6. Paul Brian Murray
       The Summary is unclear as to when Sergeant David Fox came into contact
       with Paul, merely placing the time after some time after 15.05* Photograph
       Reference 5/32 timed at 15.32 shows Paul being carried on a temporary
       stretcher by» among others, Sergeant Pox. The Murray's are anxious to
       fill in the missing 25 minutes or so and perhaps you would kindly consider
       releasing Sergeant "ox's statement.
        We enclose a copy of Mr and Mrs Murray's undated letter which outlines
        their concerns and should be obliged if it would be possible for you to
        kindly consider the further’ questions contained therein.

    7. Sarah Louise Hicks
       The Hicks family are anxious to establish whether Sarah received attention
       between 14.50, when she was seen by Paul McCaffrey and 15.21 when she
       was helped through the perimeter fence by P.C. Marshall. We should be
       obliged if you would kindly consider releasing a copy of P.C. Marshall's
                    wMr.h mav deal with this aspect.   A copy of Mr Kicks' letter of

   8. Victoria Jane Hicks
      You may recall that in our letter of the isth December 1990 we requested
      that you kindly consider calling P»C. McGuinness end Mr Paul Taylor*
      We enclose for your consideration a copy of a letter dated 13/11/90
      which provides further details of Mr Taylor’s account of his contacts
      Vith Victoria. Mr Taylor's account of cuddling Victoria conflicts with P.C.
      McGuinneee* account of removing her f m a pile of bodies on the
      terracing and the Hicks family would like this clarifying if possible.



   Further outstanding Queries
   1. John Alfred Anderson
       The Anderson fanily ere anxious to have clarified at the Inquest that
       their ski 's consumption of a quantity of alcohol prior to the game 1
       did not contribute in any way to his death. We enclose a copy of
       Mr Anderson's undated letter to ourselves in this regard for your
       consideration.
   2.,   Colin Mark Ashcroft
         The Ashcroft family are not content with the position of Colin on the
         terraces as identified end would like if possible to view the video
         footage again. A copy of their letter dated IS/11/90 is enclosed.

   3. Nicholas Peter Jbynes
      The Summary indicated that Nicholas was attended upon by a young doctor
      from Liverpool, this doctor has not been identified up to the completion
      of the Summary. Mrs Joynes would very much like to meet this individual
      and wishes to know if he/she has been identified. A copy of Mrs Jaynes'
      letter of 12/11/90 is enclosed.

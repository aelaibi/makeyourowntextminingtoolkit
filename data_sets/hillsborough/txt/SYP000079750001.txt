           I travelled to the gan\e with my cousins                               and              they

           live at                                                               We travelled to

           by car      We only stopped for petrol on the way,                       There were no delays

          We arrived in Sheffield at about                     13.30 hours      (1330)   We parked in a

           side    road about       10 minutes walk away from the ground.                 On the way to

          the ground there were Police Officers directing traffic.

           I saw a Few fans drinking from cans of beer in the street.

          When we arrived at the ground we looked for someone to buy a ticket.
                                                                                               PAGE    2
                                                                                               S2401

           We found someone quite quickly and bought our tickets.                    We then went

           and got some chinos. We did not see anyone fighting or drunkeness.
                            \a                           -+ S & Z T / s - f t T
           We got to the turnstiles tckgo in at about\140Q hours (14Q0) . There

           were    police officers outside aYtd inside the gr o u n d .          I was searched

           before       I went through the turnstiles and again after I had gone

           through.        There were no queues at the turnst il e s.         There were some

           stewards about by the turnstiles.                I handed my ticket    in as I went

           through the turnstile.             I did not see any gates open other than the

           turnstiles.     I did not see\any jne getting into the ground illegally.

           Once    inside the ground I did not see any signs saying where to go.  My

           coushiri had been before and he knew where to go so we went straight
                   \      M t.
           down the t un ne l. There was not many people about and we had no

           problems getting through the tunnel.                There were no stewards and

           Police officers by the tunnel.               There was no disorder     in the ground at

           this time.        There was no one drinking either.

           near    it

           We took up our match viewing               position at aboVt   1405 hrs   <1403).     At

           this time there was         plenty of room.        I was stood with my cousins at

           this t4-Qje.      There were no di st'Cwrbances or anything        like that at this

           time.        F ron'iHASQ hours    (1430)   onwaNds the pen was getting very full

           and at about        144$> hrs    (1445)    it was quite crushed.    From then on the

           crush just got worse and worse.               I w^hs separated from my cousins.

           There wSsre surges every so often.              At abdtit 14.53 hrs    (1435)   there was

           a big su rge vf orw ard .        I expected to go back but did not and I was very

           crushed.        There was a kid about         15 to 16 years next to me who had gone

           down he was nearly on the floor he was blue               in the face.      He had

           short mousey brown straight hair.               He was solidly build with chubby

made two journeys to the other end of the ground with injured fans.                          I

did see a number of people on the pitch that were obviously dead.                       We

then found           and de c ided to 1eave the g round and phone h o m e .        It

was about      16.30 hrs   (1630)     then.    We then went back into the ground

to see if we could do anything.               We then went back to the car to go

home.       I did not witness anything that         I consider was a factor     in the

deaths or injuries to anyone.               I did not see anything 1 consider to be

a criminal offence.

I think that once pens 3 and 4 were full              the tunnel should have been

blocked off and the fans directed around the outsides and into the

outer    pens.

            Further to my statement dated 13th June                    1989(130689),       I

            add that today.          have been shown various Photographs                   by POL

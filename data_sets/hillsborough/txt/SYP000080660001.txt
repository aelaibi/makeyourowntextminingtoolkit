            by transit van to Hillsborough Football Stadium for briefing                 regarding

            the FA Cup semi-final       between Nottingham Forrest and Liverpool.

           At 11.15am (1/115)      in company with POL PC 1 7/ WE Lp fl , I was deployed on

           Penistone R<f at its junction with Lepping4 Ln adjacent to the Swan

           Shell Petrol Stn.        This    location is at the roundabout at the end of

           Leppings Ln, walking away from the stadium towards Wadsley Bridge,

           Our duty was to assist supporters and direct them to their partici^tar

           gnd of the ground.
                                                                           PAGE     2
                                                                           S2492

’ To begin with, a steady trickle of fans walked past us and from the

 outset fans were enquiring with other fans           if they had any tickets

 spare.     The fans that were asking for tickets appeared to be mainly

 Liverpool    supporters.

 We were constantly asked,       once again mainly by Liverpool      supporters,

 directions to local       public houses.

 As the number of fans began to increase,         I saw more and more fans with

 cans of beer and lager.

 Whilst standing     close to an Officer who was in possession of a radio,

 I heard a transmission to the effect that a pub that had been used by

 Liverpool    supporters    had been wrecked,   but this I cannot    confirm.

 I saw some fans, more than once, walking up and down,            obviously not

 wanting to get into the ground early.

 As the kick off time ofr 3 . 0 0 pm (1500) approached,      the build up of fans

 increased considerably.        The fans that I saw were mainly Liverpool

 supporters,    as most of the Nottingham Forrest supporters were

 alighting from buses and coaches at a nearby bus depot and were

 directed to the ground on a route that would bypass my location,

 although there were a few Nottingham Forrest supporters.

 During the last 30 minutes before kick off,          the number of Liverpool

 supporters going down Leppings Ln increased at what I would say was an

 alarming    rate.   I have performed duty at football matches on Leppings

 Ln on a number of occasions and I have never seen so many supporters

 walking down Leppings Ln to go to the football match.            There was a

 very large and constant stream of supporters which seemed to stretch

 as far as the eye could see and I remember thinking to myself and

 commenting to POL PC WE L CH, the Officers at the Leppings Ln turnstiles

 were going to have their work cut out containing and controlling the

 number of fans that were       pouring   into that   location.

 At approximately 3.00pm       (1500) we were   instructed via a radio message
                      s                                                  PAGE       3
                                      y                                  S2492

to attend at the Leppings L/t^turnstiles area.          We went/down as a

Serial with POL PS ASHTQM in charge and on arrival,4t the Leppings Ln

turnstile area we were       instructed to form a cordon across the entrance

in order to prevent supporters gaining access.

I was not in possession of a radio and did not know what had happened

inside the ground, although it was obvious some sort of crowd disorder

or crowd problem had occurred.         We were just   instructed to stop people

entering the ground for the time being.

The supporters outside with tickets were obviously very angry about

this.

After a short while,       we were   informed that an ambulance would be

attending to convey some       injured people out of the ground.       A short

time    later the ambulance arrived a nd was allowed through a large gate.

A short time after that some Liverpool          supporters began walking from

inside the Leppings Ln end and seemed to be very upset and very angry.

They were saying things to us to the effect,          "WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE,

YOU SHOULD BE INSIDE.        THERE ARE BODIES IN THERE."

A short time later,       it appeared that we had received a message,

although I did not hear       it, that we should attend inside the gr o u n d ,

entering by the Leppings Ln end.          As we walked through the gate,       on

the right hand side and into what I would call the open area behind

the West Stand,    I saw an ambulance and ambulancemen treating someone

inside the ambulance.        At the side of the ambulance      I saw a man laid

on the floor,    his body was blue,       no one was attending to him.    It

became obvious that this man was dead.

We carried on walking and into the open space behind the West Stand.

There were    people all    over the place.     Liverpool   supporters were very

angry indeed,    they were shouting abuse at us and there were several

       es lying on the ground.

 e mavde our way past these and into the central tunnel which runs              into
                                                                           PAGE       4
                                                                           S2492

the terracing on the West S t a n d .   Once I came out of the tunnel and

stepped on to the terracing      I could see large numbers of fans on the

pi t ch and the noise was deafening.

I then looked down the terracing towards the bottom w here the fencing

was and saw bodies,    some of which were laid on top of each o t h e r , in a

heap.     Police Officers and supporters were frantically removing bodies

and placing them on the pitch at the rear of the goal.

I immediately went on to the pitch and began assisting with the
kHM                                         ------------
removal of bodies.  After helping to remove several of these bodies,                  I

went back and got hold of another man whose skin               still   pink and

his body was warm.                                 ^Ar

I got this man to the pitch at the side of the goal and commenced

mouth to mouth resuscitation a nd cardiac massage.           While I was doing

this,   several   supporters shouted abuse towards me.

After a few minutes - I d o n ’t know how long - a fireman a ttended and

said he would take over as he had special         equipment,   ox yg en , etc.    I

left this man with the fireman and returned to help with more bodies.

All the time fans were shouting abuse towards Police Officers.               They

were obviously angry.

Police Officers and supporters were ripping the wire fencing down to

make removal of the bodies simpler and quicker.

After a while,    supporters were getting so angry I feared there may be

a major    crowd control   problem.   We were   instructed to form a cordon

across the centre of the pitch as it was feared rival supporters might

start fighting.

As more and more bodies were removed from the pitch,           the tension

seemed to ease and things returned to normal.            We were then directed

to our original    points on Penistone Rd a nd remained there until most

of the supporters had left the area.

We were then taken to Claywheels Ln and from there back to Division.

                in connection with the F.A. Cup Semi-Final.

                I have previously submitted my recollections           concerning the event of

                that day and now wish to clarify certain matters           concerning deceased

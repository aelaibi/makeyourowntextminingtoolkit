      Thank you for your letter of 7 June about your research project
      at football grounds.
      I recognise that there is a particular problem with litter around
      and in football grounds, and I commend the work TBG have been
      carrying out to research this problem.
      As you rightly point out, clubs will need to do more to tackle
      litter, particularly in the light of Lord Justice Taylor's
      report, and the possibililty of their grounds being designated as
      litter control areas by local authorities, once the provisions of
      the Environmental Protection Bill come into force.      I am sure
      that any advice TBG could give as to the best ways to approach
      litter control and prevention would be welcomed.     However, the
      level of financial support that the Football Association and the
      Football League continue to give TBG is a matter for them to
      decide.



                                                       4

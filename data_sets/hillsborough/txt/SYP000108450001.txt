              stadium,         a police       officer       halted the           traffic          and we were                i n f ormed

              that all         public       houses were          closed and that we                    could          park our        car      in

              the    ground       in good time.



              Af 1       parking my          £it\, we      saw    people        going       to an open                public: house.

              We also went            into thii^vpbbl i.c house,                 it was          crowded          but    there was             no

              On making          our way      to the       stadium,       1 noticed              that at          each junction,                 on
                                                                                                                    PAGE        2
                                                                                                                    R53

both sides           of the dual          carriageway,            there were         groups       of    b e t w e e n two

an d    ten Police          Officers.            There were          i n stances     of s t o p - s e a r c h a n d also

people        being a d v i s e d      that      bottles        etc,    would      not    be a l l o w e d    in

the     stadium.        Also at          intervals,           were     manned,      m a r k e d Police        vehicles

and dog        handlers.



We     reached L e p p i n g s       Lane       at about        14.30 hours         and    1 im m e d i a t e l y

noticed        large    numbers         of      people     in the       road.       This     g roup was        not

moving        towards
                                     \                                      \
                         the st&diurn as there were t w c K s e t s of large gates.
                                 \                         \                               rr)AiN                           ,
One     pair    of^j a t e s were open and these led to the left hand side an d

seat area.            The    gates we           needed     to    pass    t h r o u g h were a p p a r e n t l y       closed.



I then noti c e d a foot Po l i c e Offi c e r                       opening       these     gates,      at    intervals,

to a l l o w     people      to    pass        through.         After    a short         time,    a mounted

Officer        got    in front         of the         gate.



I couM         see    no foot O f f i c e r s          in the gate,          Leppings        Lane area.             There

were     no queues and the                s i t u a t i o n was      like    standing        on t e r r a c i n g

people        s t a nding    close       together,         shoulder         to shoulder.


                                      CAT                               _                        .            ..
I saw four m o u n t e d P o l i c e O f f i c e r s             in this area,            all    lie rsey s i d e .



The     feeling       of the       crowd at           t h i s\t ime was      one    of an urge n c y          to get

into     the ground,          it was about              "14 , g/j w ith only        ten m i n u t e s    to go

b efore       kick    off and        no a p p a r e n t    movement         towards       the stadium.


                                                          \             (h i                                 OAi ( J i i t j
At     this    time,    one of the m o u n t e d M e V s e y s i de Of f i c e r s               communicated              I
with     those a r o u n d        him that        the     gatrrN^^was to be d e l a y e d until               15.15

hours,        and that       there was           no    rush to get          in.     This     sett l e d the

crowd down and we                 sl o w l y    began     to move.

At    this t ime,       I. s a w a Supe r i n t e n d e n t V V n       f o ot,    edge      from    th e    gate

rear    of    the    crowd.




S h o r t l y after     the    horse at        the       gates m o v e d and theN j a t e s          opened.           The

                                          forward           This a rea was            very o v e r c r o w d e d and

there    were       still

up.     I saw m o u n t e d O f f i c e r s        lifting      c h i l d r e n out     of the      people       and

attempt       to edge       through.



I was,       at this      time,     c o ncerned          for my own safety and                became        aware

that    two     of my friends           had m o v e d      e l s e w h e r e , myself     and the          other

f r i e n d were     still     together.



I would       say    in my e x p e r i e n c e      of    similar      matches        that    it was        by far

the worst          'crush'     I had      been      in.     My f r i e n d s and        I had      previously

arranged        to meet       inside      the stadi umNi f we            became         separated,



Soon            assed thro u g h        the    gates and went            into      the    court yar d a rea

before       ttre t u r n s t i l e s .5^1    then heard a           roar     from      inside      the     stadium,

the    game     had o b v i o u s l y   started.           People      then      began    to shout          at   the

mounted       officers        as to why the              game   had not       b e e n _ d e l a y e d as    they had

said.        The    officers      could       not    explain.          I noti c e d      that      they were,          at

this    time,       underSincreasing               pressure      from    the      push of the            crowd.

There    were       no foot o H i c e r s          in front      of the       turnstiles.            The     crowd

was    pushing and shoving                increasingly           but    this      only    i n creased        the

pressure        on those       of us      close      to the      turnstiles.



My feeli n g s       now were       for my own safety and                   to    keep my feet a n d             to    try

                                                                                                                       R55

to get    to a turnstile.



As    I neared       the    turnstile,             I saw a Police             Officer        look        over    the wall

above    the     t u r n s t i l e s and was            looking    to    the        rear of the           crowd.       I

looked t          here      his    gaze                          ;d and       I saw the         same
                                       N    I
Superintendent             f rom befor                            on a wa 13. , near            to the          roadway.

I do    not    know what,          if anything,             was    said.



The Of f i c e              ppeared a n d           I then saw him              c                   "'          "'    again

and he then shou t e d             to the          crowd that        t h e side        exit was           now ope n a nd

for    people     to make         their way to this area,                       to    relieve        the      crush.



At this,       the    crowd       immediately             i n creased        its a c t i v i t y     to get          to this

gate.      I was      carried          s i d eways      off my feet.                I was    very        c o n c e r n e d at

this    time.        I was       not       in control       of where          I was        going.



I then found myself                at the m o u t h of the               end t u r n s t i l e       before          the    side

exit.      I had become            twisted          round so       X went           into    the tur n s t i l e

backwards.           I saw that             there was a railing a bout 3 feet                             high,       coming

from    the    corner       of    the wall          so s e p a r a t i n g    the     turnstiles            from      the

side    exit.



I held on to the male                      behind me,       as    I thou g h t        he was        going       to fall

over    this     railing and               pulled him       into     the t u r n s t i l e w i t h me.                The

s i t u a t i o n outside        was       very,    very fast,          very        confusing.\



I ha n d e d   the    correct          portion of tic ket               to t W        gat,eman an d e n t e r e d the

As    I have     been to         the       stad i u m    before,     as had two             of my        friends,          we

^     decided       to enter          the   side     t e r racing      as    the      tunne 1 a rea was           too

      c route*d and there              seemed      no way        through.          We e n t e r e d    this    terracing

      (the side          of the P o l i c e      look-out         room).         We    f ound a space          near      to the

      back    of the       terrace,         about     six yards           from     the    divid i n g       fence.       We

      were about          th i r t y y ards      from the         pitch area.            The    game    had been         in

      progress          for about        five minutes.

      I looked          toNthe     centre      of the       terrace,         behind       the    goal,' people           were

      obviously          being     crushed„         Pe o p l e were         climbing       over       the    front      fence.

      At first. Police O f f i c e r s a t t e m p t e d             to     push them          back    but    then      began

      to d i s c a r d their          h e l m e t s and    help     people       out.

      I looked          to the     pitch and         in front        of us,        a m i d d l e - a g e d male      was

      lying       on the     grass.         He was        blue    in the       face.       A group of          people         then

T here were       now      co n c e r t e d   efforts         by some Po l i c e         Officers         to help

people       out of the         terracing.



Although        the First         Aid     personnel           were    doing all          they      could,     there       was

Gr o u p s   of Police        Officers         then began to a r r i v e                and stand on the

pitch.        A group of a bout               100 stood          in the         penalty area.            This     was

also     filling        up wit h      injured        people,         in places          people were         rec e i v i n g

dead.        Another       person was          covered over w i t h a                 coat.



The    group a t t e n d i n g      to the male          near        the    stand,       and    the      people    in the

stand,       cheered as         the male        was     resuscitated.                However,         the   g roup went

quiet a ga i n and a g a i n            they    began to          resuscitate            him,      he was     then

removed        by stretcher.

 increasing        numbers        were        being     carried       off.



After\bout             of    cheering          from T><ie F orest S u p p o r t e r s ,         a small        group       of

L iv e r p o o 1 T a n s    ran t W ' a * r d s t h e m .           line    of P o l i c e O f f i c e r s   came     frorn

the    opposite        end and         pushed         them back.           T hese O f f i c e r s    r e m a i n e d at

the    h^NLf--way line.           The N o t t i n g h a m Fo r e s t S u p p o r t e r s      fell      quiet and

b egan    clapping          people       carrying         the   injured,



This     scene     remained.             As    the     pitch began to            clear,      an a n n o u n c e m e n t

from the Police              s t a t e d to      retain our          ticket      stubs and s h o r t l y        to

leave     the    stadium.



The    feeling all a r o u n d was                one     of shock,         upset     and    disbelief,

everybody        realised         that        people     had died.



P e r s o nally,     I was       upset,        s h o c k e d and numbed          by what       I had seen.            I

also     felt    d i sbelief        at    the act ions          of some P o l i c e         Officers.          I could

not    e x p l a i n to rny friends              as    to why they did nothing.



At    no time did           I see a Po l i c e Offi c e r             being a s saulted,              or u r i n a t e d

upon.       At   no time         did     I see any          person     remove        property        from any

person      on the         pitch.



X accept, that             people      travel         to matc h e s    without        tickets        but     in my

opinion       it- was       sheer weight              of people       that     caused the           crush outside.

I saw      plenty of         people       still        wit h their         tickets,      a friend          in my group

included,        at the        end of the             game.

              We    were         engaged         in    the     parking      and     uloading          of L i v e r p o o l         supporters

               position            outside        the     *Gate*        public      house.

              There         were       s t ill    a vast          number    of     supporters           and       the    majority          of w h o m

              were       Liverpool              supporters          walking        down     from Halifax                Road       towards       the

Due    to the mai n          of these       still    carrying and drinking                cans-; and bottle

of b e e r / l a g e r / c i d e r as    they were w a l k i n g        down this       road,    I was

e nga g e d   together w i t h other            officers         stopping all        supp o r t e r s    with

drink at       this       point and telling           them to finish           it here and there.

The    car    park wall         of the      ’G a t e ’ pub at       this    point was       literally

covered       in beer        cans       and bottles         that had been         left    behind.        No one

seemed to be             in a hurry       to get     to the        ground even th o u g h          it was well

past £ .30         pm    (1430)      by this    time.

A great       number        of these      s u pporters were            drunk at this        point       during

the day.

At £.43       pm    (1445)      there was a report               of a fight       taking     place       inside

the    ’'Gate*      pub.       I a t t e n d e d w i t h my    colleagues.          The back       doors       to

the    pub were          locked      but- had been opened              to a llow a few L i verpool              fan

inside.        An a r g u me nt       had o c c u r r e d w ith some        local    lads    but    it had

resolved       itself,.         The     landlord was a d v i s e d accordingly.                 The re were

f a n s s t ill     ins id & t h i s p ub at t h i s ti m e .

At 3.00       pm    (1500)      we      were    informed to clear           the     pub of s u pporters             in

case    of a recur r e n c e            of trouble.            The landlord was to           close for the

a f t e r rsoon a ny w a y .

was    told to make            its way to the ground.                   There w o u l d appear          to have

been    some       problem      in the ground         but      I did     not know what          it was.

There was          sounds      of a m bulances       outside        the ground.          I heard a report

that a ma n had had a heart attack,                           and a s s u m e d that was what            the

confusion,          no one      seemed to know what was                  happening.

We ente r e d the gr o u n d            from P e n i s t o n Road,       at the side        of the

gymnasium.              T here was an a m bu la n c e         s i t u a t e d at this    point and        laid

out    next    to this was            the body of a teenage                lad covered       in a blanket.

I received a report                   that      two      persons      had    been killed         by a crowd

crush.        At      this    point PC 2718 W a r d a n d myself were                         directed        by

Inspector            Town©rid to stop suppo r t e r s walk i n g                     from the H o p       to the exit

to    leave      the ground,             m a n y said they d i d n ’t want               children to see what

was    going         an,     I did not know what                  had h a p p e n e d -and tried to stop

these       people         from     passing.            E v e n t u a l l y more and more        kept     coming to

leave      the gr o u n d         to PC War d a n d my s e l f           had    no choice        but    to let them

At this        point        I w a l k e d up and. looked over                  the    crowd.       I c o u l d n ’t

believe what               I saw,        1 was      confused as to what was taking                        place.

There was a great                   deal     of a ct i v i t y    on the field.             There was a great

many       people      running             ar o u n d    on the field at          this end         of the      pitch. 1

could see oyer               a dozen         people         laid out        on the grass.         P e o p l e were

using       the a d v e rt is in g         boards as         s tr e t c h e r s and    carrying        these       people

off    the     field to the back                  of the N or t h Stand,               My serial        was    then

di r e c t e d to as s i s t w h e r e           possible.          I made my way to the                rear of the

N or th Stand,             a great       deal     of a ct i v i t y was        taking      place w i t h about

fifteen or tw e n t y               people       laid      out   on s t r e t c h e r s o b v i o u s l y dead.

I ran onto            the    pitch where            I a s si st ed      in s t r e t chering 3 persons                to

I still        did not know what                  had      caused this         tragedy       1kept     hearing

reports        that        fans    had     rushed        into    the ground at L e p p i n g s          Lane       end at

the    last minute            and the surge f or w a r d had                   crushed those           in front.

A Sergeant            told me to make a cordon across                           the    centre      line of the

pitch as        there was           the      fear of a crowd             invasion.          We were       stopping

people w a n d e r in g           from L e p p i n g s Lane         end to the S p i o n H o p end.

H u n dred s   of fans were               crying and screaming,                m any were       just    sat on the

grass a p p a r e n t l y     in a dase.

T a l k i n g w i t h other        o f f icers       It ried     to      find out what      had happened.

No one     seemed to know.                  All      Iknew was           that there wer e       up to twenty

persons        near    the    g y mn as iu m that          looked dead.

On the     pitch there was                 no d i re ct io n from s u p e r v i s o r y     officers       of what

we    should be doing.                I    had split        up from m a n y of my serial                in the

c o nfusion      .     T here was          no a n n o u n c e m e n t   on the    public address          system

for what        seemed an e t e r n it y w i t h             people      coming up shouting abuse

calling us m u rd er er s             and       it was all        our    fault.     What was       our    fault,   I

did not know a n d neither                      did a great m any other             officers       stood on the

centre     line.

Eventually           there was an a n n o u n c e m e n t           by K e n n y D a l g l i s h that    there was

a serious        incident          taking        place and        for the      hundreds     of fans       on the

pitch to d i s perse and                  co-operate w i t h the             police and give

assist a n c e .       At    this hundr e d s          on the       pitch     in front     of    the West Stand

b egan walk i n g          towards        the    terraces       and     clearing    the    pitch.        There was

match would           be abandoned.               There was         no d i r e c t i o n for us on the field

as    to what        had    eaused the           serious      incident.

At 4. SO pm          (1620)       on the        i n s t r uctions       of   Inspector Townenci we

centre     line.           We made        our way back          to C l a y w h e e l s Lane,     to the

Liverpo ol       coaches.           The     fans     that were also making                their way       back

there     s hou t e d and         called us          'Murdering Bastards,              it was all your

fault,     y o u ’ve got          your      overtime        in and y o u ’re killing            people."

Eve n th o u g h these            jibes were         being made          there was a .'lot of supporters

who    had from        the    ground        gone     to an off          licence and were          taking    cans

of beer        back    to the        coaches.

Whilst       we w e r e      outside           I saw a few              small            lads,       about       5 of     them,

climbing        over        the     turnstiles             roofs        to      get       into       the    g r o u n d , these          were

crowd moved           us all         o ver      to    p o s i t i o n No            1A    on the        grid       plan.

At    p o s i t i o n No     1A     is    the    last        time       I can            remember          all     of    us    b e ing

together.          At       t his    tirm? in our               g r o u p was            myself,       Giles        H U T T , Antony

At    this    time      position           1A    there          was    a     lot         of m o v e m e n t      in the        crowd

swaying       in all         directions              and     people          were         very       packed        together.

Antony OWEN           said        to me,        "Do       you want           to m o v e         down a bit,"              a n d we

started       moving         our     way       forwards,           as      we       did      t his t h e r e       was    a surge         from

behind and          quickly          we    ended          up    in a       p o s i t i o n at a b o u t            IB on the

attached        grid        plan.

At    this    tim e     I    fell        over     a n d so      did     somy'            other       p e o p l e a r o u n d me

someone       he 1 ped       me     up.        T h e r e was anott^er s u r g e                 forwards           and    backward^^

and    I ended        up     pinned        up w i t h m y          b ac k a g a i n s t           a crushbarrier                at   about

position        IB on the            grid       plan,           Im a n a g e d       to     p us h    the        man     in f r o n t     of

me a w a y    a n d as       I did        so    I managed             to     step          to   the     s Ade a w a y         f r o m the

barrier.           Just      as     I did       t h is t h e r e      was       a        huge     sy^rqe f r o m         behind and            I

     was    shot, f o r w a r d             to w i t h i n a b o u t             6 or S f eet              from    the      perimeter           fence,

     I cannot           say w h a t          time          thi^surge               occurred,             other      than     it was

     definitely after                       kick       off.

     After        this       time          there       were       a    number           of      other      pushes      forwards          and     I

     eventually              ended          up at          p o s i t i o n No y t C on the               grid     plan w i t h i n arms

t ail e n g t h    of    the          perimeter             fenc,e.

       t about          this          time       I heard a thud a nd                         people        screaming         and      from      behind

     me    to my        right          a    lot       of      people                  s hot      forwards         hitting        the     back      of      th

     people        who       were          already            pushed                  up a g a i n s t     the    fence.         When      I had           ti

     to    think        about          this,          when     I returned                  to    the     ground afterwards                 an4

     l o o k e d at      the          terraces,             I believe              the       thud      I h e a r d was       the jba r          er

     breaking           in       pen 3,          although             I di d       not       see    it     br eak.                          I

     When     I got          to        p o s i t i o n No         2,       I think           the g a m e   was     still         in      play. I

     was    on m y       own,              I don't k now where                        A n t o n y was      pushed     to.        As      I w a s at

     p o s i t i o n No          2    I had m y a r m s               up    protecting              my     chest.        I c o u l d n ’t m o v e

     in a n y      direction,                I was          being          severely             crushed mainly              by    backwards

     pressure.

     There        were       a       lot    of    p e o p l e a r o u n d me               screaming,            !,I c a n ’t b r e a t h , ” but

     no    one     I could             describe.               All         t hat      was       on m y m i n d at        that      time      was      to

     get    out     of       the       terraces.

     I eventually                    ended       up    pushed          right          up a g a i n s t      the     perimeter           fentfe, a n d

     it w a s      then          t hat      I noticed a                gate        in the          perimeter          fence       j u s ^ /lo my

     left.         I can             remember          a      couple                  of lads       screami/fg at a              policeman,

     It t o o k     a few minutes                      for     him         to    open        the    g a t / , about         2 or 3        people

With          difficulty             1 managed            to    get       out       through         the g a te       a n d as       I did      so

a     policewoman                grabbed           hold    of me          to    pull       me    out.

I c a n't           say what           t ime       I got       out    of       the       terraces.           Ica n't         remember

whether             the     game       wa s    still       in p l a y          or    not
                                                                     At I-ljti LiC
I s a w a girl,                  her    n ame       was          ______________ |/ she                  w as     very       upset,       so    I

stopped             with     her       for     a while,          then a             po1iceman          came      up to me a n d           told

me     to      get    b ack       in the           terraces          and       he t r i e d      to    put me        into     pen 2 .          As

he w a s         doing       t his      I was        coughing             and       he    s t ill     wanted      me    to    go    back

o nt o        the    terraces.

Just          then    I saw                                and _______________                      they were          on the       pitch,

the      game        had     stopped           by    now and          I pulled away                   from     the     policeman and

run o ver            to     them.

There          were       people        ly i n g     all       over       the       place.          It was       only       then    that       I

realised             people          were      dyi n g .        I saw a             policeman          putting         his    coat       o ver      a

l a d ’s head.

I sat          down       on the        pitch        for a t ime               and a       policeman           came     o ver      and

h e l p e d me w i t h m y              breathing.

I saw                                then and         she       said       she       couldn't          find      her    brother          or    his
                                                                                                        /

couldn't.

After          this       I saw A n t o n y          a n d J a s o n w i t h Gile-^ a n d J a m e s                    on    the    pitch.

I went           o ver      to    them        to    see    if t h e y          had       seen any       of     the     other       lads,       but

they          h a d n ’t.

I lost           three       of m y         friends        in the          tragedy,             C hristop/ier D E V O N S IDE ,

disorder.               On    the     terraces             at a b o u t      2.55pm         (1455)          there       was    a ball          or

a    balloon        b e in g       knocked           through         the a i r        by    people,          it o n l y       lasted a

couple       of m i n u t e s         and       d i d n ’t s e e m      to    cau s e a n y           problems.

I never       saw anyone                  consuming           alcohol         inside            the    gro u n d .

1 was     not       i n j u r e d as        a    result        of my e x p e r i e n c e s            at     the     game.

Eventually              I left        the       ground        of m y      own accord,                 but    I d o n ’t k n o w          at

what    time.

There     ar e      a few          points        which        I consider              factors          in    causing          the    deaths

and    injuries,              being,        the       supporters             were      all       herded       down       the       ground          in

a mass.            I think           we    should          have      been al lo we d             to m a k e       our    own way          to

the    ground which                  would       h ave      meant       people         turning          up over          a    period          of

time     instead             of all        together.

Also    I think              the     tunnel          should       h ave      been      closed         o f f and         people

directed           to       the    sides        of    the     terracing,              the a b s e n c e       of s i g n s         meant

most    people              presumed        t hat      the     tunnel         was      th e      only       entrance          to    the

t e r ra c e s .

Even    after           the       disaster           had    t o ok    p l ace      the      police          just     seemed         to    be

standing         around,             they       seemed        very     slow        in d o i n g a n y t h i n g          positive*             the

few    p o l i c e m e n who          were       helping          seemed         to    be       doing       their       best,       but

there     ware          a    lot w h o      just       stood around                doing         nothing.

There     seemed             to    be a     ba d      lack     of m e d i c a l        equipment             and     sex^ices

readily       available.

It    took    far           too    long     to       get    down      the     perimeter               fencing.

There     should             h ave    been a nnouncements                     made         to    tell       the    supporters             what

was    going        on,       people        were       still         com i n g     onto         the    terraces          long a f t e r

the    game        had       been     s t o p p e d w h i c h wa s           making         matters          worse .

If the       kick-off              had     been       delayed and             those         people          outside          informed,

then    there           would        not    have       been any           panic        to       get    into       the    ground.

Also     I cannot             understand              why     the     p o 1 i ce      had       not    noticed          how    badly

overcrowded                 the    centre        of    the     terraces            were         earlier       on a n d w h y         they
                                                                                                                  PAGE      8

             had    not   done   anything    to    rectify    it.
                                                                             /
             There    were      insufficient      numbers    of    poliy^        outside    the    t u r n s t i l e s to

                       the       grid          plan       I heard           a    l a r ge     roar f r o m      the c r o w d w h i c h   at    the     time        I

                       the       g a me        or    the       pitch.

                       Within about                      2 or 3 m i n u t e s             after       hearing     the    roar    (kick     off)        I found

                       I had          been          in    p o s i t i o n 2 / for           I would      estimate        about     2 minutes           when     I

                       heard          the       thud and             people         screaming           as    previously        stated;        t his    was

                         side    breaking.         I could        only    estimate        the     time    of    hearing       thr!

              positive.          The    screaming       I heard         I can     be    definate       in s a y i n g   was

              coming         from an area       b e h i n d me    and    to m y    r i ght   as    I was       in   pasitjjB-rTNo

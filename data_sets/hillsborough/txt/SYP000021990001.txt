9    The MP for Liverpool Garston, Eddie Loyden,
     is calling for a full inquiry into the
     tragedy, and will raise questions in the
     House of Commons.  Mr. Loyden was at
     Hillsborough and has praised the actions
     of Liverpool fans who went to the aid
     of the injured supporters.

10   At police headquarters in Sheffield, the
     Chief Constable of South Yorkshire,
     Peter Wright, has been fielding a barrage
     of questions about his forces handling
     of the crowds at Hillsborough.     He said
     several thousand fans arrived late..and a
     gate at the Liverpool end was opened by
     a police officer to prevent trouble.
     However, he d i d n 't accept that this led
     to a crush on the terraces.

         Details of delays on roads between Liverpool and Sheffield

                                15 April 1989




Before itemising the delays, it is important to clarify that the

motorway road system around Manchester, which now provides a complete

bypass to the south of the city was not complete on 15 April.     At that

time the M63 finished at Portwood Roundabout, to the east of Stockport

at the junction with the A560.     The final part of the M63 providing the

last link to the M67 at Denton was not opened until 28 April.



Routes




The recommended route published in the Liverpool Programme advised

supporters to follow the M62 east out of Liverpool, north of

Manchester, across the Pennines to Jet 42 of the M1.     It was then

suggested that they travel south on the M1, leaving at Jet 35 for

Sheffield.     Supporters who followed that route have not reported any

great delays.




It is clear that many Liverpool supporters chose to follow the M62 or

M56 east out of Liverpool, then joining the M63 to the west or south of

Manchester.     This motorway terminated to the east of Stockport and

supporters were then required to follow the A560 to Mottram in

Longdendale, where they could join the A57 over Snake Pass to

Sheffield.     Supporters who chose this route were the ones subjected to

long delays.

 Delays




 There is some conflict of evidence between that offered by P Sgt

          or Greater   Manchester Police (ttftclaooifi<Mi document) and that

contained within the statements and questionnaires completed by

supporters and coach drivers, many of whom talk of lengthy delays

including a coach driver,                       [Document 326) who produced a

tacograph chart indicating he only travelled 5 kms in an hour on the

M63•   However, some of the accuracy of this evidence has to be viewed

in the context that many people are confused as to their correct

location when they were delayed and also, they were frustrated by the

hold-ups and may have understandably felt the period of the delay to

be longer than it actually was.




M62, West of Junction 15 Eastbound Carriageway



At 1106 a damage only road traffic accident occurred between a motor

cycle and a saloon car.      The motorway, which at this point has four

lanes, was reduced by two lanes for only about 15 minutes.           No reports

of serious delays.                                            ).

 M62 Junction 15 Eastbound Carriageway




 Between 0830 and 1345 hours, the three lane motorway at this point was

 reduced by one lane, due to a third lane closure for essential cental

barrier renovation.     During the closure, traffic was flowing slowly

through the road works and was only delayed for a maximum of 10

minutes.   (Efaclaoaificd document                     St 515 & 5 1 7 )

Contraflow, two lanes in each direction.            Long term work relating to

widening scheme.   No serious delays reported.           (feelaoaified document ^5?

           , St 517).



M63 Between Junctions 2 & 3 Eastbound Carriageway



The three lane motorway at this point was reduced by one lane to direct

traffic into a suitable configuration for approaching contraflow.

Delays reported no time specified,         (feclaaaificd document

 M63 Between Junctions 3Bf6 Both Carriageways




 Contraflow, two lanes in each direction.             Long term work relating to

widening scheme.    Long delays reported by supporters and coach drivers.

It was at this location that                  only travelled 5 kms in one hour.

M63 End of Motorway Portwood Roundabout




At that time the motorway terminated at a roundabout, at the junction

with the A560.    Heavy congestion reported due to volume of traffic.

This delay varies between a     \ hour   and 1 hour 10 minutes between 1215

and 1325 hours.    (Doc 325, St 214, 331, & 440).



M67 End of Motorway Mottram in Longendale



This is a traffic bottleneck caused purely by the combination of a

heavy volume of traffic and the geography of the road layout.            At this

location the motorway terminates into a single lane carriageway, close

to a crossroads controlled by traffic lights in a small village centre.

The A560, which carried traffic from the M63, joins the M67 at a

roundabout at the terminus of the motorway, just prior to this point

and this further contributes to the bottleneck.            Unspecified delays

reported.   (Doc 81, St 214).

A57 Approaching Sheffield




There is one report of an unspecified delay at this location.   (St 78).

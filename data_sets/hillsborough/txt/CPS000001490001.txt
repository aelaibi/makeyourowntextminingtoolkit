A brief note to report some progress.

On 30/12 Ann Adlington phoned in response to my fax of 24/12. I explained the CPS stance on disclosure.

On 30/12 Chris Enzor and I agreed drafts of letters to HFSG and Hammond Suddards on the issue of disclosure.

On 31/12 CE sent letters to HFSG, the solicitors for both defendants, and Hammond Suddards.

The main development is that the SY Police, advised by HS, now appear willing to give voluntary disclosure at
this stage. There are matters of detail to be resolved but this should now be an easier process if Police and CPS
are following the same line on disclosure. Ann Adlington has agreed to try to identify on the schedules what
material HSFG has already had and what they now want.

Happy New Year!

I paraded for duty at                      0 945    that day, an d verified             that     the officers             I

D u c k e n f i e l d and other            officers. I was            the officer          in charge         of sub­

sector £0,           cont a i n i n g      serials 49,          50 and 51.        This sub-sector

c o nsisted of three m ar k e d                 police       ’Transit'’ vans,           containing          u n iformed

officers,        who were        to     patra 1 the-? Foxhill,         P a r s o n Cross,      and Gre n o s i d e

areas.         These a reas       were      in the a rea set aside              for the Liverpool

supporters,         and    i n c luded the        localities where Liverpool                   s u pporters

were     to park their           c o a c h e s , mi ni b u s e s , and private        vehicles.

The Chief        Inspector        for that area was Chief                 Inspector Purdy?             his

s uperior       was S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Marshall.

A fter    the briefing,           I b ri e f e d the m e m b e r s     of my section,              and ensured

that     the meals,        radios,        etc,   were     properly drawn.             Although        our

instructions were             to take the          packed meal         provided       im m e d i a t e l y after

the    briefing,        1 felt        that for the van             covering     the Foxh i l l       area,     Tango

4    (serial     49),     that    it w o u l d    be w i s e s t   to a s c e r t a i n the    immediate

c i r c u m s t a n c e s w i t h the    licensed      premises       in that area,           as    I was aware

that     some    of the      public, houses,          such as The Fox            Inn on Foxhill             Road,

had been very busy the                   previous year.

Accordingly,          I e l e c t e d to a c c o m p a n y   the Foxhill         van for the          initial

part     of the     shift,       on the grounds           that should         there    be any        trouble,

the    likeliest        locality w o u l d be the             Foxhill       area.     The     sergeant        in

charge     of the       serial        was PS 2207        Shaw,      F2,   and we com m e n c e d      patrol, at

1050 that        day.

At    1058 we drove          past The Fox          public      house,     and    1 noticed          that    there

were     six    or s even young men,              a p p a r e n t l y Liverpool     supporters,            alre a d y

waiting        outside     the    premises,        and    that     there were two           or three

vehi c.1 es     i n the    car    par k .

At    1103 we drove          past The Basset             public      house on Cowper           Avenue..        The

premises were a l r e a d y open,                customers         could be seen       inside,        and a

small     knot of young men standing                     by the      entrance.        There        were also

v e h i c 1 e s i n t h e ca r p a r k .

At    11.23 we      r e t urned to The Fox            public       house,     and   1 went         inside and

spoke     to the      landlord.           He had a p p a r e n t l y made a r r a n g e m e n t s     for an

influx of L iv er p o o l         supporters?         he had set aside a large                     room for
their     e x elusive        u s e , p u 11 i n g h i.s r e g u 1a r c u a t o rne r s i n t o a s i d e r a a m ?

he had engaged a d oo rm an and extra                         bar   staff?      and stated his

i nt e n t i o n of staying          o pen for       the L i v erpool         supporters.

1' a d v i se d him to exerc i s e            care and discretion,               and     inform ed him that

there would         be a police            presence       in the area.           My home a d d r e s s       is not

too    far from this a r e a j I had heard a rumour                            to the effect          that he

had also        laid      in a large         supply of beer,           ready for this           event.

However,        I b el i e v e d that all           licensees        in the area had been visited,

and    their     i n tentions        discovered,          and    I was       aware   that his      intention

to stay open was               known»

When    I visi t e d       the    premises,         there were a l r e a d y a p p r o x i m a t e l y      twenty

customers        in the        room set aside           for     the Liverpool          supporters.,         and    the

car    park was a l r e a d y b e g inning             to f i 11 u p »

We    then made a check               of the other           licensed        premises     in the area.

Mos t o f t he      pu b 1 i c ho u ses we r e e i t her            closed,     o r open o nIy to t he

rear?     all    of the o ff -l i c e n c e         premises a p p e a r e d     to be open,          but were

not at      that    stage        giving      cause     for    concern.

We    then paid        passing a t t e n t i o n       to the m a i n        roads   in the Foxhill           area,

incl uding The Fox and Basset                       public houses,            and a small       chip*-shop in

T r a f a l g a r Roa d    that     had been the          scene     of disorder          on   previous

matches.         I noti c e d       in particular            that The Fox        public       house    rapidly

became      full?      the     crowd spilled out              on to his        patio,     and the wall            in

front     of his       premises          facing     on to foxhill            Roa d was    compl e t e l y    lined

w i t h supporters,            sitti ng      on the wail        and    drinking.         The    car    park was

c o m p 1 e t e 1y f u 11 ..

At    1315 we      r e c eived a radio m e s s a g e            to the       effect that a group of

y o u t h s were    causing         trouble and s h o p l i f t i n g         in the                  shop in

                          which     is    im m e d i a t e l y oppos i t e                                             We

attended,        and      the m a n a g e r e s s   c o m p l a i n e d that a group of y ouths              had

been    into the          premises,        snatching         sweets    from an open display,                 and
                                                                                                                     P AGE

whe n the m a n a g e r e s s           had    r em o n s t r a t e d w i t h them,     she had      been

s u b j ec te d to verbal               obscene abuse           and had been assaulted,                   although

there were            no a p pa re nt         injuries.         She was however           very d i s t r e s s e d

and frightened.                   The youths         had left the area               in a w hite         van,    and the

m a na g e r e s s    had    noted       the number.            We    passed    these     details         to G r o u n d

Control,        and       c om me n c e d a search of the area.

At    1330 we saw the van,                     regis t e r e d number                         being       driven

al o n g H al i f a x R o a d towards              the City.           We followed the             van as       it

stop p e d     in the        car    park       of a public           house    called The White Horse                   in

Ha li fa x Road,            and d e t a in ed the occupants.                   The van was a simple

Renault        van,       c o n t a in in g nothing more              in the     rear    than a mattress               and

six L i verpool             supporters,           all    of w h o m had been drinking.                    Details        of

the o c cupants             of the van are              given at       the end.

At    1340 we a r r i v e d at E cc l e s f i e i d Po l i c e Station.                      The    six     people

were     then d o c u m e n t e d ? this            process      took    until       1430,    w h e n we     left      one

of the v a n ’s crew,               PC 333 Ogilvie,              with    them at E c c l e s f i e i d and

resumed patrol               d i r e ct ly     to the L e p p i n g s    Lane     entrance         to the ground.

We were        unable        to    inform ground            control      that we had resumed                 patrol,

as    radio      traffic was at that                    time    virtually        continuous,         and     it was

apparent         that       it was       very     busy at the Leppings Lane                   end.

We a rr i v e d at          the L e p p i n g s Lane       e n t rance at        1510.       There was a crowd

m il l i n g about          at    the    entrance,        but    it was       not p a r t i c u l a r l y dense,         and

we were able              to alight and            pass t h r o u g h the       crowd to join other

officers         in the a rea            immediately           in front       of the     turns t i l e s     in front

of the West Stand.                      I there      saw the         other    two serials          from my sub-

sector,        ie serial           50    (PS Hall brook,             Tango 5) and serial             51    (PS Cres s e y

T ango 6),           who were       alre a d y there           before    us.

Athough        radio        traffic         remained e x t r e m e l y       busy,    giving       the    impression

of severe            d i f f i c ul ti es     inside    the     ground,       there was       no apparent             need

at that        precise moment                 for our     presence at          that     location?          I thought
                                                                                                                   PAGE
                                                                                                                   R57

that we           should     be better           employed       in our given duty of mobile

reserve,           an d a c c o r d i n g l y    sought       p e r m i s s i o n from Chief       Inspector Purdy

and S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Marshall               to resume mobile             patrol.        On being        given

this    permission!,              I    i n s tructed all        three       serials      to resume at about

1515.         I    r e j oined PS Shaw's               serial,       and    patrolled the          roads      in the

immed iate          v i ci ni ty of the ground.                     It    was at     this    stage I first

became a ware             that        f atalities       had occurred,           from hearing a mess a g e

mentioning            that       five bodies were at a particular                          location.

At    1525,        as a result           of the        radio traffic           revealing         that    there     had

been a serious               and fatal           incident,          1 instr u c t e d the driver            to   return

to L e p p in gs L a n e .             Upo n our arrival             we    found that a m b u l a n c e s and fire

brigade           vehicles were arriving.                      We    took up a s t a nd-by             position      in

L e p p i n g s Lane        in the mouth of              its j u n c t i o n with Sheristone Road., with

the    crew of the               vehicle        remaining        inside      the van.         At this       time     there

was a trickle               of    people        leaving       the    ground,       and some of these             persons

were    being         very a bu s i v e a n d t h r e a t e n i n g         towards any          police     officer

they saw           in L e p p i ng s Lane.             These    persons were using                obscenities,

threats,           and were           in an ugly mood.

At    1535,        whilst        standing        by at that          location,        I saw a local G . P . ,

Do c t o r E. Birkby,                 in his     own vehicle.              Dr. B k i r k b y was apparently-

trying        to reach the              g r o u n d , but was        held up by the           crowd and by the

e m e rg en cy v e h icles             thro nging       the    road.        Also    nearby was Chief

Inspector Waring.                      I took     p os s e s s i o n of Dr.        B i r kby's    car,    and handed

him over           to Chief           Inspector Waring              for    escort     to the      ground.

After     parking and securing                     Dr.    Birkby*s          vehicle,      I left the van and

its    crew on s t a n d- by at                 that    point and went             towards       the    ground.          I

e nte r e d       the gro u n d        by the exit        gate       nearest       to Vere Road,          Gate     "A",

w h i c h was wide           open at that              time,    an d      passed     u n d e r n e a t h the N o r t h

St a n d and        into     the g ym na s i u m at           1545.

Upon    entering           the gymnasium,                I was met          fay the a p p a l l i n g    sight     of a
large      number        of a pp ar en tl y      dead bodies          laid out on the floor,                   w ith

police       officers and other                 persons       in a t t e n d a n c e    upon them.         This was

the    first      i nd i c a t i o n    I had of the m a g n i t u d e            of the      tragedy?        I

attempted         to     count     t h e m , but was         unable     to      continue       to do so.          1 found

Dr.    8 i rk by a t t e n d in g       to an injured          person nearby,                and    returned his

keys     to him.           I then       left    the g y m n a s i u m and         returned to the van              in

L e pp in gs Lane.

At    no time       did       I touch any of the              bodies        I saw,      nor was       I engaged         in

mo v i n g any      of the bodies              in the ground.

Upon     returning            to the van,        1 was       informed that the van and driver

were     required          to help        in casualty e v a c u a t i o n to hospital.

A cco r d i n g l y ,    PC    1S2H H u t c h i n s o n took       the van for            these      duties,      and

the    remainder           of the s ect i o n         r e t urned w ith me back               through Gate         '“A"

to the entra n c e             to the       gymnasium,         where we           took up a p o s ition as             part

of a cordon             prote c t i n g     the e n v irons       of the          g y m n a s i u m from the crowd.

A this time             there were          a number of         persons           a t tending at the

gymnasium,          trying       to trace        relatives         or find details                 of the dead and

injured,        and      it was        n e c essary    not    to a llow them access                  to the

g y m n a s i u m at that        time.

At about        1615       I was a sked        by S u p e r i n t e n d e n t     Bates      to form a n      initial

contact       point       near     to the g y m n a s i u m      entrance.             The    purpose was         to

take     details         of    persons who were              reported as missing,                   and of the

persons       reporting,           so that a start             could be made              on identifying           some

of the bodies.                 I remained at that              location engaged                in this work

until     approximately                1730,   assisted        by other members                of serial       49 „

By that       t i m e , the      press      of the      r e 1atives         had    ceased,         and there was          no

one    else at that             time      reporting a n y o n e missing?                  in addition,

arrangements             had been made           to a c c o m m o d a t e    the     persons        looking    for

missing       relatives,           etc,     at Hammer ton Road.

I handed        the      lists we had taken,                 toget h e r with an             incomplete       list of
                                                                                                                   PAGE

persons        trea t e d    by the St.              John's A m b u l a n c e Brigade,              to DC 3211

Priestley           for o n w ar d t r a n s m is si o n         to the     casualty          b u r e a u/major

incident        room.

At    1740,     together w i t h PS Sha w and his                         serial,       I went       on foot       to

C la yw h e e l s Lane,         where we        c o llected our            van.      At that         time    the

m e mb er s    of the       serial       were all           r e a s o n a b l y fresh,    and had not been

involved        in the       h ar ro w i n g    exper i e n c e      of w i t n e s s i n g    the     deaths      of the

casu a l t i e s     or of moving            the dead and            injured?           I therefore          decided

not    to seek         p e r mi ss io n to stand down at that                       time,      although       I

u nd er s t o o d that       one of the other                    serials    in my sector             had been stood

down a short            time     before.             ye    therefore       resumed mobile              patrol,      as

there were           still      s up p o r t e r s    in the area,          at    1800,       as    I felt    there was

still     a role that            the     serial           was    capable    of p e r f o r m i n g .

At    ISSO we        r e c eived a report                 of trouble       with s u pporters at the

N or t h e r n General          Hospital,             to w h i c h a number          of injured had been

taken.         We    r e m ained        in the area of the                 hospital until            1920,   when        we

returned        to the ground.                 There        did not appear           to be any further-

useful        duty to und e r t a k e          at that           point,    and a c c o r d i n g l y      I informd the

ground        conT,rol      of our aval 1abi 1 ity and a sked                       for    further

instructions,               We were        stood d own at            1930,       returned to C l a y w h e e l s

Lane    traffic         garage,        and went            off    duty at 200 0 that               day.

I have        pocket      book     entries           of the above,          made     up on my arrival               home

at about 210 0 that                day.      I have         since    re c o l l e c t e d that at about             1715

to    1730,     or     perhaps          later, I had a c o n v e r s a t i o n wit h               Inspector       Tingle

C2,    who stated           that        he had been a s s a u l t e d          by supporters whilst

e n ga ge d    in a p p l yi ng      first aid to an                injured man on the ground?

certainly           the officer          was    upset and           to some       degree       d i s t r e s s e d when       I

spoke     to him,         but    I have        omi ted to          include       this     in my notes.

I have        p re v i o u s l y been enga g e d on football                     duties at H i l l s b o r o u g h

last year,       and was a l l o ca te d the              coach    park duties along Claywheels

any o c c a s i o n   I have w o r k e d at H i l l s b o r o u g h .

On the o c c a s i o n of this match,                as    1 have    said earlier,          I did not see

a n y of the      incident       inside the ground?                 1 at   no time      e n t e r e d the

playing area or           perimeter        track?         and    I did not touch or handle any of

the    casualties,        either       injured or dead.              At    no time did I speak to,

or have any d if fi c u l t y with,              any of the         stewards       employed       by the     club

either     inside      or outside         of the ground.

As    for my o b s e r va ti on s about          this matter,           I can only state           that     I was

sa d d en ed and d e pr es se d to see               so m a n y of the Liverpool           supporters

w hose    only a t t i tu de      seemed to be host i l e and              c o mpletely ungovernable?

w ho s e main     i nte rest      seemed      to fae cent red on dr i nk i ng from as                e a r 1y    as

possible      to as      late     as    possible; and to            remark   that the young men

arrested       fay serial       49 a p p e a r e d   to have       no shame or finer              feelings      of

any description.

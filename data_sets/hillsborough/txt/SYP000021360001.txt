            12 May 1989



            Dear Assistant Chief Constable, Mr Jones

            I refer to your letter of 11 May 1989 addressed to the Chief Constable
            on the subject of Lord Justice Taylor’s inquiry into the Hillsborough
            disaster.

             The Chief Constable has appointed me as 'liaison officer' and I will
             arrange the required statements at the earliest opportunity.

             X understand that one of your Senior Officers will be contacting me
             in the near future and I am, of course, available on the extension
             shown above.

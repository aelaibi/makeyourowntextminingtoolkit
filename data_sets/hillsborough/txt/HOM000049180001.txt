      EVIDENCE OF ANTHONY JAMES EDWARDS
 1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH: You have in all, I think, made four
 2        statements.      The first one was dated 7th May of 1989?
 3   A.   Yes.
 4   Q.   That,   I think, was probably to the solicitors, was it?
 5   A.   That is right, yes.
 6   Q.   For the ambulance service?
 7   A.   Ambulance service, yes.
 8   Q.   There was another statement on 25th October 1989 to the
 9        West Midlands Police?
10   A.   That is right.
11   Q.   Then you made a statement to Ann Adlington dated 5th
12        September 1995?       Do you have that?    I have a handwritten
13        copy.    (Pause)
14   MS   ADLINGTON:    Is it in relation to Ann Williams case, sir?
15   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       May be, yes.   Perhaps you had
16        better look at it. I have only got the photostat copy.
17         (Handed)    The signature is at the end.
18   A.   I actually don't have a copy of that, but yes,        I rememier
19        that.
20   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       May be we will take a photocopy of
21        that.    Finally,    I have one dated simply October of this
22        year.    It does not have a proper date on it.        Do you know
23        what date that was?
24   MS   ADLINGTON:    Sir,    we sent it out for signature,    I think, on
25        12th October.       We received it back in on 17th October -when
26        I sent you a lot of other statements which you had
27        requested.
28   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I see.   Roundabout 17th October, is
29        it?
30   MS   ADLINGTON:    Yes.     Mr. Edwards had suffered a bereavement
31        at the time so I      didn't want to waste time by sending it
32        back for him to date it.
33   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Then I have a letter from you dated
34        10th November.        What do you want to tell me in addition
35        to tha t .   I d o n 't want you to go over the whole story
36        again because I have read those statements and I



                                         2
)
    1        understand what you say, and I am quite clear what it is
    2        you are saying.
    3   A.   I have always felt that those statements, or the initial
    4        statement should have been cross-examined in the first
    5        place, from the outset.     The statement I made to the
    6        solicitors was, in a sense, a guarded statement;         not all
    7        of it was instructed, but there were things I was
    8        instructed out of it that were not relevant.
    9   Q.   Like what?
10      A.   Just small things but quite important, when Mr. Hopkins
11           swore, when the police officer said they were still
12           fighting.    Oh, and when we came back.    There was a
13           swearing actually at the scene on the pitch.      They were
14           just small things.     I felt there was a lot more ---
15      Q.   I am afraid there was a good deal of swearing going on
16           that day.
17      A.   That's right.
18      Q.   People's feelings were running very high.
19      A.   That's right.
20      Q.   I don't think, if I may say so, that is of any great
21           significance.
22      A.   No, no, that is right, but what I am saying is that I
23           always felt and was led to believe when I made this fixst
24           statement that I would at some later stage be cross-
25           examined;     I was likely to be called.   Of course, that
26           never happened.     I do have, and I have always made that
27           clear to     my employers, a different view to them about the
28           emergency response at Hillsborough.
29      Q.   You set that out in your most recent statement, have you,
30           particularly the one dated October 1997?
31      A.   I have not said I felt there were people, for instance,
32            Sarah Hicks, was still alive.     I always believe that:
33            that Sarah Hicks was alive.     I said this to my counsellor
34            the very first time I was counselled at Hillsborough.        It
35            is one of the things I had to     live with.   I have not said
36            that I felt - not felt, I actually acted out of protocol.
37      Q.   What do you mean by that?


                                          3
I
    1   A.   That there are certain protocols that you should adhere to
    2        within a major incident, and I didn't adhere to those
    3        protocols.
    4   Q.   What do you mean?
    5   A.   It was clear that there was no other ambulance officer at
    6         the scene, at the pitch, the Leppings Lane end of the
    7        ground, when I was there.     Really, I should have took
    8         charge of the scene.    I ended up with an ambulance which
    9        had possibly dead people on, and I left the scene without
10            triaging the scene.
11      Q.   I think you are wrong about that.    There were other
12            ambulance people there.
13      A.   Do we know where they were?
14      Q.   Yes, we do.
15      A.   I d o n 't .
16      Q.   They gave evidence before Lord Taylor.     Yes.
17      A.   I never saw any other ambulance officer.
18      Q.   That may be. It was a pretty chaotic state of affairs,
19           wasn't it?
20      A.   At the time I was there, Mr. Eason who I was sent to see
21           wasn't there.    I had seen Mr. Eason outside the ground.
22            There were five officers present, most of which I had seen
23            before even getting on to the pitch.    There was no officer
24            at the far end of the pitch.
25      Q.   So you think you ought to have taken control?
26      A.   As I was the only ambulance person there, the theory is       I
27            should have taken control.
28      Q.   But you had been told by M r . Hopkins to go down and
29            collect casualties and take them to hospitals, hadn't you?
30      A.   I had been told to go down and to liaise with Mr. Leeson.
31      Q.   And you couldn't find Mr. Leeson?
32      A.   No.    I was surprised anyway because I thought I saw Mr.
33            Leeson on Penistone Road as we entered the ground.
34      Q.   I am sorry?
35      A.   I thought I saw Mr. Leeson on Penistone Road as we entered
36            the ground;    he was sorting out traffic.
37      Q.   You thought you saw him in Penistone Road?


                                           4
)
    1   A.   Yes.
    2   Q.   Yes.
    3   A.   So when we got down to the other end, I always believed
    4        that somebody should have questioned why we did what we
    5        did.     I was not called to be questioned for that.    Why did
    6        we leave the ground with four bodies, two policeman, a
    7        nurse?
    8   Q.   Because you needed to get them to hospital as quickly as
    9        possible, I imagine.
10      A.   The normal procedure then is that you are supposed to be
11           triaged.     We went through what is claimed to be a triage
12           point, but nobody triaged our vehicle.
13      Q.   Yes.
14      A.   So therefore before I knew where we were, we were back on
15           Penistone Road and heading towards Northern General.        I
16           assumed we would have been triaged at the so called
17           casualty clearing point.
18      Q.   Yes.     That would have caused further delay, wouldn't it?
19      A.   Not really.     When you triage, you then prioritise and you
20           can deal with the priorities.      I clearly had two people --
21
22      Q.   I thought the people you had on your ambulance - it was
23           Victoria Hicks, wasn't it?
24      A.   Yes.
25      Q.   I thought that was a priority case?
26      A.   No, I didn't think so.
27      Q.   You didn't think so.     You thought she was dead, did you?
28      A.   I thought she was dead, yes.
29      Q.   I see.
30      A.   However,    I did see Sarah.   When I saw the girl on the
31           ambulance, I thought - she had got on to the ambulance and
32           I was pleased with that.       I realised when I was there that
33           this wasn't the same girl I had seen.
34      Q.   You might have had some difficulty with Mr. Hicks if you
35           tried to put Victoria Hicks off?
36      A.   Yes, but I didn't know that at the time, did I.      I mean,    I
37           have still got to deal with the fact that I left Sarah.


                                            5
)
    1        Somebody had clearly been working on       Sarah.    She had a
    2        good colour, and I don't believe her       pupils were fixed and
    3        dilated, whereas Victoria's clearly were.          I didn't
    4        actually see Sarah - Victoria - on the ground.
    5   Q.   Did you examine Sarah?
    6   A.   Not on the ground.
    7   Q.   Where did you examine her then?
    8   A.   She was put into the back of the ambulance.          Not by me.       I
    9        am sorry:     did I examine Sarah?
10      Q.   We are talking about Sarah now?
11      A.   If we are talking about Sarah, I looked at         Sarah. I looked
12           at two people: one that a nurse had pointed me to, a chap,
13           and I looked at Sarah.
14      Q.   You thought she was still alive?
15      A.   I thought we probably had a chance      with her, yes.
16      Q.   Did you take her pulse?
17      A.   No, I didn't.    It was based on a very quick assessment.
18           The same with the chap.     The only assessment you can do in
19           those situations is to look at       the colour of the skin,     if
20           you can get to it, and look at       the pupils.
21      Q.   Did you look at the pupils?
22      A.   Yes, I did.
23      Q.   Sarah's?
24      A.   In Sarah's case, yes.
25      Q.   And they reacted to light?
26      A.   Well, I didn't actually do the reaction to         light, but vhen
27           you have somebody who is dead, they have a clear, very
28           fixed, dilated, often glazed pupil, which I think was the
29           case with Victoria.
30      Q.   That, surely,   is only after they have been       dead for some
31           time, isn't it?
32      A.   Yes.
33      Q.   You didn't close the eyelids and then open         them to see
34           whether they reacted?
35      A.   No.
36      Q.   You could have done that, couldn't you?




                                           6
j
    1   A.   I could have done.      Instead, I got off the field.       There
    2        were lots of things I could have done.        I took two bodies
    3        down the other end of the field.        I could have gone back
    4        once we got to the so-called clearing area;           the so called
    5        triage area, because I knew more than anybody what the
    6        situation was up the top.      I had seen people being
    7        resuscitated but nobody had asked me what the situation
    8        was.    There was nobody in charge of that situation.
    9   Q.   I thought Mr. Hopkins was in charge?
10      A.   Mr. Hopkins directed us, in my opinion quite rightly
11           directed us towards Leppings Lane end of the ground.            Tou
12           understand I am talking about the goal?
13      Q.   Yes.
14      A.   I think quite rightly directed us.        What I think was wxong
15           was just sending one ambulance.        I believe they should
16           have sent more staff at least up to that end for somebody
17           to triage there.
18      Q.   What else do you want to tell me?
19      A.   I want to say about the fact of the ambulance being
20           restricted from getting on to the ground.           We got on and
21           off the ground very easily.        So too did Mr.    Flack's
22           ambulance.    It was!                     who got    caught.
23      Q.   I think that is not quite accurate.       Both the two first
24           ambulances had some trouble getting on to the ground?
25      A.   We did not.
26      Q.   You were in the third ambulance, weren't you?
27      A.   OK.
28      Q.   You have made the point in your statements that did not
29           have any difficulty but the other two - I think one hit a
30           hoarding, or something or other, and the other hit the
31           ramp.   You are not suggesting that is not true, are you?
32      A.   No, I am not suggesting that is not true.           What I am
33           saying is that the role of the police officers at that
34           scene created a situation where you could only drive in
35           one direction.    That was never said.      The only reason that
36           we got on was because Mr. Hopkins leant over the ambulance




                                            7
 1        and slapped on our horns which then allowed the officers
 2        to split, and they got through.
 3   Q.   Where was this cordon?
 4   A.   Right at the ramp entrance.
 5   Q.   How many police officers were there there?
 6   A.   Enough to block the way.
 7   Q.   In your first statement you did not talk about the cordon
 8        of police officers there.       You talked about one policeman
 9        telling you that you couldn't get on to the pitch?
10   A.   Yes.
11   Q.   That was something you did not elaborate at that stage?
12   A.   No.
13   Q.   Why was that?
14   A.   It is the same piece when I started saying to that chap
15        about the police officer coming up and saying, you know,
16        that they were fighting.        He said that would be
17        investigated and it was not particularly relevant for what
18        they wanted.       They wanted to know what I did, not what
19        other people did.
20   Q.   But you mentioned about the police officer saying they
21        were fighting, in your third statement?
22   A.   Yes.
23   Q.   That is the reason why he said you couldn't get on to the
24         pitch?
25   A.   Yes.     Again,   I think I should have been cross-examined.   I
26        think quite a lot of play is made of the ramp, but very
27        little play is made ---
28   Q.   It is very difficult for people to cross-examine unless
29        they know what you are going to say.
30   A.   Yes, but what I am saying is that I should have been given
31        an option, because even from my first statement it is
32        clear that I felt there was a restriction not to do with
33        the ramp.
34   Q.   I see.     Perhaps you do not understand how these things
35        work.     Your statement was available to Lord Taylor's
36        Inquiry.     He had to make up his mind, and the inquiry team
37        had to make up their minds, which witnesses they were


                                          8
)
    1        going to call to be examined.    Obviously, they could not
    2        call     allthe witnesses, and they didn't decide to call
    3        you.     Atthe Inquest the Coroner decided that he would not
    4        investigate matters so far as the main Inquest is
    5        concerned after 315.     In the mini Inquests he did
    6        investigate that.    It was up to him to decide which
    7        witnesses to call.     I cannot see anything at that stage
    8        which indicates that you should have been called, but you
    9        think you should have been?
10      A.   Yes, I do.    I think that my position was always different.
11           I have always felt that we were part of a bad process;
12           thatI behaved in a way and dealt with the situation <juite
13           wrongly, and I believe that the ambulance service
14           management also dealt with the situation quite wrongly.
15      Q.   I don't think you have ever said before, have you, that
16           you believed you dealt with the matter wrongly?
17      A.   No, but that's I wrote to you and said     that I feel as if I
18           would rather discuss those things.
19      Q.   I see.
20      A.   Rather than put it in writing.    What I   am saying here is
21           that had I still been in the ambulance service, I always
22           thought that I would have been called to task for what
23           happened at Hillsborough, my part in i t .
24      Q.   Did you try to tell anybody that you thought    you had done
25           the wrong thing?
26      A.   I told my counsellor, and that was as far as    it went.
27      Q.   Who was your counsellor?
28      A.   My initial counsellor was a lady from Northern General
29           Hospital.
30      Q.   Somebody from the National Health Service?
31      A.   Yes.
32      Q.   Who would that be?
33      A.   I have a name, but I don't know where I have    got it
34           actually.
35      Q.   Did you have psychiatric counselling as a result of this?
36      A.   I had one day initial counselling in which I    tried to
37           explain my guilt for Hillsborough.    The lady who


                                          9
■)
     1         interviewed me, who I think is                     , was very
     2        nice.     After the Cook Report, it was clear I wasn't
     3        handling Hillsborough at all.
     4   Q.   After the what report?
     5   A.   The Cook Report on the TV.        The Cook investigators came
     6        across me.     I then asked my Authority could I have some
     7        counselling because I clearly was not handling it.
     8   Q.   What - after the Cook Report1
     9   A.   After the Cook Report.     I am still having counselling,
10            incidentally.     I am only now just able to read some of the
11            things.
12       Q.   I am not sure you have got quite so much to blame your-self
13            for as you think you have;        it was a very difficult
14            situation which confronted anybody on that occasion.
15       A.   It was.    I agree with that, but I think people should hold
16            their hands up and say, "We did things wrong here" instead
17            of trying to pretend that they called a major incident,
18            which they did not.    My driver - which I did not say in my
19            initial report, and I can be criticised for this and it is
20            wrong - did not put on his horns and lights because he
21            didn't feel it was a severe incident when we were called.
22            The information that was passed to him did not indicate
23            that it was necessary to even go on an emergency.
24       Q.   You left the hospital where you delivered a casualty,        at
25            half past three, as I understand it, and you were at the
26            ground two minutes later.     That is what you said in your
27            statement.    It doesn't suggest to me that you were held up
28            very much.
29       A.   No, but what I am saying to you is that quite often         wlien
30            you were close to a scene, particularly in the older idea
31            with the ambulance service, the older end - which
32            _______ |was - they did not put on their horns and lights if
33            they were close to a scene.       Always now, no matter how
34            close you are, you would put on your horns and lights to
35            let people know this is an emergency situation.
36       Q.   Could you have got to the ground any quicker than two
37            minutes from the hospital?


                                           10
     1   A.   No, no; the point     I am making here is that the ambulance
 2             man was not even aware that this was a severe incident
 3             that we were going to.
 4       Q.    That I follow.  I am just asking you what the consequences
 5             of that would be?
 6       A.   The consequences in the time delay,    I don't believe there
 7             was a time delay;     but when you are mentally preparing for
 8             a scene and going to a scene, we had no idea what we were
 9             going to and this is half past.      We only heard of
10             fatalities when we reached the traffic island Herrier
11             Road.
12       Q    Who was in charge of your ambulance - you or the driver?
13       A.   He was more senior.
14       Q.   Does that mean he was in charge?
15       A.   That means that he is in charge.      On the day I wasn't even
16            paid as a qualified ambulance man.       I was a qualified
17            ambulance man but I was not paid as that rank;       I was paid
18            as unqualified.
19       Q.   Why was that?
20       A.   Because I had transferred from one service to another, and
21            you had to start again.     As far as the control units were
22            concerned, I was an unqualified ambulance man.
23       Q.   You seem to be bothered about this question of the timings
24             of the ambulance arriving on the pitch.     Is that right?
25       A.   Yes.
26       Q.   Just help me about that.    The video evidence that you were
27            shown, shows the ambulance on the pitch at 335, is that
28            right?
29       A.   Approximately, yes, I think so.
30       Q.   What do you mean by "approximately"?
31       A.   I cannot at this moment remember exactly that there was
32            time insertion on the video.
33       Q.   I see.   We may have to look at that.    What is the point
34            that was troubling you about this?
35       A.   One of the things I am surprised about - again, because I
36            always believed I would be called - one of the things that
37            troubled me about it, was the fact that a Liverpool police


                                          11
I
    1         officer, off duty police officer, Bruder, as I have made
    2         it clear, made a statement suggesting that there was an
    3         ambulance went on to the field, and it was the Cook Report
    4         investigators who brought it to my attention that his
    5         evidence was dismissed, because if he was wrong on the
    6         timing of the ambulance he was wrong on other areas.
    7   Q.   By whom was it dismissed?
    8   A.   It was dismissed by the Coroner.
    9   Q.   Where do you get that from?
10      A.   That is what the Coroner    said on the Cook Report.
11      Q.   The Cook Report does not    happen to be the Inquest.
12      A.   No, but the Coroner said in an interview that if PC Bruder
13           was wrong on the time of the ambulance, he was wrong in
14           other areas.
15      Q.   There has never been any question that PC Bruder was
16           assisting in this case.
17      A.   No, that is right.
18      Q.   There has never been any question.
19      A.   No, that's right.
20      Q.   And there has never been any question that he was doing so
21           after 332.     I don't know whether you are aware of that?
22      A.   No, what I am aware is what the Coroner said on the
23           television.
24      Q.   Don't worry too much about what the Coroner said on the
25           television.      I am concerned with the facts rather than
26           what people say on television interviews.      The fact of the
27           matter is that Mr. Bruder did not, so far as the best
28           photographic evidence is concerned, deal with Kevin
29           Williams until after 332.     There is a problem of the
30           timing here, but I don't think there is any reason really
31           to doubt that the ambulance that Mr. Bruder was talking
32           about was your ambulance.
33      A.   No, that is right.
34      Q.   I accept that.     There is a difficulty about the timings.
35      A.   Yes.
36      Q.   They are difficult to reconcile.




                                          12
 1   A.   Yes, they are.      They must be in those circumstances.     Ann
 2        Williams sent me PC Bruder's original statement and asked
 3        me to read his original statement.
 4   Q.    I have to try to reconcile these timings as best I can,
 5        but they are not easy to reconcile. I am not sure what the
 6        problem is.      I quite appreciate that at the Inquest in
 7        Kevin Williams' case it looks as though Mr. Sawyer did not
 8        appreciate that you had been on the pitch at 1535, but
 9        that is unfortunate.
10   A.   It is.    The problem with that is, is that therefore there
11        is a good possibility that if Mr. Bruder, as he was, was
12        right about the sequence of the ambulance, he was also
13        right about other things that possibly Kevin still had a
14        pulse.
15   Q.   I am not going to argue the point with you.      I have trade
16        the point.      There is a difficulty with the timings but
17        nobody has ever questioned that Mr. Bruder was dealing
18        with Kevin Williams at some time after 1532.      There has
19        never been any doubt about that, and nobody has ever
20        questioned that.
21   A.   What they have questioned is whether or not he had the
22        other areas wrong.
23   Q.   No.   The only question,    I think, was whether he actually
24        felt a pulse.
25   A.   In my experience, off duty police officers, you would
26        normally take their word on what they say.      I believe when
27        I have read the rest that this is an experienced person
28        who deals with the situation very well.
29   Q.   I am afraid you will have to wait until you read my ireport
30        as to my conclusions about this, but I do not think you
31        need be too troubled about this aspect of the matter.
32   A.   Can I also be troubled about other aspects?
33   Q.   I don't know.     What is the problem?
34   A.   Going back to the triage point and the reason I left the
35        ground.    It is OK for you to say I should not concern
36        myself with what happened and the fact that I left
37        Victoria Hicks, but I believe it was perfectly possible to


                                        13
I
     1         set up a triage on the pitch and not at the gymnasium. I
     2         believe that was perfectly possible and should have
    3          happened, and I don't believe that was cross-examined
    4          properly either through me or the ambulance service.
    5                 The ambulance service claimed that there were 42
    6          ambulances.    that is 84 ambulance staff plus 5 ambulance
    7          officers and 25 St. John's.        Yet there was nobody there.
    8         Nobody was at the epicentre of the incident, and that has
    9         never really,    in my opinion, been fully examined.         I think
10             it is just too convenient to say,      "They were all dead ly
11            315";     I don't believe that at all.        I don't believe Sarah
12            was dead.     I believe she was wholly saveable.
13                    I cannot prove that, I know, and I stand criticism
14            from people with greater experience of trauma I have, but
15            ten years before I had dealt with a crushing case, which
16            incidentally a police officer told me not to both to deal
17            with because she was;     and she is still alive today.
18            Fifteen minutes it took getting to that scene.           Why did it
19            take so long?    Why was I left on my own?        Why did I have
20            to make decisions that I should never have had to make?
21            We could have saved people, and we didn't.          We have gone
22            round with pats on our backs and tried to pretend that
23            somehow we did a good job;        we did a bad job, and we
24            should hold our hands up and learn from i t .
25                    They say things like the crush took place at 6
26            minutes past or something like that, and therefore by 315
27            they were all dead.     Therefore any effort ---
28       Q.   Nobody has ever said that.
29       A.   Nobody has ever said that?
30       Q.   No.  That is one of the misapprehensions that people
31            suffer from.
32       A.   Well, probably you can put    meright    on    that one then.      You
33            see, that is one of the things that bothers          me, and has
34            bothered me.
35       Q.   What the Coroner said was that everybody had received the
36            injuries from which they died by then.          I don't suppose
37            you dispute that?


                                           14
I
    1   A.   No, that's right, but I wouldn't also say that therefore
    2         that had the rescue effort been dealt with differently
    3         that we would have had more people alive, because if not
    4        you might as well dispense with the entire ambulance
    5         service now, mightn't you?       A traumatic event happens.       It
    6         takes a length of time to get to that traumatic event, you
    7        deal with the situation, you go through a process, a
    8        protocol, and you do your best, and people sometimes come
    9        out of that against all the odds.        We didn't get to the
10           people, and we didn't triage the people.
11      Q.   Quite a lot of people were rescued?
12      A.   By whom?     Not by the ambulance service.
13      Q.   Right.     Is there anything else you want to tell me?
14      A.   I wanted to discuss that, but you are not happy with that,
15           are you?
16      Q.   I don't think I am here to discuss matters with you;            I am
17           here to listen to what you want to say.
18      A.   OK.     I further believe that there was a level of prejudice
19           by my senior managers on the day.
20      Q.   Prejudice?
21      A.   Prejudice.
22      Q.   What sort of prejudice?
23      A.   Prejudice against a type of person, a type of supporter
24           and the place that they came from, and I think that
25           prevented them from seeing the incident correctly.
26      Q-   What basis have you got for saying that?
27      A.
28                      was known to say, on the one hand what he called a
29           joke, but racist comments.        Ac the time when he was
30                                                     his job didn't put him
31           under a lot of pressure and
32                          He had this jibe.    He had this way of, like,
33           what we call "lining people up", and my wind up was the
34           fact of coming from Liverpool.       So he would say things
35           like,    "Check your hub caps" which is supposed to be funny
36           because Liverpool people apparently steal hub cabs, and he
37           told other jokes about Liverpool people stealing.           I

)
     1        believe                was prejudiced.   I believe he 1
     2
                                               and didn't allow himself
     3        to see what was going on because of his own prejudice.
     4   Q.   That is quite a serious allegation.
     5   A.   It is a serious allegation, and it is one that I can
     6        substantiate.
     7        If you are going to substantiate it, you have got to tell
     8        me in what way his conduct on the day - no matter whether
     9        he makes frivolous remarks in the mess day - fell short of
10            what an ambulance officer should come up with.       Have you
11            ever made this complaint to anybody before?
12       A.   Not at all.
13       Q.   Why not?
14       A.   Because I thought I would have been cross-examined about
15            it.
16            How can you be cross-examined about it if you have never
17            told anybody?
18            Because I was under the impression I would have been
19            called;    wrongly under that impression.
20            What do you say that                |did on that day which he
21            shouldn't have done, or failed to do?
22       A.   It is my belief.
23       Q.   If you are going to make these allegations, they must be
24            supported by some evidence, do you understand?      It is not
25            just a question of belief.      I am sure you realise that,
26            d o n 't you?
27       A.   I realise that I and other people were subject to jibes
28            from              and I believe that affects his judgment.
29       Q.   In wrhat way?
30       A.   After the event in the           he was telling people
31            about how many Liverpool people were drunk, and yet
32            clearly the Liverpool fans were involved with the rescue
33            effort.    They should have been praised, not criticised.
34            People drink all the time before they go to football
35            matches, and that has always, always disturbed me.




                                         16
I
     1         I am afraid that                 is not the only person who
     2         made allegations that some of the Liverpool fans were
    3          drunk.
    4          Yes, I know, but he was|                         and I thought
    5          that was wrong, a wrong opinion to have.
    6    Q.    You thought that none of them      were drunk?
    7    A.   No, I don't say that at all.      I know what it is like at a
    8          football match.     People drink and have drink before thsy
    9          go, but they were the people that were assisting me;            not
10             the ambulance service.
11       Q.   It was a distasteful remark to make?
12       A.   I always felt that;     I always felt that was aprejudicial
13            remark to make.      He should have judged the thing as it
14            was.
15       Q.   Never mind about what he said afterwards.         In what respect
16            did he fall short in his conduct on the day?
17       A.   I cannot say that.    I am not in a position      tosay that.
18             It is just a belief, and you are right, Ican       only say how
19            he tret me and other people in the ambulance station
20            previous to that, and probably that, then, is a wrong
21            thing to say about the day.       I cannot say that.     It is
22            just a belief. Probably it is a wrong belief.          I cannot
23            substantiate that except I believe I know him.
24       Q.   That is very fair, if I may say so.      I am afraid I cannot
25            act on beliefs of that sort without substantiation.          I
26            would rather not put it in my report that this is what you
27             think, because it is pretty defamatory.
28       A.   It is.
29       Q.   If you wanted to make a complaint about his conduct on
30            that day, I imagine there are procedures whereby
31            complaints can be made in the ambulance service?
32       A.   There were, but it wasn't something you did very easily.
33       Q.   No.  You have now left South Yorkshire?
34       A.   Yes.
35       Q.   Where are you now?
36       A.   Scotland.                                         —-
37       Q.   Are you still in the ambulance service?

    1   A.   No.
    2   Q.   What are you doing now?
    3   A.   I run a cycle shop and a holiday cycle distance
    4   Q.   You are on the                   |
                                              ?
    5   A.   Yes.
    6   Q.   I don't know where that is, I am afraid.          Is it
    7                ?
    8        No, it is not;    it is just off

13      Q.   Is there anything else you want to tell me?
14      A.   The only thing I can say - in my defence really - is that
15           I am here because I am disturbed by the ambulance service
16           response.    I have nothing to gain at all.        In fact,   I have
17           lots of things to lose because don't like people making
18           public statements, and I have a business and quite a
19           successful business, but I firmly believe that the
20           ambulance service should be brought into question, the
21           ambulance service response.          That's it really.
22      LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    Thank you very much.
23      A.   Thank you.
24      LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    We will send you a copy of the
25           transcript of this.     If there is anything else you want to
26           say or correct, then please do so quickly.          I am getting
27           to the end of my Inquiry now, and I need to have the
28           answers back quickly.
29      A.   Thank you for your time.
30      LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    Not at all.       Thank you for coming.

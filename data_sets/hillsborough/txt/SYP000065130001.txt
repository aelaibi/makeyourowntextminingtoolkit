         that     something            had       happened          at       the     football            g ro u n d ,          and     they were

         asking       for       doctors          and      nurses        to     go    to       the     ground             to     help,       he       heard

         congestion             I got       out     and      walked.              I made            my w a y        to L E P P I N G S

         LANE     entrance           of     the     ground         on the           way       I saw        a     lot       of    people          walking

         away     from      the      ground         I did         not       see     any       fighting              or     drunkness,                or    any

         cli s t u r ba n c e s .

         As    I got       to    the a c t u a l          entrance           at     Leppings            Lane          there         was     a    lot       of

         people       milling          about,          I got       to       the     big       blue      g ate         but       did    not       go       in at

         fir s t .      I asked a P o l ic em an                   if       I could           help and              told        him    I w as         a

         nurse       and    he      directed           me    to a d o c t o r .               I found            the       doctor         who's           n ame   I

         I walked          a short          way     with         the    riv er       on        my     r i gh t      and       the blue          gate       on

         my    left.        I stayed             near       to    this       gate,           there      was         a girl          sat     with          a boy

         leaning        against           the     railings,,            she       seemed            slightly             injured          but        alright

         and    the     boy      looked alright,                   the       doctor           was      looking             at a       boy       on    the

         ground,        and      nearby          was      a girl        wh o      w as       unconcious               but       had    been          put     in

I#       the    recovery            psoition,             and     there        was       a boy        sat       with          her,     I looked             up

         and    saw a boy who                 I thopught               at    first           w as    h urt       but       then       I noticed

         somebody          lying       at     the      s ide      of    him       covered            up,       up     to      this     poi nt         I did

         not    realise          pe o p l e      were       actually           dead,          and when              1 looked again                    I

         noticed        there        were        other       bo d i e s ,      partly           covered             up a n d        I remember

         really       sunk       in until           t his        boy    said        the m a n          l y ing        by      the     s i de     of       him

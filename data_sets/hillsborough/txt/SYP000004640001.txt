He was        standing       by an open gate              on the        right       hand side of the

was      trying      to stop     people       panicking,           as     people were            becoming       very

            to a barrier w ith the               pressure,          moving     slowly forward.              The    barrier-

            appeared       in front        of m e \ a n d    I was    sucked u n de r n e a t h       it and out        in

            front    of    it.     I noticed ti-\t                     had been turned around,                    w i t h his

            back    to the       pitch.       We were        both    in Pen     number 4 after we             came out           of

            the tunnel.



            There was       no Police         control        evident       inside     the     tunnel or on the

            terracing.           Neither were         there any S te wa rd s           present.         There w as         no

            disorder amon g s t          the fans,          nobody was       drinking         any alcohol. I did

            not a c t u a l l y see a barrier               break.



            As   I was     sucked    under       the barrier          the    pressure        began to ease a

            little.        I did not        see the         players    come on the           pitch,    I did not see

            the m at c h s t o p p e d .     All    I remember was             one    cross    from Joh n B a r n e s .

            After a while          people      star te d moving            to ease the        pressure       on the        front

                     joined me.

            During    the height          of the      crush     I remember a girl,              a ro un d    19 years,

            back    on the terracinq.               The man,         who    I think was wear*ng a uniform,

            he took       hold of her        by t h e V l a t h e s    and     took    her    thro ug h the        crowd,        I

            think he went          thro ug h towards, the             centre        tunnel.     I think       this     was

            about    five minu t e s after            the mat^ch had been s t opped a l t h o u g h                 I can't

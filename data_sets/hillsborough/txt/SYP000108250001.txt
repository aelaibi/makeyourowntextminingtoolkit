ROTHERHAM ROAD TRAFFIC



Tour of duty 15.4.89, 8 am x 8 pm.                  Nature of duty, supervision of patrols

engaged with traffic regulation at motorway intersections to the south of the

county concerned with travelling Notts Forest supporters.

Call Sign: Golf Charlie Sierra 3-

Due to the early completion of supporters being cleared from the motorway,

(Ml), I went to Brightside Lane Driving School at 1430 and took an early meal.

On receipt of the call for 'Operation Support', I took up a position in the

Police    Range    Rover,    and    escorted      four   or   five   transit   Personnel    Carriers

containing officers who had been on point duty prior to the 'kick off' to the

ground.       I approached via Penistone Road and parked my vehicle outside the

gate leading to the gymnasium area.               I entered the ground via this gate, still

at this stage not knowing what was happening inside the ground.                       I ascertained

shortly    after      entering     that   there    had   been   a    crush   and   that   there   were

numerous injuries.

At this point I saw supporters using the make shift stretchers and carrying

injured away from the pitch area to the gymnasium and area under the stand.

I noticed that supporters in the stands at either side of the entrance where

the injured were being carried were taunting and shouting at each other in a

menacing and threatening manner and I saw numerous objects being thrown out of

the   crowd    onto    the   stretcher .carriers.         I was verbally       abused by     several
supporters       during        tfhis period    and    had    fans pleading      for help and medical

assistance.             I could see that             therewas a problem due to lack of ambulances

and medical        assistance so went                out onto Penistone Road to assist with traffic

control, allowing access for ambulances and other emergency staff.                          During the

whole   of      this    time     I,   together   with       other   officers,   were   subjected   to a

continuoustorrent of verbal abuse.                     As ambulances were arriving I went back

inside the         ground,       under the stand near to the gymnasium and assisted with

injured people.           I saw there was a need for transport for 'walking wounded' as

the more serious cases were being taken away by ambulance.                         I arranged for the

Transit Mini           Buses    that we had brought from Driving School,                to be brought

inside the gates and had them loaded up with the less seriously injured.                           They

were then escorted by Police Motor Cycles to Hospital.

I resumed from the ground and went to the Traffic Garage at Claywheels Lane at

approximately 4.30 pm.                I resumed from there and took up traffic supervision

on   the   Ml    and     general      patrol   at Woodall       Service    area   until 7*30 pm.      I

returned to Main Street and went off duty at 8.00 pm.

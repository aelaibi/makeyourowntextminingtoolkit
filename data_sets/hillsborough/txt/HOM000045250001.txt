PROFESSOR SCRATON




Professor Scraton, who is coming to see you on Friday morning, has been commissioned by
the Home Office Emergency Planning Department to do some work on the way in which the
police and other authorities manage, or fail to manage, the aftermath of major disasters such
as Hillsborough. I attach the material which the Emergency Planning Department has sent
me about this.

2.      I suggest that you ignore the covering note and the blue/yellow Home Office book and
go straight to the red one, which is Scratonâ€™s (joint) work. It contains extensive material
about Lockerbie plane explosion and the Marchioness disaster as well as Hillsborough.

3.     I do not think there is anything new here for our scrutiny, but I suggest that the
Hillsborough passages on pages 51- 58 and chapter 5 (pp 79 onwards) are worth looking at
before we encounter the Professor again on Friday.

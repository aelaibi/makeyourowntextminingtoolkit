Dear Chris,

                                   Re: Hillsborough

I have received a further communication from Ann Addlington.

I enclose copies of the letter and enclosures (except the Ruling and Insp. Whiteâ€™s
Statement as you have copies of these).

When you have had an opportunity to consider the contents I would appreciate having
a word with you.



Yours sincerely,




S. L. Popper

              In April        1988       (000488)    I began e mp l o y m e n t with S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y

              F ootball       C lu b at H i l l s b o r o u g h as an a p p r e n t i c e     footballer.          I have

              since    left a nd am now unemployed.

             O n the    15th of April              1989    (150489)        I together w it h other a p p r e n t i c e s

              were e mp lo y e d on the day as               "ball       boys*.       This was       normal     procedure

              for big games              like    the semi    finals.

              We had a game              in the m or n i n g a nd then went             to the g r ou nd a nd ate          our

              lunch.        We were        s pread out b et we en the Live rp oo l a nd N o t t i n g h a m

              dre ss in g     rooms.        I stood       in the     corridor.

              I first went out by the                 players tunnel               at a bout 2 .1 5     pm   (1415)     to see

              how the       crowd was bui ld in g           up.      The K op e n d w a s q u i t e fu M         but the

              L ive rp oo l      end was        quite empty.         I was wit h                                      We

              s tayed out for a bout 5 m inutes a nd then went back 1/

               We    came     back out at about 2.45                      pm    (1445).          We have set      places where we

               go a nd me a nd                                            went     to the        posi ti on    in front of the

               S o u t h S t an d towards                the L e p p in gs Lane        ei         We both sat        in front of

               the wall.            I could              see that       the    terr ac es at L ep p in g s        Lane were

               full.        The     centre          pens      were      p a ck ad but       the outside       ones   s ee me d quite

               empty.         It never             o c c u rr ed to nyr that         there was any            problem.       The    crowd

               were     in good voice                    a nd I couod still           see      fans   coming      t hr o ug h the

               tunnel.            The    crowd           w a s ^uj^ing        back a nd f orth        in the      centre      pens.I

               could also           see fans             being    lifted up from the                terraces     into the seated

               s tand above.

               The    players           had    come out,          had their        kick a bout a nd the game               had

               k ic k ed off        I was          half wat ch in g       the game a nd the terraces.                     I saw

               uniformed           pol ic em en s tandi ng              on the     fenc in g s ig na l li n g     people      to get

               I could see a t remendous                         s*frge of      people         come from the      tunnel and

               push down the              terracii

               I then saw a pol ic em an                     run onto the          pitch a nd the          referee       s t op p ed the

               I could see numerous                       fans    being       pulled from the           pens by the         police and

               onto     the       pitch.           The    perimeter       gates were           open as well       a nd    people were           I

               being      pulled out of there.                       It was       obvious        to me that      people      had been

               s er i o u s l y    injured as they were                   laying down on the               pitch.        T h e y were

Dear Peter

Thank you for your letter of the 7th June. I have pencilled in Saturday the 14th
October, to speak on the hospital responses in major emergency. As I have only been
involved in one major emergency, I suspect I will have to confine my remarks to that
experience.

I will do ray best in what will doubtless be a general discussion. It seen® that just
about everyone has communication problems of a similar nature, and I applaud your
initiative in organising this Synposium.

Yours sincerely

Dear Courtney,

I was sorry not to be able to meet you at the recent Symposium on Disasters in
Stoke but I had an opportunity to chat to

I am organising a Symposium on Communications and Documentation for Major
Emergencies in the South Staffordshire Medical Centre at New Cross Hospital,
Wolverhampton on Saturday 14th October 1989. I enclose a provisional
Programme and wonder whether you would be prepared and able to attend to
speak on the hospital response to a major emergency. This would be with
particular reference to difficulties experienced in communications and
documentation. I hope that this Symposium will provide some practical
help to those of us involved in hospital disaster planning. Obviously
your recent experience following the Hillsborough disaster would be of
considerable interest to people and I hope to circulate this Symposium
throughout the CSA. I intend to leave plenty of time for open debate
and discussion and there will be an exhibition of relevant' communication
equipment.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours sincerely. x O _______________ ,

It was a most enjoyable meeting and I was not alone in

          Dear Courtney,

          Symposium on Communications and Documentation for Major Emergencies

          Saturday 14th October 1989

          I am most grateful to you for your contribution to the highlysuccessful
          Symposium on Saturday 14th October 1989.

           I was very pleased with the attendance for the Meeting and all the reports
           I have received have been extremely complimentary.

          I was personally most interested in hearing your views andlistening        to
          your presentation.

          There is obviously much to do in improving our response to major
          emergencies and I hope this Symposium has concentrated minds on some
          of the problems which we all know to exist. It will obviously be a
          slow process to standardise our approach at a local level but there is
          obviously the will and great enthusiasm from all concerned.

          I have pleasure in enclosing a cheque to reimburse you for your expenses
          which I hope is satisfactory.

           I also have pleasure in enclosing a small gratuity which I hope you
           will accept and find useful as Christmas approaches.

           Hopefully, we will not have to wait another twenty years to see some
           improvements in communications for these inevitable disasters.

           Yours sincerely,

    Dear Mr Crosby

    nomimmications       : Hillsborough Disaster

    Thank you for your letter of 14 September.  I was interested to hear that you
    were speaking on this subject and would be grateful to receive a copy of your
    paper in due course, along with any other information you derive from the
    symposium which may have a bearing on our emergency planning.

     In answer to your questions      s-

     (1)       As far as I know, the only cellphones used by staff  of the Sheffield
               Health Authority on the day, and, indeed, days following Hillsborough
               were my own and that used by the duty Public Health Medical Officers.
               M y telephone is a Vodaphone.

     (2)       Sheffield does not enjoy the best cellphone reception, especially (in
               relation to the areas I visited over the course of the day and following
               week) in and around Northern General Hospital.   The lower floors of the
               Royal Hallamshire Hospital are not top strength.   From my experience,
               the Vodaphone system was working throughout the period and "system
               blockage" is seldom if ever experienced in this area.

               There was no (and could hardly be) any effect on the operation of
               cellphones as a direct effect of the Hillsborough disaster or its
               aftermath (if this is the issue in your mind and behind your question).

               My principal difficulty arose from an inability to recharge batteries
               fast enough to keep up with the telephone being continuously switched on
               (from 6.00am to 11.00pm daily over several days) and used heavily for
               making calls (which drains them very fast).  In fact, additional
               batteries were purchased because of this.


                                                               /continued...

Re    : Communications   : Hillsborough Disaster


(3)     It was undoubtedly an advantage for me to have a cellphone,  not least
         because it enabled others to contact me instantly and because I could
         also continue some of my normal work whilst on the move during the days
         following the disaster.  You will appreciate, however, that I hold a
         portable cellphone for regular purposes and not specifically for
         untoward incidents or emergencies.

(4)     I am sceptical of the value of a portable telephone, except for those
         with frequent and immediate requirements to make contact/be contacted
         whilst on the move and away from normal communication s y s t em s . I doubt
         the cost effectiveness in other cases.

It is also worth bearing in mind that if you carry a phone, it is difficult to
escape it (unless you succeed - as I generally do - in restricting in-coming
calls to those that are genuinely urgent).

You do not ask for examples of the use which the telephone was put to during
the disaster and its aftermath.  If you would like some, please let my
secretary know, and I will be happy to provide a list promptly.

Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Mapplebeck

Rei Cellular Telephones during the Hillsborough Disaster

I have been asked to speak on hospital coonunications during the Hillsborough
disaster at a forthcoming Symposium in Staffordshire. It would be helpful to knew
what your experience was in using your Cellphone at the height of your activity. I
am particularly interested in the following questionss-

1, How many Cellphones were in use in the Sheffield Health District on that date?

Did you you experience any difficulty in use (e.g. poor reception or system
blockage)?

3. Did you feel it was an advantage to have such an instrument at your
administration level?

4. Could yew foresee the use of such a telephone at a local or departmental level?
I hasten to add question 4 is purely hypothetical (but if anyone is going to buy me
one I would like a red one please.

Thank you for your time.

Kind Regards

Yours sincerely

    Thank you for your letter of 19 April enclosing one from Mr
           of                     Greenford, who makes
suggestions as to how another tragedy such as that which took
place at Hillsborough might best be avoided in the future.

    As you know, an enquiry under the Chairmanship of Lord
Justice Taylor has been formed to investigate the events of
Hillsborough and to make recommendations.   In the circumstances
I have therefore forwarded yours and your constituent's
correspondence to Mr R Whalley, Secretary to the enquiry, who can
be contacted at this address.  Your constituent's letter also
suggested that all professional football should be suspended
indefinitely and a Minister should be appointed with full powers
to reorganise its structure.  In view of the fact that Mr Colin
Moynihan is the Minister responsible for Sport, I am copying this
correspondence to his office at the Department of Environment in
order that they may deal with thes;e particular points in your
constituent's letter.

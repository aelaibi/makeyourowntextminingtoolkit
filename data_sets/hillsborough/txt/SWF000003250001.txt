TO ALL CLUBS



Dear Secretary,

                                Anti-Hooliganism Measures

    Further to the Divisional Meetings on 29th January, 1987, and a further
meeting with the Government officials on Monday, 23rd February, I can now
inform you that the Government Ministers, Mr Richard Tracey and the Hon.
Douglas Hogg have endorsed the proposals embodied in the League's comprehensive
Report of November 1986 - save that they required specific action to be taken
by the Clubs on the subject of Membership Schemes.

     This action is along the lines detailed to Clubs at the meetings on 29th
•January, and is as follows

        1)      All Clubs are asked to develop and introduce membership schemes
                 for specific designated areas of their grounds by the beginning
                 of the 1987/88 season.   These areas should be reserved for
                 members only.  Non-members would not be admitted. The schemes
                 should cover at least 50 % of each ground's capacity as determined
                 by the conditions of the ground's safety certificate.   Clubs which
                 cannot attain 50 % should identify the percentage they can meet.
                 Advice may be obtained from Andy Williamson re points of detail.

        2)      Clubs who feel that they are unable to meet the requirements for
                 50% Membership Schemes will be able to make representations to
                 a Special Committee consisting of representatives from the League,
                 The Football Trust and independent advisors.  If, after discussion,
                 it is agreed by the Special Committee, the club and the local
                 Police that they are unable to meet the 50% requirement, then the
                 Club will be expected to show that they are taking adequate
                 alternative measures.  Should this be the case, their position will
                 be accepted by the Government.  If the Club is not able to convince
                 the Committee, they may become liable to a charge under F.A.
                 procedures for failing to implement the recommendations on
                 Membership.


                                                                          / C o n t d .2
                                    -   2   -




    Whilst appreciating that the principle of membership schemes is a complex
matter, there is a requirement for all Clubs to respond quickly so that
designated areas are identified in time for sale of season tickets, etc., for
next season.

    In addition to the above, the following points were also agreed between
the League and the Government

    a)     All Clubs are required to submit detailed local plans for dealing
           with the management and control of home and away supporters as per
           the attached document. These plans must be produced as soon as
           possible and they must be drawn up in consultation with the local
           police, local British Transport Police, the   local authority and
           other relevant organisations such as local coach operators and
           recognised supporters clubs.   These plans will be available to the
           F.A. in the event of a disciplinary commission.

    b)    The League, the Football Association and the clubs, with advice
           from the local Police, will consider the need  for all ticket
           arrangements at particular m a t c h e s .

    c)    The League will commission a study by independent consultants to
           report on the scope, costs and benefits/disadvantages of a
           reciprocal membership scheme embracing all 92 League C l u b s . The
           Association of Chief Police Officers have agreed to assist with the
           advice on this study.

    d)    Football Trust grants will be made available to Division Three and
           Four Clubs for the installation of closed circuit television
           depending on the particular needs of individual clubs.  Clubs who
           have not yet applied should review their requirements.

    e)    The League and the Football Association will support and promote the
           development of family enclosures and other initiatives designed to
           establish closer links between clubs and their communities.




    The Management Committee need your urgent co-operation in order to be able
to report back to the Government at the earliest opportunity.

                               Yours sincerely,
                                  LOCAL PLANS

Dear Sir,

Re:    Membership Scheme/Local Plan

Please find enclosed, as requested, the proposal for a membership scheme here
at Hillsborough.

At present the capacity of the stadium stands at 54,324.                                       This ccmpri ses: -

Kop (Hone Supporters Standing)                                                  21,000
South Stand covered .)       • Home                                              5,567
South Stand uncovered)     Supporters                                            3,310
North Stand            )     Seating                                             9,882
West Stand (Visiting Supporters Seating)                                         4,465
Leppings Lane (Visiting Supporters Sestifle)                                    10/~~
                                                                                54,324


If we deduct the parts of the ground allocated to visiting supporters then we
are left with 39,724 of capacity; and of this balance some 21,000 is on the
Kop.

I have had meetings with the South Yorkshire Police who have stated
categorically that they do not want the Kop to fall within the scope of a
membership scheme, as it is the only area of standing accommodation for home
supporters and cannot be partitioned.

                                                                               continued . . .

           In light of this advice we were left with the natural choice to designate the
           next biggest area, the North Stand, as our membership area. Its capacity of
           9,882 would mean that 24.87% of the available capacity would be within a
           membership scheme.

           Whilst we fully acknowledge and accept the target of 50% grounds such as
           Hillsborough, with large capacities, present special difficulties, and taking
           in account the advice of the local police I trust that you will find the
           scheme as proposed acceptable.

           A copy of my local plan is attached to this letter,

           yours faithfully,

Dear Sir,

Re:   Local Plans/Safety Certificate

Thank you for your letter dated IP.th August 1°88, amendments to air local
plans for the ccnino season are as follows:

1} Hie capacity in the North Stand (ie. members stand) is reducer] by 180 to
9,702 places. This is to accommodate a new disabled facility here at the
ground. This in turn makes total-capacity of the ground 54,101.

2)    A copy of the admission prices for the current season are enclosed.

3) This year cur membership scheme has been altered slightly in that cuest
tickets are available for purchase but these must be collected and paid fcr
prior to the day of the match.

4)    The restaurant licence is now in the name of our new Caterinq Manager,


I confirm that we are still not in the possession of a full Safety certificate
frcm the Local Authority but I understand from them that it is in an advanced
stage cf drafting and I win, of course, forward you a copy as soon as it has
been received.

Ycurs faithfully,



G.H. Mackrell
Secretary

               THORNE         SUB    DIVISION          AS,      ROSSINGTON



               On      Saturday       15 A p r i l        1989,       I came       on    d u t y at       8 . 0 0 a.m.    at, Edlirigton

               At      8 . 4 0 a.m.       I paraded            in the       car    park       opposite          Divisional

               charge         of S e r i a l     30.      Other        members          of    t hi s     Serial    were    Police

               D awson and           consisted            totally          of    eight       Police       Constables       and    a

               Sergeant.             The     Serial        then       travelled          in a m a r k e d P o l i c e      transit        van

               At      about     9 . 4 0 a.m.       we    a r r i v e d at H i l l s b o r o u g h         football       ground,        where

               we      were    deployed          i n to    the N o r t h         Stand       for    briefing.        We    w e r e then        .

                                                                                                                                       R 74

given a         packed          lunch         w h i c h we        consumed           w h i l s t in      the      s ta n d .




At     1 1 . 1 5 a .m .        we    took      up      out     positions             at       the r o u n d a b o u t     at    the

junction with                  Leppings           Lane       and Penistone                   Road     North,          outside         the     Old

Owl      Service          Station.             Ou r     duties          were       to    keep       rival        fans     apart.             Th e

Liverpool            supporters               arriving            from       the     West       and     the N o t t i n g h a m F o r e s t

supporters            coming          to      the      Spion Hop             end.




Close         to the       ground           it was        fairly           quiet        to    begin        w ith,       but    as     lunch

time      approached                more      and more            f a ns     carne to         the     ground.             1 was

approached            by a n u m b e r            of    fans        during         this       time      wh o     were     all       looking

f or     tickets          to    buy.          In S e r i a l        30,      there       were       t wo     people       who       had

personal            radios,          th e     Serial         Sergeant,             Police          Sergeant           Ashton        had      one

allocated            to    h i m at         the     ground          and Police               Constable           243 Landers,                wh o

is a C o m m u n i t y          Constable,              h ad      his      with      him.          Police        Constable            Landers

was      on    duty       only       feet      away       from       me w h e n         I heard a message                      come    over

the      r a di o    that       there         was      trouble          at    t he      Royal       Public        House        which         is

near      to    the       g round        at    the N o t t i n g h a m F o r e s t              End.




From where            I was          positioned              1 could          see       up    from      the      roundabout            up the

road      towards          the       r a i 1w a y      sta ti on w h e re            the      Liverpool           s u p p o r t e r s we r e

arriving.             There         was       by now a            constant           s t r e a m of      supporters             walking

f r am t h i s di r e c t i o n             down       t o w a rd s t he       g ro u n d .        At    a     p o i nt   a too ut

halfway         up    the       h il l      1 could          see     that      a     large         number        of    poeple         were

s tandi n g i n t he                street        out s i de a          pub 3.i c. ho us e .            I do      no t k n o w        t he

n am e    of    it,       but       I also        saw     t ha t     all      the       coaches         t ha t    were        arriving

were      being       directed              to a       parking          area       near       to    this       pub.



At     about        2.00       p.m.      the      flow       of     supporters               was    becoming          more      a nd more

on     the     edge       of    the      forecourt             of    the     Service            Station.              I became         aware
of    a group         of a b o u t       12 to         15 L i v e r p o o l                supporters             wh o     were       beginning

to    argue     with S Nottingham                       Forest                fans.             I approached               th e     group and

told     both        parties          to m o v e       on.           A1thouhh               the       atmosphere              between          the

r ival      f a ns    was    hostile,             there             was       no    trouble            and      everyone            e ls e     had

moved       away.          Police       Constable                   Landers            arid P o l i c e         Constable             Kitson         at

this     time        had    gone       inside          the          service            station            to    tr y a n d         s or t     out    a

vehicle        which        had       been       parked             on    the       forecourt               without           permission.




Throughout            the    later          part       of       the       morning               I saw a n u m b e r            of     f a ns

walking        about        carrying             cans       of a l c o h o l               and    I indeed            informed               several

of    them     t ha t      there       wa s      a good             chance          they would                 not    be      allowed          into

the    ground         if t h e y       were       d ru n k .             As    t he        time       got      nearer         to    the       kick

off    time      I saw       fans        drinking               from          c a ns       of    b e er     one      after         the       other,

a s . if to      be     trying         to     drink         them          all,         so       they      d i d n ’t h a v e        to       leave

them     Outside           the    ground          when          they          went         in.        There       were        stil'J. fans

enquiring            about       spare        tickets               at    this         time.



At    about     2.50        p.m.       I noted          a n d in d e e d               c o m m e n t ed        t o P o 1 1 c e C o nst a fa1e

kitson       that       there         were       s t il l       a    large          number            of L i v e r p o o l         fans       heading

towards        the      ground.             At    one       p o i nt          there         were       so m a n y        t h at     not       all    of

them     could walk              on    the       pavement                and       they         had    to      s pill      onto       the      road.




At    about     3.00        p.m.       the       Serial             gathered               on    the      corner         of    the       junction

Leppings        Lane        and       Penistone             R o a d.           We      were       going         to    go      into P h a s e         two

of    our    duties         which        wa s     to    be on             standby-/              but      we    heard         over       a    radio

that     there        was    a    p r o b l e m at          the          turnstiles               at      the L e p p i n g s         Lane      End.




Over     the     r a d io    1 could             hear       a       lot       of    supporters                 singing         arid a P o l i c e

Officer's            voice       w h i c h was         saying             that         a    l a rg e      number         of    f a ns        were

outside        the      ground         pushing          against                on e        of    the      ga t es .        1 then            heard

                                                                                                                                                    fct7^

                                                                                                                                           R74

someone          shouting             over     the     fans          sinking,          requesting               the    game         be h e l d

up    fo r      15 m i n u t e s        to a l l o w      the        fans      outside          to      get     in.       I believe

this       request          was       turned        down.            I then         heard       someone            saying        that

people          at    the        front        of the      crush were                getting          injured          and      that        one; of

the    gates         was         becoming damaged.                     I then         heard          that       it w a s       going        to be

necessary             to    open        the    gate       in o r d e r         to    relieve            the     pressure            at     the

f ro n t .      I then          heard        the    order        to     open        the      gate.



After        a few         seconds           1 heard       that         all     available               officers          were        to

attend          on the          track        around       the        s id e    of    the      pitch,          at    which        we      started

to m a k e       our w a y         to    t he L e p p i n g s         Lane      End.          I never           heard       anything

else       on the          radio        after       that,        but w h e n         we      got     to    the      Leppings             Lane

end    turnstiles,                 I heard          that        ambulances             had      been       requested.                 We w e r e

told       to    form       a    cordon        outside           the      ground.             At     this       time      we     had       no

idea what             had        h a p p e n e d i ns i d e .         There         were     s t i ll      a number            of     fans

outside,             some        of     them       drinking, some              of     them         had     tickers          which

they         showed         to     us    and       asked        if    they      could         go     in.




A n amtou1a n c e           t h e n ar r i v e d a n d           stopped            j us t    inside          the     gate .          I then

saw    a youth             being        carried        out       of     the     ground          to      the a m b u l a n c e .            I saw

the    ambulance                man     trying       to    resuscitate                 him,        but     they       then       just       left

him and went                back        to    get    another            youth        who      I saw w ith a               resuscitator

on    hi s f ac:e .             We w e re a 11         then          told      to    go      into       the G r o u n d .           As we

walked          past       the     ambulance,             I could             see    the y o u t h         i ns id e ,      he      looked

as    if he w a s           d e ad.




As    we     walked         around           a wall       into        the      yard       behind          the W e s t       S t a n d we

were       confronted              by    the       sight     of       people         l y in g      on     the      floor       with        other

people          resuscitating                 them and at t e n d i n g                to     injuries.               There         were        a

number          of   fans        also        who    were     walking            about,          swearing            and     shouting                at
                                                                                                                                         PAGE
                                                                                                                                         R74

 us a n d P o l i c e              Officers          who were           already            in the        ground.            I saw       one        fan

 pushing           a Policeman                 about       and     shouting,               " I T ’S Y O U R      F U CK I N G FAULT".

 As     we    neared           to       the    tunnel       which          le a d s      onto     the     terracing              other    f a ns

 which        were       coming           out       of    the    ground           shouted         at     us,     it's       too    late       no w

 and     started          swearing.




 As     I entered              onto       the       terracing           I saw          that      there     wa s       several        hundred

 people          milling            about       on the          p it c h .        1 then made             my way        onto       the    pitch

 via     one       of    the        perimeter             fence        g a t e s , I think             it w a s       number       4.     I

 then        saw    people              lying       on    the    grass          n e ar     to    the     goal.         As    I entered

 onto        the    pitch           I ran       behind          the     goal       to w h e r e        I saw      people          passing

 bodies          out     through              a hole       in the          fence         onto     the     pitch.            Further       along

 :i: t h e n s a w a           large          number       of    bodies           piled         up on     top     of    each       oth e r,          1

 could        not       sa y       how m a n y       there       was       as     legs        and arms          were    all       t an g led

■ up.        1 then        saw          that    a m an who             was       conscious          was       trying        to    free

 himself           from        th e      bodies.           So    along          with another              officer           w h o had

 arrived with                  a    pair       of    step         l a d d e r s , Ic l i m b e d         up     the    fence and          l e an t

 over        the    top        of       the    fence.             A 11h o u g h          Ic o u 1 d r e a c h    the    hands       of    the

 man-,       I could           not       get- a g r i p           of    h i m a n d he          could     not     move       as he was             up

 to     his      thighs            in    the    bodies,          the       weight          of    which        held     him       fast.         I

 then        dimed        down           the    fence       and        started           to a s s i s t    with        making       the       h ol e

 As     f a ns     pulled           at    it    from       the     i n s id e,         myself       and    a senior              officer       who

 h ad a w h i t e         band           on    his       hat,    kicked           at     it     from     the     outside.           On

 getting           the    hole           larger          I helped          to     carry         a f an    from        the    terracing

 onto        the    pi t c h .           He    was       passed       to     us    by      fans     who    were        on the

 te r raci n g „




 I saw       several           police          officers           on       the    terracing             behind        the     goal       who
                                                                                                                                         PAGE

were      being        pushed about                   and     hit       by    some        f an s      but     it w a s     not     possible

to     h ea r    what       was       sai d.          The     bodies          I saw         piled          up w e r e    all      just

behind          the    goal          to    the    left       as y o u         stood         on     the      pitch       looking         at    the

stand and             they were             all       right        at    the       front         of    the       terracing,         right

under      the        top       of    the       fence.



The      youth        who       I had       been       p as sed,         I helped             carry         to    the    side      of    the

left      goal        post,          but    there          w as    no    room        to     put       him     down      so w h i l s t       t h re e

others          held       him       1 helped          to     take       th e      g o al     net      down w h i c h made              more

room.           I then went                back       to    the     hole        in      the      fence       where       I assisted             to

carry       another             male       youth       on to        the       pitc h.            He w a s        passed      to    me    by

fans      from        the       terracing.                 The     y o u t h was          motionless,              but     very warm            and

was      blueish           in       colour.           On    finding           a space            to    lay       him    down      myself        and

another          Police             officer       started           to       try and          revive          him.       I searched             for

a    p u ls e    but       could          not    find       one.         He     appeared              to    be    dead.        Someone

then      came a n d            took       over       from        us.        1 think          it w a s       an ambulance               man.         1

was      then asked                 by a w o m a n         Police        C o n s table           to    try a n d        find      some

oxygen          for    a    person          she       was     resuscitating,                     so    I found a medical

p e r s o n w ho       was          going       around.            All       the     time        I could          see    p eo p l e ,    fans

and      officers           alike,          trying          to     resuscitte               p eo pl e,        s o me    injured         p eo p l e

M/ho b e g a n        to    breathe             again,        were       being          sick ,        others       were     just, b e in g

covered          up by          clothing          because           there          was      no m o r e       to    be    d on e    for       them.




A il     the     time       people          were       running           about          shouting            and    cr y in g,      trying          to

find      persons           they          had    lost.            I was       then approached                     by a m a n w h o           had

l os t    his     young             son    so    1 told           him where             the      injured would              be     taken

and      pointed           out       where       to    go     in o r d e r         to     find        out m o r e       information.                 1

then      saw     t h at        a    l a rg e    part       of     the L i v e r p o o l           supporters            began      to       s u r ge

towards          the       Nottingham             Forest           supporters               who       had    been       taunting         them,

so     I went         to    the       centre          of    the     pitch          where         I met       other       members         from
                                                                                                                                            PAGE             :

            Serial        30.        We    then    formed          a    line       across          the     pitch and          stopped       any

            further         Liverpool            fans       from       going       towards          the     kop.        We    stayed       in the

            centre        of    the       pitch     u nt i l      about         5.15     p.m.       when,       in c o m p a n y w i t h

            Police        Sergeant            Ashton,        we     returned            to    the     roundabout             on P e n i s t o n e

            R o a d North.



            Whilst        in the          centre       of    the       pitch       I saw       several          scuffles           broke    out

            between         the      f a ns     in the       seated          area       and    I saw P olice                Officers

 ^          trouble.            Once       outside          the     ground         I never          saw any           further       trouble         and

             refreshments.



             At     about      7.10       p.m.    we    received             information              to    stand       down       so we

             returned          to    our      Transit        van and            returned,          to D o n c a s t e r      arriving

             I    have     policed         at    Hillsborough                on    one       other       occasion when Sheffield

             Wednesday          played          Newcastle           United         in the          league.            I did     no I. P o l i c e       at

             the      location         I was      at    on     this         day,    but       I was        on    the    other       end    of

             Leppings          Lane       near    to a       parade          of    shops,          where        the    away     supporters

             were       arriving.             There     was       very       little          trouble        on t h is        day    despite         a

             l ar g e    turnout          of N e w c a s t l e      fans.

                 packed meal.       During meal break and prior to going to our patrol

^    | 2^        area,   a senior officer,    believed Ch. Supt. Duckenfield,            was moving

                 around casually speaking to Serial Sergeants ensuring that any young

                 officers were fully briefed and if we were aware of the geography and

                 size of the event.

                 After this serial 33 made its way to its patrol area.                  We met at The

                 Travellers Pub,     Penistone Road North. We were to supervise Liverpool

                 fans arriving via A61-Halifax Road-Penistone Road North between The

                Travellers Pub and Wadsley Bridge Station.               Cars to be directed off

                 coaches would be sent to Halifax Road to disembark              passengers.

                At The Travellers Pub we were approached by the licensee,                 who told us

                 the pub would not open for business today due to problems he had last

 year with Liverpool      fans.    At the rear of the pub about             12 fans were

  sat drinking been and playing football.            All were moved on and

 advised to go to the ground.

  In company with PC 2749 Allen, walked to our point Penistone Road

 North opposite junction with Wardsend Road North outside funeral

 Home,   J. Fairest.

  There was a pub opposite but this was          closed to Liverpool          fans.

  Liverpool    fans were already arriving by car,         bus and van.         At one

  stage whilst Sgt. Atkins with us heard of a stolen car from Liverpool

  being found by a Special Constable.

  As fans walked                                                  f beer,    lager,    etc.

  leaving     the ground than were heading for it.

  Enquiries    revealed they were either going to The Fox Pub on                Fox Hill

  Road or     looking for an off-licence to buy beer.

  The Fox    appeared to be a meeting point for many groups of fans.

  Whenever    possible fans were advised to go to the ground early and

  those without tickets not to approach the ground.                 This advice was

  not taken by. a«y-fctrartr"! caT^“Tecarir;~~

Fox Pub.

A Special Train due to arrive at E .OSpm          <1402) arrived early 1 .50pm

(1350) approx.     Its passengers were quickly marshalled outside Wadsley

Bridge Station then escorted towards the ground.             Only a few of this

group were drinking,      but there were some without tickets as they were

asking for any spares as they passed.

I saw one man -who appeared to be selling tickets as I approached he

saw me and moved off into the crowd.

The train crowd were      in good humour and gave little or no cause for

concern.

As kick off time got nearer the pace of fans quickened from fast

walking to trotting to running.         A lot seemed to be coming out of Fox

Hill Lane and must have been drinking           right up to the last minute.

They were obviously trying to make up for lost time.

Some time near to 3pm      (1500) when we were walking towards Travellers

Pub with Sgt. Atkin,      overheard a radio conversation between an

officer on Leppings Lane turnstiles,           he was having problems with a

late build up of Liverpool       fans and that things were getting out of

hand,   someone would get hurt if matters weren't sorted out quick.

Also heard a request for a possible delay of kick off to give time to

get fans   in and I got the impression that there would be a delay.

ground at Leppings Lane to asist with the problem.               At roundabout

Leppings Lane, Penistone Road met with another Doncaster serial and

Insp. Millett    (A1) and an unknown Ch.        Inspector.

We set off for Leppings Lane turnstiles           in a hurry.     On arrival there

were several    police horses and uniformed officers about,           but no great

                           crush of people.

                           We cordoned off the turnstiles,         but there were quite a few Liverpool

                           fans the worse for drink who kept insisting to get in.                    We were not

                           aware of what had happened until         I saw a casualty being brought out of

                           the ground by a PC who immediately gave mouth to mouth.                    As an

                           ambulance arrived,     we were directed through a large open gate into

                           the area behind the Leppings Lane terrace.

                          { The re I saw many people laid out with police and other fans giving

                           to the terraces.      There   I was confronted with on my right             in one pen

                           a pile of people, all      on top of each other, the Police and fans

                           confusion I made my way onto the pitch through this pen.                    An

                           ambulance had arrived behind the goal.             I went to the gate in the

                           fence where fans were trapped and with another officer,                   pulled one

                           fan out and clear.      We carried him to a clear spot immediately behind

                           the goal net,    the area was littered with people and began

                           resuscitation.     I gave mouth to mouth.          The other PC gave heart

                           massage.    This wej^-'-tflT^for 5-10 minutes ancflthere was no response.

                           again attempt made to resuscitate, again no response.                    Body

                           similarly marked on right hand.

enough equipment            to deal with this.     It was becoming obvious that

this was a major disaster and many were dead or seriously injured.

Liverpool      fans were also helping their own and many did a great job,

Sadly many caused trouble,            picking fights with Police, abuse,

                          iTig, also obstructing   rescue.               '

I was kicked twice whi 1s^T~'fcrying to resuscitate people and #p>*3 t on by

L i v e rpool f a n s .

By now the whole of the goal area                              ,wit^t the dead and

injurtd.       Many in a state of shock, many trying t*/ find best^J>-fends.

Fire Service        personnel appeared on the terracing and ambulancemen.

Small groups of Liverpool            fans were still    causing problems for Police,

By now someone had begun to clear bodies and injured from the pitch

losing 'makeshift' stretchers from advert'fteftfdings.

Bodies were removed to the gym,             I conveyed two, one male and one

female.      On each return to Le^'ppi/rgs* -fc4tie terrace confusion was still

apparent,      no se'fri'd'? "off icer had appeared to take control.         I saw at

least 3 Inspectors all as Confused as we were as to what was

happening next.

By now the area had been cleared of bodies,                  only those who were

shocked and searching for lost friends and relatives remained.

Liverpool      fans were still       causing problems on the terracing, missiles

must have been thrown.             PC Robinson from Bentley was hit on the back

of the head by an unknown object,             probably a coin.

During all this            I heard 3 PA announcements - 1.       Early on an appeal

for calm.         H.      Kenny Dalglish.     3.   Late on to cancel     the game.

Then at last we got an order from Supt.               to fall back and form a line

then gently usher everyone off the pitch and terracing out of the

ground.

Met up with other officers from A3 Sub Division but only one from my

serial PC S091 Highton.

           Eventually met with rest of serial 33 outside ground.

           By now it was apparent many lives had been lost either on the

           terracing or at the turnstiles.

           I do recall,   whilst serial 33 on its way to Leppings Lane,   that a

           request was made over the radio to open a gate and that request was
                                                                                     x
           granted,   I believe that came from the Police Control and was due to a

           crush outside the ground at Leppings Lane.

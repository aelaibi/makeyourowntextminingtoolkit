                            extremely           emotional,         c r y i n g , screaming                and   shoutings

                            "People        are    dying      out    ther e,            and you're          standing           h ere

                           All      this    time       the   gate was             being       p ushed,      the     bottom             of

People         were         s till       coming         up o b v i o u s l y      distressed,             saying

"Police            and      people          are    getting           c ru s h e d ,    somebody          is

going         to    get       killed."

Sh or tl y after                 t h is PC        346 Thompson              forced          his    way    through

a turnstile.                     He a p p r o a c h e d me           clutching          his       r ib a r e a ,

gasping            for      breath.           He    was       obviously           distressed.                 I directed

him     to     one       sid e      to a i d       recovery.

By     this        time       there         were    several           youths          climbing          over

At     this        t i me     we    were      still          getting        abuse       and       the    *A * g a te

looked         about          to g i v e      way.           There       was     a great          need    to     relieve

the      congestion                outside         in    order        to m i n i m i s e       the      r isk    of

A    short         time       la ter        came    the       order       to     open       the    gates.          The

gate      supervisor                employed            by    the     c 1ub      released          the    b ul k      and

had     to     leap         to     one      side    to a v o i d         being        crushed.           All     the

only      stand          to      the     si de     and       shuffle        people          along       and     prevent

ourselves             and        others       from       in jur y.          I saw several                people

with      tickets             in the i r h a n d s .

As     the     crowd          of    between 300               to S 0 0         people s t a m p ed ed           through

t he    gate        I personally                  had    to       give a s s is ta nc e           and    reassurance

to     one     man about               26 years          of age.            He was          obviously           suffering

from      the       after          effects         of    being        crushed.              He w a s     clutching

The     gate        was       closed a fter              the       above       number        had     been allowed

through.           Myself         and    others        went        outside       the       gates       to    take

stock.        There         were    approx imately 200                    to 3 0 0     people          still

outside.           I saw a m i dd le             aged man            pushing         the    crowd.

P C G o o d w i 11 a d v i s e d        him    of     his       actions.

PC    2281    Parker         and myself              again       opened        the    gates       to a l l o w

one    p e r s o n at       a t ime      to    enter,           pr ior    to    showing          their

tickets.

At    this    time      there       were mo unt ed               officers,           but    I c ann o t

say what        number.            The       scene     outside           looked       calm and

several       police         officers           under       the      direction         of    Ins p , Sykes

were    still       outside         the L e p p i n g s          Lane     end.

After       being     outside           the     gates       for a p p r o x i m a t e l y 3        to       10

minutes       there         was    a call        from Police              Control          for    all

available          officers         to a t t e n d         the     perimeter          track       in s i d e

the    grounds.

Together        with        other       members        of       the C & V u n i t           I ran

inside       the    ground.             We    had     to    shout        at a n d     ph ysically move

people       who    we re     s t a n d i ng     on    the       steps        giving       access       to       the

field.

On    entering        the     fiel d,         I saw        several        hundred          fans    on the

fie l d .     Many      police          officers           were     already          present.           I

thought       it w a s       a no rm a l       case        of    pitch        invasion       and       so    formed

a    cordon     on the        field          n ear    to    the     perimeter          t rac k .        After

a short while               I left       the     cordon and              started       directing             people

to    sit    down     on the        perimeter              tra ck.

Following          t hi s    I saw       several           f ans    climbing          over       the    fence

from    the     terraces.               It    seemed        st ill       to    be a    pitch       invasion

during       which      several          fans        had    sustained           inj ury .         I went          to

the    aid    of    several         fans       who     were        l y i ng    on the       field,          putting

them    int o      recovery         positions              and     checking          their       levels          of

responsiveness.                   When        they       recovered              I di r e c t e d      them       to the

perimeter          track         to     sit       down,       so    t ha t we         could      get       a better

picture         of w h a t       was     happening.                Th e re was             so m u c h      confusion.

I was      to    the      r i gh t      of    the       goal       looking           towards        Leppings

Lane     I could          not     see m u c h           of w h a t       was      happening           on    the       o t he r

si de.       Too       many      people           were     rushing about                   several         fans       and

police       officers            started           to    break          the a d v e r t i s i n g       boards

and    using       t h e m as         stretchers.                  They were            brilliant.               One

middle       a g e d m a n a p p r o a c h e d me               and      stated         he w a s      a Charge

N u r s e , offering             his     services.                 I directed              h i m to     several

people       l y in g     on the         f ie l d .

I approached              one     youth           lying       on    the      field.           His     eyes       were

rolled       into       the      " ba c k     of    his       head"        and       he w a s    foaming          at

the     mouth.           I spoke         to       him    to a s c e r t a i n         if     he w a s      OK.

He    said      " F uck     off,        leave       me     a l o n e , I ’m a l r i g h t . "              He

smelled         strongly          of     drink.            I advised              him      regarding            his

position          so    t ha t    he     could          breath          properly.

Following          this       the N o t t s         Forest          f a ns      at    the     Spion        end    of

the     ground         started          j e e r i n g at        the L i v e r p o o l         fans      and      this

angered         them and          several           Liverpool              fans       charged         towards           the

Hop.       I gave         c h as e      and       grabbed          hold      of      two     youths        shaking

them and         saying          " W h a t *s it g o i n g              to a c h i e v e , the re are

            I am a medical             doctor and      I qu alified from Sh e f f i e l d U n iv er s i t y         in

            1987 000087.             My qualifica ti ons are MB,               ChB.

            On    1st F e b r u ar y    1989 0 1 0 2 8 9    I began working as a senior                 house officer

            at the Accide nt and Em e r g e n cy De par tme nt                   of the Nor th er n General

            Hospital       in Sheffield.

            On S a t u r d a y    15 April     1989    150489        I was     off work^yf'lf normal           day off

            and     in the a f t e r n o o n   I /as       visiting        friends.      In my friends        house       in

            Sheffield,           about 3 . 3 ^ p m   1535 the tele<              >in was     sw itched on a nd        I

            learned that           something had happened a f H i l l s b o r o u g h football                  ground         in

            Sheffield.            I was aware        that a game was            being    played there         between

            Liverpool        and N o t ti n g h a m Forest.

            In the belief            that   doctors would be               required,     or may be required,              I

            te le p h o n e d the hospital           where     I work        but was unable       to get a reply.               I
                                                                                                                     PAGE
                                                                                                                     S3177

         decided then that as there was                        no reply tfmt          something was amiss and

         so    I drove at once to the N o r t h e rn Genjeral Hospital.                                          /

         I ar r i v e d about 3.4£fpm 1545.                  I wenJr straight            to the Accident, and

         E m e r g e n c y De pa l a m e n t .    On my ar r i val         I saw Mr W A R D R O P E , a          sultant

         in the hospital,                    he gave me          charge of a patient o                    trolly who

         was    u n c o nscyfus and told me to take him to treatnj^fTt room C whi ch is

         situatafalong             the    corridor        from the main           rescusi ta tio n       room.

         Th^Pe were a number of doctors and nurses                                in all       of the    rooms       leading

         off the main          corridor,          all    busily treating           patients.        There were          no

         members       of the      public         in the entrance ar e a on my arrival.

         I w h ee le d the young man on the stretcher                            to the treatment          room.        I was

         accompanied          by a nurse.            I have never seen this                lady before and             I do

         not    believe       she was       from this hospital.                  She did wear a nurses

         uniform.         On arrival             in treatement        room there was one other               patient

         Duri ng     the time        I spent        in treatment           room C oth er jra tie nt s a rr i v e d for

         me to examine and treat.                       In all    I dealt wijj^^- or 5 young men,                     all

         havi ng fits and all               u n c o n s c i o u s , all    ragflfived similar       t r e a t m e n t , given

         oxygen and         line drips.            All    of these         patients were young white males,

         the you ngest          probably about            14 years and the            rest older         but all       still

         in their       teens.        All    of these        patients were adm it te d to this                   hospital.

         I also      received visits               from senior        consultants Mr GE TTS Dr RYAN and Mr

         W AR DR OP E amongs         them.

The    room sometimes            had 3 or 4 patients            in the      room to be treated.

Other     doctors        did come      throrfrejh the    room to treat         patient?

All    the   patients         I aj^mded        to wore      blue jeans wi th^^dark hair and               red

Liverpool        footb^j^r shirts            on.     I do not know tf^T names          of any of these

people.       I r^mber            that      none of them       left treatment        room C conscious.

About 3pm        1700 I left          the department,          after    it was    clear.     I went       into

the    physio th er ap y de partment where               people    from the football          ground

were    being        treated for minor             injuries,    ankle    sprains and the          like.

Ar o u n d this       time a lady was          bought    into the ac cident and em e r g e n c y

department                                                                  She   had not    been to the

football      match.          I assisted       in treating       this    lady.

I remained           in the ac ci de nt and emer ge ncy depar tm ent              until     8pm 20 0 0 at

w h i c h time       I left      the hospital,         which by now was quiet.

I should explain that                 the normal       r es usc it at ion   room is immeditely off

the entrance           to the ac ci de nt and e m e rg en cy department.                  I was   not

involved       in this        room.        Other   nearby    rooms were      being used as

ad ditional          r es us ci ta ti on    rooms and this       includes        the room in wh ic h      I

worked,      treatment           room C.       This    room is no rm all y used for minor

0 pe rat i o n s .

1 did not examine any dead bodies or                         pronounce      life extinct      on any

patient.         The     plaster      room became       the mortuary,         I w a s n ’t in this      room,

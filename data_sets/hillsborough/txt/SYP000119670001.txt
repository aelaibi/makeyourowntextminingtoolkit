                 At Sam      "15 April        1989      I commenced duty at West B^r Police S t a t i o n                     for

                 briefing        in relation to the FA Cup Semi                     Final    between N o t t i n g h a m

                 Forest and Liverpool.

                 Phase     1 of my serials               (11)    duty c o m menced about 9. 3 0 a m at the Midl a n d

                 Station,       Sheaf Street.              We were s pe ci fi ca ll y detailed to supervise

                 the arrival          of N ot ti n g h a m Forest         Football     supporters       trave l l i n g    by

                 rail and their             s u bsequent        escort    by PSV to Hillsborough.

                 The     early arrivals were               very orde r l y a l t h o u g h   in general         spirits were

                 high.      The     later the arrivals                 the higher    the spirits.          It was

                 a p p arent    that alcohol            was a major        influence       towards     this.      I believe

                 I travelled          on the          last PSV escorting         the Forest        supporters.          These

                 were     under     the     influence       of alcohol         shouting and swearing.              We

                 increased        the number           of police        officers    on this escort         to    prevent

                 trouble.         However,            this did not stop them singing                obscen i t i e s    and

                 there was a stream of urine                      flowing      from the upper        deck of the PSV.

                 At that       time we didn't             have enough          policemen to police         e f f e c t i v e l y and

                 safely.        A l t ho ug h Phase        1 was successful          a large number          of supporters

                 went     to H il l s b o r o u g h under        the    influence    of alcohol.

                 I arri v e d at H il l s b o r o u g h about 2 . 3 0 p m and            immediately went          to the

                 gym n a s i u m to regroup my serial.                    The y were all       present.         However,        4

of the officers were                  completing arrest                      reports.                       I was    issued with

meal    tickets and obtained a meal.                           On        completion serial                            sergeants

were    called to the              reception desk           in the gymnasium.                                   I reported that

because           of arrests my serial was                currently                     reduced to 3 P C ’s and

myself.            I was told to        remain on standby.

A few minutes              later serial       sergeants              were again                         called to the

reception desk.                I informed an       Inspector                      the numbers                   on my serial.

He told me to go to                  the Leppings          Lane              straight away.                     I asked him

outside or              inside.      He told me to             go aro u n d on the track.                                    It was a

bit vague           but    I thought       I would be met                    by an Inspector                         in Charge       of

the    gr ou n d .

I informed serial                 members    engaged         in arrest                     reports             that    I was    going

to the Leppings              Lane.      I switched my radio                             to the match                  channel       and

wa l k e d    towards       the Leppings       Lane.            I was wit h PC 269 Broomhead,                                       PC 22

F letcher and PC              1785 Cheetham.

I could see that               the two teams were warming                                  up on the                pitch.     As we

w a l k e d down the          track    the a tmosphere was                        electric and the                      noise

deafening.               I c o u l d n ’t hear a thing.                 When            I reached the Leppings

Lane end I wa l k e d towards                the middle where                           I met               briefly wit h PS

993,         We    commented on the middle                of the terrace section.                                       1 could see

that     it was          packed.     Too    packed.       People were                             scaling           theperimeter

fence.            The    fence was     bowing with pressure and                                      the      people at       the

front were              screaming     for help.       Shouting                    for the gates                      to be opened.

I was        completely suprised             by this         because                 the terracing                    to the    right

of me was           far from full.           I could see the                         terracing                 steps.        It seemed

1 udi c r o u s .

I went        towards       the    safety gate and 1 think someone                                            opened    it, just      in

front        of me.        It seemed that we should a llow some                                              in the middle

section           into the     right    hand section.                    One         of the first                    people    out,       a

man    in his           late teens     came screaming                 towards me.                            He shouted ti.at he

had been screaming          for the gate       to be opened and a police                officer    had

refused.        He had the number written             on his hand.        He screamed       that

people were       being killed.           I told him to get off the pitch so I could

get    others    out.     I continued       to filter people, out         towards       the right

hand terrace.           They were    refusing       to go in and stayed on the

perimeter.        I was looking round          for people       to help me but I had

already       become    detached    from my serial.

I noticed       that    several    people    were    coming    out injured       as a result of

the crush.       St Johns A mb ul an ce me n were          getting    involved with       these.

I still       tried to filter people          from the middle          towards    the right.

Everyone       seemed    to have    a go at me.        Shouting       abuse,    I was    getting

embroiled       in argument       after    argument.        I still    didn't    know anything

of the    tragedy.        I heard nothing       on the radio.           I believe4we       were

still    trying    to prevent       a pitch    invasion.        The    numbers    of police       were

increasing but          the situation was getting             out of hand.       The    crush didn't

seem to abate          and the crowd were       frantic.

There    seemed    to be loads       spilling       onto    the pitch over       the fence.        I

saw a young man on the pitch near                   the goals    and a p o liceman running

onto    the    field.

The    number    of injured people          coming    from the       terrace    increased

rapidly.        I began helping       the    injured.        Sitting    them on the pitch or

trying to get them assistance.                 I can't remember          how many I helped.

I remember one          chap who really worried me.             He was unconscious          but he

was    breathing.       A man asked me       to help him.       I placed him in the

recovery position with             the help of an ambulanceman.                 He said he would

be alright.        I left him when          the other man came back.              I helped

another girl       to the side of the pitch with an arm injury.                         She was

extremely       distraught.        Whilst    I was    at the side of the pitch a young

man jumped       from    the stand.        He had a brace on his          teeth and was

screaming       that    it was our fault.           I told him we couldn't             get people

 out.      I saw the a m bulance             on the     pitch and went       back towards         the

 qoals.      Several       policemen were giving m outh to mouth.                     One man had

 his     head covered and was o b v iously                dead.     I looked around and there

 were     others    covered.           I realised we       had a    tragedy but not         the

 e n o rmit y of    it.        The    fire   brigade were        there and the     fence was        being

 pulled down.         I saw some youths w ith wo o d e n boards and we                      put a man on

  it.     He was about 35 years                old and heavy.          We   ran across    the     pitch

 w i t h him.      He was       dead.    I left them at the Kop end of the                  pitch and

 went     back towards          the Leppings Lane.           The Forest        s u pporters were

 taunting       the Liverpool           end.     A large    number      ran towards      the Kop.         It

  looked nasty.           An    Inspector        shouted at me to get my men together.                      I

 didn't     know where any of them were.                    I saw some other        officers        -from

 West Bar and we           formed a line across             half way.        We were there         for a

  few minutes w hen a Chief                  Inspector    told me to go outside           onto the

 Leppings Lane.

  I stood on the Leppings Lane while                      the Liverpool        crowd dispersed.

 Most     of the    crowd were          shocked,       some were    distraught,      others were

  nasty and abusive.                 We stood there ma i n l y      in silence and        took     the

  flak.     I d o n ’t know how           long    I stood there        but that    is where       I heard

  the    first messages          over    the     radio.

 W hen the      crowd had dispered               I went   into    the ground      looking    for the

  remnants      of my serial.             I found PC C h e e t h a m    in the gymnasium.           He was

  dealing with a body.                 I became aware       how big the tragedy was.                The

  other members       of my serial             were    outside    the ground      completing       the

  escort    of the Forest             fans    back    to the Midl a n d Station.

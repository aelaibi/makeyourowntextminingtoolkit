NAME:                              Brian Leonard MOLE

AGE :                              Over 21

OCCUPATION:                        Chief Superintendent of Police

STATION:                           Divisional Headquarters,            Churchfield, Barnsley




I am a Chief Superintendent in the South Yorkshire Police and am currently

the Divisional Commander of the Barnsley Division of the Force.

I was appointed a Constable in the Sheffield City Police in October 1963                               and

served in Uniform        and    CID Duties as               Constable and            Detective        Sergeant, until

1974 when I was promoted to the rank of Inspector.

For   a period    of     two    years   I served       as   Staff   Officer     to   the   then   Chief

Constables and during that time had responsibility for the planning of major

events in the form of Royal visits, in liaison with the Lord Lieutenant of the

County and had a particular responsibility for War Duties.

In 1976 I was promoted to Chief Inspector and posted as Deputy Sub Divisional

Commander to the Sheffield Central Division (D1 Sub Division) where I remained

in post until 1979.       During my time in the Sheffield Central Division, I was

responsible for the policing of football matches at Sheffield United Football

Ground     and   for     the    planning and arrangement              of     various    marches       and

demonstrations associated with normal City life.

In 1979 I again        transferred      to the Research S Development Department with

particular responsibility for planning public order training and policy.

In the October of that year I was promoted to Superintendent and appointed as

head of the newly formed Operations Division.

Almost   immediately     upon    appointment       the Steel        Strike    commenced    and    I    was

responsible for Police operations and planning in connection with that matter.

During that time I had particular involvement at the Hatfields Steel Works,

%
    which was the scene of much disorder and heavy pic ketting.

    In December 1981, I transferred from the Operations Division and returned to

    the Sheffield Central Sub Division as Sub Divisional Commander and again had

    some responsibility for football matches and marches and demonstrations in the

    City Centre.

    In the March of 1982, I took up the post of Detective Superintendent in charge

    of   the   Criminal     Investigation Department            in   the Sheffield North Division.

    However,    within 3 months I was appointed the Deputy Divisional Commander of

    that Division.

    I remained as the Deputy Divisional Commander until October 1985 when I was

    promoted     to   the    rank    of   Chief    Superintendent        and   appointed     Divisional

    Commander of the Division where I remained until the 27 March 1989, when I was

    transferred as Divisional Commander to the Barnsley Division.

    During my time in the Sheffield North Division, as Deputy Divisional Commander

    and Divisional Commander, I was deeply involved in the planning and command of

    operations associated with Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and in fact in

    1987   was the Officer commanding             the       semi final between Coventry City and

    Leeds United and in 1988 the match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.

    In addition, in 1984 during the Miners dispute, I was involved in the policing

    of picket lines in Nottinghamshire, Orgreave, Doncaster and Barnsley and at

    times took control of the Force Control Room dealing with the deployment of

    personnel to picketting situations.

    So far as both the 1987 and 1988 semi finals are concerned, I was directly

    responsible for         the planning and       liaison      with   the management   of Sheffield

    Wednesday    Football     Club    and   the   Football      Association.     On   both    occasions

    negotiations were entered into concerning the allocation of seating areas to

    opposing fans and the decision was taken that one team would be allocated the

    South Side and the Kop and the other team the North Side and the West Side and




                                                    -   2   -
Leppings Lane Terraces.           This decision was based on the geographical location

of   the   Stadium    and   was    in   an    effort         to    ensure    complete    segregation     of

supporters to prevent confrontation and public disorder.                            Consideration was

given to other methods of deployment, but on balance it was felt that this was

the most appropriate separation.

In   connection     with both     the semi      final        in 1987 and 1988,          this policy     was

followed and the operations were succesfful.

In 1989 during the week prior to Monday 20 March 1989, I was approached by Mr

Graham McKrell       the Secretary of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club,                            who

indicated that once again he might be asked to stage the semi final, possibly

between    Liverpool    and Nottingham         Forest.            He asked    if I would be      able    to

confirm    that   we could Police such              an event        and I indicated       that we would

receive any proposal        in a favourable manner should the situation arise.                            I

again indicated       that if we did stage that event,                      I would ask that the same

segregation procedures were utilised as in previous years and that                              Liverpool

would be allocated the North Stand, West Stand and Leppings Lane Terraces and

Nottingham Forest the Kop and South Stand as in the previous year.

On Monday 20 March 1989, I was again contacted by Mr McKrell who confirmed that

he had been asked by the Football Association to stage the semi final between

Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.              He did say that the Football Association had

asked if the allocation of seats could be reversed in that they would like more

facilities for Liverpool fans.               I once again pointed out the reasons for the

decision    taken     the   previous         year     and         after   confirmation     of    the    ACC

(Operations) Mr W W Jackson,            I confirmed that there was no possibility of

change and that that was the only manner in which I would be prepared to Police

such an event.       Mr McKrell indicated that he would have to take the matter back

to the Football Association before the final decision was reached

I believe it was later that same day that Mr McKrell contacted me and said that




                                                -    3   -
*



    the Football Association had accepted the position and that we would be asked

    to Police the semi final on the 15 April 1989 and that the ticket allocations

    would be in accordance with our plans of the previous year.

    As   a consequence    of this information I spoke             to Superintendent Murray and

    Inspector Sewell at Hammerton Road Police Station and at 3pm that day made

    arrangements for a meeting to be called for Wednesday 22 March 1989 in order

    that early planning discussions for the event could take place.

    Conscious of the fact that I was scheduled to take command of a n ew Division

    on the 27 March 1989,        I called upon       the proposed n ew Divisional Commander,

    Chief Superintendent D G Duckenfield, to attend that meeting in order that

    continuity might remain and he could continue with the planning which would be

    in his domain.       The meeting took place at lOam on 22 March 1989 at Hammerton

    Road Police Station        and involved all interested parties, including                  the heads

    of Operations and Traffic Division, the Senior Officers who would be involved

    in the operation, the Support Staff responsible for preparing the Operational

    Order and representatives of                                        '                British Rail,

    Public Transport and the Highways Authority of the County Council.

    At that meeting initial plans were made concerning action to be taken and in

    particular consideration was given to the mode of travel of supporters and

    representation was made by the British Rail representatives f or Liverpool to

    be brought into the Midland Station in the City Centre and Nottinghamshire to

    the Wadsley Bridge Station in the North of Sheffield. Such action would defeat

    the segregation plans in that supporters would be crossing each other and I

    indicated    that   this would not      be   acceptable and asked the British Rail                   to

    reconsider    the    matter.      The   reasons      for    their       request   were    based    upon

    management difficulties in routing and time scheduling trains.                      It was further

    agreed at that       meeting that the Operations and Traffic Division                     would take

    responsibility       for   all   traffic matters         affecting      the City    and     that    'D '

         Division, the Central Division, would be responsible for policing their own

         area    leaving     the match      itself   to   be       the responsibility             of the Divisional

         Commander of the Sheffield North Division.                       The meeting closed at 11am and I

         took no further part in the planning meetings concerning this matter.

         Following upon        the meeting I spoke             to Superintendent Murray               and Inspector

         Sewell concerning the manpower levels used at the previous year's event and

         asked       them   to examine     the position        for     this    year and      to determine     if any

         reductions or increases were appropriate, taking into account our findings the

         previous year.         The findings the previous year indicated that some Officers

         were under employed and I was conscious                        of the need         not   to repeat such a

         situation if that was the case and if there were no other factors which might

         dictate       their need    for    this   future match.               The   only    other   action   I   took

         concerning this matter was to maintain liaison with Mr McKrell during the next

         few days and in particular to make reference to the need for clear indications

         of tickets by colour coding and appropriate colour coded systems on turnstyles

         to ensure easily recognisable access to the Stadium.

         In    the    knowledge     that   Mr    Duckenfield           would   be    commanding      this   event,    I

         personally selected the Sector Commanders who would be working to him and as

         in the previous year utilised the system of using three sectors,                               those being

         the Ground,        the Liverpool       supporters outside the ground and the Nottingham

         supporters outside the ground.              In this connection I selected Superintendent

         Greenwood as the Ground Controller, Superintendent Marshall to be responsible

         for the Liverpool supporters and Superintendent Chapman to be responsible for

         the    Nottingham      supporters.        All    three        Officers      had    a wide    experience     in

         policing football matches and in fact had been Sector Commanders at the semi

         final   the previous       year.       The only difference was that Mr Marshall                      and Mr

         Greenwood reversed roles            and   this    was because Mr Marshall, having been my

         Deputy for some time, had a better knowledge of the visiting supporters end of




                                                           -   5   -
the ground,     ie Leppings Lane,            than Mr Greenwood, who had been away from the

Division     for    some   time     albeit       for    many     years   he    had       policed         matches    at

Hillsborough.            In addition,        Superintendent           Murray       was    identified         as    the

Officer in charge of the ground control communications and this Officer was in

fact the man who regularly took up that position at First Division matches

throughout the season.

Prior   to   my departure         from       'F'    Division         I met with      Chief      Superintendent

Duckenfield        and   discussed        with   him     in    general    the problems              on    Division.

During that discussion the semi final was touched upon and I appraised him of

the staff selected          and    the fact        that Mr Murray was examining the manpower

situation.

On the day of the semi final, Saturday 15 April 1989, I had no role to play in

the operation and was policing my own Division at Barnsley.

At   approximately       3.30pm     that     day    I   was     en   route    on    the Ml motorway               from

Barnsley     to Sheffield         when,      on    local       radio,    I heard         of   difficulties         at

Sheffield     Wednesday        Football      Ground.           The    reporter      did       not   seem     unduly

concerned and spoke of a delay in the match due to a pitch invasion.                                          As my

journey progressed, it became clear from the radio reports that the incident

was more serious and there was some indication of possible fatalities.                                        Calls

were being made for doctors to attend at the Stadium and a short time later I

heard   an   appeal      for    Police      Officers          to respond to Hammerton               Road    Police

Station.     It was approximately 4pm at this time and I immediately responded to

Hammerton Road Police Station,               arriving at approximately 4.20pm.

On   arrival,      I saw numerous          uniformed Police Officers in the Station area,

including Chief Inspector McRobbie.                     I immediately went to the Control Room

and contacted Chief Superintendent Duckenfield in the Police Control Room at

Sheffield Wednesday Football Club via the internal telephone system.                                        I asked

Mr Duckenfield if I could be of any assistance to him and he asked if I could




                                                       - 6 -
deploy uniformed Officers into the Leppings Lane area on foot and in an effort

 to calm supporters leaving the ground and show compassion for their apparent

feelings of distress.

I immediately went to the Canteen at Hammerton Road Police Station with Chief

Inspector McRobbie and organised units of men in serials under the command of

Sergeants and briefed them as to the information in my possession concerning

the   current       situation.    I then deployed               Units   to locations      in and around

Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground and Chief Inspector McRobbie dealt with

the notation        of deployment.       At       this       time also present was Superintendent

Mordew     and      after   deployment        I        obtained      transport    and    together   with

Superintendent         Mordew    attended         at    Sheffield       Wednesday     Football   Ground,

approaching from Middlewood Road into Leppings Lane.                             On reaching Parkside

Road I saw that Leppings Lane was heavily congested by football supporters and

a large number of fire engines.                   I alighted from the car and began on foot

towards the Stadium and there met Chief Inspector Waring.                            The crowd was dense

and I would generally describe the attitude of supporters as hostile towards

the Police.

I spoke briefly to Chief Inspector Waring and he confirmed that he had little

or no difficulty at that location and the crowds were gradually dispersing.




Together     with    Superintendent    Mordew,           I    then   turned   into    the private   road

leading to the back of the South Stand and on entering that area through the

gates I saw an area of sheeted rails adjacent to the riverside and noted a

number of bodies laid out in that location.                          I was approached by Detective

Inspector Webster who informed me in fact                       that there were eleven bodies at

that location and he further informed me that there were a further 74 in the

Gymnasium.

Prior to this point the magnitude of the situation had not been known to me and
•    .
L




    I immediately made my way through                  'C' Gate into the West Stand enclosure and

    into    the    Police    Control       Room    where,           on    arrival,    I    found Assistant        Chief

    Constable        (Operations)       Mr        Jackson,              Chief    Superintendent        Duckenfield,

    Superintendent         Marshall,       Superintendent                Murray,     Police       Sergeant    Goddard,

    Police Constable Ryan and Police Constale Bishard.                               At this point I noted that

    the ground was relatively empty, with the exception of a few supporters in and

    around      the Leppings Lane end,             Press in the Press Box and officials on the

    playing area.

    I noted that messages were being received on the radio and were being dealt

    with by the Control Sergeant and PC and in general they related to outbreaks

    of disorder and sporadic fighting in and around the Stadium.                                   My attention was

    particularly drawn to Superintendent Marshall and Superintendent Murray,                                           who

    both   seemed        to be extremely       distressed.                ACC M r Jackson was attempting to

    speak to Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and Superintendent Marshall and at

    some point a telephone call was received and was answered by Mr Jackson.                                       From

    the nature of the conversation,                 I formed the opinion that it was a call from

    the    Chief    Constable.        Mr     Jackson          was       attempting    to    ask    questions      of   Mr

    Duckenfield and Mr Marshall and relate them down the telephone.                                    I remained in

    the Control Room and listened to what was taking place through the messages

    and noted that the main communications handset was not being utilised, but

    that personal radios were being used on talk-through facility. At about 5.15pm

    M r Jackson indicated he was to go to Headquarters with Mr Duckenfield and Mr

    Marshall       and    informed    me     that    he        had       made    arrangements        for   Det    Chief

    Superintendent Addis to deal with mortuary arrangements in the Gymnasium and

    had given certain instructions to Chief Superintendent Nesbit concerning the

    welfare of Officers and their stand-down arrangements. He asked that I remain

    at    the   Ground     with   a   view    to    finalising             any   outstanding        matters      and    to

    eventually close down the operation.                       Throughout this time we were visited by

        Fire    and    Ambulance      Senior         Officers          and   I    recall       Mr    Don   Page,     the   Chief

        Ambulance Officer, and Mr Harry Wright the Chief Fire Officer, both calling at

        the Control Box.

        I noticed that a Fire Officer was in fact standing at the top of the steps

        leading to the Control Room overseeing the Leppings Lane Terraces. Mr Jackson

        and     Mr    Duckenfield        and        Mr   Marshall        then      left       the    Control       Room    and   I

        immediately        asked    for an          update from         the Sector Commanders in the form of

        Superintendent           Chapman       at    the    Nottingham            side    of     the   Stadium      and    Chief

        Inspector waring at the Leppings Lane area of the Stadium.                                         It was clear that

        there    was some disorder and no doubt as a consequence of the attitude of

        supporters and I instructed that all personnel remain on duty and that the

        mobile units, named Tango Units,                        remain ready and available.

        Responses were given to numerous incidents of fighting, but in the fullness of

        time calm was restored.

        I recall that trains had left the area, as had coaches which were released from

        their coach parks and whilst I have no real recollection of time, I recall that

        when the situation was calm I made my way to the Gymnasium,                                        leaving Sergeant

        Goddard       in   the     Control      Room       and     there         examined      the     temporary      Mortuary

        facilities accommodating some 85 bodies.                             There was some natural confusion,

        but in general things were in order and Detective Chief Superintendent Addis

        was controlling the Mortuary aspect.                        I spoke to a number of Officers who were

        clearly in shock and were distressed by events which they had experienced.                                               I

        noted    that      the   temporary Mortuary               was    located         in   the Gymnasium,         which was

        separated into three sections, the first section containing the bodies,                                              the

        second       section     being   a     relative          sterile     area        where      Police    Officers      were

        accommodated and the third section had been set up for identification purposes

        and statement taking by CID Officers.                          A separate section had been created for

        identification           purposes      and       this    was    adjacent         to    a separate      office      where




                                                                  - 9 -

    relatives could view bodies in relative privacy.

    I formed the opinion that arrangements were well organised and that temporary

    Mortuary     facilities       were    well    in   hand.         During   this   time    I did meet      Det

    Superintendent McKay and noted that he too was in some way distressed by the

    events.

    Following the visit to the Gymnasium,                   I checked the remainder of the Stadium

    and made my way to the Directors area of the Sheffield Wednesday Club situate

    in the underside of the South Stand,                     and there saw Graham McKrell the Club

    Secretary.         Some members of the staff were clearly distressed and I advised Mr

    McKrell regarding counselling facilities for junior members and the need to

    ensure that medical facilities were available.

    During these conversations Mr McKrell informed m e that he had details of the

    computer print-outs regarding turnstyle figures at 3pm and that he had seized

    them and placed them in his safe (drawer).

    Having satisfied myself that things were in order in the Stadium, I resumed

    duty the Control Box and then sought security of the terrace subject of the

    disaster.

    Through     Superintendent          Mordew    I    arranged       for   Officers    to   be   deployed    to

    security of the centre pens with the intention of 1) preserving evidence and

    2)      recovering property         subject       of those       who had been      injured    or who were

    deceased.

    I noted that numerous Officers were assembling in the North Stand ready for

    debrief      and    because    of    their    general        condition     authorised     Superintendent

    Mordew and Superintendent              Brookfield, who had              also attended     the scene,      to

    debrief Officers and ensure that Serial Sergeants could confirm that all their

    Officers were accounted for and to note their whereabouts during the events.

    In addition, some Officers who had responded to Operation Support were in the

    locality and having consulted with                  'D' Division,         the Central Division of the




                                                        -   10   -
Force,    I arranged for two Sergeants                      and 20 Constables to be organised for

deployment       to     'D'     Division      who     were           suffering     some    potential    disorder

scenes.

Once    debrief       facilities       had    been        dealt       with,   I   instructed      Superintendent

Mordew to stand down those Officers who were no longer required.

Having    yet    again     assessed         the situation             in    the vicinity     of    the ground,      I

instructed that Tango Units,                 the mobile units on public order duties,                        should

remain    on    patrol        and    also    liaise       with       Inspector      Hand-Davis, the         Mounted

Inspector, that his Officers should remain on patrol in pairs in an around the

Ground.

I was informed that relative were in the vicinity of the Ground with a view to

identification and was advised that accommodation and planning had been put

into being for identification of the deceased.

Having experienced the stress placed upon Officers and families in and around

the temporary m ortuary, I was conscious of the considerable stress placed upon

Officers and arranged for the Force Welfare Officer,                                                           to be

called out for counselling reasons.

I was conscious of the fact that social workers and members of the Church and

Salvation Army had been requested to attend at the scene to assist with the

counselling of relatives.

I was    of    the    opinion        that   there     would          be    some   considerable      delay    in   the

identification of bodies and in the retention on duty of Officers who were

allocated to each body for identification purpos es. In view of this, I caused

feeding    arrangements             to be put    in hand             for    those Officers        who were    to be

retained, pending identification of individual deceased persons.

At approximately 9.30pm the Chief Constable, Mr Peter Wright, attended at the

scene    and I met him and             toured    the area of the disaster with him.                           I was

informed       that   at   approximately         10.15pm             that night     Mr    Colin    Monaghan,      the




                                                      -    11    -
Minister of State for Sport,                    was   scheduled to arrive by helicopter at the

Stadium and arrangements were being made for him to be met.

My    recollection          is     that   at    approximately         10.30pm    the   Minister     arrived,

accompanied          by   Chief Superintendent            Duckenfield.          Together   with    the Chief

Constable and other Officers, I showed Mr Monaghan the scene and described to

him the facilities at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

Shortly after this, an impromptu press conference took place on the pitch with

television and other media representatives and Mr Moynaghan was then taken to

the Gymnasium where he spoke to Officers concerning their involvement in the

d a y 's events.          He later left the scene.

At approximately midnight the staff of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

departed from the Stadium and I arranged for security of the Gymnasium area to

protect    the temporary Mortuary facilities.                         Arrangements were made for the

reception       of    relatives       for identification purposes                and social      workers    and

members of the Church were briefed to expect relatives attending in distressed

situations.           These      representatives          were      readily    available   throughout       the

night and in fact met numerous relatives and remained with them throughout the

identification procedures.

I    remained    in       the    vicinity      of the Gymnasium         throughout     the night     and    was

present    through          many    identifications            of   deceased    persons    and    noted    many

extremely harrowing situations regarding grieving relatives and the effects

upon Police          involved.        Throughout      these procedures Inspector John Charles,

Detective Policewoman                                 Police Constable Jean S helton, maintained

records    of the deceased persons and liaised constantly with Superintendent

Torr in charge of the casualty bureau arrangements.

Throughout these events I noted that the Ambulance Liaison Officer was present

in the temporary Mortuary and at one stage I asked if he could increase the

number of mobile stretchers available to speed up the identification process.




                                                      -   12   -
  The Ambulance       Liaison      Officer   was most helpful            in    this connection and was

  extremely professional in his duties.                  The process of identification continued

  until approximately 5am, when arrangements were made for the remainder of the

  bodies to be removed to the City Mortuary where the process would be continued

  later in the day.

  During the course of events during the evening, the Coroner, Mr Stefan Popper,

  attended     the   scene       together    with      Professor      Alan     Usher,     who   both    viewed

  arrangements       and   confirmed      the    location      of     bodies    at   the   Sheffield         City

 Mortuary.

 At     approximately      5.30am I      left    the    Sheffield      Wednesday        Football      Club    and

  returned to Hammerton Road Police Station, where I confirmed that all Officers

  involved     in    the   operation      other     than      those    connected        with    the   deceased

 persons, had been stood down and were accounted for.

  I retired from duty at approximately 6am and resumed duty at 8am that same day

  at Police Headquarters.

  I wish to place on record my considerable appreciation of the efforts of all

  individuals       involved      in   this matter,      and    in particular        the efforts of the

 Officers      involved      in    dealing      with    the    traumatic       events     of    dealing      with

  identification of families of deceased persons, the Social Services and Church

  representatives          and     the   Ambulance       Service       who     maintained        a    presence

  throughout the night.

  I am satisfied that every effort was made to project the professionalism of

  all   the   Emergency     Services and         from my      experiences have no reservation in

  confirming their dedication to service to the Community.

Chief Superintendent

South Yorkshire Police



In August 1985, I was the Deputy Divisional Commander of the

Sheffield North Division and on the 7 August, attended a meeting

at the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club concerning the Safety

at Sports Grounds Act.

I have been shown a copy of the notes of that meeting and in

particular, a reference to   gates formed by the new radial fence

within the Leppings Lane terraces.

I recall in general terms, a discussion concerning those gates

and can say that at no time did the police agree to steward the

gates or permanently man them.

The police accepted that they would exercise control and this

referred to control for segregation purposes.

In brief, because of the nature of the terraces, it was often

necessary to only utilize certain areas for away and home

supporters and to this end, some areas had to be sealed off to

ensure segregation.    In this connection, keys were in the

possession of the police, who determined which pens were to be

utilized and either locked or opened and fastened back gates to

necessitate segregation.

At no time did we agree to permanently man those gates, our role

being one of the maintainance of public order through

observation and segregation of opposing fans.
Brian Leonard MOLE
Chief Superintendent
South Yorkshire Police



I am the divisional commander of the Barnsley Division of the
South Yorkshire Police.

In .1987 I was the divisional commander of the Sheffield
North Division, 'F' Division and as such had responsibility for
policing the Sheffield Wednesday football ground.

On Sunday 12th April, 1987 I was in overall command of the
policing arrangements for the FA semi final between Leeds
United tad Coventetyy City football clubs which was staged
at the Sheffield Wednesday ground.

I can say that whilst officers were briefed to be aware of the
possibility of none ticket holders attending the game and
that checks should be made to identify them and turn them away,
there were no specific plans to place cordons on Leppings
Lane in the form of barriers and I did not give any instruction
to that effect.  I have no knowledge of any such cordons
being introduced and in fact I would see difficulty in the
introductions of such cordons, even on the footpath, as
vehicular traffic is generally allowed to pass along Leppings
Lane and any attempt to filter pedestrians on the footpath
would be likely to cause danger in that they may step into
the roadway into the path of vehicular traffic.

To myknowledge the only barriers in Leppings Lane were those
that were situate at the various junctions along that road
and which were utilised to restrict access to residents only
in those roads.  This is the normal practice and the only
time I would expect to have seen barriers across the footpath
would be when residents vehicles were being allowed to drive
from Leppings Lane into their respective roads.

Whilsat   I cannot account for individual initiative on the
part of   officers manning those barriers I can say that it
was not   my policy to filter supporters by utilising barriers
accross   the footpath.




Chief Superintendent.                20.6.89.
CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT BRIAN LEONARD MOLE                    PAGE 1




I am a Chief Superintendent in the South Yorkshire Police.

In October 1985 I was promoted to the rank of Chief

Superintendent and appointed Divisional Commander of the

Sheffield North Division where I remained until the 27 March

1989.

During my time in the Sheffield North Division, as Deputy

Divisional Commander and Divisional Commander, I was deeply

involved in the planning and command of operations associated

with Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and in fact in 1987 was

the officer commanding the semi final between Coventry City and

Leeds United and in 1988 the match between Liverpool and

Nottingham Forest.

So far as both the 1987 and 1988 semi finals are concerned, I

was directly responsible for the planning and liaison with the

management of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and the

Football Association.   On both occasions negotiations were

entered into concerning the allocation of seating areas to

opposing fans and the decision was taken that one team would be

allocated the South Side and the Kop and the other team the

North Side and the West Side and Leppings Lane Terraces.      This

decision was based on the geographical location of the stadium

and was in an effort to ensure complete segregation of

supporters to prevent confrontation and public disorder.

Consideration was given to other methods of deployment, but on

balance it was felt that this was the most appropriate
CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT BRIAN LEONARD MOLE                    PAGE 2




separation.



* Paragraph - I have been shown a copy of the Operational Order

for the 1988 Semi Final, which I prepared and which I can say

is a true copy.    I identify it by the label attached which I

have signed.

* A paragraph here should address the agreement between Mole

and Mackrell (see Lord Justice Taylor (Mackrell) Page 89 on)

regarding overflow from A-G being taken up by West Stand

turnstiles.

Did he know of the use of gates 9-10 for North Stand and

approve of i t , appreciating the computer counts for sections

would be wrong.    Why post serials to 1-8 and 9-16 in 1988 and

1989 if he knew.

Did Murray know of these agreements if they were infact

adopted.

* Murray says that shortly after joining Division, he was

spoken to by Chief Superintendent Mole and his role in the

activities at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club were explained

to him (See Murray Discipline Interview Page 16).    Can Brian

Leonard Mole confirm or enlarge on this expressing his opinion

of Murray's duty and maintaining safety etc.    (See Inquest D2

20D and D2 23B and C).

He should also explain if he can how it evolved that a

Superintendent should be in control box.    (See South Yorkshire
CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT BRIAN LEONARD MOLE                      PAGE 3




Police SO's guide).     Only needs be a Sergeant or above.



The de-brief system is as follows, firstly once a serial is

stood down the serial sergeant is required to complete a de­

brief document.   This document known as a sheet contains

information as to any incidents that have occurred during the

operation such as arrests, persons injured, use of truncheon by

Police officers or any course of conduct outside the normal

scope of the operation.

The de-brief sheet is then immediately passed by the Sergeant

to the logistics team who review each de-brief sheet before

releasing the serial.

My own supervisory officer de-brief then took place some three

to four days after each semi final.     It is right to say this

de-brief extended to include representatives of every Division

or Department involved.     I can state that in both 1987 and in

1988 the de-briefs did not disclose any suggestion that

supporters had been injured due to overcrowding or crushing.

In addition, I cannot recall any other agency reporting to me

such a problem.

As regards the tunnel being closed in 1988 by Police Officers

that is the sort of incident I would have expected to have been

on a de-brief sheet.     I was not made aware of the problem in

1988 and as a result my planning for 1989 was not influenced.

Other aspects of my planning did change because of the result
CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT BRIAN LEONARD MOLE                   PAGE 4




of the 1988 de-brief including the removal of air cover and the

removal of one serial from Hillsborough precinct.

It was this that resulted in my view that 1988 was a success

and formed a sound base for the 1989 match.

In connection with both the semi final in 1987 and 1988, this

policy was followed and the operations were successful.

In 1989 during the week prior to Monday 20 March 1989, I was

approached by Mr Graham Mackrell, the Secretary of the

Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, who indicated that once

again he might be asked to stage the semi final, possibly

between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.   He asked if I would

be able to confirm that we could Police such an event and I

indicated that we would receive any proposal in a favourable

manner should the situation arise.   I again indicated that if

we did stage that event, I would ask that the same segregation

procedures were utilised as in previous years and that

Liverpool would be allocated the North Stand, West Stand and

Leppings Lane Terraces and Nottingham Forest the Kop and South

Stand as in the previous year.

On Monday 20 March 1989, I was again contacted by Mr Mackrell

who confirmed that he had been asked by the Football

Association to stage the semi final between Liverpool and

Nottingham Forest.   He did say that the Football Association

had asked if the allocation of seats could be reversed in that

they would like more facilities for Liverpool fans.    I once
CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT BRIAN LEONARD MOLE                    PAGE 5




again pointed out the reasons for the decision taken the

previous year and after confirmation of the Assistant Chief

Constable   (Operations) Mr W W Jackson, I confirmed that there

was no possibility of change and that that was the only manner

in which I would be prepared to Police such an event.     Mr

Mackrell indicated that he would have to take the matter back

to the Football Association before the final decision was

reached.

I believe it was later that same day that Mr Mackrell contacted

me and said that the Football Association had accepted the

position and that we would be asked to Police the semi final on

the 15 April 1989 and that the ticket allocations would be in

accordance with our plans of the previous year.



* Some explanation required here if possible regarding

allocation and turnstiles, and did Murray know of these

agreements if they were infact adopted.



As a consequence of this information I spoke to Superintendent

Murray and Inspector Sewell at Hammerton Road Police Station

and at 3.00 pm that day made arrangements for a meeting to be

called for Wednesday 22 March 1989 in order that early planning

discussions for the event could take place.

Conscious of the fact that I was scheduled to take command of a

new Division on the 27 March 1989, I called upon the proposed
CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT BRIAN LEONARD MOLE                       PAGE 6




new Divisional Commander, Chief Superintendent D G Duckenfield,

to attend that meeting in order that continuity might remain

and he could continue with the planning which would be in his

domain.    The meeting took place at 10.00 am on 22 March 1989 at

Hammerton Road Police Station and involved all interested

parties, including the head of Operations and Traffic

Divisions, the Senior Officers who would be involved in the

operation, the Support Staff responsible for preparing the

Operational Order and representatives of British Rail, Public

Transport and the Highways Authority of the County Council.



* Can he say whether Murray was at this meeting.



At that meeting initial plans were made concerning action to be

taken.    The meeting closed and I took no further part in the

planning meetings concerning this matter.    Following upon the

meeting I spoke to Superintendent Murray and Inspector Sewell

concerning the manpower levels used at the previous year's

event and asked them to examine the position for this year and

to determine if any reductions or increases were appropriate,

taking into account our findings the previous year.     The

findings the previous year indicated that some officers were

under employed and I was conscious of the need not to repeat

such a situation if that was the case and if there were no

other factors which might dictate their need for this future
CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT BRIAN LEONARD MOLE                    PAGE 7




match.   The only other action I took concerning this matter was

to maintain liaison with Mr Mackrell during the next few days

and in particular to make reference to the need for clear

indications of tickets by colour coding and appropriate colour

coded systems on turnstiles to ensure easily recognisable

access to the stadium.

In the knowledge that Mr Duckenfield would be commanding this

event, I personally selected the Sector Commanders who would be

working to him and as in the previous year utilised the system

using three sectors, those being the Ground, the Liverpool

supporters outside the ground, the Nottingham supporters

outside the ground.   In this connection I selected

Superintendent Greenwood as the Ground Controller,

Superintendent Marshall to be responsible for the Liverpool

supporters and Superintendent Chapman to be responsible for the

Nottingham supporters.   All three officers had a wide

experience in policing football matches and in fact had been

Sector Commanders at the semi final the previous year.     The

only difference was that Mr Marshall and Mr Greenwood reversed

roles and this was because Mr Marshall, having been my Deputy

for some time, had a better knowledge of the visiting

supporters end of the ground, ie Leppings Lane, than Mr

Greenwood, who had been away from the Division for some time

all be it for many years he had policed matches at

Hillsborough.   In addition, Superintendent Murray was
CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT BRIAN LEONARD MOLE                   PAGE




identified as the officer in charge of the ground control

communications and this officer was in fact the man who

regularly took up that position at First Division matches

throughout the season.

Q. Do you think perhaps you've got too great a faith in human
   nature in saying that you expected people not to come
   because o£ announcements?     A. I think for me to have a
   crystal ball, sir, would be difficult.  I hope that people
   will respond to commonsensa.  There is little I can do
   except try and accommodate that, and I believe that the
   plans that were made were made to accommodate that
   difficulty, and I really would be vary hopeful that people
   would respond to the appeals that were made, which were
   genuine and in the interests of encouraging a pleasant
   sporting event which this nation usually enjoys.

Q. Indeed.  Mr. Mole I think everyone would sympathise with
   your hopes but your experience as a Police Officer must
   have surely taught you that hope was not always fulfilled.
      A.     The same appeals were made last year.  I made them
   personally on television and radio and afterwards I was
   delighted to report back to the media that I was delighted
   with the response of supporters, and in fact they did
   respond. ' I think there are many elements which affect that
   and I think it is a sad fact that you can't cater for e^ery
   element such as the weather - and it was a super day, which
   may well have had some bearing on the desire for people to
   attend and to get the feel-and flavour for it. You can't
   cater for those aspects, but I honestly believe that the
   vast majority of people responded and would respond to
   those appeals.

Q. Let me come later to whether it was catered for
   sufficiently.  I don't beliave it is likely is it that the
   nature of the Liverpool fan changed radically between 1988
   and 1989.  - A. The nature of the fan?

Q. Yes.   -   A. No I don't think so.

Q. What I am getting at is that you were likely to have had
   the same proportion of people drinking too much, the same
   proportion of people making a nuisance of themselves as in
   1988 as you had in 1989.  - A. In terms of intelligence
   the attitude and behaviour of the fans has been very good
   this season and that too was taken into account, and in
   fact we had enjoyed Liverpool visiting Sheffield Wednesday
   on, I would be guessing at the date but I think it was the
   14th January this year when they attended the first
   division match with Sheffield Wednesday, and the fans'
   behaviour was excellent on that occasion.  I think I
   believe I am correct in saying resulting in only four
   arrests.

Q. It has been said that 1988 event went off, so far as the
   Police were concerned, well.  - A. I believe it was a
   successful event.

      MR. COLLINS:  You see you have got 23 turnstiles to
get in 24,000 people, putting it very broadly? - A. Yes.

And it is not as simple as that because A-G, that is seven
turnstiles, have got to in theory accommodate all those
goinginto the terraces, that is some 10,000. - A. 10,100.

On simple flow rates of turnstiles you are going to be pushed
to qet that sort of number in in less tnan an-nour-and-a-iicl....
A. Not being one of my areas of responsibility I would not
really be definitive, but I know that the Green Guide cdiCS
of "750" a nominal figure of people going through the turn­
stiles but that I believe caters for where money is c n a n g m g
hands.   We are dealing with an all ticket situation anc my
discussions with the Secretary of Sheffield Wednesday m une
oast have indicated that turnstiles can accommodate soirieu.mg
 in the region of 1,000 an hour.

t see.   So you considered that there was no possibility,
from vour experience, no possibility of danger ox a bui^
ut> at'these turnstiles assuming that there was no, a sudden
surqe right towards the end? - A. I think assuming tnau the
oeople attended responsibly in good time to enjoy the
facility there should have been no dirficuluy.

 But you keep on saying that "responsibly and in good time" •
 but there was no entertainment was there other than-tne
 rather minimal sort of entertainment by some music ana a sore
 of disc jockey over the Tannoy? - A. I am nou aware.

 Certainly there was nothing special laid on in the way of
 entertainment? - A. I am not aware what was laic on Jiis
 year.
 I am talking about 1988? - A. I would accept that there
 was no entertainment.

 You have heard nothing to make you believe there was anything
 different in 1989? - A. I think in 1988 there v/as m iact,
 qoing back to memory, but I think there was some
 football or something.  I could not be positive on uhau.   j.
 am trying to tie with many matches.

  So people might have been encouraged by that to cone in good
‘ time because there was something t o ‘see? - A. That may well
  have been a factor and I think again that the P oppleweU
  Report talks about entertainment and I know iu is mentioned
  in here.
  Indeed, but there was nothing in 1989? - A. I am not aware.
  I accept what you say.  I don't know.

  Now the lack of entertainment is a factor which would make
  people not particularly keen to come into tne ground early.
  It is not particularly attractive to stand on the terrace
  with nothing to do, is it? - A. I think my experience sir,
                                  B.L. MOLE


That was a plan devised by you.   Is that right? - A. It
was sir, yes.
Obviously with consultation with other Officers? - A. Yes.

So far as the ultimate approval of that plan for each year
wajs^concerned, was that you or someone else? - A. I would
prepare the plan in consultation with my Officers anc
sign that plan and forward it to Headquarters as a copy
for information sir.

By "Headquarters" you mean? - A. The Assistant Chier Constable
of Operations would receive a copy of the order.

Mr. Jackson? - A. That is correct sir, yes.

Did M T* Jackson have the ultimate decision whether or not
to approve? - A. If in fact he had any fault with the order
then he would have that sanctioned to rectify that matter
and refer it back to me sir.

So it was his ultimate decision as to whether that plan
should go ahead or be modified? - A. That is correct sir.

Did he have any comments can you recall in relation to the
plan-on any of the years 1987, 1988, 1989? - A. No s^ -
In br-ief during the arrangements I am o ^ e n in consultation
with"Mr. Jackson as well as my subordinate Officers so most
o£ the matters are resolved before I put pen to paper with
the final plan, but certainly there were no particular
comments which would require modification or rectification
once I submitted that order for the seal or approval sir.

 The next thing I would like just to ask you about is horses.
 Clearly the use of mounted Officers is something which is
 recognised as being invaluable in crowd control? - A. I
 find it invaluable sir, yes.

 indeed if one looks at what we have as Document 11 which
 is the South Yorkshire Standing Instructions for Policing
 of Football Matches.  If you would turn to page 5 or that
 document, paragraph 7.6? - A. Yes sir.

 Incidentally I assume you are well aware of this document
 which emanates from Mr. Jackson and is dated March 1986?
 - A. I am indeed sir, yes.

  It is a memo from Mr. Jackson to effectively those concerned
‘ dealing with already updating the Yorkshire Instructions
  following the Popplewell Report.- That is right, is it.
  - A. That is correct sir, yes.

 7.6 one sees Police horses are dealt with and their role
 is set out as t h u s :

                                                                     B.L. MOLE


                      information of anyone putting a serial or barrier across that
                      tunnel.  I certainly did not give instructions in 1988 for it
                      as far as I recall, but that serial would, before moving to
                      the tunnel, be activating at the rear of the turnstiles in the
                      enclosure at the back.  If they had gone to that location
                      —- =        down the tunnel at sous Dhase that could have
                      been interpreted as a serial, but I have no direct knowledge
              B      'of a specific instruction.

                   Q. Would they be by and large the same Officers as were used for
                      policing league games? - A. Generally, yes.

                   Q. And is there a possibility for confusion here that those who
                      had policed league games would know that that particular
                      serial would be involved in actually filling pens in
                      accordance with control's instructions? - A. The section of
                      the Officer in charge of the area there is important, and I
                      made the same selection there this year as last year, and it
                      is he really who deploys 13, 14 and 15 for the duties in that
                      location, and would be normally the same man at league matches
                      as well.

                   Q. Could we have a look at one example of an operational order
              D       for a league match.  Page 87 is the one we have managed to
                      find for the Sheffield Wednesday-Queen's Park Rangers game,
                      2nd May, 1987.  It is right to say it was your practice to let
                      Mr. Mackrell to have a copy of the operational order so he
                      knew what was going on? - A. Yes.

                   G. Would you agree it is rather a good idea the club should have
                     / the operational o r d e r , not so they would interfere but so they
                       would know the way in which the policing is being controlled?
                       - A. I believe that is the correct way.

                   Q. Is it within your knowledge they were not given the
                      operational order this year for the first time? - A. That is
                      not within my knowledge.

                   Q. Could we go specifically to the details for each section and
                      just go to page 98.     I hope it is just clear at the bottom
                      right-hand corner.     You see the way in which the detail that
                      polices phase 1 at a league game behaves. Serial 6, this is.
                      Ue d o n ’t have the Officer’s name on the left-hand side.  Their
                      functions before the match are, in the terms of the order:

                           "To maintain order, to ensure pens are filled in
                           accordance with instructions from control; occupancy of
                           pens by away-home fans will be given at briefing".

                      - A. Yes.  This is when the end was used by both home and
                      visiting supporters.

                   Q. So during the filling up process at least one serial of 11 men
                      in all is physically in the pen controlling their filling? -
                      A. They are filling the pen for segregation to that pen which
               H      has been selected, and at page 1 it says they will be in the
                      south pen on Leppings Lane terrace and part of the West Stand.

                   Q. In fact you would be quite v/rong to if there was a dangerous
                      situation outside-wouldn't it to let that affect your mind?
                      - A . As in isolation I would, yes.

                   Q. Now can I turn to the considerations given to the flow at
                      the turnstiles? - A. Yes sir.

               B   Q. Were you yourself aware of the particular capacities of
                      the different .sections of the ground? - A. I was sir, yes.

                   Q. You would know therefore that the Leppings Lane had 10,100
                      for terraces? - A. Yes.

                   Q. And you were only allowing, if you only allow A-G, some
                      seven turnstiles? - A. The allocation of turnstiles is a
                      matter for the Club sir.  I don't aliow the turnstiles.

                   Q. But vou would be informed of that? - A. I was aware of it.

                   Q. Would you have an opportunity to comment on it? - A. I
                      think there v/as little alternative to tnat arrangement.

                   Q. But having acquired that knowledge, seven turnstiles for
               D      10,100 people, what conclusions were you able to draw as
                      to the need for fans to arrive at any particular time prior
                      to the match? - A. I think the consideration would be I
                      would want people to come as early as possible and therefore
                      plan for the opening of turnstiles at 12 o'clock which gives
                      a three hour rate before kick-off to encourage people through
                      the media to come because in the last hour on reasonable
                      assessment I could expect to accommodate something like
                      7,000.

                   Q. It would not only be a good thing for them to arrive early,
                      it would be crucial on those figures, wouldn't it? - A.
                      They should arrive early and in fact that was the case the
                      previous year and the year before that.

                   Q. Just let me put these matters to you and see if you agree
                      v/ith m e .

                            If you took your optimum figure, which is far greater
                      than the Green Code, of 1,000 per hour, that is 500 per
                      turnstile in the last half-hour? - A. On those figures, yes.

                   Q. That means that the most, on an optimum situation which
                      those turnstiles could cope v/ith, A-G in thelast hair-hour
                      would be some 3,500 fans? — A. Yes sir.

                   O. That means that even if you had a perfect situation because
                      1,000 really requires quite good conditions, doesn't it?
                      - A. Well that is the advice given by the Club sir and I
                      respond to it.

               H   Q. You .have got to have well over a half having arrived before
                      2.30 if you are going to cope v/ith the remainder? - A.
                      And usually that is the case, sir.

         Q. When you had the'experience of 1938 were there any problems
            at the Leppings Lane entrance.  Did you have any experience
            then of unduly large crowds having gathered outside, and
            difficulty in dealing with them? - A. No sir, I didn't.

         Q. Was that a factor in your consideration of 1989? - A. It
            was sir.  I had made contingencies to deal v/ith any overflow
     B      in 1988, did not have to use that contingency and therefore
            was facing that experience when I looked at 1989's plan.

         Q. We have heard of Liverpool's progress and its success in
            1989 and success it has enjoyed to-date, in 1983 and the
            success this season. Were there any features, was there
            any information which came to you prior to and at the time
            of your planning for 1939 to suggest that there had been
            any material change in what you could expect? - A. None at
            all sir. As I have said Liverpool have always in my
            experience had a good following and I saw no change in the
            situation.

         Q. Did you have any intelligence information supplied to you
            concerning Liverpool and Forest? - A. I had intelligence
            in the form of intelligence reports as to their attitude.
     D      I think I referred yesterday their behaviour had been good
            during the season.  The usual pick-pocketing, the usual
            forged tickets which is a consistert factor with Liverpool
            supporters. That type of intelligence was available to^e.

         Q. And had you maintained links with Merseyside? -.A. I had
            sir.
     E   Q. With the Police Authority there to ascertain what the
            situation was? - A. The football intelligence system of
            the Force has that link with the Football Liaison Officer
            and my own Detective Sergeant Football Intelligence
            Officer who maintains that contact on an almost day-to-aay
            basis when we are anticipating the event.

         Q. Did you receive any warnings from that direction that there
            may be a change in the characteristics of the supporters,
            a change in the time that they might arrive or the numbers
            in which they might come? - A. No sir.

         Q. The question of planning for their accommodation through
            the turnstiles. Is there any difference in Police approach
            to what might be described as an “anticipated confrontational
            situation" and the policing of a sporting event? - A. There
            is a different approach sir, yes.

         Q. What is it essentially.  What do you try and achieve in
            the latter? - A. I think in the latter we are looking for
            harmony. We are looking for what I have said is a good
            day out by people and we are not looking at aggressive
            tactics. We are looking at encouragement, public support
     H      and commonsense to achieve the objective of what I have
            described in programmes as "a happy family's day out" at
            sporting events of this nature.

                 THURSDAY, 28th FEBRUARY 1991

                   BRIAN LEONARD MOLE Sworn

                        By THE CORONER

Q.   You are Brian Leonard Mole? - A. That is correct, sir.

Q.   And you are a Chief Superintendent? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. I know that you are the Commander at Barnsley at th$'
   moment, aren t you? - A. That is correct, sir, yes.7
                                                          /
Q.   Prior to that I think you were Chief Superintendent      in
     other Divisions? - A. Indeed I was, sir, yes.

Q. Because of that you had considerable experience of
   policing not only football matches in general but
   Hillsborough in particular? - A. I have indeed, yes,
   sir.

Q. In the briefest possible way just summarise your
   footballing policing experience up to 1989? > A. Right,
   sir, yes. In the seventies I was the Sub-Divisional
   Commander in Sheffield City with the responsibility for
   policing Sheffield United at that time.   In 1979 I
   became Head of the Operations Division as
   Superintendent and served there for two years,
   responsible for all public order matters within the
   County of South Yorkshire, responsible for training,
   for football, firearms, horses, dogs, underwater search
   - all the operational natters within the County.    In
   1982 I went as the Head of CID in the Sheffield North
   Division, shortly afterwards becoming the Deputy
   Divisional Commander responsible for policing
   Hillsborough; remained in that post until '85 when I
   became the Divisional Commander iu the Sheffield North
   Division; remained there until March of 1989, during
   which time I policed Hillsborough throughout, with the
   two semi-finals in '87 and '88. I then transferred to
   Barnsley and have been responsible for the policing of
   the Barnsley Borough of the South Yorkshire Police
   since that time.

Q. Thank you. It follows that, in fact, 1981 was a year
    in which you were not policing Hillsborough, is that
   right? - A. That is correct, sir, yes.   I was in
   operations Division but, in fact, I was away at the
   Command course at Bramshill during the early part of
   that year.

 I am a Chief Superintendent in the South Yorkshire Police and am currently

 the Divisional Commander of the Barnsley Division of the Force.

I was appointed a Constable in the Sheffield City Police in October 1963               and

served in Uniform and CID Duties as Constable and Detective Sergeant, until

1974 when I was promoted to the rank of Inspector.

For a period of two years I            served    as Staff Officer to the then Chief

Constables and during that time had responsibility for the planning of major

events in the form of Royal visits, in liaison with the Lord Lieutenant of the

County and had a particular responsibility for War Duties.

In 1976 I was promoted to Chief Inspector and posted as Deputy Sub Divisional

Commander to the Sheffield Central Division (D1 Sub Division) where I remained

in post until 1979.        During my time in the Sheffield Central Division, I was

responsible for the policing of football matches at Sheffield United Football

Ground   and   for   the    planning    and     arrangement   of   various   marches   and

demonstrations associated with normal City life.

In 1979 I again transferred to the Research & Development Department with

particular responsibility for planning public order training and policy.

In the October of that year I was promoted to Superintendent and appointed as

head of the newly formed Operations Division.

Almost immediately upon appointment           the Steel Strike commenced and I was

responsible for Police operations and planning in connection with that matter.

During that time I had particular involvement at the Hatfields Steel Works,
 which was the scene of much disorder and heavy picketting.

In December 1981, I transferred from the Operations Division and returned to

 the Sheffield Central Sub Division as Sub Divisional Commander and again had

some responsibility for football matches and marches and demonstrations in the

City Centre.

In the March of 1982, I took up the post of Detective Superintendent in charge

of the Criminal Investigation Department in the Sheffield North Division.

However, within 3 months I was appointed the Deputy Divisional Commander of

that Division.

I remained as the Deputy Divisional Commander until October 1985 when I was

promoted   to    the   rank   of   Chief   Superintendent   and   appointed   Divisional

Commander of the Division where I remained until the 27 March 1989, when I was

transferred as Divisional Commander to the Barnsley Division.

During my time in the Sheffield North Division, as Deputy Divisional Commander

and Divisional Commander, I was deeply involved in the planning and command of

operations associated with Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and in fact in

1987 was the Officer commanding the            semi final between Coventry City and

Leeds United and in 1988 the match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.

In addition, in 1984 during the Miners dispute, I was involved in the policing

pf picket lines in Nottinghamshire, Orgreave, Doncaster and Barnsley and at

times took control of the Force Control Room dealing with the deployment of

personnel to picketting situations.

So far as both the 1987 and 1988 semi finals are concerned, I was directly

responsible for the planning and liaison with the management of Sheffield

Wednesday Football Club and the Football Association.               On both occasions

negotiations were entered into concerning the allocation of seating areas to

opposing fans and the decision was taken that one team would be allocated the

South Side and the Kop and the other team the North Side and the West Side and
Leppings Lane Terraces. This decision was based on the geographical location

    the Stadium      and   was   in   an    effort      to ensure   complete segregation of

supporters to prevent confrontation and public disorder.                  Consideration was

given to other methods of deployment, but on balance it was felt that this was

the most appropriate separation.

In connection with both the semi final in 1987 and 1988,                    this policy was

followed and the operations were succesfful.

In 1989 during the week prior to Monday 20 March 1989, I was approached by Mr

Graham McKrell the Secretary of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, who

indicated that once again he might be asked to stage the semi final, possibly

between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.                  He asked if I would be able to

confirm that we could Police such an event and I indicated that we would

receive any proposal in a favourable manner should the situation arise.                      I

again indicated that if we did stage that event, I would ask that the same

segregation procedures were utilised as in previous years and that                   Liverpool

would be allocated the North Stand, West Stand and Leppings Lane Terraces and

Nottingham Forest the Kop and South Stand as in the previous year.

On Monday 20 March 1989, I was again contacted by Mr McKrell who confirmed that

he had been asked by the Football Association to stage the semi final between

Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.            He did say that the Football Association had

asked if the allocation of seats could be reversed in that they would like more

facilities for Liverpool fans.             I once again pointed out the reasons for the

decision   taken     the   previous        year   and    after   confirmation   of   the   ACC

(Operations) Mr W w Jackson,          I confirmed that there was no possibility of

change and that that was the only manner in which I would be prepared to Police

such an event.     Mr McKrell indicated that he would have to take the matter back

to the Football Association before the final decision was reached

I believe it was later that same day that Mr McKrell contacted me and said that
the Football Association had accepted the position and that we would be asked

to Police the semi final on the 15 April 1989 and that the ticket allocations

would be in accordance with our plans of the previous year.

As a consequence of this information I spoke to Superintendent Murray and

Inspector Sewell at Hammerton Road Police Station and at 3pm that day made

arrangements for a meeting to be called for Wednesday 22 March 1989 in order

that early planning discussions for the event could take place.

Conscious of the fact that I was scheduled to take command of a new Division

on the 27 March 1989, I called upon the proposed new Divisional Comnander,

Chief Superintendent D G Duckenfield, to attend that meeting in order that

continuity might remain and he could continue with the planning which would be

in his domain.     The meeting took          place at lOam on 22 March 1989 atHammerton

Road Police Station      and involved all interested parties, including         the heads

of Operations and Traffic Division, the Senior Officers who would be involved

in the operation, the Support Staff responsible for preparing the Operational

Order and representatives of             -                                 British Rail,

Public Transport and the Highways Authority of the County Council.

At that meeting initial plans were made concerning action to be taken and in

particular consideration was given to the mode of travel of supporters and

representation was made by the British Rail representatives for Liverpool to

be brought into the Midland Station in the City Centre and Nottinghamshire to

the Wadsley Bridge Station in the North of Sheffield. Such action would defeat

the segregation plans in that supporters would be crossing each other and I

indicated that this would not be acceptable and asked the British Rail to

reconsider   the   matter.       The   reasons   for   their request   were based      upon

management difficulties in routing and time scheduling trains.            It was further

agreed at that meeting         that the Operations and Traffic Division would take

responsibility     for   all    traffic matters    affecting   the City   and   that    'D'
Division, the Central Division, would be responsible for policing their own

area leaving the match itself to be the responsibility of the Divisional

Commander of the Sheffield North Division.        The meeting closed at 11am and I

took no further part in the planning meetings concerning this matter.

Following upon the meeting I spoke to Superintendent Murray and Inspector

Sewell concerning the manpower levels used at the previous year's event and

asked them to examine the position for this year and to determine if any

reductions or increases were appropriate, taking into account our findings the

previous year.     The findings the previous year indicated that some Officers

were under employed and I was conscious of the need not to repeat such a

situation if that was the case and if there were no other factors which might

dictate their need for this future match.           The only other action I took

concerning this matter was to maintain liaison with Mr McKrell during the next

few days and in particular to make reference to the need for clear indications

     tickets by colour coding and appropriate colour coded systems on turnstyles

to ensure easily recognisable access to the Stadium.

In   the   knowledge   that Mr   Duckenfield   would be commanding this event,   I

personally selected the Sector Commanders who would be working to him and as

in the previous year utilised the system of using three sectors, those being

the Ground,    the Liverpool supporters outside the ground and the Nottingham

supporters outside the ground.       In this connection I selected Superintendent

Greenwood as the Ground Controller, Superintendent Marshall to be responsible

for the Liverpool supporters and Superintendent Chapman to be responsible for

the Nottingham    supporters.      All   three Officers had a wide experience in

policing football matches and in fact had been Sector Commanders at the semi

final the previous year.         The only difference was that Mr Marshall and Mr

Greenwood reversed roles and this was because Mr Marshall, having been my

Deputy for some time, had a better knowledge of the visiting supporters end of
the ground, ie Leppings Lane, than Mr Greenwood, who had been away from the

Division     for some      time albeit for many years he had policed matches                 at

Hillsborough.         In   addition.   Superintendent         Murray   was identified    as the

Officer in charge of the ground control communications and this Officer was in

fact the man who regularly took up that position at First Division matches

throughout the season.

Pri°r to my        departure from      'F' Division I met with Chief Superintendent

Duckenfield       and discussed with him in general              the problems on Division.

During that discussion the semi final was touched upon and I appraised him of

the staff selected and the fact that Mr Murray was examining the manpower

situation.

On the day of the semi final, Saturday 15 April 1989, I had no role to play in

the operation and was policing my own Division at Barnsley.

At approximately 3.30pm that day I was en route on the Ml motorway from

Barnsley     to   Sheffield   when,    on   local    radio,    I heard of difficulties at

Sheffield     Wednesday     Football   Ground.        The   reporter did not     seem    unduly

concerned and spoke of a delay in the match due to a pitch invasion.                      As my

journey progressed, it became clear from the radio reports that the incident

was more serious and there was some indication of possible fatalities.                    Calls

were being made for doctors to attend at the Stadium and a short time later I

heard   an   appeal   for Police Officers           to respond to Hammerton Road Police

Station.     It was approximately 4pm at this time and I immediately responded to

Hammerton Road Police Station, arriving at approximately 4.20pm.

On arrival,       I saw numerous uniformed Police Officers in the Station area,

including Chief Inspector McRobbie.           I immediately went to the Control Room

and contacted Chief Superintendent Duckenfield in the Police Control Room at

Sheffield Wednesday Football Club via the internal telephone system.                    I asked

Mr Duckenfield if I could be of any assistance to him and he asked if I could
 deploy uniformed Officers into the Leppings Lane area on foot and in an effort

 to calm supporters leaving the ground and show compassion for their apparent

 feelings of distress.

 I immediately went to the Canteen at Hammerton Road Police Station with Chief

 Inspector McRobbie and organised units of men in serials under the command of

 Sergeants and briefed them as to the information in my possession concerning

 the current   situation.     I then deployed Units to locations in and around

 Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground and Chief Inspector McRobbie dealt with

 the notation of deployment.        At this time also present was Superintendent

Mordew   and   after   deployment      I        obtained   transport    and   together   with

Superintendent   Mordew     attended       at    Sheffield   Wednesday    Football   Ground,

approaching from Middlewood Road into Leppings Lane.                   On reaching Parkside

Road I saw that Leppings Lane was heavily congested by football supporters and

a large number of fire engines.            I alighted from the car and began on foot

towards the Stadium and there met Chief Inspector Waring.                The crowd was dense

and I would generally describe the attitude of supporters as hostile towards

the Police.

I spoke briefly to Chief Inspector Waring and he confirmed that he had little

or no difficulty at that location and the crowds were gradually dispersing.



Together with Superintendent Mordew,              I then turned into the private road

leading to the back of the South Stand and on entering that area through the

gates I saw an area of sheeted rails adjacent to the riverside and noted a

number of bodies laid out in that location.                I was approached by Detective

Inspector Webster who informed me in fact that there were eleven bodies at

that location and he further informed me that there were a further 74 in the

Gymnasium.

Prior to this point the magnitude of the situation had not been known to me and
I immediately made my way through 'C' Gate into the West Stand enclosure and

into   the Police Control Room            where,   on arrival,     I found Assistant Chief

Constable     (Operations)        Mr   Jackson,        Chief   Superintendent       Duckenfield,

Superintendent     Marshall,      Superintendent        Murray,   Police Sergeant       Goddard,

Police Constable Ryan and Police Constale Bishard.                At this point I noted that

the ground was relatively empty, with the exception of a few supporters in and

around the Leppings Lane end. Press in the Press Box and officials on the

playing area.

I noted that messages were being received on the radio and were being dealt

with by the Control Sergeant and PC and in general they related to outbreaks

of disorder and sporadic fighting in and around the Stadium.                  My attention was

particularly drawn to Superintendent Marshall and Superintendent Murray, who

both seemed to be extremely distressed.                  ACC Mr Jackson was attempting to

speak to Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and Superintendent Marshall and at

seme point a telephone call was received and was answered by Mr Jackson.                    From

the nature of the conversation, I formed the opinion that it was a call from

the Chief Constable.         Mr Jackson         was attempting to ask questions of Mr

Duckenfield and Mr Marshall and relate them down the telephone.                 I remained in

the Control Room and listened to what was taking place through the messages

and noted that the main communications handset was not being utilised, but

that personal radios were being used on talk-through facility. At about 5.15pm

Mr Jackson indicated he was to go to Headquarters with Mr Duckenfield and Mr

Marshall    and   informed   me    that    he    had   made    arrangements   for    Det   Chief

Superintendent Addis to deal with mortuary arrangements in the Gymnasium and

had given certain instructions to Chief Superintendent Nesbit concerning the

welfare of Officers and their stand-down arrangements.               He asked that I remain

at   the Ground with a view to finalising any outstanding matters and                        to

eventually close down the operation.             Throughout this time we were visited by




                                             - 8 -
 Fire and Ambulance Senior Officers and I recall                       Mr Don Page,       the Chief

Ambulance Officer, and Mr Harry Wright the Chief Fire Officer, both calling at

 the Control Box.

I noticed that a Fire Officer was in fact standing at the top of the steps

leading to the Control Room overseeing the Leppings Lane Terraces.                        Mr Jackson

and   Mr   Duckenfield     and        Mr   Marshall   then    left   the     Control   Room   and   I

immediately asked for an update from the Sector Commanders in the form of

Superintendent        Chapman    at    the Nottingham        side of    the Stadium       and Chief

Inspector Waring at the Leppings Lane area of the Stadium.                      It was clear that

there was some disorder and no doubt as a consequence of the attitude of

supporters and I instructed that all personnel remain on duty and that the

mobile units, named Tango Units, remain ready and available.

Responses were given to numerous incidents of fighting, but in the fullness of

time calm was restored.

I recall that trains had left the area, as had coaches which were released from

their coach parks and whilst I have no real recollection of time, I recall that

when the situation was calm I made my way to the Gymnasium, leaving Sergeant

Goddard    in   the    Control    Room      and   there   examined     the    temporary    Mortuary

facilities accommodating some 85 bodies.                  There was some natural confusion,

but in general things were in order and Detective Chief Superintendent Addis

was controlling the Mortuary aspect.              I spoke to a number of Officers who were

clearly in shock and were distressed by events which they had experienced.                          I

noted that the temporary Mortuary was located in the Gymnasium, which was

separated into three sections, the first section containing the bodies, the

second    section     being a relative sterile area where Police Officers were

accommodated and the third section had been set up for identification purposes

and statement taking by CID Officers.              A separate section had been created for

identification purposes and this was adjacent to a separate office where
relatives could view bodies in relative privacy.

I formed the opinion that arrangements were well organised and that temporary

Mortuary facilities were well in hand.       During this time I did meet Det

Superintendent McKay and noted that he too was in some way distressed by the

events.

Following the visit to the Gymnasium, I checked the remainder of the Stadium

and made my way to the Directors area of the Sheffield Wednesday Club situate

in the underside of the South Stand, and there saw Graham McKrell the Club

Secretary. Some members of the staff were clearly distressed and I advised Mr

McKrell regarding counselling facilities for junior members and the need to

ensure that medical facilities were available.

During these conversations Mr McKrell informed me that he had details of the

computer print-outs regarding turnstyle figures at 3pm and that he had seized

them and placed them in his safe (drawer).

Having satisfied myself that things were in order in the Stadium, I resumed

duty the Control Box and then sought security of the terrace subject of the

disaster.

Through Superintendent Mordew I    arranged for Officers    to be deployed   to

security of the centre pens with the intention of 1) preserving evidence and

2) recovering property   subject of those who had been injured or who were

deceased.

I noted that numerous Officers were assembling in the North Stand ready for

debrief and because of their general     condition   authorised Superintendent

Mordew and Superintendent Brookfield, who had also attended the scene,       to

debrief Officers and ensure that Serial Sergeants could confirm that all their

Officers were accounted for and to note their whereabouts during the events.

In addition, some Officers who had responded to Operation Support were in the

locality and having consulted with 'D' Division, the Central Division of the
 Force,    I arranged for two Sergeants and 20 Constables to be organised for

 deployment    to     'D'   Division   who   were   suffering   some   potential   disorder

 scenes.

 Once debrief facilities had been dealt with,              I instructed Superintendent

Mordew to stand down those Officers who were no longer required.

Having yet again assessed the situation in the vicinity of the ground, I

instructed that Tango Units, the mobile units on public order duties, should

remain     on patrol    and also liaise with Inspector Hand-Davis,            the Mounted

Inspector, that his Officers should remain on patrol in pairs in an around the

Ground.

I was informed that relative were in the vicinity of the Ground with a view to

identification and was advised that accommodation and planning had been put

into being for identification of the deceased.

Having experienced the stress placed upon Officers and families in and around

the temporary mortuary, I was conscious of the considerable stress placed upon

Officers and arranged for the Force Welfare Officer, Mrs Penny Grimshaw to be

called out for counselling reasons.

I was conscious of the fact that social workers and members of the Church and

Salvation Army had been requested to attend at the scene to assist with the

counselling of relatives.

I was of the opinion that there would be some considerable delay in the

identification of bodies and in the retention on duty of Officers who were

allocated to each body for identification purposes.             In view of this, I caused

feeding arrangements to be put in hand for those Officers who were to be

retained, pending identification of individual deceased persons.

At approximately 9.30pm the Chief Constable, Mr Peter Wright, attended at the

scene and I met him and toured the area of the disaster with him.                   I was

informed that       at approximately 10.15pm that night Mr Colin Monaghan,            the
.^
*       «r
    «


         Minister of State for Sport,          was scheduled to arrive by helicopter at the

         Stadium and arrangements were being made for him to be met.

         My   recollection   is    that   at   approximately   10.30pm    the Minister   arrived,

         accompanied by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield.                Together with the Chief

         Constable and other Officers, I showed Mr Monaghan the scene and described to

         him the facilities at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

         Shortly after this, an impromptu press conference took place on the pitch with

         television and other media representatives and Mr Moynaghan was then taken to

         the Gymnasium where he spoke to Officers concerning their involvement in the

         day’s events.    He later left the scene.

^       At approximately midnight the staff of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

         departed from the Stadium and I arranged for security of the Gymnasium area to

         protect the temporary Mortuary facilities.            Arrangements were made for the

         reception of relatives for identification purposes and social workers and

         members of the Church were briefed to expect relatives attending in distressed

         situations.     These representatives were readily         available    throughout   the

         night and in fact met numerous relatives and remained with them throughout the

         identification procedures.

         I remained in the vicinity of the Gymnasium throughout the night and was

        ..present   through many   identifications     of deceased persons      and noted many

        extremely harrowing situations regarding grieving relatives and the effects

        upon Police involved.        Throughout these procedures Inspector John Charles,

        Detective Policewoman Sandra Lewyn, Police Constable Jean Shelton, maintained

        records of the deceased persons and liaised constantly with Superintendent

        Torr in charge of the casualty bureau arrangements.

        Throughout these events I noted that the Ambulance Liaison Officer was present

        in the temporary Mortuary and at one stage I asked if he could increase the

        number of mobile stretchers available to speed up the identification process.

       The Ambulance Liaison Officer was most helpful in this connection and was

       extremely professional in his duties.               The process of identification continued

       until approximately Bam, when arrangements were made for the remainder of the

       bodies to be removed to the City Mortuary where the process would be continued

       later in the day.

       During the course of events during the evening, the Coroner, Mr Stefan Popper,

       attended    the   scene        together   with    Professor Alan        Usher,   who   both   viewed

       arrangements      and    confirmed the location of bodies                at   the Sheffield City

       Mortuary.

       At approximately 5.30am I left the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and

       returned to Hammerton Road Police Station, where I confirmed that all Officers

       involved    in    the operation        other     than     those   connected   with     the deceased

       persons, had been stood down and were accounted for.

       1 retired from duty at approximately 6am and resumed duty at 8am that same day

       at Police Headquarters.

       I wish to place on record my considerable appreciation of the efforts of all

       individuals involved in this matter,                and in particular the efforts of the

       Officers    involved      in    dealing   with     the    traumatic events       of dealing with

       identification of families of deceased persons, the Social Services and Church

       representatives         and     the   Ambulance     Service       who   maintained      a   presence

       throughout the night.

       I am satisfied that every effort was made to project the professionalism of

       all the Emergency Services and from my experiences have no reservation in

       confirming their dedication to service to the Community.

            Chief Superintendent

            South Yorkshire Police



            In August 1985, I was the Deputy Divisional Commander of the

            Sheffield North Division and on the 7 August, attended a meeting

            at the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club concerning the Safety

            at Sports Grounds Act.

            I have been shown a copy of the notes of that meeting and in

            particular, a reference to    gates formed by the new radial fence

            within the Leppings Lane terraces.

            I recall in general terms, a discussion concerning those gates

            and can say that at no time did the police agree to steward the

            gates or permanently man them.

            The police accepted that they would exercise control and this

            referred to control for segregation purposes.

            In brief, because of the nature of the terraces, it was often

            necessary to only utilize certain areas for away and home

            supporters and to this end, some areas had to be sealed off to

            ensure segregation.    In this connection, keys were in the

            possession of the police, who determined which pens were to be

            utilized and either locked or opened and fastened back gates to

            necessitate segregation.

            At no time did we agree to permanently man those gates, our role

            being one of the maintainance of public order through

            observation and segregation of opposing fans.
Brian Leonard MOLE
Chief Superintendent
South Yorkshire Police



I am the divisional commander of the Barnsley Division of the
South Yorkshire Police.

In .1987 I was the divisional commander of the Sheffield
North Division, *F’ Division and as such had responsibility for
policing the Sheffield Wednesday football ground.

On Sunday 12th April, 1987 I was in overall command of the
policing arrangements for the FA semi final between Leeds
United     Covenfctyy City football clubs which was staged
at the Sheffield Wednesday ground.

I can say that whilst officers were briefed to be aware of the
possibility of none ticket holders attending the game and
that checks should be made to identify them and turn them away,
there were no specific plans to place cordons on Leppings
Lane in the form of barriers and I did not give any instruction
to that effect.  I have no knowledge of any such cordons
being introduced and in fact I would see difficulty in the
introductions of such cordons, even on the footpath, as
vehicular traffic is generally allowed to pass along Leppings
Lane and any attempt to filter pedestrians on the footpath
would be likely to cause danger in that they may step into
the roadway into the path of vehicular traffic.

To myknowledge the only barriers in Leppings Lane were those
that were situate at the various junctions along that road
and which were utilised to restrict access to residents only
in those roads.  This is the normal practice and the only
time I would expect to have seen barriers across the footpath
would be when residents vehicles were being allowed to drive
from Leppings Lane into their respective roads.

Whilsat   I cannot account for individual initiative on the
part of   officers manning those barriers I can say that it
was not   my policy to filter supporters by utilisina barriers
accross   the footpath.

NAME:                            Brian Leonard MOLE

AGE :                            Over 21

OCCUPATION:                      Chief Superintendent of Police

STATION:                         Divisional Headquarters, Churchfield, Barnsley




I am a Chief Superintendent in the South Yorkshire Police and am currently

the Divisional Commander of the Barnsley Division of the Force.

I was appointed a Constable in the Sheffield City Police in October 1963                  and

served in Uniform and CID Duties as Constable and Detective Sergeant, until

1974 when I was promoted to the rank of Inspector.

For a period of two years I            served as Staff Officer          to the    then Chief

Constables and during that time had responsibility for the planning of major

events in the form of Royal visits, in liaison with the Lord Lieutenant of the

County and had a particular responsibility for War Duties.

In 1976 I was promoted to Chief Inspector and posted as Deputy Sub Divisional

Commander to the Sheffield Central Division (D1 Sub Division) where I remained

in post until 1979.        During my time in the Sheffield Central Division, I was

responsible for the policing of football matches at Sheffield United Football

Ground   and   for   the    planning    and        arrangement   of   various   marches   and

demonstrations associated with normal City life.

In 1979 I again transferred to the Research & Development Department with

particular responsibility for planning public order training and policy.

In the October of that year I was promoted to Superintendent and appointed as

head of the newly formed Operations Division.

Almost immediately upon appointment the Steel Strike commenced and I was

responsible for Police operations and planning in connection with that matter.

During that time I had particular involvement at the Hatfields Steel Works,




                                           -   1
which was the scene of much disorder and heavy picketting.

In December 1981, I transferred from the Operations Division and returned to

the Sheffield Central Sub Division as Sub Divisional Commander and again had

some responsibility for football matches and marches and demonstrations in the

City Centre.

In the March of 1982, I took up the post of Detective Superintendent in charge

of the Criminal Investigation Department in the Sheffield North Division.

However, within 3 months I was appointed the Deputy Divisional Commander of

that Division.

I remained as the Deputy Divisional Commander until October 1985 when I was

promoted   to    the   rank   of   Chief   Superintendent     and   appointed   Divisional

Commander of the Division where I remained until the 27 March 1989, when I was

transferred as Divisional Commander to the Barnsley Division.

During my time in the Sheffield North Division, as Deputy Divisional Commander

and Divisional Commander, I was deeply involved in the planning and command of

operations associated with Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and in fact in

1987 was the Officer commanding the                semi final between Coventry City and

Leeds United and in 1988 the match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.

In addition, in 1984 during the Miners dispute, I was involved in the policing

of picket lines in Nottinghamshire, Orgreave, Doncaster and Barnsley and at

times took control of the Force Control Room dealing with the deployment of

personnel to picketting situations.

So far as both the 1987 and 1988 semi finals are concerned, I was directly

responsible for the planning and liaison with the management of Sheffield

Wednesday Football Club and the Football Association.                 On both occasions

negotiations were entered into concerning the allocation of seating areas to

opposing fans and the decision was taken that one team would be allocated the

South Side and the Kop and the other team the North Side and the West Side and




                                           -   2   -
Leppings Lane Terraces.        This decision was based on the geographical location

of   the Stadium     and was    in    an   effort       to ensure complete segregation of

supporters to prevent confrontation and public disorder.                  Consideration was

given to other methods of deployment, but on balance it was felt that this was

the most appropriate separation.

In connection with both the semi final in 1987 and 1988,                    this policy was

followed and the operations were succesfful.

In 1989 during the week prior to Monday 20 March 1989, I was approached by Mr

Graham McKrell the Secretary of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, who

indicated that once again he might be asked to stage the semi final, possibly

between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.                  He asked if I would be able to

confirm that we could Police such an event and I indicated that we would

receive any proposal in a favourable manner should the situation arise.                      I

again indicated that if we did stage that event, I would ask that the same

segregation procedures were utilised as in previous years and that                   Liverpool

would be allocated the North Stand, West Stand and Leppings Leune Terraces and

Nottingham Forest the Kop and South Stand as in the previous year.

On Monday 20 March 1989, I was again contacted by Mr McKrell who confirmed that

he had been asked by the Football Association to stage the semi final between

Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.           He did say that the Football Association had

asked if the allocation of seats could be reversed in that they would like more

facilities for Liverpool fans.         I once again pointed out the reasons for the

decision   taken     the   previous    year     and      after   confirmation   of   the   ACC

(Operations) Mr w w Jackson, I confirmed that there was no possibility of

change and that that was the only manner in which I would be prepared to Police

such an event.     Mr McKrell indicated that he would have to take the matter back

to the Football Association before the final decision was reached

I believe it was later that same day that Mr McKrell contacted me and said that




                                            -   3   -
 the Football Association had accepted the position and that we would be asked

 to Police the semi final on the 15 April 1989 and that the ticket allocations

 would be in accordance with our plans of the previous year.

As a consequence of this information I spoke to Superintendent Murray and

 Inspector Sewell at Hammerton Road Police Station and at 3pm that day made

 arrangements for a meeting to be called for Wednesday 22 March 1989 in order

 that early planning discussions for the event could take place.

Conscious of the fact that I was scheduled to take command of a new Division

on the 27 March 1989, I called upon the proposed new Divisional Commander,

Chief Superintendent D G Duckenfield, to attend that meeting in order that

continuity might remain and he could continue with the planning which would be

m   his domain.    The meeting took place at lOam on 22 March 1989 at Hammerton

Road Police Station and involved all interested parties, including the heads

of Operations and Traffic Division, the Senior Officers who would be involved

in the operation, the Support Staff responsible for preparing the Operational

Order and representatives of British Rail, Public Transport and the Highways

Authority of the County Council.

At that meeting initial plans were made concerning action to be taken and in

particular consideration was given to the mode of travel of supporters and

representation was made by the British Rail representatives for Liverpool to

be brought into the Midland Station in the City Centre and Nottinghamshire to

the Wadsley Bridge Station in the North of Sheffield. Such action would defeat

the segregation plans in that supporters would be crossing each other and I

indicated that this would not be acceptable and asked the British Rail to

reconsider   the matter.      The   reasons        for   their   request   were   based   upon

management difficulties in routing and time scheduling trains.               It was further

agreed at that meeting that the Operations and Traffic Division would take

responsibility    for all   traffic matters         affecting the City       and   that    'D'




                                       -   4   -
 Division, the Central Division, would be responsible for policing their own

 area leaving the match itself to be the responsibility of the Divisional

 Commander of the Sheffield North Division.           The meeting closed at 11am and I

 took no further part in the planning meetings concerning this matter.

Following upon the meeting I spoke to Superintendent Murray and Inspector

Sewell concerning the manpower levels used at the previous year's event and

asked them to examine the position for this year and to determine if any

reductions or increases were appropriate, taking into account our findings the

previous year.     The findings the previous year indicated that some Officers

were under employed and I was conscious of the need not to repeat such a

situation if that was the case and if there were no other factors which might

dictate their need for this future match.               The only other action I took

concerning this matter was to maintain liaison with Mr McKrell during the next

few days and in particular to make reference to the need for clear indications

of tickets by colour coding and appropriate colour coded systems on turnstyles

to ensure easily recognisable access to the Stadium.

In   the   knowledge that   Mr Duckenfield         would be commanding this event,   I

personally selected the Sector Commanders who would be working to him and as

in the previous year utilised the system of using three sectors, those being

the Ground,    the Liverpool supporters outside the ground and the Nottingham

supporters outside the ground.     In this connection I selected Superintendent

Greenwood as the Ground Controller, Superintendent Marshall to be responsible

for the Liverpool supporters and Superintendent Chapman to be responsible for

the Nottingham supporters.       All   three Officers had a wide experience in

policing football matches and in fact had been Sector Commanders at the semi

final the previous year.      The only difference was that Mr Marshall and Mr

Greenwood reversed roles and this was because Mr Marshall, having been my

Deputy for some time, had a better knowledge of the visiting supporters end of




                                       -   5   -
 the ground, ie Leppings Lane, than Mr Greenwood, who had been away freon the

Division for some time albeit              for many     years he had policed matches at

Hillsborough.       In addition.     Superintendent           Murray was identified    as the

officer in charge of the ground control communications and this Officer was in

fact the man who regularly took up that position at First Division matches

 throughout the season.

Prior   to my departure from         'F'    Division I met with Chief Superintendent

Duckenfield and discussed with him             in     general    the problems on Division.

During that discussion the semi final was touched upon and I appraised him of

the staff selected and the fact that Mr Murray was examining the manpower

situation.

On the day of the semi final, Saturday 15 April 1989, I had no role to play in

the operation and was policing my own Division at Barnsley.

At approximately 3.30pm that day I was en route on the Ml motorway from

Barnsley    to Sheffield    when,    on     local    radio,    I heard of difficulties at

Sheffield     Wednesday   Football   Ground.          The   reporter did not   seem    unduly

concerned and spoke of a delay in the match due to a pitch invasion.                    As my

journey progressed, it became clear from the radio reports that the incident

was more serious and there was some indication of possible fatalities.                  Calls

were being made for doctors to attend at the Stadium and a short time later I

heard an appeal     for Police Officers             to respond to Hammerton Road Police

Station.    It was approximately 4pm at this time and I immediately responded to

Hammerton Road Police Station, arriving at approximately 4.20pm.

On arrival,    I saw numerous uniformed Police Officers in the Station area,

including Chief Inspector McRobbie.           I immediately went to the Control Room

and contacted Chief Superintendent Duckenfield in the Police Control Room at

Sheffield Wednesday Football Club via the internal telephone system.                  I asked

Mr Duckenfield if I could be of any assistance to him and he asked if I could
 deploy uniformed Officers into the Leppings Lane area on foot and in an effort

  to calm supporters leaving the ground and show compassion for their apparent

 feelings of distress.

 I immediately went to the Canteen at Hammerton Road Police Station with Chief

 Inspector McRobbie and organised units of men in serials under the command of

 Sergeants and briefed them as to the information in my possession concerning

 the current    situation.     I then deployed Units to locations in and around

 Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground and Chief Inspector McRobbie dealt with

 the notation of deployment.         At this time also present was Superintendent

 Mordew   and   after   deployment      I        obtained   transport    and   together   with

 Superintendent   Mordew     attended       at    Sheffield   Wednesday    Football   Ground,

 approaching from Middlewood Road into Leppings Lane.                   On reaching Parkside

 Road I saw that Leppings Lane was heavily congested by football supporters and

 a large number of fire engines.            I alighted from the car and began on foot

 towards the Stadium and there met Chief Inspector Waring.                The crowd was dense

 and I would generally describe the attitude of supporters as hostile towards
the Police.

I spoke briefly to Chief Inspector Waring and he confirmed that he had little

or no difficulty at that location and the crowds were gradually dispersing.



Together with Superintendent Mordew,               I then turned into the private road

leading to the back of the South stand and on entering that area through the

gates I saw an area of sheeted rails adjacent to the riverside and noted a

number of bodies laid out in that location.                 I was approached by Detective

Inspector Webster who informed me in fact that there were eleven bodies at

that location and he further informed me that there were a further 74 in the

Gymnasium.

Prior to this point the magnitude of the situation had not been known to me and
I immediately made my way through 'C' Gate into the West Stand enclosure and

into   the Police Control Room where,                   on arrival,    I found Assistant Chief

Constable     (Operations)        Mr   Jackson,          Chief   Superintendent       Duckenfield,

Superintendent     Marshall,      Superintendent          Murray,     Police Sergeant     Goddard,

Police Constable Ryan and Police Constale Bishard.                    At this point I noted that

the ground was relatively empty, with the exception of a few supporters in and

around the Leppings Lane end. Press in the Press Box and officials on the

playing area.

I noted that messages were being received on the radio and were being dealt

with by the Control Sergeant and PC and in general they related to outbreaks

of disorder and sporadic fighting in and around the Stadium.                    My attention was

particularly drawn to Superintendent Marshall and Superintendent Murray, who

both seemed to be extremely distressed.                    ACC Mr Jackson was attempting to

speak to Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and Superintendent Marshall and at

some point a telephone call was received and was answered by Mr Jackson.                      From

the nature of the conversation, I formed the opinion that it was a call from

the Chief Constable.         Mr Jackson        was attempting to ask questions of Mr

Duckenfield and Mr Marshall and relate them down the telephone.                    I remained in

the Control Room and listened to what was taking place through the messages

and noted that the main communications handset was not being utilised, but

that personal radios were being used on talk-through facility. At about 5.15pm

Mr Jackson indicated he was to go to Headquarters with Mr Duckenfield and Mr

Marshall    and   informed   me    that   he    had made         arrangements   for    Det   Chief

Superintendent Addis to deal with mortuary arrangements in the Gymnasium and

had given certain instructions to Chief Superintendent Nesbit concerning the

welfare of Officers and their stand-down arrangements. He asked that I remain

at   the Ground with a view to finalising any outstanding matters and to

eventually close down the operation. Throughout this time we were visited by




                                           -    8   -
Fire and Ambulance Senior Officers and I recall                                  Mr Don Page, the Chief

Ambulance Officer, and Mr Harry Wright the Chief Fire Officer, both calling at

the Control Box.

I noticed that a Fire Officer was in fact standing at the top of the steps

leading to the Control Room overseeing the Leppings Lane Terraces. Mr Jackson

and   Mr    Duckenfield     and        Mr   Marshall         then    left    the       Control   Room   and   I

immediately asked for an update from the Sector Commanders in the form of

Superintendent         Chapman    at    the Nottingham              side    of    the Stadium and Chief

Inspector Waring at the Leppings Lane area of the Stadium.                                It was clear that

there was some disorder and no doubt as a consequence of the attitude of

supporters and I instructed that all personnel remain on duty and that the

mobile units, named Tango Units, remain ready and available.

Responses were given to numerous incidents of fighting, but in the fullness of

time calm was restored.

I recall that trains had left the area, as had coaches which were released from

their coach parks and whilst I have no real recollection of time, I recall that

when the situation was calm I made my way to the Gymnasium, leaving Sergeant

Goddard     in   the    Control    Room      and       there   examined          the    temporary Mortuary

facilities accommodating some 85 bodies.                       There was some natural confusion,

but in general things were in order and Detective Chief Superintendent Addis

was controlling the Mortuary aspect.                   I spoke to a number of Officers who were

clearly in shock and were distressed by events which they had experienced. I

noted that the temporary Mortuary was located in the Gymnasium, which was

separated into three sections, the first section containing the bodies, the

second     section     being a relative sterile area where Police Officers were

accommodated and the third section had been set up for identification purposes

and statement taking by CID Officers.                   A separate section had been created for

identification purposes and this was adjacent to a separate office where




                                                   -   9 -
relatives could view bodies in relative privacy.

I formed the opinion that arrangements were well organised and that temporary

Mortuary facilities were well in hand.           During this time I did meet Det

Superintendent McKay and noted that he too was in some way distressed by the

events.

Following the visit to the Gymnasium, I checked the remainder of the Stadium

and made my way to the Directors area of the Sheffield Wednesday Club situate

in the underside of the South Stand, and there saw Graham McKrell the Club

Secretary.   Some members of the staff were clearly distressed and I advised Mr

McKrell regarding counselling facilities for junior members and the need to

ensure that medical facilities were available.

During these conversations Mr McKrell informed me that he had details of the

computer print-outs regarding turnstyle figures at 3pm and that he had seized

them and placed them in his safe (drawer).

Having satisfied myself that things were in order in the Stadium, I resumed

duty the Control Box and then sought security of the terrace subject of the

disaster.

Through Superintendent Mordew I arranged for Officers           to be deployed to

security of the centre pens with the intention of 1) preserving evidence and

2) recovering property subject of those who had been injured or who were

deceased.

I noted that numerous Officers were assembling in the North Stand ready for

debrief and because of their general         condition   authorised Superintendent

Mordew and Superintendent Brookfield, who had also attended the scene,          to

debrief Officers and ensure that Serial Sergeants could confirm that all their

Officers were accounted for and to note their whereabouts during the events.

In addition, some Officers who had responded to Operation Support were in the

locality and having consulted with 'D' Division, the Central Division of the




                                    -   10   -
Force,    I arranged for two Sergeants and 20 Constables to be organised for

deployment    to   'D‘ Division   who       were       suffering   some   potential   disorder

scenes.

Once   debrief facilities had been dealt with,                I instructed Superintendent

Mordew to stand down those Officers who were no longer required.

Having yet again assessed the situation in the vicinity of the ground, I

instructed that Tango Units, the mobile units on public order duties, should

remain    on patrol   and also liaise with Inspector Hand-Davis,                 the Mounted

Inspector, that his Officers should remain on patrol in pairs in an around the

Ground.

I was informed that relative were in the vicinity of the Ground with a view to

identification and was advised that accommodation and planning had been put

into being for identification of the deceased.

Having experienced the stress placed upon Officers and families in and around

the temporary mortuary, I was conscious of the considerable stress placed upon

Officers and arranged for the Force Welfare Officer,]                                   \to be

called out for counselling reasons.

I was conscious of the fact that social workers and members of the Church and

Salvation Army had been requested to attend at the scene to assist with the

counselling of relatives.

I was of the opinion that there would be some considerable delay in the

identification of bodies and in the retention on duty of Officers who were

allocated to each body for identification purposes.                In view of this, I caused

feeding arrangements to be put in hand for those Officers who were to be

retained, pending identification of individual deceased persons.

At approximately 9.30pm the Chief Constable, Mr Peter Wright, attended at the

scene and I met him and toured the area of the disaster with him.                      I was

informed that at approximately 10.15pm that night Mr Colin Monaghan,                      the




                                        -    11    -
Minister of State for Sport,         was scheduled to arrive by helicopter at the

Stadium and arrangements were being made for him to be met.

My   recollection   is   that   at   approximately      10.30pm    the Minister   arrived,

accompanied by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield.                  Together with the Chief

Constable and other Officers, I showed Mr Monaghan the scene and described to

him the facilities at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

Shortly after this, an impromptu press conference took place on the pitch with

television and other media representatives and Mr Moynaghan was then taken to

the Gymnasium where he spoke to Officers concerning their involvement in the

day's events.   He later left the scene.

At approximately midnight the staff of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

departed from the Stadium and I arranged for security of the Gymnasium area to

protect the temporary Mortuary facilities.             Arrangements were made for the

reception of relatives for identification purposes and social workers and

members of the Church were briefed to expect relatives attending in distressed

situations.     These representatives were readily available              throughout   the

night and in fact met numerous relatives and remained with them throughout the

identification procedures.

I remained in the vicinity of the Gymnasium throughout the night and was

present   through many    identifications         of deceased persons    and noted many

extremely harrowing situations regarding grieving relatives and the effects

upon Police involved.      Throughout these procedures Inspector John Charles,

Detective Policewoman                       Police Constable Jean Shelton, maintained

records of the deceased persons and liaised constantly with Superintendent

Torr in charge of the casualty bureau arrangements.

Throughout these events I noted that the Ambulance Liaison Officer was present

in the temporary Mortuary and at one stage I asked if he could increase the

number of mobile stretchers available to speed up the identification process.




                                        -    12   -
       The Ambulance Liaison Officer was most helpful in this connection and was

       extremely professional in his duties.              The process of identification continued

       until approximately 5am, when arrangements were made for the remainder of the

       bodies to be removed to the City Mortuary where the process would be continued

       later in the day.

       During the course of events during the evening, the Coroner, Mr Stefan Popper,

       attended    the scene     together   with      Professor Alan      Usher,   who    both   viewed

       arrangements and confirmed        the   location of bodies at            the Sheffield City

       Mortuary.

      At approximately 5.30am I left           the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and

      returned to Hammerton Road Police Station, where I confirmed that all Officers

      involved     in   the operation    other       than     those connected    with    the deceased

      persons, had been stood down and were accounted for.

      I retired from duty at approximately 6am and resumed duty at 8am that same day

      at Police Headquarters.

      I wish to place on record my considerable appreciation of the efforts of all

      individuals involved in this matter,                and in particular the efforts of the

      Officers     involved   in dealing    with      the     traumatic events     of    dealing with

      identification of families of deceased persons, the Social Services and Church

^     rePresentatives      and   the    Ambulance         Service   who   maintained      a   presence

      throughout the night.

      I am satisfied that every effort was made to project the professionalism of

      all the Emergency Services and from my experiences have no reservation in

      confirming their dedication to service to the Community.

I am a Chief Superintendent in the South Yorkshire Police.

In October 1985 I was promoted to the rank of Chief

Superintendent and appointed Divisional Commander of the

Sheffield North Division where I remained until the 27 March
1989.

During my time in the Sheffield North Division, as Deputy

Divisional Commander and Divisional Commander, I was deeply

involved in the planning and command of operations associated

with Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and in fact in 1987 was

the officer commanding the semi final between Coventry City and

Leeds United and in 1988 the match between Liverpool and

Nottingham Forest.

   fsr ss both the 1987 and 1988 semi finals are concerned, I

was directly responsible for the planning and liaison with the

management of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and the

Football Association.   On both occasions negotiations were

entered into concerning the allocation of seating areas to

opposing fans and the decision was taken that one team would be

allocated the South Side and the Kop and the other team the

North Side and the West Side and Leppings Lane Terraces.      This

decision was based on the geographical location of the stadium

and was in an effort to ensure complete segregation of

supporters to prevent confrontation and public disorder.

Consideration was given to other methods of deployment, but on

balance it was felt that this was the most appropriate
CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT BRIAN LEONARD MOLE                    PAGE 2




separation.



* Paragraph - I have been shown a copy of the Operational Order

for the 1988 Semi Final, which I prepared and which I can say

is a true copy.    I identify it by the label attached which I
have signed.

* A paragraph here should address the agreement between Mole

and Mackrell (see Lord Justice Taylor (Mackrell) Page 89 on)

regarding overflow from A-G being taken up by West Stand
turnstiles.

Did he know of the use of gates 9-10 for North Stand and

aPProve °f it, appreciating the computer counts for sections
would be wrong.    Why post serials to 1-8 and 9-16 in 1988 and

1989 if he knew.

Did Murray know of these agreements if they were infact
adopted.

* Murray says that shortly after joining Division, he was

spoken to by Chief Superintendent Mole and his role in the

activities at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club were explained

to him (See Murray Discipline Interview Page 16).    Can Brian

Leonard Mole confirm or enlarge on this expressing his opinion

of Murray's duty and maintaining safety etc.    (See Inquest D2
20D and D2 23B and C).

He should also explain if he can how it evolved that a

Superintendent should be in control box.    (See South Yorkshire
CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT BRIAN LEONARD MOLE                      PAGE 3




Police SO's guide).     Only needs be a Sergeant or above.



The de-brief system is as follows, firstly once a serial is

stood down the serial sergeant is required to complete a de­

brief document.    This document known as a sheet contains

information as to any incidents that have occurred during the

operation such as arrests, persons injured, use of truncheon by

Police officers or any course of conduct outside the normal

scope of the operation.

The de-brief sheet is then immediately passed by the Sergeant

to the logistics team who review each de-brief sheet before

releasing the serial.

My own supervisory officer de-brief then took place some three

to four days after each semi final.    It is right to say this

de-brief extended to include representatives of every Division

or Department involved.    I can state that in both 1987 and in

1988 the de-briefs did not disclose any suggestion that

supporters had been injured due to overcrowding or crushing.

In addition,   I cannot recall any other agency reporting to me
such a problem.

As regards the tunnel being closed in 1988 by Police Officers

that is the sort of incident I would have expected to have been

on a de-brief sheet.    I was not made aware of the problem in

1988 and as a result my planning for 1989 was not influenced.

Other aspects of my planning did change because of the result
CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT BRIAN LEONARD MOLE                   PAGE 4




of the 1988 de-brief including the removal of air cover and the

removal of one serial from Hillsborough precinct.

It was this that resulted in my view that 1988 was a success

and formed a sound base for the 1989 match.

In connection with both the semi final in 1987 and 1988, this

policy was followed and the operations were successful.

In 1989 during the week prior to Monday 20 March 1989, I was

approached by Mr Graham Mackrell, the Secretary of the

Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, who indicated that once

again he might be asked to stage the semi final, possibly

between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.   He asked if I would

be able to confirm that we could Police such an event and I

indicated that we would receive any proposal in a favourable

manner should the situation arise.   I again indicated that if

we did stage that event, I would ask that the same segregation

procedures were utilised as in previous years and that

Liverpool would be allocated the North Stand, West Stand and

Leppings Lane Terraces and Nottingham Forest the Kop and South

Stand as in the previous year.

On Monday 20 March 1989, I was again contacted by Mr Mackrell

who confirmed that he had been asked by the Football

Association to stage the semi final between Liverpool and

Nottingham Forest.   He did say that the Football Association

had asked if the allocation of seats could be reversed in that

they would like more facilities for Liverpool fans.    I once
CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT BRIAN LEONARD MOLE                    PAGE 5




again pointed out the reasons for the decision taken the

previous year and after confirmation of the Assistant Chief

Constable   (Operations) Mr W W Jackson, I confirmed that there

was no possibility of change and that that was the only manner

in which I would be prepared to Police such an event.     Mr

Mackrell indicated that he would have to take the matter back

to the Football Association before the final decision was
reached.

I believe it was later that same day that Mr Mackrell contacted

me and said that the Football Association had accepted the

position and that we would be asked to Police the semi final on

the 15 April 1989 and that the ticket allocations would be in

accordance with our plans of the previous year.



* Some explanation required here if possible regarding

allocation and turnstiles, and did Murray know of these
agreements if they were infact adopted.



As a consequence of this information I spoke to Superintendent

Murray and Inspector Sewell at Hammerton Road Police Station

and at 3.00 pm that day made arrangements for a meeting to be

caH-ed f°r Wednesday 22 March 1989 in order that early planning

discussions for the event could take place.

Conscious of the fact that I was scheduled to take command of a

new Division on the 27 March 1989,   I called upon the proposed
CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT BRIAN LEONARD MOLE                     PAGE 6




new Divisional Commander, Chief Superintendent D G Duckenfield,

to attend that meeting in order that continuity might remain

and he could continue with the planning which would be in his

domain.    The meeting took place at 10.00 am on 22 March 1989 at

Hammerton Road Police Station and involved all interested

Parties, including the head of Operations and Traffic

Divisions, the Senior Officers who would be involved in the

operation, the Support Staff responsible for preparing the

Operational Order and representatives of British Rail, Public

Transport and the Highways Authority of the County Council.



* Can he say whether Murray was at this meeting.



At that meeting initial plans were made concerning action to be

taken.    The meeting closed and I took no further part in the

planning meetings concerning this matter.    Following upon the

meeting I spoke to Superintendent Murray and Inspector Sewell

concerning the manpower levels used at the previous year's

event and asked them to examine the position for this year and

to determine if any reductions or increases were appropriate,

taking into account our findings the previous year.   The

findings the previous year indicated that some officers were

under employed and I was conscious of the need not to repeat

such a situation if that was the case and if there were no

other factors which might dictate their need for this future
CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT BRIAN LEONARD MOLE                    PAGE 7




match.   The only other action I took concerning this matter was

to maintain liaison with Mr Mackrell during the next few days

and in particular to make reference to the need for clear

indications of tickets by colour coding and appropriate colour

coded systems on turnstiles to ensure easily recognisable

access to the stadium.

In the knowledge that Mr Duckenfield would be commanding this

event, I personally selected the Sector Commanders who would be

working to him and as in the previous year utilised the system

using three sectors, those being the Ground, the Liverpool

supporters outside the ground, the Nottingham supporters

outside the ground.   In this connection I selected

Superintendent Greenwood as the Ground Controller,

Superintendent Marshall to be responsible for the Liverpool

supporters and Superintendent Chapman to be responsible for the

Nottingham supporters.   All three officers had a wide

experience in policing football matches and in fact had been

Sector Commanders at the semi final the previous year.     The

only difference was that Mr Marshall and Mr Greenwood reversed

roles and this was because Mr Marshall, having been my Deputy

for some time, had a better knowledge of the visiting

supporters end of the ground, ie Leppings Lane, than Mr

Greenwood, who had been away from the Division for some time

all be it for many years he had policed matches at

Hillsborough.   In addition, Superintendent Murray was
CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT BRIAN LEONARD MOLE                   PAGE




identified as the officer in charge of the ground control

communications and this officer was in fact the man who

regularly took up that position at First Division matches

throughout the season.

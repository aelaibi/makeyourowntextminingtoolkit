              At 8. 4 5 a m on S a t u r d a y         15 April    1989    I c ommenced duty at Woo ds ea ts

              Po li ce Station,           Sheffield,        from where mys el f and other               offic ers were

              I was      in charge        of 4 serials,           26 to 29     inclusive,       these    comprising       of

My serials were               in p os it io n shortly before                   11.O Oa m that day.

A l t h o u g h not m a n y fans were                  building    up in these areas at              this time,,

g at h e r i n g m a i n l y a r ou n d       the      chip shops an d s an dwich shops w h i ch were

o pen    in the area.                E v e n at this        tiirie I saw fans drinking             from bottles

w hi c h a p p e a r e d to be of beer or                   cider and m any were           seen to be

d ri n k i n g    from an d        carrying         cans of beer and            lager.     During      the    course

of the day           1 was a s k e d        by several        fans     dire ct io ns     to ne ar by    public

houses w h i c h were              open and         in particular         The F o k    Public House,

Foxhill          R o a d 7 w hi ch    r ec eived        pub li ci ty    last year      in relation to the

amount       of alco h ol          consu me d       by the     fans.

One     incident          springs      to min d         regardi n The Bee Hive Public House,

D y k e s Hall       Road.         I recall         one mess ag e       being    passed early        in the     day

relating          to fans      c o ng re ga ti ng outside              these    licensed     premises

d e m a n d i n g access w hich was                 refused     by the     licensee as        1 believe        he

was     closed for           the day.          However,       a short      time    later     I was a p pr o a c h e d

by 4 youths            from L i ve rp oo l          who a sked direc ti on s          to 'Ihe Bee Hive

Pub l i c House.             1 told them not              to bother as he was             closed     but     1 was

told     they were           friends        of the       licensee and were e xp ec te d            there      by him

The     build up of fans               in the L ep pi ng s Lane area obv io us ly                  increased as

the     kick      off time a p p r o a c h e d an d numerous               persons were        seen     in

p o s s e s s i o n of alcohol             m ai n ly    cans of beer and          lager.      R eq ue st s    for

d ir e c t i o n s   to     public: houses             continued       during    the afternoon.

I recall          that at the          pre -m at ch       briefing we were            told that      the     train

from Liv e r po ol          was      due    to arrive at W a ds l ey Bridge S t a t i o n at Ssi.OEpm

that day.            However,         it did        in fact arrive         about      10 minu te s     early.

L e p p i n g s Lane        then     became      bloc ke d by the masses              of fans making          their

way     to the ground and a l t h ou g h many were                        drinking and        carrying        cans

of alcohol            the    banter        betw een myself         and the fans was           f ri endl y and
                                                                                                            PAGE
                                                                                                            R 136

good h u m ou r ed and            I saw none of the obvious                   signs of drunkenness.

Although           towards       kick    off time      the m as se s        thinned    c on si de r ab l y there

were     still       fans w a lk in g and         running along             Leppi ng s Lane      to the

ground.            I believe        that at sometime            after       £ . 0 0 pm an   in s t r uc ti on was

given,      th o u gh      I do not know by whom,                to    close L ep pi ng s Lan e        to

v eh i c u l a r    traffic.

During       the a f t e r n o o n      1 was a sk ed by possi bl y 7 or 8 fans                   if 1 knew

the    location of any ticket                   touts     for    them to buy tickets.                 I was      not

a ware     of any         in the area.          This     se em ed strange         in so m u c h as the

previous year w h en                the same two teams            played at H i l l s b o r o u g h     I saw

numerous           ticket       touts,     who as    the kick         off a p p ro a ch e d were almost

giving       tickets        away     to the      fans.     This       year    I also      saw numerous        fans

a s k i n g other         fans     if they had any spare               tickets.        On each o cc asion

the answer was              no.

As the kick           off a p p r o a c h e d    I was    not    near       the L ep pi ng s Lane

turn s t i l e s w h i c h we were           told at the         briefing would             be op en ed at       12

noon.

Once     the       fans    had     cleared      in L ep pi n gs Lane         I began ma ki ng my way to

C l a y w h e e 1s Lane         for a m e a l , w he n    I was       d ev iated to go to the Leppings

Lane     turnstiles.              This w ou ld be s ho r tl y after 3 . 0 0 p m that                 day.

On my arrival              at    that    location a short             time    later,      I saw numerous

officers           in that a re a but few fans.                  I found       radio t r an s mi ss io ns at

that     time       from gr ou nd        control    almost       u nreadable        due     to the    noise

being made           by the       spectators.          In a d d i t i o n    to this,       constable s were

not    issued w it h            radios and had to           rely on s up er vi so ry          officers      to    pas

o n me s s ages         t o t h em .

A short        time after           this    I was   told to go to the               rear of the West

Stand.         I do       not    recall    whet he r     this    i ns tr uc ti on     came from ground

control        or a no t he r       officer      in L ep pi n gs Lane.

On my arrival              in the are a behind            the West S tand           I saw numerous
                                                                                                           PAGE
                                                                                                           R 136

persons         in the a re a g e ne ra ll y m i ll i ng about.                 I saw some were

distressed,          g as pi ng      for   breath,       others    either       sitting     or    lying    on the

floor     injured and until                X heard of a f at al i ty the se ri ou sn es s                 of the

s i t u a ti o n did not         become apparent            to m e .

I saw o ff icers a s s i s ti n g with              c asualties and giving m o u t h               to mouth

r es u sc i t a t i o n to      persons       on the floor,            I a s s i s t e d other    officers

wi th    the     removal        of the     injured to outside              the ground and          into the

a re a   behind      the West S t a n d w hich joins L ep pi ng s Lane and P e ni st on e

R oa d North.           M ys e lf and other         offic er s     gave      comfort and what          other

a s si s t a n c e we    could until           a fleet      of a m b ul a nc e s   began a rr iv i ng at the

scene.          I recall        doctors,       nurses and first aiders a rr iv i ng                 in the

a r e a to assist.              I he lp ed with the          placing       of the      injured     into the

ambulances.             Dur in g     the   course     of events         I saw about        10 dead bodies

lying     by the        railings        guar ding     the    river and         protected     from    public

view by a line             of    police       officers.

A l t h o u g h a m bu l an c es     were wanting         to get       into the a rea       behind the West

S t an d this was          i mpossible as the             crowds       in that area w ould          not

disperse.          F e el i ng     amon gs t    several      fans were         running     high an d      I was

ve rb a ll y a bu s ed on several               o ccasions as were             other    o ff icers wit hi n my

hearing.          B e ca u se    of the feeling           of the       crowd    in that are a       I was

fearful         of a serious           public     order     s i tu at io n arising        though than kf ul ly

this     did     not h a p p e n .     During      the    course     of events         I did not h a n d 1e

any bodies.

So me t im e after        4. 0 0 p m    the    crowds     began to       leave the        ground ma n y     in a

sombre mood,            m any    v er ba l ly abus in g      the   police.         Once    they had       cleared

1 went      onto     the terrace at the L ep pi n gs                 Lane end of          the ground and

a s s is t ed    in the      removal       of a small        number      of spectators who were

still     remaining.             This was       to f ac il it at e      the taking        of photographs           of

the a r e a .

I have      policed       two      other      semi-f in al s    in recent years.             In    1988,    when
                                                                                                        PAGE
                                                                                                        R 136

     the same      two    teams     took       part.     On this   o cc as io n    I spent m uc h of my

     time    before      the     kick    off    in the are a of the L ep pi ng s Lane

     turnstiles.          I do not        recall       any seri ou s   public order s i t u a t io n on

     this    o c c a si o n at    that    location.         I recall    several        ticket   touts   being

     in the a rea who were almost                  giving     tickets away as           the kick off

     approa ch ed .       Myself        and other       officers   were also        handed tickets       by

     fans    to pass      on to others w i sh in g ac ce ss            to the g a m e .

     In 198'7,     1 was       on duty at        the semi-final        between Leeds and Coventry.

     I was     policing        the a re a behind the S o ut h S tand              between L e p p in g s Lane

     a n d P e n i s t on e R o a d North.        Again,     on this    o cc as io n    I do not   recall

     any    problems.

                 states:
I was    born     on    the   23rd   April       1936.         I    am    a    Control

Superintendent. I have been with SYMAS for 24 years.                                I was

a   Control      Officer      from   the       15th    October       1973,          until

promotion to a Control Superintendent on the 3rd April 1989.

On Thursday and Friday I was not working.                   On Saturday I was
to work from 0600 to 1400 hours.                 My first involvement with
the Hillsborough incident was that we had two additional

crews on from 1000 to 1800 hours which was purposely for the

Football    stand by.         They were used generally until                         1300

hours and were then sent back to the Stations at Longley and

Middlewood.        The Longley ambulance then went down to the

ground and was based there.
Ray   Clarke     took    over   as   Control          Superintendent           at    1400
hours.     He knew about the Middlewood vehicle as he had been

briefed the day before.          It was Clarke who had told me about
the Middlewood vehicle and I believe that Clarke had been

briefed by David Jones.

I went home at about 1425.           I had a coffee and a nap. About

1525 I got a phone call saying there was a major incident

and would I go to the Northern General to act as liaison

      officer.          The message came from                       I immediately

set off to Northern General after putting                      my uniformon.                I

didn't know what type of incident it was.
I arrived      at Northern       General at about 1550.                   Everything

appeared    to    be    busy with     ambulances           coming as            I was
approaching       the    Hospital.         I    tried     to       find    a    vacant




                                      132.
     telephone to notify Control that I had arrived.                         I phoned in
     at about      1605 and spoke to Mr Smith the Assistant Chief

     Ambulance      Officer        responsible         for   Control,       Liaison      and

     Planning.       He told me to find out the number of casualties

     at Northern General and the number of deceased.

     I then went to the casualty area and told them that I was an

     ambulanceman.           I liaised with the police who were setting
     up an incident room.               I then went outside so I could speak

     to the crews who were arriving to say that I was on site and

     available      to     help.    I    spoke    to    about     four   crews      in    45

     minutes.
     At   about     1700    I was       trying    to    establish     the     number      of

     patients who had been received at the Northern General and

     the number of deceased but everyone was too busy for this

     information to be collated.                 I would say that the incident

     was now peaking off.

8.   My contact at Control was S & E                          . He telephoned me at

     1700    and    suggested       that    I contact         him    every    20    to    30

     minutes.      I was telling him about patient movement, passing

     information between Control and the Hospital.                           The senior

     doctor was concerned with the number of casualties and in

     particular      how    many     would    be   arriving         later    on    as    the
     Hallamshire closes at 2100 on a Saturday.                      It was suggested

     that the Rotherham District General might be able to assist

     after   2100    when     the    Hallamshire        closed.       I passed          this

     information back to Control.
                    told me that he was sending up four ambulances



                                             133
around 1815 to 1845              They were to be used to transfer the
dead     from    the        Hospital   to    the     temporary    mortuary     at

Hillsborough.
I went to the police at Northern General to see if they were

aware that bodies were to be transferred to Hillsborough.

They were not aware of this and asked on whose authority the

transfers were to be made.               I said it was on the Coroners
authority and I was then given the go ahead.                     The ambulances

arrived and I went down in one of them to the mortuary at

the     Hospital       to    supervise      loading.     On   arrival    at   the
mortuary       I rang                          We were    loading    the    first

ambulance when                         rang me and said that we should

stop further loading as the police inspector at Hillsborough

had     said    that    they    couldn't      cope     with   any more     bodies
arriving.        By the time that            I got back to the Hospital

mortuary to tell them the first ambulance had set off.                          I
used the radio set in an empty ambulance to try to contact

Control    to tell          them to bring the first ambulance back.

Control were unable to contact the first ambulance.                      At this

time the police then arrived with an escort for each dead

body.     They said that the previous instructions had now been
cancelled       and that       all   bodies were       to be moved down       to
Hillsborough.      I rang                    to let him know        this.     We

loaded the ambulances with three bodies and a police officer

for each body.          The ambulancemen set off.

I went back to casualty and told                         that I was now back

and that bodies were being transferred.



                                         134-
12.   I then waited at the Hospital and finished at 2310.



13.   I was aware of the Hillsborough Plan as well as the Major

      Incident Plan.

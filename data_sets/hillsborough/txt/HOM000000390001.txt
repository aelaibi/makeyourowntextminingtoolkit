from C l i n t o n i a of Brentwood,

We all met           at the Horse and G ro om Public House,                     Brentwood,       Essex at             i

7 . 3 0 am on m at ch day.              On rout9?rw« -did stop at the first service

s tat i o n on the Ml           for breakfast-            I also had two         cans of        lager on the.

bus *     We       arrived at S h e f f ie l d at about           11.30 am and parked about               2

miles     from the ground and the S pi on Kop end of the ground*                                   We   parked

jyay from the gr ou nd to enable                    an easy gettaway after the match.                         I

did not see any             police       presence       at this time.

I s u b s e q u e n tl y made my way to the ground an d to the Leppings Lane                                  end*

I a r r i v e d at about 2.30             pm and at this          time    I was       stood towards      the

fajf     but       in a mass      of   p*eople all       presumably trying            to get    in the

ground.            The   crowds were          in good heart,       singing and joking             but getting

impatient           as the queue was           going down*         I saw       four    policemen on

ho r s e b a c k    but didn't         see any on foot          patrol.        I heard the Police

shouting           11K e ed back and try to form queues                  but    I was    getting     crushad

badly and had my arms                   pinned to my side a lt ho u gh            I could breathe

alright        at    this   time*        I saw a m a n     in front       of me with a young            lad and

he shou t e d to a policeman for help as his                            lad was       crying.     I c a n ’t

f a n-

him as       I was       getting       p>ushed from side          to       side but       I saw him     later                 a

the side           out   of the    crowd which          is where       I made my way too because                  I

c o u l d n ’t stand the          crush any more*           At this       time    I was    just with

                                  I got       out of the    crush at about 2*50             pm an>;

intended wa_iting till                  the    crowd had either          gone    in or away from the

ground*            I knew the entrance            that    I was    to enter as          I had been to the

ground       on previous          occasions       but    it was well       sign       posted outside       by

the ground through the                       gates.        I also went w it h the                 crowd through the

ticket as              an exhibit,          exhibit       reference JPB/1.                                                        (

I had seen              people       climbing    the*-*<ir.s41-s at the Leppings                  Lane end and

trying           to either       get       into the ground or out of the                       crush.

Whe n       i got       through the gates             I saw two            programme        sellers       to the        left

and         I stopped with                       and we bought               some      programmes.            i was       one

of the first                 through       the gate but         it wasn't         a big       rush.       I had plenty

of     room and time             to buy my       programme            and having done so I walked

towards a tunnel                 as    I could see the             pitch,         I didn't        see any signs

directing              people    left or       riqht or any stewards                    or Pol ic em en doing the

same,           so    I headed thro ug h the tunnel                   which at time was               clear although

some        other were          p e o d 1e where walking towards                      the   pitch.        I d i d n ’t see •

anyone           di r^ct ing     o e o p 1 e either        into or away from the tunnel.                           At     the

end of the              tunnel       I saw a barrier w hi ch divided two sections                                  known as

r i g pd5   3    and    4,     For    no    reason    I    s e le c te d    to   go    to   the    rig h t    of    the

barrier              in pen 3 a lt houg h       I could have gone to the                       left as        it was       full

at the tunnel                 entrance       although       it was         packed just         in front        of the end

of the tunnel                 in both pens.           I pushed my way forward                      into      pen 3 in the

normal manner                 at football       matches         and didnt          have much difficulty

in getting              forward about          10 foot        and event ua ll y took up position                          in

line w ith the                right hand       post as you            look       at the goal m outh from the

L ep p i n g s Lane           stand.

As      I got         to the    end of the tunnel               the        players     came    onto the         pitch and

yhsji i e v e nt u al l y took               up my position they were still                         kicking about

prior           to kick       off.

When         I took up my            position    I was         still with                         and then noticed

                             by me who had t ra velled up with us,                          although         I h a d n ’t

to some extent                             it was        no worse            than it had been the            previous year when

I had been                   in the same                   pen.       The      crush is quite          normal     on kick-off

time    and usually                              it eases        after 5 or           10 minutes       when people have founii

the ball              hit           the          bar.

This was              after                about 4 m i n u t e s .             Liverpool       were    at this time       playing

towards              the S pion Kop end and away from Leppings                                            Lane.    This surge         is

quite       normal                  at a Liverpool                   m at ch although following                the surge    the

crowd goes                   in a backward .movement and thus                                  people      generally end up at

the     point               thev had started*                         This was not the            case at H il ls bo r ou g h and

the     crush was                          only a forw ard or sideways                      movement       and 1 had no control

over    the d i r ec t io n                         in whi ch I was             taken.        When the surge occurred             1

was aware               of a barrier                       about       15 feet    in front       of me       collapsing    and

the    people                near                bv went     catapulting          forwards.           At this     time of being

carried by and w ith the                                     crowd I experi en ce d             intense       heat and my body

was    if       I had just got out of shower-                                          My    clothes      were also saturated,

as a result                      of the heat.                    The heat        had built        up and up and       it felt         as

if I had been in a dessert.                                            I always        remained on my feet           and dont

control              of my movements                         for the          ID minutes,       when      it eased I made my

way     to the                   rear of the               pen.       I ended up            at the    rear but by the fencing

separating _pens 3 an d 2.                                       At this       point        I saw a gate that was          open and

a llowed me access                                 to pen 2 and this was                    considerable       emptier at that

time.           I looked at my w at ch and                                    I got    into    pen 2 at       about .3.30 pm.

I felt          in a trance and was                                obv io us ly as          I now know suffering          from

shoe k »                                                            ...
            I did not            know at    this   time .yhat had happened to

                               a p pr o ac h ed me about     15 minutes            later.     I had in between time

            been helping             pass a dv e rt i si n g   boards         from pen 2 onto       the   pitch area.

            The        boards      had been    removed from the facia of the seating area on the,/

            i
            Aigct, Stand.                                            _ _

            At about 4 pm I saw                              and some others            from off the mini        bus

            standing and             some sitting an d around the                    centre    cirle on the    pitch.

                               and myself went       to the front             of    pen £ and the gate onto the

            pitch was            shut and a policeman was              stood by it.             I asked   if I could go

            onto        the     pitch to my friends            and he said           "certainly" and      let us

            onto the            playing area.

            iAi e    then could account for             8    out of     1 0    people from the mini         bus and

            t,hen remained on the                playing       until asked to leave via the                loudspeaker

            s ystem and            I left the ground at about 4.45                     pm.

            party were             safe   and we    returned to B r e n t w o o d .           We did stop for      a bite

            to eat         and arrived home at              10 .30    pm.      (Sign©d)

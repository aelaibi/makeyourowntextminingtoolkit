             I am a Police Constable          in the South Yorkshire Police,             at present

             stationed at Cudworth.

             On Saturday the 9th of April,             "1988 (090488),      my tour of duty was

             8 . 13am (0813)a4 . 1 5 pm (1615), and after          commencing duty at Cudworth I

             was transported to Hillsborough,                Sheffield,    where   I paraded for

             football match briefing at 9.30am                (0930).     The match in question on

             this date being between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest,                       and was       in

             fact an FA Cup Semi Final.

             liy Serial Sergeant was PS Higgins and part of my duty that day was to

             search supporters just after they had entered the football                        ground at

             the Leppings Lane end of the ground,                this being for weapons,          drink

             et c .

             Th i.s was ca r r ie d o ut by my s e If a n d o t he r o f f i ce r s and t o t h e be s % o f

             my knowledge was          carried out with a minimum of delay and good

             h um o u re d fa s h io n .

             Whilst supporters were entering the ground although it was obvious

             that a few of them may have had drink before entering the ground,                             X

             personally saw no signs of alcohol abuse.

             After    the start of the football match,             my duty was then somewhere              in

             the bottom of the West Stand,             but    in all honesty I— cannot— remeiribei

         exactly where,    although I do recollect that   I did not see any

         evidence of people being drunk or signs of crushing or danger to any

         person.

         After the football match had ended my duty was to escort supporters

         to Hillsborough Railway Station and again this was carried out with a

         minimum o f   delay e t c .

         My full tour of duty was then completed and ended at 7 . 0 0 pm <1900)

         this date after returning to Cudworth.

GENERAL COMMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS

        Many feel that the report has been written based on
capacity crowds and there is no room for flexibility.  No
account appears to have been taken of local circumstances and
differing attendances.

        Clubs in lower divisions feel aggrieved that they have
been linked with grounds with massive capacities compared with
theirs.

Dear Sirs

il^IRY INTO THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER

I refer to your letter of 2 October to Mr Whalley, the Secretary to the Inquiry, who
has asked me to reply.

There is only one list of those documents which were presented to the Inquiry: this
list was itself formally presented to the Inquiry as well as being circulated to the
parties.  I think the best thing is to let you have a copy of this list.     This is
accordingly enclosed.    As you will see, there are no gaps in the numbering.

                                          Yours faithfully



                                                 <£»

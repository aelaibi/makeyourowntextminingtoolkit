      Dear Lord Justice Taylor

      I am sorry you are having to come to Sheffield in such tragic circumstances.

      I do, however, want to offer the full co-operation      of   all    officers      of
      Sheffield City Council to help in your investigation.

      I am sure you will be contacting the appropriate officers directly to engage
      their assistance, but if there is anything I personally can do, please do not
      hesitate to let me know.


      Yours sincerely




       CLIVE BETTS
       Leader of the Council




                                                                                             R3474

 The Press Council have this week forwarded to The Sun a nuiriber
 of letters concerning coverage of the Hillsborough disaster.
 Your communication containing criticism of aspects of that reporting
 was among the letters sent to this office.

 I write to advise you that a reply to your original letter of
 complaint was sent to you by The Sun Managing Editor last week.
 There is now concern that you received this response.

 You may still have queries on this very irrportant issue and I
 now ask you to advise me direct of any further matters you wish
 raised. A stamped addressed envelope is enclosed if you wish
 to reply.

 In conclusion, I wish to place on record our undertaking that
 The Sun will be publishing in full the findings of the Press
 Council inquiry into the Hillsborough coverage by newspapers
 and TV. We are advised that some 300 complaints embracing all
 newspapers were received by the council.


 Yours sincerely,




 Kenneth Donlan

HILLSBOROUGH

Following th e screening o f th e dram a docum entary "Hillsborough" on Thursday 5 D ecem b er 1 9 9 6
and your letter d ated 2 0 D ecem ber, I h ave now had th e opportunity to study in som e detail the
contents o f th e program m e and to conduct further research.

As a result of th e research into th e m aterial collected by W e s t M idlands Police for th e Lord Justice
T aylo r Inquiry and th e transcripts o f evid en ce given a t th at inquiry, tw o volum es of docum ents
h ave been com piled which cover th e m atters raised in your letter. It w ould serve no useful
purpose fo r m e to transcribe certain parts o f th e evid en ce into this letter and it seem s appropriate
to provide th e docum ents to you in th eir present form .

V o lu m e O n e deals with video evidence, to g eth er with com m ents from th e coroner, D octor Popper,
H om e O ffice Pathologist, P rofessor U sher, D octor G um pet, a consultant neurologist, and
D octor S later. A lso in th ese docum ents are com m ents from Police C o n stab le Bichard concerning
th e operation of th e video cam eras in question.

Let m e say a t th e o utset th a t no new evid en ce has em erg ed and th e issues raised in th e television
program m e have all previously been aired in Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry o r th e coroner's inquest.

P erhaps I can address specifically th e concerns m entioned in your letter d ated 2 0 D ecem ber. First
of all I m ust em phasise once again th at th ere is no new evidence. S econdly, you see k clarification
on w h eth er film from a video cam era trained on th e central enclosure w as availab le to th e T aylo r
Inquiry. Such a video film w as m ade availab le to th e T aylo r Inquiry and a copy is enclosed for your
inform ation, to g eth er with an o th er video film , com pleting th e video record availab le from police
sources, th at day. T h e second video, like th e first, w as m ade availab le to Lord Justice Taylor. You
will s ee th at they did not provide any useful inform ation to th e m atch com m anders on th e day of
th e disaster and th e program m e m akers m ay be m istaken in thinking th at th ey did.

Police C o n stab le Bichard g ave evidence to Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry concerning th e workings
of th e cam era on th e day in question and his evidence can be seen in volum e o n e of the
docum ents provided, a t Section Tw o.

Police C o n stab le Bichard told th e Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry th at w hilst som e pictures w ere
availab le from th e cam era in question they w ere o f poor quality although th e cam era w as in fact
working.

T h ere does seem to be som e confusion about th e video tap es and perhaps I can clarify the
position. Evidence given by Police C onstable Bichard concerns th e cam era film ing inside th e
ground although, as I h ave previously m entioned, it w as not working properly. W h ilst it w as
focused on th e Leppings L ane end o f th e ground exclusively, th e recorded m aterial on th e ta p e
enclosed is a com pilation o f a num ber o f cam eras situated around th e ground. S everal cam eras
are used by control room personnel to scan th e ground and its environs but th ese record fo o tag e
only w hen transferred to certain monitors in th e control room. It will be seen from th e enclosed
video th a t fo o tag e from several cam eras had been recorded on th e day in question. W h e re th e
reproduction is o f poor quality then th at is th e cam era trained on th e Leppings L ane end of the
ground. For your inform ation I h ave also included a video schedule (p rep ared by th e W e s t
M idlands Police fo r th e T aylo r Inquiry and included h ere in th eir original form ) of th e se particular
tap es which form th e basis o f a transcript of th e film which w as m ade availab le to Lord Justice
Taylor's Inquiry. P le as e s ee Section O n e in V o lu m e O n e.

Although your letter o f 2 0 D ecem b er does not refer specifically to th e asp ect of missing tap es, it
has been an issue causing som e confusion. W e clarified this fo r th e M inister, David M acL ean , for
his intended contribution to th e A djournm ent D e b a te o f 17 D ecem ber. For your convenience, I
rep eat th at clarification here. T h e missing ta p e is a sep arate issue entirely from th a t of w h eth er or
not th e police cam eras w e re w orking. In addition to th e police control centre within th e ground,
S h effield W ed n esd a y Football Club also had a video recording facility and indeed had th eir own
recording suite. This w as entirely under th e supervision o f S h effield W ed n e sd a y Football Club and
th e police had no control in its operation. During th e night follow ing th e disaster tw o video tap es
w en t missing from th a t particular room. S h effield W e d n e sd a y em ployees say th at th e room w as
locked and th e alarm set. W h en they returned th e next m orning th e room w as still locked with th e
alarm still arm ed. T h ey did, how ever, discover th at tw o video tap es w e re missing. O n e o f th e
tap es w as of no use w h atso ever owing to th e fac t th at following building w orks around th e ground
th e cam era w as trained on a brick w all. T h e oth er ta p e w as from a cam era a t a fixed point outside
th e playing are a and w as trained on th e turnstiles a t th e Leppings Lane end of th e ground. As
such it did not give a view o f th e terracing o r indeed any internal part o f th e ground.

Following th e discovery of th e th eft th e crim e w as recorded and W e s t M idlands police officers
m ade enquires to trace th e person responsible. To d ate th a t crim e rem ains undetected. I hope
th at clarifies th e position concerning th e video tapes.

A further point raised is th e m atter concerning th e coroners im posing a 3 .1 5 pm cut off point a fter
which he w ould not ta k e any evidence. In V olum e O n e o f th e enclosed docum ents this issue is
explained in som e detail. D octor P opper took evid en ce from , am ong others, Professor Usher,
D octor S late r and D octor G u m p et concerning th e injuries to th e d eceased and th eir likely tim e of
rem aining alive a fte r th e initial crush.    T h at evidence, coupled with D octor Popper's own
observations o f th e disaster, led him to believe th at 3 .1 5 pm w as an appropriate point at which to
call a clearly defin ed cut o ff tim e.

Finally, if I m ight turn to th e ten questions posed to th e H om e S ecretary, then once again I have to
inform you th at th ere is nothing new in th ese questions. T h ey have all been asked previously at
eith er Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry o r th e coroner's inquest. T h e second volum e o f docum ents
enclosed deals exclusively w ith th e ten questions and you will see, from th e copy of th e transcripts
provided, th at th e questions w ere indeed addressed and d eb ated a t som e length. In fac t eight out
o f th e ten questions resulted in a direct recom m endation from Lord Justice Taylor. T h e two
questions which did not result in a recom m endation w e re questions six and ten - th e first about the
allegation o f C h ief S u p erin ten d en t D uckenfield's lying and th e latter ab o u t w hy only fourteen of
those w ho died w e re taken to hospital. Though th ere w ere no recom m endations from th ese two
points, th ey w ere fully addressed.

A se p arate section has been allocated to each question with th e relevan t com m ents from
w itnesses highlighted for e a s e o f reading. I have also ad d ed a brief resum e preceding each
section, again to facilitate reading.

Extracts from Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry h ave been included to illustrate th e fa c t th at all th e
issues raised in th e ten questions have been fully exam ined. Having heard all th e evid en ce of
events surrounding th e disaster, Lord Justice T aylo r arrived a t his conclusions and m ade
recom m endations.

It is my considered opinion th a t th e dram a docum entary "Hillsborough" provided no evidence upon
which to launch a new inquiry or anything to a ffec t Lord Justice Taylor's original findings.

HILLSBOROUGH

Following the screening o f the dram a docum entary "Hillsborough" on Thursday 5 D ecem ber 1996
and your letter dated 2 0 D ecem ber, I have now had the opportunity to study in som e detail the
contents of the program m e and to conduct further research.

As a result of the research into the m aterial collected by W e s t M idlands Police fo r the Lord
Justice Taylor inquiry and the transcripts o f evidence given at that inquiry, tw o volum es of
docum ents have been com piled which cover the m atters raised in your letter. It would serve no
useful purpose fo r m e to transcribe certain parts of the evidence into this letter and it seem s
appropriate to provide the docum ents to you in their present form.

Volum e one deals with video evidence, together with com m ents from the coroner, Doctor Popper,
H om e O ffice Pathologist, Professor Usher, Doctor G um pet, a consultant neurologist, and
Doctor Slater. Also in these docum ents are com m ents from Police C onstable Bichard concerning
the operation of the video cam eras in question.

Let m e say a t the outset that no new evidence has em erged and the issues raised in the
television program m e have all previously been aired in Lord Justice Taylor's inquiry or the
coroner's inquest.

Perhaps I can address specifically the concerns m entioned in your letter dated 20 Decem ber.
First of all I must em phasise once again th at there is no new evidence. Secondly, you seek
clarification on w hether film from a video cam era trained on the central enclosure w as available
to the Taylor inquiry,         video film w as m ade available to the Taylor inquiry and a copy is
enclosed for your in fo rm atio n ^ Y o u will see th at jh ilfd not provide any useful inform ation to the

               Police C onstable Bichard g ave evidence to tho coroner's inque st-concerning the workings o f the
               cam era on the day in question and his evidence can be seen in volum e one o f the docum ents
               provided, at-item fe a r . T ^ * â 2 - .

               Police C onstable Bichard told t-he-cofeRer th at whilst som e pictures w ere available from the
               cam era in question they w ere of poor quality although the cam era w as in fact working.

               T h ere does seem to be som e confusion about the video tapes and perhaps I can clarify the
               position. E vidence given by Police C onstable Bichard concerns the cam era filming inside the
               ground although, as I have previously m entioned, it w as not working properly. W hilst it w as
               focused on the Leppings Lane end of the ground exclusively, the recorded m aterial on the tape
               enclosed is a com pilation o f a num ber o f cam eras situated around the ground. Several cam eras
               are used by control room personnel to scan the ground and its environs b u t^ ^ ^ re c o rd footage
               w hen transferred to certain monitors in the control room. It will be seen from the enclosed video
               th at footage from several cam eras had been recorded on the day in question. W h ere the
               reproduction is o f poor quality then th at is the cam era trained on the Leppings Lane end of the
               ground. For your inform ation I have also included a video schedule o f these particular tapes
               which form the basis o f a transcript of the film which w as m ade available to Lord Justice Taylor's
               inquiry. P le a s e see section one in volum e one.

      &        T h e missing tap e is a sep arate issue entirely. In addition to the police control centre within the       ^y^e-
               ground, Sheffield W ed n esd ay Football Club also had a video recording facility and indeed had             f**y
               their own recording suite. This w as entirely under the supervision o f Sheffield W ednesday
               Football Club and the police had no control in its operation. During the night following the
uA^aJife^ **   disaster two video tapes w ent missing from th at particular room.              Sheffield W ednesday
               em ployees say that the room w as locked and the alarm set. W h en they returned the next
               morning the room w as still locked with the alarm still arm ed. T hey did, however, discover th at two
     cc-
               video tapes w ere missing. O ne o f the tapes w as o f no use w h a t s o e v e r t h e fact that
               following building works around the ground the cam era w as trained on a brick wall. T he other

               tap e w as from a cam era at a fixed point outside the playing area and w as trained on the
               turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end of the ground. As such it did not give a view o f the terracing
               or indeed any internal part o f the ground.

               A further point raised is the m atter concerning the coronersimposing a 3 .1 5 pm cut o ff point after
               which he would not take any evidence. In V olum e O n e of the enclosed docum ents this issue is
               explained in som e detail. Doctor Popper took evidence from , am ong others, Professor Usher,
               Doctor S later and Doctor G um pet concerning the injuries to the deceased and their likely tim e of
               rem aining alive after the initial crush.      T h at evidence, coupled with Doctor Popper's own

            Here are the faxed questions as promised, together with my covering letter to
            Paul Pugh which w e agreed over the 'phone.

            When you and your staff approach the 10 questions, I think that we ought to take the
            most helpful stance that w e can possibly manage. We could, in a logical sense, adopt a
            minimalist stance and simply refer to sections and paragraphs o f the various documents
            produced by the three Inquiries. However, I think that this would show us in a poor
            and defensive light when our actions - right and wrong - have been already extensively
            reviewed by the judicial system.

       HILLSBOROUGH

           Thank you very much for your letter, faxed to us this afternoon,

       Like the Home Secretary, I have given a public undertaking to scrutinise the Granada "drama
       documentary" with a view to seeing if it contains any new evidence and to pursuing such new
       material if it emerges.

           It is the professional view o f those o f our officers completely familiar with the material
           afforded to the previous enquiries - Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry; the Inquest before HM
           Coroner and the Judicial Review - that there is in fact no new evidence brought forward. We
           are content to have this view challenged,

           The programme is also inaccurate in a number o f respects. Whilst this is expected in a
           programme with any dramatic content, the observation should be seen in the context o f
           Granada's assertions as to the filmâs factual base.

           I will have staff examine the ten questions you have relayed to me as soon as possible and
           certainly before the end o f January,

                                       THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER:

                                           TEM UNRESOI ,VED QUESTIONS


            ONE

            Why was Chief Superintendent David Duckenfteld put in charge of a major semi-final
            only 21 days btfore the game, when he was relatively inexperienced at policing
            football matches?

            TWO

           Why were there no barriers or cordons to filter the crowd and prevent a build up
           outside the Leppings Lane end of the ground if, as the fans insist, there were the
           previous year?

           THREE

           Why was the game not delayed, as a number of police officers thought it should have
           been, when it became obvious that it would not be possible to get all the Liverpool
           fans safety into the ground before the 3pm kick-off?

           FOUR

           Why didnât police recognise overcrowding on the Leppings Lane terrace when eye
           witnesses, including football commentator John Motson, were aware of the problems
           fifteen minutes before kick-off?

           FIVE

           Why wasnât the tunnel leading to the central pens closed when they became full, the

           too small to be effective in an emergency evacuation?

      ADJOURNMENT DEBATE: HILLSBOROUGH - DRAFT SPEAKING NOTE FOR MR
      MACLEAN


      I would like to join with the Hon Member for Liverpool Walton in
      expressing my deepest sympathy for the families of those who were
      involved in the tragic events at Hillsborough.             I know I speak
      for the whole House in saying that our thoughts will remain with
      them this Christmas, which I know they must find a particularly
      difficult time of the year.


      Anybody who saw the news reports that dreadful Saturday - 15th
      of April 1989 - will have been overwhelmed by those terrible and
      distressing pictures. X know that for the families who suffered
      such appalling tragedy their loss was made all the worse by the
      fact that they arose out of an event which should have been a
      normal family outing.


      Factual drama means points can't be challenged.
      The   Hon   Member   for   Liverpool    Walton   has   however   drawn    the
      attention of the House not so much to the events themselves but
      to a programme - a so called factual drama - which was shown
p*C   recently on Channel 4. The makers of the programme Hillsborough
      have emphasised that they were acting on behalf of the families.
      But   I must    admit   that   I have   a deep    sense   of   unease    when
      programme makers choose to make their points through a dramatic
      format,     which plays upon the emotions of viewers rather than
      through a documentary which can allow points to be discussed or
      challenged.


      Programme wrong about the missing video
      So the programme makers made a two hour "drama documentary" in
      which they claim they raised a number of fresh points. In fact
      many of these points had already been considered by Lord Taylor's
      inquiry. In particular I understand the programme makers claimed
      that evidence had come to light about a so called missing video
      tape and that the Coroner had been wrong in considering that
      those who died were dead by 3.15.


      If the programme makers had used a normal documentary format and
invited    South Yorkshire Police             to comment on the charges,              I
understand that South Yorkshire Police could have told them that
the   alleged       missing   video    which        is   supposed    to   have    shown
evidence of overcrowding on the terraces is not missing at all.
It never      has    been.    The    film    is    in the possession         of   South
Yorkshire Police and was given both to the Taylor inquiry and to
the inquest.

It is true that a video from a fixed camera, directed not at the
enclosures where the tragedy took place but at the turnstiles,
did indeed disappear on the night of the disaster. I understand
that this particular video was never in the possession of the
police. The loss of the video was reported as a crime but the
culprit was not detected. This video has never been found and it
is not the video that the programme makers appear to be claiming
as new evidence.

If the programme makers had used a normal documentary style they
would have been forced to show that the matter of the timing of
the deaths and whether the Coroner had made a mistake in taking
a 3.15 cut off point had already been considered by a judicial
review.     The      producers       chose        not    to give     audiences     that
information.         Instead they called for another public inquiry. I
will discuss that call in âa moment.


Four investigations already taken place
But   first     I    would like       to remind the House           that there have
already been four independent investigations or reviews of the
Hillsborough tragedy:


              there was Lord Taylorâs inquiry


       *       there was the inquest into each of the 95 deaths


               there    was    the    investigation into            police   behaviour
               supervised by the PCA

               finally, there was the judicial review of the inquest.
Each of these a different purpose; I think it might be helpful
if I were just to say a little about of each of these inquiries
and their outcome.


Lord Taylor's enquiry
First,    the        formal    inquiry     by Lord    Justice   Taylor.    This   was
commissioned by then Home Secretary on the second day after the
disaster. It terms of reference were not only to inquire into the
events but also to make recommendations about the needs of crowd
control and safety at sports events.


Over 31 days between the 15th of May and the 29th of June, Lord
Taylor heard oral evidence from 174 witnesses at a public hearing
in   Sheffield.          He    also   received       evidence   in   the   form    of
submissions and letters. The inquiry considered video film from
three separate sources which provided in all some 71 hours of
further evidence.


Lord Taylor published an interim report in August which set out
the causes for the disaster and made immediate recommendations,
he found that there were a number of causes why the disaster took
place. He found that:


            the immediate cause of the gross overcrowding was the
            failure to cut of access to the central pens which
            were already overfull.


      *     they were already overfull because no safe maximum
            capacities had been laid down, no attempt was made to
            control           entry   to   individual    pens   numerically,      and
            there was           no effective     visual monitoring         of   crowd
            density.


      â¢     he found that when the influx from gate C entered pen
                3,    the     layout of    the barriers     there afforded        less
            protection than they should have done and a barrier
            collapsed.


            he        found that      the need to open gate          C was due      to
         dangerous       congestion       at     the     turnstiles.      That
          congestion occurred because, as both the club and the
          police should have realised, the turnstile area could
          not easily cope with the large numbers unless                    they
          arrived steadily over a lengthy period. The police had
          failed to draw up plans as to how they would control
          large numbers should they arrive in a short period.
          Unfortunately that event, which Lord Taylor considered
          was forseeable, took place.


     â¢    Finally     he, found    that    the   presence     of   an    unruly
          minority     who   had   drunk       too   much   aggravated      the
          problem.    So did the Clubs's confused and inadequate
          signs and ticketing.


So we have it: a number of reasons for the disaster; no single
person or organisation to blame. But Lord Taylor clearly put a
significant portion of the blame for the disaster at the door of
the police.


Indeed he was particularly critical of the attitude of South
Yorkshire Police to the disaster. I quote from the report:


     "It is a matter of regret that at the hearing and in their
     submissions, the South Yorkshire Police were not prepared
     to concede that they were in any respect at fault in what
     occurred.   Mr     Duckenfield,       under       pressure    of    cross-
     examination, apologised for blaming the Liverpool fans for
     causing the deaths, But that apart, the police case was to
     blame the fans for being late and drunk and to blame the
     Club for failing to monitor the pens. It was- argued that
     the fatal crush was not caused by the influx through gate
     C but was due to barrier          124a being defective.            Such an
     unrealistic approach gives cause for anxiety as to whether
     lessons have been learnt.        It would have been more seemly
     and encouraging for the future if responsibility had been
     faced."
 if needed
[He also considered the reports that had been published in the
press about the behaviour of Liverpool fans. Again I quote from
his report:
        "Before this Inquiry began there were stories reported in
        the press, and said to have emanated from police officers
        present at the match, of "mass drunkenness".                       It was said
        that       drunken      fans- urinated    on    police    whilst    they    were
        pulling      the dead and        injured out,         that others had even
        urinated on the bodies of the dead and stolen their
        belongings. Not a single witness was called before the
        inquiry to support any of those allegations, although every
        opportunity was afforded for any of the represented parties
        to have any witness called whom they wished. As soon as the
        allegations I have mentioned were in made in the press, Mr
        Peter Wright, Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, made a
        dignified statement dissociating himself from such grave
        and emotive calumnies. Those who made them and those who
        disseminated         them would have done better             to hold       their
        peace."



Members       of    the    House.    This   is    strong      criticism:    it   hardly
suggests that Lord Taylor in any way had the wool pulled before
his eyes.


But I mu.sât stress that since the report the police have accepted
responsibility for the part they slaved in the disaster. Most
recently, the present chief constable of South Yorkshire Richard
Wells       said on the Today programme that the police saw their
responsibility in three particular areas. He said
               once       the    gates   were    open   the    police   should     have
               foreseen where the fans would go


        â¢      he accepted that they might have reduced some of the
               pressure by changing the kick off time.


               he also accepted that officers did not recognise soon
               enough the distinction between disorder and distress.
So, the South Yorkshire Police have accepted that they were at
fault in those respects. They have paid compensation to the
families. This is apart from money paid out by the Hillsborough
disaster appeal.


The inquest
iphe second investigation into events was the inquest conducted
by   Her     Majesty's      Coroner       for    South   Yorkshire.      This    was    a
difficult task partly because of the number of deaths and partly
because the Taylor inquiry was itself in progress. The coroner
conducted      an       inquiry    into    the    deaths    of    each    of    the    95
individuals and sat for a total of 96 days.


I think it is important that I remind the House of the purpose
of an inquest; it is a fact finding inquiry conducted to
establish reliable answers to four important but limited factual
questions. They are:


               the identity of the deceased


        â¢     the place of death

               the time of death; and finally


        *     how the deceased came by his death.
That is all an inquest can consider. Rule 36 of the Coroners'
Rules       1984    requires      that    the    proceedings      and    evidence      are
directed solely at finding the answers to these questions and it
 forbids any expression of opinion on other matters.


 As members        of    this House       are aware,     the     jury   examining      the
 evidence found that the cause of death was accidental death. But
 the findings of an inquest do not bind any person affected by
 them. The inquest conclusion must not be framed in such a way as
 to determine any question of criminal responsibility on the part
 of a named person or any question of civil liability. A finding
 of accidental death does not prevent further proceedings.
Investigation by West Midland' Police

The third investigation into the events was conducted by West
Midland Police supervised by the Police Complaints Authority with
a view to establishing whether the disaster resulted from or was
made worse by criminal activity on the part of any individual.
It also considered whether any officer should be subject to
disciplinary proceedings. The investigation involved the taking
of 5,341 statements as well as a scrutiny of all the material
which had previously been examined. The evidence was sent to the
Director of Public Prosecutions who concluded that the result did
not indicate that any one should be made the subject of criminal
proceedings.         This   meant   that     neither   Chief       Superintendent
Duckenfield, nor Superintendent Murray not for that matter any
other person has been charged with any crime.


For any other person apart from a police officer that would have
been the end of the proceedings.               For a police officer there
remained the question of whether they had failed in their duty.
The PCA decided that both Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and
Superintendent Murray should face disciplinary charges. Police
disciplinary hearings are held in private; they are concerned
only with whether an officer may have failed to conform to police
discipline.       A   disciplinary     hearing    does   not   consider      wider
 issues.

But, a further point about police disciplinary hearings which is
 often forgotten is that whilst there are a number of punishments
 which     can   be    imposed   for   bad    discipline     the    most   serious
 punishment      a    disciplinary     tribunal    can     impose    is    that   of
 dismissal or of a requirement to resign.


 This is the heaviest punishment which it is possible to award an
 officer for the very worst offence which he could have committed.
 It means that his conduct must have been so bad that it would be
 inappropriate for him to remain an officer.


 In the event Mr Duckenfield retired because of his ill health in
 advance of a disciplinary tribunal's ruling on whether or not he
     was guilty- But by doing so he took on himself what the worst
     disciplinary judgement could have imposed upon him to do- He
      stopped being a police officer. The disciplinary hearing could
      not continue because such hearings can only be held on police
      officers.

      On 13 January the Police Complaints Authority announced that
      disciplinary proceedings against Superintendent Murray would be
      withdrawn. When explaining their decision the Authority stated
      that        the    retirement     of    the   Chief    Superintendent      on    medical
      grounds meant that what                 in effect was a joint allegation of
      neglect of duty could not be fairly heard in the absence of the
      more senior officer. But, some time later, Superintendent Murray
      also decided that he did not wish to remain as a police officer.


      So that is three separate examinations of events surrounding
      Hillsborough;             each   one   with   a separate      purpose.     The    fourth
      examination was the judicial review of the Coronerâs proceedings.



      Review of the inquest

      Again it might be helpful if I remind the house that neither the
      Home Secretary nor the Attorney General has the power to order
      a fresh inquest. That can only be done if my rt hon and learned
      Friend            makes an application under section 13 of the 1988 Act.
      There        is      a   statutory     requirement     that   in   order   to    justify
       directing           a fresh inquest       there should not only be specific
       grounds,          such    a   fresh   evidence,      but   circumstances       that     the
       interests of justice require a fresh inquest.


       The High Court has also developed a doctrine of judicial reviews
       so that the vast majority of issues arising from the conduct of
       inquests can be considered by the High Court. Mr Taylor whose son
       Kevin was so tragically killed put forward an application under
       section 13 of the act ; the main points were:



                           that the coroner wrongly failed to direct the jury as




IS   DEC   â 96    17:21                                                                     PA G E . U0 9
                                to the verdict of lack of care or accidental death due
                                to or "aggravated'by lack of care" relating to the
                                negligence of the police which caused the tragedy.


                     â¢          that the coroner wrongly excluded evidence of lack of
                                care in the emergency services and police reaction to
                                the deceased initial injuries, wrongly insisted on a
                                cut off point of 3.15 pm for the evidence heard at the
                                main inquest.
      and
                                wrongly failed to direct the jury on the availability
                                of a verdict of accidental death by lack of care or
                                lack of   care    based   on    the   failure   of       the various
                                responsible   agencies to provide the deceased with
                                adequate medical attention after they had sustained
                                their original injuries.


       It was also asserted in relation to Kevin Williams that there was
       evidence to justify the coroner in concluding that he was alive
       beyond the 3.15 pm cut off time adopted by the Coroner and that
       pressure had been put on two witnesses to retract their evidence
       about the signs of life they described in Kevin Williams after
       3.15.

       My            Hon and        learned      friend   the    Attorney General         carefully
       considered the evidence and concluded that none of the matters
       raised               afforded      a     realistic      likelihood of         a    successful
       application to the High Court.


       The applicants proceeded by way of judicial review. In giving the
       judgement of the Divisional Court, Lord Justice McCowan ruled
       that none of the procedural or technical points raised justified
       the intervention of the Divisional Court. It found that the cut
       off point of 3.15 was a reasonable and sustainable point.


       As a Minister it is clearly not possible for me to know the
       truth of what happened on that terrible Saturday. None of us here
       can. But we can be satisfied that those dreadful events nearly
       seven years ago have been fully investigated and examined. It is




1b   DEL    â -d b       17 I   2                                                              PAGE. 0 1 0
impossible to guarantee that a tragedy will never occur again but
measures      have ben taken to ensure that British football stadia
are among the safest in the world.

The hon Member for now calls for a further public inquiry into
these events.          I fully sympathise with those families who feel
that in some way they have not been given the truth about their
loved one's deaths. Certainly in an appalling tragedy such as
Hillsborough it is perhaps inevitable, though deeply distressing
for the families, that there will be confusion about some
details. After all the investigations and examinations that have
taken to place, could we ever achieve greater certainty about the
events       after nearly      seven years?         I believe we could not.          I
believe that Lord Taylor did an excellent job at the time and one
for which sports fans have reason to be grateful. I do not
believe we could better it now.


what     would    be     the   purpose    of    a    further   inquiry?    I    fully
understand that some families still feel bitter about the way
 that events were handled that terrible day; things were done, or
 not done, things were said that should not have been said but the
 fact that we know about them proves there has been no cover up.
 Lord Taylor criticised the police; South Yorkshire have accepted
 that they were partly responsible for the consequences and have
 paid compensation.   The DPP considered and rejected criminal
 proceedings against any police officer and though disciplinary
 proceedings       were    not   taken:    Superintendent       Duckenfield,        who
 might, and we must remember this, not have been found guilty,
 chose himself to take the strongest measure which he could be
 forced to take and stop being a police officer.


 Positive lessons have been learnt. Lord Taylor made far reaching
 recommendations which have been implemented:
            All clubs of the Premier League and First Division
                 have converted their stadia to all seated grounds.
                 Second and Third Divison clubs should have all seater
                 stadia by August 1999.


         *       The    Government   has       made    Â£l39m   available       to   the
              Football   Trust   to. fund    Taylor    related   work      at
              foortball grounds for projects totalling Â£437m


British stadia are now recognised as being amongst the safest in
the   word.    This   was   commented   on   by   overseas   visitors    and
officials during EURO 96.Thankfulkly there have been no major
incidents since Hillsborough. So, we should not forget the very
positive things which have been achieved.


My current belief is that a further public inquiry would serve
no useful purpose.

What if there is fresh evidence? Now a drama documentary is not
in itself evidence. I don't often agree with the hon Member for
Blackburn but he too recognised that it was important to examine
the evidence, not the programme.

But what if in making the drama, the researchers have discovered
new information? As I have explained I am not yet convinced that
they have. But if they have, what then? The Chief Constable of
South Yorkshire has already made clear that if there is fresh
evidence he would wish to have it examined. I understand that if
there were fresh evidence he would not wish it to be examined by
police from the South Yorkshire force, who might be considered
to have a vested interest in the outcome, but by officers of a
different force. Furthermore, he would wish this investigation
to be supervised by the independent Police Complaints Authority,
The Police Complaints Authority have themselves indicated their
willingness to undertake this supervision.            If evidence of any
wrongdoing were uncovered those papers would be passed to the
Director of Public Prosecutions in order to determine whether
charges should be brought against anybody.


But all this is, at present, entirely hypothetical. At present
we have no new evidence. As I have already made clear I am not
convinced that it exists.




                                                                        5Qr; Â£ t \a '

 How is that police officers have been awarded substantial sums
 in compensation and the families have not?


 The judgement on the management of the claims for police officers
 was a matter for the Police Authoroity. I understand that on the
 basis of legal advice the police authority settled 14 cases out
 of court. There are a further 25 cases outstanding. Five cases
 have been taken to court;         of these,     four were successful       in
 achieving compensation: one was not. The Police Authority have
 said that they will appeal against the four successful claims.


 The question of compensation for members of the public is one for
  the        courts.   I   understand    that   the   courts   have   awarded
  compensation only in thoese cases where there is a close familial
  tie. I understand that over Â£12m has been awarded in damages and
  costs to members of the public.


  If further pressed
  This is entirely a matter for the courts.


  Background
  The fact that police officers have received substantial sums in
  compensation when many friends and relatives appear not to have
  done is a matter of continuing controversy.             South Yoprkshire
  Police Authority received 1,567 claims in respect of the tragedy;
  33 are still outstanding. Many claimants have been found not to
  be eligible.


  Damages and costs to members of the public have totalled Â£l2m;
  South Yorkshire Police say that they cannot immediately provide
  details of how many claimants have been succesful. The figures
  involved suggest that the sums going to relatives will in some
  cases have been smaller than those going to police officers.
  Whilst this appears unjust the courts reach their decisions on
  the basis of loss of expected earnings rather than the grief
  suffered by family members.

Why was an officer from the former West Midlands Serious Crime
Squad chosen to undertake investigations into the tragedy?


I     understand      West      Midlands   was        chosen    to   undertake        the
investigation        of   the    Hillsborough         tragedy    because      it   was^ a
negihbouring force.          This was a choice approved by the Police
Complaints         Authority.     The   head     of    the    investigation        wasthe
 Assistant Chief Constable Mervin Jones now Chief Constable of
 Cheshire; he was reporting to Geoffrey Dear now an HM Inspector.


 Background
 A story cmplainin that Detectiuve Superintend Stan Beechy former
 head of the controversial West Midlands Serious Crime Squad which
 was disbanded in Auugust 1989 after a PCA investigation.He was
 said by the report to be the second most senior policeman. Mrs
 Williams     is     claiming     Mr    Beechy    was    in     charge   of    evidence
 concerning her son Kevin and should have presented the jury with
 the evidence to suggest that an ambulance did not stop which
 could have saved her son. Mrs Williams also claims that she has
  a witness who says that Kevin was alive after 3.15. The Attorney
  General's office explain that the medical evidence has been
  examined and they are convinced that the 3.15 cut off point for
    time of death was correct. This was also the conlusion of the
    judicial review.

     Gate A - that is the alignment of the camera puts it out
     of view.

     Which camera was it that was used to go in on Gate A?
     A.  It would be the camera on Leppings Lane.

     So the same camera?   A.       It is the same camera; it is
     iust that its position is high up and directly in line
     with the top of the doors    and therefore you cannot actually
     see the gate, you see the tcp section to it.

     Gate A you can see just inside the gate, can you not?
     A.   You can see into the rear area heading towards the
     rear of the Stand.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     This camera is on the south
     corner of the West Stand,    is it?

          MR. COLLINS:      I think it is on the model,        where the
     Usher is pointing.

             LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Yes, that is it.          That    is the
     one?      A.   That is correct, sir, yes.

          MR. COLLINS:   There is also a Club camera,   is there
     not  which has a view of the Leppings Lane turnstiles?
     A. â i do know -hat there are Club cameras but I have
     not   really been involved in that system      at all;it is
     purely a Club system.

    J The purpose of the Police system is basically what?
     What is it there for?   A.   Command and control initially
     but we are now going into areas of evidence-gathering,
     and I would say that the trend is moving into that field.

Q.    Is that what the close-up is really    for?        A.        That's right,
      sir,   yes.

Q     So you can zoom in on an individual if there is a troubleÂ­
      maker?   A.   That's right.     People sometimes misunderstand
      the video system that you ; see quite capable of identifying
      somebody from a picture just by enlarging it but, in fact,
      if you look at your television screen and have more than
      six heads and shoulders on it, you will not be able to
      get sufficient id entification from that, and therefore
      you either have to increase the power of your lense or
      move your camera nearer to the people you want to take
      a picture of.

Q. Apart from the camera that looks over the turnstiles you
   have, I think, a camera which looks over the West terracing?
   A.   âThat is correct, yes |

Q. Where is that positioned? * A.   It is s i t u a t e d just to the
   left-hand side of the Control Box and near to the s c o r e Â­
      board . 1

Q. Ag'ain, roughly where the Usher is pointing?               A.      That" is
   tne position, yes, sir.

We have heard that on the day in question there was something
wrong with that one;  is that correct?   A.   For a number
of weeks we have had difficulty with the camera and they
have been looking into having the camera replaced or
improvements made.   In fact, on the day when I arrived
at the ground Mr. Roger Halsworth, who is the Technical
Officer for the Club, was in fact working on that camera
to try and upgrade the picture that we were actually
getting.

What   was the trouble?  A.   When the system had been
switched on, after an amount of time, the picture would go'
white - you would lose actually what you could see.    We
believed initially it was in relation to the lighting inside
the ground but we seem to think that it may be a problem
with   the electrical supply to that camera.

What  was the effect of that on the day in relation to your
ability to look properly at the terraces, the West terraces.
A.   On that particular day, the picture had b e e n â the
quality had been improved.     It was not  up to mark but it
was  a lot better than it had been.     We were getting
pictures, that is the best   way of describing it.

Could you zoom in in the normal way on to the terraces if
you wanted-to? A.    The actual control facilities were
fully available.

 What I am getting at is this, would it have been possible,
...if you were afraid, for example, that they were becoming
  overcrowded, could you take a close-up with that camera?
  A.    You can move -----   A    close-up is available to move
  into those centre two pens.     However, because of its
  position and angle, it does give you a false impression about
  the crowd that is in there.    It is quite low down and it
  is set at 90 degrees to the pens rather than looking face
 on.

 So what is the falsity of the impression?   Does it show it
 fuller than it really is or emptier, or what?   A.   It is
 just the illusion.   The picture creates a bit of an illusion
 about the crowd that is in there.   You may be looking at
 somebody who is stood in the far corner of Pen 3 and it may
 give you the impression that in fact he is stood in the
 far corner of Pen 4.   It is because of the angle of the
 camera.

 I follow   that but we know that those pens did     become overÂ­
 crowded.     A. Yes, sir.

 Is there something in the positioning of that   camera which
 means that it is more difficult to assess that?    A.    The
 physical position it is in is difficult to assess that the
 pens would be getting overcrowded.

 Is there anywhere else where you think the camera could be
 which would improve on that?   A.   That is available? ..
 Really you are looking at a position directly in front of
 the terraces.

                                              T.   BICHARD


Q.    One point, please, on the two video monitors in the right-
      hand corner of our picture.  Who decides what should be
      recorded on each of those video tapes?   A.   As with
      actually dealing with the monitors, either I see something
      and switch it on to tape or I am instructed to tape a
      particular incident.

Q.    I think about the time that Gate C was ordered to be opened by
      Mr. Duckenf i e l d , did he not ask you vhether or not the scene
      outside Leppings Lane ws being recorded?          A.   Certainly
      before 3 o'clock I was asked, "Are we taping the scenes
      out there?"

Q. Can you recall, Mr. Bichard, whether you were taking it
   down on both videos or just on one of them?   A.   I
   cannot recollect whether it was both or one.

Q. And the tapes from those videos, were they kept by you and
   then handed over in due course to other Officers?   A.  Yesy
   that is right.

Q. Did either of them stop     in the course of that afternoon?
        Yes, the tapes are     3-hour VHS tapes.    One expired
   just after 3 o'clock.

Q. What about the other?   A.   The other tape, somewhere
   between 2.30 and 3, the actual function of the tape, the
   mode of operation, was altered inadvertantly.

Q      By whom?   A.    Again, the assumption is that when the radio
     * repair-man came into the Control Box, Mr. Duckenfield
       actually came and stood to my right-hand side, behind the
       controls and I would then move into the left-hand corner
       and I have caught the video with my knee - the actual
       operating buttons.

 Q. With your knee?      A.    Yes,   sir.

 Q.    One of the buttons on the desk there that we see?
       A.  No   sir, the two videos themselves are actually mounted
       to the *left-hand side of that control pannel at knee height.

 Q. When you were asked by 'Mr. Duckenfield whether or not the
    scene outside Leppings Lane was being recorded, did you not
    check the video monitor to make sure that they were - that
    is the machine itself?    A.   Yes, I looked down to the
    machine and they were both functioning right.

 Q. Did you then not notice that one of them was not running?
    A.   It did not stop running until after 3 o'clock, sir.

 Q. Did you not notice that one of them was not running?
    A.   They were both running, sir.   We are talking about
    the time-around half past two to quarter to three.

 Q.    Yes.   A.   And it finished about 6 minutes past 3, I believe*
       one of the tapes.
                                           T.   BICHARD


I thouaht you told me a moment    ago that one of them, due
to an inadvertant malfunction,    I think is how you described
it.   A.     Yes.

Did you not notice when you checked to see whether or not
the pictures that Mr. Duckenfield wanted recorded were in
fact being recorded?   A.   Yes.

That one of the machines - had it been switched off, or
wh a t7  A    No.   What happens was the system was designed
t o operate on a time-lapse mode so that a 3-hour tape would,
in fact, cover 18 hours of pictures.    Basically it is - -

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   A  picture every few minutes,
â 0       it'?  A.   Seconds we are dealing with really, sir,
and I   when I took over the system, altered it so that the
tapes would run at a normal speed so that people could view
them on normal video recorders.    However, that also means
that the tapes have to be changed during the match.     At
this particular time when I checked them, they were running
in the correct mode, that is normal speed.

       MR     KALLIPETIS:   Yes, the time that you are talking about
 is w h e n âyou were asked whether the scene outside Leppings
 Lane was being recorded?       A.   That's right, sir.

 So vou are raying it is after that that somehow the switch
 is knocked, are you?   A.   Yes, that's right.

â And which switch was knocked?   A.   There are three b a t o n s
"on the front of the video recorders and one of those which
 changes it from normal mode to 18-hour time lapse system.

 When you were asked to take over the VHF link with Force
 Control  can you remember when that was?   A.   My concentration
 was applied to that just after 3 o'clock, basically when we
 realised that things were going wrong.

 Because up to that time your main and primary duty would be
 with the videos, would it not?   A.   It was, yes.

  You have had a chance to see the transcript from Snig Hill,
* I ihink! Mr. Bichard, have you not?   A.   I have now got
  that with me, yes.

  Can you tell me when, in fact, you took over from looking
* at the transcript?       Do any of the messages ring a bell with
     7   A        There were certain messages that were passed
  bv me p r i o r to 3 o'clock.   I would say around 5 past, 6
  m'nntpe nast 3 is when I made a conscious decision to pay
  ?he full attention to the VHF radio, if you like, when the
  rescue operation had begun.

  Who was operating the VHF radio in contact with Force C o n t r o l
  before you gave your conscious attention to it?   A.    I was
  monitoring it and operating it on the odd occasion when I
  used it.                                                    ~ < Â£ j .
                                                                 A




with is this; you were not present but you will be aware
that in April/May this year we sat for two-and-a-half weeks
approximately and we dealt with the 95 deceased and we
dealt with three issues which Coroners deal with; who the
deceased was, when he/she died and where he/she died.    I
specifically excluded from discussion at that time the
question of how he or she died because as you will
recollect the DPP was still actively considering the matter
and we did not want to trammel his investigation but, on
the other hand, I felt it was right we should allow people
to hear what we could deal with.
     I will raise the second point at the same time because
it may be easier for you to deal with the two things
together.   At those hearings we dealt in considerable
detail, in fact infinitely more detail than we would
normally deal with in an Inquest, with events after the
pathological cause of death and X did it because X realised
that the families were desperately anxious to know what had
happened immediately after the incident.   My question to
you is - and I think this is what we need to deal with and
get right - bearing in mind we have only dealt with the
question of who, when and where and that we have done it in
considerably greater detail than one would normally expect
to do, why is it necessary to review that very activity
again which I think is what you are really asking me to do?

         MR. KINS:       Sir, as I understand the individual
Inquests there was not an enquiry into, in the individual
cases, the impact of the organisation rescue on the
survival or otherwise of .fche particul^^lgv.ed orie.            All
-that" was done when one' loolcs at -thoseT â¢^tn%Qfeâs'6s was to
identify the time of1 a first sighting, that isr<to ^say,
somebody who seemed to be unconscious, and of a time when
effort was made^t^resjasc-itate-in any-given case and then
death was. certified.          'in many of the cases ^there was a
large gap of time after 3:15' pm when it wa.S' not
investigated at the individual Inqueststthe nature of the
service's available to deal with those being brought off and
if I ,can just give one or two examples of that, you have
e x a m p l e s vof people who are brought off at 1522 and it is
said that there was an effort to resuscitate by a lay
individual and then that particular lay individual is not
heard of again, or the officer is not, and it is said that
the given loved one arrives at the temporary mortuary.
There has been no investigation directed to the global
organisation of what happened immediately after they were
brought off the terraces. Certainly I have been through
the individual transcripts and there does not seem to be
 any evidence directed to that issue and those witnesses who
were called could not deal with those issues, sir.




                                                                       M

   " THE CORONER:   Are you suggesting that the cause of
death in respect of these individuals is not in fact the
pathological cause of death which we have been given but due
to a novus actus in effect by person or persons whose
evidence you have not yet heard?
     MR. KING:    Certainly the families, and I put it as
openly as this, sir, and putting it bluntly, cards on .the
table, are not convinced at all that had there been a far
more sensible, logical organisation of the rescue .services,
of the major disaster team being brought in, of proper
medical equipment being available, of proper triage being
carried out, that those measures, had they been there, in
several cases, would not have resulted in the survival of
their loved ones.    They cannot - obviously they were not
there - produce through me concrete evidence of that at this
stage but at every stage of an Inquiry into this disaster,
and this certainly is true even in the Taylor Inquiry, that
particular aspect of the disaster has never properly been
gone into.
      Again putting it very simply to you, sir, most of the
families I represent feel there has been a complete blanket
(not a deliberate blanket) been held down over what happened
after they were brought off the terraces and before
individuals were certified.dead and there has been .no effort
made systematically to -agf^iyse what was the organisation at
theWime for the res^iif^wHat,>might-have been, and what-c&u9.d
hafve made a difference.    A very simple example again is that
I am instructed there is evidence of Dr. Gumpert given^ at the
Inquest that without an electrocardiogram we can never'be
sure whether or not there is a pulse and when dealing with
individual loved ones taken off the terraces and simply desalt
with by lay people, the absence of such sort of equipment
means that one would never know whether or not that
individual was alive or dead at that stage.      Itjis?a
matter - and I do not mean this pejoratively - which* i-s swept
under:,                            All Beware interested in is
the immediate' CEU^dn'4-leadirig' t& those being brought off the
terraces".    I cannot put it any more firmly than that, sir.

     THE CORONER:    You have put it very plainly and I
appreciate it.    I will give a ruling on your application in
a few moments but do you want to develop it further?
Obviously I want an opportunity to hear from your colleagues.

     MR. KING:   Have you the individual statements which
were supplied?
     THE CORONER:   I do have those in front of me.   I would
not want to go through all of them but if you wish to pick
one or two as examples I am prepared to listen to you and
indeed it also makes it easier for everybody else.
                                                              6




     MR. KING:   Sir, if you were to turn to No. 11 to start
with, which is the submissions to you of the Jones family,
Richard Jones, I do not knowwhether you have been given one
or two documents.   I have two documents in relation to M r .
Jones one headed "Dear Miss Steel" and one headed "Dear Mr.
King".
     THE CORONER:     No. 11, did you say?
     MR. KING:   Yes, sir.     I beg your pardon, sir, it is
No. 10.   Sir,   if you look --
     THE CORONER:    Mr. King, may I just stop you for one
moment because something has occurred to me, and I have been
reminded, which I ought to say to the Press before we go
further?    The session this morning is being heard without
the Jury and the reason we have not got the Jury is because
we are dealing with legal points.    That means no doubt that
you can report we are in session but you should not actually
report what is being said.    You will no doubt be familiar
with the provisions of Subsection 2 of Section 4 of the
Contempt of Court Act and I say you must not report what we
are discussing.    If we had wanted the Jury to hear we would
have had them present but we do not wish them to hear at this
stage.   You may, when we have finished the Inquest, if you
still feel it is a reportable and interesting aspect then, of
course, that is a different matter but for the moment please
do not report the content of the legal matters we are
discussing.    Mr. King, I am sorry to interrupt you, would
you continue?
     MR. KING:   Sir, the document I am looking at and I
appreciate those alongside me are not looking at any document
but it is just to help you is one headed to myself, "Dear Mr.
King".
     THE CORONER:   I have a document headed "Dear Miss
Steel" dated 22nd October.
     MR. KING:      Sir, this is dated 7th November.

     THE CORONER:   I have not got it I am afraid.        It is
not in front of me.
     MR. KING:     I apologise for that and I will take you
through, if I m a y t h r o u g h five points which are raised by
Mr. and Mrs. Jones.        Sir, they make the basic point that, the
report into the death of their loved one, Richard, was
certified at 1600 hours in the temporary mortuary and,
therefore, so far as the family are concerned, so far as
evidence is concerned, they presume* as they say they must be
entitled to, up to that time the evidence of death is not
clear as having already occurred.

     Point No. 2, sir, is extracted from the evidence given
by Dr. Gumpert at the Inquest already held here and in fact
it was evidence given on the occasion of Kevin Tyrrell and,
sir, it is a quotation from his evidence which you may
recall:
     "I would like to observe that feeling the carotid pulse
     is quite difficult in someone who has a low blood
     pressure as would have been here.   In fact it can be so
     difficult it is impossible and you have to have an
     electrocardiogram on to know whether the heart has
     stopped or not."
     Then there is the statement of Mr. Eccleston, which is
certainly a statement in the large bundle of statements given
to the West Midlands Police, and indeed Mr. Eccleston gave
evidence to the Taylor Inquiry in which he says this:

                                  /"For an extremely long.
     "for an extremely long time we were without an/ form
     of medical equipment of any description.  I still
     cannot understand w^y the local health authority's
     major medical disaster team were not called upon.  I
     understand that all health authorities in this
     country have a major disaster policy.  It is
     impossible accurately to estimate the difference this
     would have made in saving life.  I do, however,
     believe that the Liverpool fans should have been
     given tne chance".

And the question raised by Mr. and Mrs. Jones is this,
sir:  there was a major incident vehicle.  Why was it not
called?  Lack of equipment undoubtedly resulted in deaths.

     Sir, I pause there.  Of course, Mr. and Mrs. Jones
were not there and of course they are not experts, but you
will see, sir, from the basis of that evidence they are
firmly of the belief that one cannot just ignore an
inquiry, an inquest, into that aspect.

        Sir, number 4 point made by Mr. and Mrs. Jones comes
from tne statement made, again in the      large bundle, sir,
from Dr. Glynn Phillips, particularly     where he s a y s that
af te r' 3.15 p.m. he gave mouth to mout resuscitation to a
man for 15 minutes, and just as he w.-,: giving up the heart
sprang to life, and after that tne man started breathing
on his own.     We know that this does not prove this man
lived.--/ or if he did he may have been brain damaged, but
the point we are trying to put across to the coro'ner is
that after 3.15 p.m. not all the people who were later
certified dead were necessarily dead.

     Sir, finally Mr. and Mrs. Jones direct your attention
to the long statement which I am sure you have seen, sir,
of Dr. John Asnton in which there is a series of reasoned
critical comments on the disorganisation of the medical
and the rescue attempts, honest and in good faith tnough
they were, after the people were brought off the terraces.

     Sir, that is Mr. and Mrs. Jones in tnose comments and
in the short letter, sir, which you have, which you have
already referred me to, sir, they emphasise an issue as to
the failure to implement triage after the disaster
happened, again, concentrating on what Dr. Gumpert has
said as to the fact that without an electro-cardiogram it
is not possible to know whether a heart has stoppped.

     Sir, can I move on from Mr. and Mrs. Jones' comments
and just give you one or two more examples - I appreciate
that in many ways it is repetitious but it is making the
point - to number 14, sir, which is in the case of William
Roy Pemberton.

     T H E CORONER:   And this one is a d d r e s s e d to you.
     HR. KING:   Sir, it is not often that instructions           to
Counsel are given in advance to the Tribunal, and I
suspect, sir, that it is not a wise move in most cases.

     THE CORONER:      You are probably right.

     MR. KING:   Sir, it was an effort in tne relatively
short time since we were before you to put before you the
various matters which the families wished to place before
you and it was felt this was the easiest way to do so,
sir.

     Sir, if I can then turn to Mr. Pemberton, you will
see that he makes the following points:        tne r e p o r t sinto
the death of his loved one Soy,- that life again in his case
was pronounced extinct at 16. 0 0 nours t o u t s , and again in
the absence of medical evidence to the contrary, the
family can only assume that their loved one was alive
until that hour, and sir, if you then go to paragraph 3 of
that document you will see there is a reference to tne
statement of Mr. Saxton of the St. John's Am bulance
Service, beea use h e r efers to tne re su sc itation of a young
man at 15.50 nours, indicating in the he art-felt view of
Mr. Pemberton, as with all the otner families, that death
must have occurred after 3.15 p.m.

     Again ne refers you, sir, in paragraph 4, to the
statement of Dr. Byrne wnen he quotes that he was x
approacned by a senior Police Officer and asked to start
certifying the dead as there may be some still alive, and
sir, again, the point has been made that as we only know
for certain that dea th was at 4 o'clock, to ignore these
concerns as to the adequacy of the attentions and the
rescue efforts after 3.15 is to not investigate what could
well have been a major reason for why somebody died and
did not survive.

     The final point on Mr. Pemberton, sir, in paragraph
7, is the question he asks:  why was it that the very
seriously ill and dving, and those who appeared to be
daad, were not taken to the hospital in the very first
available ambulance, and he raises himself the issue as to
why the serious accident response vehicle was not called
out to the stadium, as he understands to be the case.

      Sir, if I can then deal with perhaps one example of
minutiae, of detail, if one turns to the cases of the
Hicks sisters, of Victoria and Sarah Hicks, sir, wnich is
at numbers 7 and 3 in your list, sir, you will notice the
case of Victoria, tnat on the face of tne summary wnich
was    produced at the Inquest prior to today, there was a
gap    in time.There is a gap in time between 15.21, which
was the time when Police Consta ol e- Mc Gu in ne ss -rescued
Victoria from a pile of tnose who, unfortunatel^'vhad
.fallen, and 15.23 when Mr. Turner was seen h e l p i n g
Victoria out onto the pitch.
                                                                            10




     Mr. Hicks has drawn to your attention, sir, that he
has drawn to the attention of this Inquest the evidence of
a gentleman, a Mr. Taylor, whose evidence is that he was
on the very terrace where Victoria was after she had been
"rescued" by P.C. McGuinness, and that for some six
minutes he did not, in fact, resuscitate because the poor
man did not know what to do, and one can understand that,
but as Mr. Hicks says, those six minutes could have been
vital to the survival of his loved one Victoria, had she
received trie proper attention.

      Sir, that is just an example of matters which,               in Mr.
Hicks's submission tc you, through me, ought to be
inves t i g a t e d .

     Sir, if one turns to Sarah Hicks at numbe r 8, again
if one looks at the timings we know that at 5-minutes*
past-3 a Miss McCaffery see? Sarah, who clearly-has
fallen, and we know at 2 1 - m i n u t e s - p a s t - 3 , nelps the fallen
Sarah througrt onto the pitch.         Again, the time gap' there
between o-mi.iutes-past-3 and 21-minutes-pas t - 3 . We know
it was nbt u n t i 1 20-pas t-4 that Dr. Bull examined Sarah
and certified ner death, and we know from the summary that
it is said that at some time between 15.38 and 15.50 an
unidentified member of the medical team stated in his vi$w
that Sarah was at that time beyond help.

     All those times, sir, go beyond 3.15 and they again
illustrate the need in the submission of the families for
tne times after 3.15 to be thoroughly investigated.

     Sir, those are just four examples but, sir,., if y/ou
read tie papers which I understand and I am sure you have
they express the flavour of all the other submissions
that, in fact, we cannot know that a cut off point at this
stage is the right cut off point at 3.15 and it is
premature, sir, so to do, in toy submission to you.   That
is how I put it.

     THE CORONER:   Thank you very much indeed, Mr. King.
I think what we will now do is to give the rest of you an
opportunity to make points.    I think we ought to start
with Mrs. McBrien.  I think you would probably support
what has been said, but is there anything in addition to
what Mr. King has said that you feel you would like to
tell me.  Mrs. Mc3rien can I say if you are more
comfortable sitting down - indeed, that goes for all of
you - if you are more co mf ortable sitting down, sit down.
I don't mind - it does not make any difference.    I know
some of your legal colleagues sitting around you are used
to standing so they will tend to rise, but you do what is
comfortable.  Mrs. McBrien, is there anything you want to
aud no what Mr. King nas told me?

       MRS. McBRIEN:      No, I go along with every th in g        that
Mr.   King has said,    thank you.

                                                                                 40

That is a matter which my learned friend will, I am sure, fully
understand.  I merely mention it now so it is not said that it is
mentioned with hindsight afterwards.  There may, indeed, be a
great deal of difference between the responsibility or lack of
responsibility on the part of some of those who died, and
separate representation would in normal circumstances be required
because it may be that one family would make an allegation
against another. Again, I give as an example, and I am not
saying that any such person exists, but if it were shown that
someone who died had come at the very last minute with a great
deal of alcohol inside him and had made his way right down to the
front, pushing and crushing, and had caused some deaths, then
that would be a matter where he or his relatives might well
require to be separately represented.

     THE CORONER:   Yes, Mr. Manning, if I may say so, the issue
of representation is (a) for the families, because that is to
whom you were applying your mind, and (b) for the legal
representatives who obviously have to weigh whatever conflict of
interest there may be between their clients.  So that is really
not a matter for me, and it is not probably even a matter for
you.  It is a matter for Mr. King and his instructing solicitors,
and, of course, primarily for the parties themselves.

     Perhaps I should say one other thing. You have mentioned a
couple of verdicts and matters like that.  I am not getting into
an argument at this stage as to what verdict if any the Jury
would bring in, or even what directions, if any, I am going to
give them, because the objective of this Inquest as far as it has
one is to hear the evidence and to enable the Jury to reach a
verdict on the evidence.  I have the advantage of having seen
loads of statements.  I do acknowledge that, but experience has
taught me in much simpler Inquests than this that it is not
infrequent that what you think is going to be the verdict does
not turn out to be because the evidence when it actually comes,
or the nuance, if you like, or the innuendoes, or any word you
care to use, is different to what I had anticipated from just
looking at the statement. So I have made it as far as I am
able a rule not to predetermine the answer but to wait until I
have heard the evidence.  I say this not as a criticism of you
but just as a clarification for everybody.  I do intend to
listen to what is said, which is the reason why we are here
this morning. Obviously, I have read statements and I have
ideas myself, but the crucial thing is the Jury, they have got
to make up their mind, and they do it in the light of the
evidence, and I will do my best. I can't do more than that.    I
am sorry, Mr. Payne.

      MR. PAYNE:   Sir, with regard to the submissions by Mr.
King , the position of the Chief Constable is that he is neut.ral.
I have got no ".submissions to make about what Mr-: 'King is asking
you to do, but I wish it to be heard that the position of the
Chief Constable is that he wants to do everything he can to
assist you in the conduct of this Inquest, and certainly does not
wish to do anything to put in the way of M r . .King,any obstruction
into any/en^.^i^.tha$phe wants to- m.ake. on behalf of the relatives
of the people who died. Sir, that is the position.
                                                            14




    , As a comment on what Mr. King has said, strictly it appears
to us that h?e iSvfsaying that there is the possibility, to put it
in a legal term. of a hovus actus, i.e. something which
intervened after the crushing and before the deaths, which caused
or contributed to the deaths of at least some of the people, and
the response of the Chief Constable to that submission, if I put
it correctly, is that we can quite 'see that is something which
people would wish to see investigated on the question of how it
came about. I only make that comment in an endeavour to be
helpful, but the position of the Chief Constable is that he has
no submissions one way or the other.

     May I just say while I am on my feet with regard to what Mr.
Hale has just said, as a matter of fact it is not correct that
the Police have admitted negligence.   It is well known and has
been well publicised that what has happened is that the Police
have agreed to make payments to those people who were injured and
to the dependents of those who died, and that such payments are
in the process of being made.   Also there has been a civil action
in respect of apportionment of liability in respect of those
matters.
     THE CORONER:   Thank you very much, indeed.  I accept
entirely what you say and in a sense I accept what Mr. Manning
says as well.  It is not really relevant to my proceedings
whether or not negligence has been admitted or not admitted.   It
is neither here nor there. So I did not comment on it, but I
appreciate what you have said.

     MR. ISAACS:   I think, sir, in fact, that is Mr. Hale.      Mr.
Manning sits to my left.

     THE CORONER:     I beg your pardon.   Forgive me, please, both
of you.
     MR. ISAACS:   Sir, I have no submissions.  It is entirely a
matter for you having regard to the breadth or depth which you
consider appropriate for this particular Inquest.

     MR. MANNING:   Sir, I have exactly similar comments as far
as my client is concerned.

     MISS SINCLAIR:      I have no submissions on this matter, sir.

     MR. CATCHPOLE:   I add to that. The matter is entirely for
you. You are the best person, having read all the evidence, to
make that judgment, and no doubt that was the reason we had, as
you have already pointed out, sir, a fairly detailed
investigation into the earlier Inquests.

     MR. CALLAGHAN:   Sir, this is not an application of which I
have had previous notice, and which in the circumstances of the
application is some surprise to me. All I think I should, sir,
is this is not the time and place for some sort of Public Inquiry
into the activities of the Ambulance Service and the Emergency
Services, and it is not appropriate to bring such a matter into


                                                                   42

the arena as a sort of   side   wind. Beyond that, sir, it is
obviously a matter for   you.
     MISS ADDELMANN:    Sir,   I    have no observations or submiss
about the point, and I can do no better than echo those remarks
made by my learned friend, Mr. Catchpole.

     MR. RUSSELL:   I too endorse those remarks. None of us,
other than my learned friend, Mr. King, has seen the original
statements, and so are being invited to comment upon a course in
the dark because we have not seen the nature of an example of the
material he now seeks to rely upon.  I recognise it is a matter
for you, and if you decide I don't take a stance one way or the
other.
     THE CORONER:   Shall I then deal with this point? Is there
anybody else wants to say anything on this issue? Mr. King?

     MR. KING:   Sir, only to emphasise that it is not a side
wind which I am embarking on. I am seeking to address causes,
contributory causes to the deaths, and I am concentrating on
that, and it is in that context I have invited the Court to look
beyond 3.15, and certainly we are dealing with it from the point
of view of possibilities of novus actus, yes, I aiccept that.

     THE CORONER:   I have listened hopefully with attention, and
perhaps I ought to say this to you, Mr. Russell, before I go on.
I know you have not had the advantage of seeing the letter, but
it is only fair to say Mr. King in his summary of the points as
far as I can see summarised the points which his clients were
making entirely fairly. There is nothing extra in the letter, so
to speak, except connecting words, basically.  That is for your
reassurance, if I can put it like that.

     Throughout, and in fact almost from the word "go" on the
15th April, 1989, when I first learned about this incident, one
of the underlying criteria which I tried to apply in thinking
how to set about dealing with the Inquests was to as far as
possible treat the Inquests as if they were completely
standard, if I can put it like that - it is a horrible word -
but completely normal Inquests. The fact that it was national
news, that it was 95 young people, that it created a terrible
amount of anxiety, pain and so on, in some ways is unique
because of the numbers, but each individual death I dealt with
families are in exactly the same situation, and I tried to
think and I still try to think, what and how would I set about
if I had had a road traffic incident or a works accident as
opposed to an incident in a football stadium.   I have thought
back on many occasions to say a road traffic incident where
somebody might have suffered a serious head injury.   That
person may well have been at the road side for X number of
minutes while one was waiting for the ambulance services to
attend.   They may then have been taken by an ambulance to a
hospital.   They may have gone into the resuscitation room.
They may have been worked on by the doctors. They may have gone
into hospital and they may have then died two, three days, may
be longer after the incident. Or alternatively, you could have


                                                                43
                                                         16




a situation where by chance the road traffic incident occurs on
the xoad and a doctor happens to be. He walks up to the
patient, looks and says, "I am sorry, the injury is so severe
that this person is dead". Or you could have a situation where
the person has this road traffic incident and is taken into
hospital and is certified dead on arrival.

      In none of those instances would I as a matter of routine
call evidence of what happened after the incident ;itself was
concerned, and indeed, the pathologists in the example which i
have used would have given as cause of death serious head injury,
for instance, or multiple injuries with fracture of the skull, or
something of that nature.   It seems to me that the fact that the
person may survive an injury for a number of minutes or hours or
even days, is not the question which I as Coroner have to
consider. My task is to establish who the person was - I am
sorry to repeat this - where he died, when he died and how he
died.   It is from my understanding of the pathological evidence,
the overwhelming pathological evidence is and was that the people
died as a result of crushing or traumatic asphyxia. Different
words were used, but the sense was always the same. The
underlying problem which these poor men and women were subjected
to was an inability to breathe.

     That does not mean to say that some of them did not in fact
respire for a period of time or even have a heart beat
thereafter, but the damage was done, and indeed, both Dr.
Gumpert, Dr. Slater, Prof. Usher, who dealt with this question in
an overall point of view, all in fact said, as I understand their
evidence, exactly the same.

     One of the points, Mr. King, which you have made is that
because ;a person has not been certified dead until a particular
point in time, one must therefore assume that he is alive. With
the greatest respect I don't accept that as a reasonable -
"reasonable" is a very unkind word - as a proposition which I
would take.  Indeed, if you think about it for a moment I am sure
you would agree with me, if a body were to be found in a
macerated state one would call a doctor who would
certify death, but it would be a little bit illogical to
assume that that particular body was actually alive
until that point.

     The issue of death certification and the timing of it is
important, because one wants to have if possible certainty. That
is the first thing. Secondly, the conventional way of
establishing a person is definite dead is that a medical man says
so, but to draw the conclusion that until a medical man has said
so a person is alive is in my view an impassible proposition to
maintain.




                    /I do understand the anxiety....


                                                              44
                                                                     17




          I do u nderstand the anxiety w h i c h a lot of the families
h a v e about this issue, but as I have already said the
o v e r w helming medical evidence, the p a t h o logical evidence,
and that is the crucial one I am interested in, is the^
d a mage that caused the d eath was don e due to the crushing.

          Now I picked the arrival of the first ambulance not
b e c a u s e there is a n y thing magical about that bu t because^
when we look at the videos we can actually see that and it
is a convenient marker, that is all.            If the first
am bulance had arrived at 3.30 I would have picked that time.
It is simply intended as a marker, but, and this is an
important point, I considered the medi c a l evidence.         The
medical evidence was that once - I am not quoting verbatim
but the sense of what Professor Usher said, and, indeed, the
others as well, was that once the chest was fixed so that
r e spiration could no longer take place, then irrecoverable
brain damage would occur between four and six minutes.
That is the point.

      No w I felt that the evidence w h i c h I had heard and in
the light of what I had read that the latest time, the
latest, when this permanent fixation could have arisen would
have been a p p r oximately six minutes past, w hich is when the
match stopped.       It almost certainly was before, but let us
assume six minutes past, add another six minutes to that,
that is twelve minutes past and then as I say I went on to
find a c o nvenient ma r k e r beyond that point in time.   In^
other words, what I am trying to say is I did not just pick
the arrival of the first ambulance entirely out of the blue,
I did try and consider in the light of the evidence w h i c h we
had h e a r d what could h ave been the latest time when the real
damage was done.

       I have already indicated that at the - I will call them
the interim inquests if I may just for the sake of a name -
we did endeavour to give a great deal more information or
ev i dence than we would ever do in a normal inquest and in
that sense I broke my own rule straight away b e c a u s e I said
I wanted to treat this matter as if it w ere a c o mpletely
standard normal road traffic incident, if you like.         I
didn't, I gave a great deal of i n f o r mation for various
reasons which I don't need to go into now.

      As an aside I can assure you that within the limits of
our ability the summaries and the e v i dence w hich was given
was an accurate reflection of what people said and if there
was a gap, for instance, as has been suggested in some cases
which is unexplained, the reason wasn't beca u s e there is
some hi d d e n evidence w hich we hav e put under the curtain,
but b e c a u s e we didn't kno w of it or couldn't find it or it
doesn't exist.        The truth of the matter, of course, is that
peo ple weren't being watc h e d individually c o n t i n u o u s l y by



                                                                           45
                                                                  18




somebody else    recording what was happening.         It is entirely
fortuitous as    to whether or not there is a witness or
w itnesses who   happ e n s (a) to h a v e been with a person, (b)
who remembers    who he is and (c) has some idea of the timing.

     Some of you who were there will r e m ember that in some
cases we had a great deal of e v i dence w i t h regard to what
had happened post-crush, shall I say, and in others we had
next to nothing beca u s e it is very sad particularly for
those families where we have got so little to share with
them, but we are living in the real w orld and in some cases
there was overwhelming - for instance, there were dozens of
photographs as you kno w - some of the people w e r e all over
the newspapers and in others we could not find any.          It
can't be helped, it is just one of those things.

       Bearing in mind that I intend at this stage to deal
w ith the question of how, and I do intend to deal wit h it
r e asonably comprehensively, I have to r e m ember two things:
that my powers are limited.      I don't hav e an open ended
authority to carry out an investigation.        The Rules and the
Act, indeed, are quite clear as to the limits of what the
coronal inquiry should be.      I admit that the wor d   how   is
a little bit flexible and assuming we call all those
witnesses on that preliminary list w h i c h I have circulated I
hope you will agree that I have been reasonably flexible
w ith that word, but nevertheless I do have to draw a line.
Indeed, this was done in other inquests.        If you think back
to the Zeebrugge inquest, for instance.       The learned Coroner
there d r e w a line.   He was judicially reviewed on where he
drew it and in that p articular case the Divisional Court or
the Court of Appeal, I can't remember now, clearly said that
a line has to be drawn and in the Zeebrugge case they agreed
it was right.      I am doing my best.   I am trying to d r a w a
line as well.

      If you think of the other major disasters where
inquests have already taken place, you will find that lines
were drawn there as well and I think you will find that the
line w i t h regard to the question which we are now thinking
about was very, very muc h tighter than what we have already
done.

     In answer to your submission, I still consider that as
a general proposition we are going to accept - I am g oing to
take these inquests and deal w i t h the question of h o w on the
basis of what h a p p e n e d to about 3.15 or thereabouts. ^ I
have explained it to you so I am not going to repeat it and
I base it mainly upon the pathological medical evidence.

        Having said that, I think it is probably right to say
b eca u s e we will be call i n g witnesses it may be that some of
the things w h i c h worry you may be dealt with to a m i n o r
                                                               19




degree but it is c e r tainly not my intention to a llow us   to
stray down that path.

        I have also got to say, it is only right, that what I
think you are really inviting me to do, Mr. King, is to hold
a further judicial inquiry into matters into which, as I
un de r s t a n d it, are outside my authority and scope. I also
seem to recollect, altho u g h Lord Justice Taylor s Inquiry
isn't - as I have already said to you at the business
meeting, I don't really want to spend too m uch time on it -
but I do recollect that the emergency services wer e very
well represented at that Inquiry and, indeed, a lot of
discussion, from my reading of the transcripts, did deal
with the issues of the medical response.

       Whet h e r or not that v;as satisfactory, whether Lord
Just i c e Taylor should have done more, whether somebody else
should look into that when we have finished that is nothing
to do wit h me.       However, as far as I am concerned, my
intention is to stick w i t h what I gave you as my initial
pr eliminary intention.

      I have, of course, already looked through the documents
which you sent me and insofar as in one or two instances
witnesses are mentioned, if I think, and, indeed, I have
thought that one or two of these in fact I think three at
the moment, you have got a point.        It would perhaps be
advantageous to call those persons and we are making
ap propriate arrangements.      Please don't think that I have ^
said, "Good grief, fifty pages, I am not dealing w i t h that,
I have already spent quite a bit of time thinking about it
and I will hopefully have another look.        If I were - which
is hi g h l y unlikely - in any p articular instance to feel we
ought to go a little bit further down that line because
there is a specific point to be made in any p a rticular
instance, then I will if I think it necessary, tell you.
However, I think it is unlikely from what I have seen and
what I have read and for the reasons w hich I h ave g iven you.




           MR.   KING:   Sir,   thank you for that.
                                                                 PROF. A. USHER


                      Cl. In fact, of course, the problem was that there were already
                          deceased people within the building? - A. Yes.

                      <i. So we did not have quite as much space as - it was not empty,
                          in other words? - A. No.

                      Ci. Which did create a few problems for us. - A. Yes.

                 Â»(>. But I am right in thinking that there is a room which we know
                      as the Special PM room which is in fact chillable? - A. Yes.

                      O. And that was done? - A. Yes, it was.

                      Ci. Prof. Usher, what I want to do was, I wanted to go through one
                          or two of the terms which we use in post mortems.

                                THE CORONER:   This, ladies and gentlemen, forgive me, is
                           a short course in pathology. What I am going to do is to ask
                           Prof. Usher to explain some of the words which are used,
                           because you will hear them over and over again, and it may
                           easier if you have had them explained at the beginning, just
                           as words:
                  (i. If I start off by saying, can you help by a word that occurs
                 D|   very often is "petechia" and "haemorrhage".  Could you just
                      explain what the word "petechia" means and what the word
                      "haemorrhage" for that matter means in that context? - A. Yes^.
                      I could do it perhaps better if I said that petechial n
                      haemorrhages are signs of asphyxia and then define asphyxi'a.

                       (). Yes, if you would. - A. Asphyxia is a process which takes
                           place when there is some mechanical interference with normal
                     E     breathing.   The causes of the interference might be external,
                           as when a pillow is put across the face.    That is called"
                           suffocation.   It may be hands 9|\ a ligature.round the neck ^
                           which is called strangling.   It may be the inhalation of some
                           foreign body into the throat, which is called choking. Or it
                           may be, and this is relevant in this case, the fact the*
                           person's chest is simply not allowed to move in and out as it1'
                           does in the normal course of respiration.    If that happens ~
                           these people are asphyxiated in all the examples I have given.

                                In traumatic asphyxia the picture is usually /airly
                           typical. When respiration stops oxygen cannot be given into
                           the blood from the lungs and the haemoglobin which is present
                           in the little red cells and which is used to carry oxygen from
                           the lungs to the tissues where it is needed, these little
                           packets of haemoglobin give up their oxygen and then turn into
                           what is called reduced haemoglobin, which is a bluish colour,
                           and this gives a bluish cast to the face and often elsewhere
                           in the body to a person who is being asphyxiated.

                                  When this happens the heart begins to fail and there isf,
                           back pressure on the very small blood vessels called v          _
                           capillaries. So the pressure in .the fine vess e l s of the skin
                     j-j   and elsewhere in the body increases, ahci the cell walls which
                           are only one cell thick, are not getting oxygen either, and so-

                           these fine vessels burst, and little bursts of red cells pass
                           through the wall into the tissues.  If this happens in the
                           skin they can be seen as little pin-point haemorrhages in the
                           skin.  They are not entirely specific for asphyxia, but it
                           would be difficult to diagnose asphyxia if there were-not such
                           petechiae. Larger haemorrhages which are formed in exactly
                           the same way are call ecchymoses.
                                So that the general picture of a person who has died from
                 B         asphyxia is of bluish cyanosis, as it is called, bluish
                           appearance about the face and elsewhere, and the presence of
                           petechiae somewhere in the body, frequently in the eyes,
                           frequently in the lax skin of both the eyelids, frequently
                           internally on the surfaces of the lung and on the heart
                           itself, and sometimes elsewhere.    The picture that we saw i=n
                           general in the people who died atHillsborough was an
                           asphyxia! picture, and it was due   to the fact that at some,-
                           time they must have been packed so close that they were unable
                           to move their chests and thus asphyxiated.

                                If the asphyxia is prolonged it begins to affect other
                           organs and in particular the brain.  The brain is very
                           sensitive to oxygen lack, and so after four or five minutes of
                           asphyxia then damage occurs to the brain. The mo r e prolonged
                 D         the asphyxia is the more damage there is to the brain, and ,5
                           eventually the vital centres in the brain are damaged and then
                           the person is technically dead.
                      Q    How long does it take for a person who is asphyxiated to (a)
                           lose consciousness, and (b) get to the stage where irreparable
                           damage has been done? - A. Well, once the chest becomes;
                           absolutely and finally fixed in the situation I imagine as we
                           had it at Hillsborough - there were moments of intermittent
                           fixation of the chest in many of the cases - but once the
                           chest becomes finally fixed then it is a matter of minutes,
                           between four and six minutes usually, before the person dies,
                           but it is a very short time mercifully before they lose
                           co nsciou sness. They may lose consciousness in 10 to 15
                           seconds.

                      Q    So in other words, once asphyxia actually takes hold properly,
                           shall we say, then the loss of consciousness is very quick? -
                           A . Yes.
                      Q. And death between four and six minutes, of that order? - Af
                         Yes, that is the usual.
                     PO.   If a person is active and struggling, does it make any
                           difference? - A. They use oxygen.  They use what oxygen they
                           have up more rapidly, of course.  It is also true to say that
                           if someone has a disease say of the chest or the lungs or the
                           heart, where they are already hampered with regard to their
                           use of oxygen, then of course they will stand asphyxia very
                           badly, and they may die in a much shorter time than that:

                 H 0.      Now. in some cases we will hear in these PMs there was what is
                           known as coning.  In other words, there was an enlargement, a

                          swelling of the brain and in others there was not.  If we deal
                          with the cases where there is coning, that is a very serious
                          situation, is not it? - A. Yes, it is.  It is unfortunately a
                          non-specific situation.  If you insult the brain in more or
                          less any way it reacts by swelling.  If you cause it to be
                          shaken around inside the head or if you fail to supply it 0ich
                          oxygen, it reacts by swelling, and since the skull is a^closed
                          boney box with only one outlet and that outlet is where.the
                n         spinal cord leaves it at the base, then it tends to push the
                          brain down into that cone.  Unfortunately, the part of the
                          brain that is pushed down is the part that contains the vital
                          centres for respiration and for the regulation of heart beat
                          and blood pressure.  So if that happens then it is JTikely to
                          cause death.
                        (J). But it is not an absolute requirement for asphyxial death? -
                             A . O h , n o , by no means:
                        4>. Because it is at the cellular level I think you are saying the
                            damage is done? - A. Yesj
                                                    .
                        O. Which is microscopic, I believe, if you like? - A. Yes.

                        (!. You were talking about the very short period when a person
                D[          actually becomes asphyxiated before he loses consciousness. -
                            A. Yes.
                        (p. What is the position if as I think you have also said there
                            are intermittent episodes of asphyxia, shortish periods,
                            compression and then relaxation and then compression and
                            relaxation and then final compression? Does that make any
                            difference? - A. In the intervals when they are able to
                            breathe properly then they to some extent replenish their
                            tissue oxygen stores, but of course once the pressure is on
                            again then the same process operates.

                        Q. Operates again. So if a person has been squashed, if I can
                           say that, and the pressure is taken off him before he loses
                           consciousness, and there is no further pressure on him, then
                           he ought to be able to breathe and recover? - A. Yes.

                        4). If he breathes and then a further episode of pressure is put
                            on then the effect of that additional pressure will depend on
                            how much oxygen he has managed to take in in the interval? -
                            A. In the interval, yes.
                        (5. And of course, the shorter the interval.... - A. Exactly, sir.

                        O. We know in some cases - in fact in many cases - there is some
                           reference to vomiting? - A. Yes.

                  (J). Can you deal with the whole question of vomiting in traumatic
                       asphyxial deaths and what it signifies? - A. Well, in any #
                       asphyxial death, as a terminal event, right at the e n d . t-here
                       is often vomiting, and for that reason many pathologists when
                H      reporting such cases simply say, and I do this myself, if
                       there is vomiting I simply say, "Traumatic asphyxia", and I


J. L. Harpham Ltd                                       33                                  50

                               take it that the vomiting is part of the last phase of thaâ¬
                               death.  It is true to say that it is particularly liable to
                               happen in traumatic asphyxia because the airways are .free,
                               which they are not if the person is being strangled, and of
                               course, compression is being exerted on the abdomen as well
                               with a tendency to force material up. So you would expect to
                               get vomiting in cases of traumatic asphyxia.

                    jjci. And you would say it is probably part of the terminal events?
                          - A. Yes, it is just part of the act of dying.

                               In some cases one inhales? - A. Yes.
                               If one inhales any vomit, if there had been no mouth to mouth
                               resuscitation presumably that would mean it was breathed in?
                               A. Yes.

                               A gasp must have been made? - A. Yes.

                     (J.         If there is artificial respiration does it make any
                               difference, do you think? Can it be blown in? - A. It could
                                be if the mouth had not been cleared of vomit first.   In that
                               case the kiss of life becomes, of course, the kiss of death,
                                because you are forcing the material down into the airways.
                    D          it is also fair to say it has been shown, principally by the
                                South Africans, that material in the stomach can be, after
                               death, forced up into the nasal fount and even down the
                                bronchi.
                        Ci. How does it get down after that, because that can't be
                             inhaled? Are you saying a gravity mechanism, or what? - A.
                             Yes, that is what is thought to be the answer.

                        Cl .   So it is not entirely explained how that happens? -A.    That is
                               right.
                        G. So the mere presence of stomach content in the lungs does not
                           necessarily mean it was inhaled before death, is what you are
                           saying? - A. That is right.

                        Cl .    But in many cases it may be, of course? - A. Yes.

                        (J). And inhalation is a very serious matter, is not it, because     it
                               irritates the linings? - A. Yes, that is right.

                      Q. I think you prepared a report for Lord Justice Taylor, and one
                         of the questions which are dealt with in that, I think, was
                    q    the question of eye haemorrhages and the effects of people
                         lying or standing? - A. Yes.
                      Q. Can you just summarise your conclusions on that? - A. Yes.     I
                         think it was put forward that you could differentiate between
                         people who died standing up and people who died lying down
                         b e c a u s e the people who died standing up did not have eye
                         haemorrhages and the people who died lying down down did, and
                    H    that in my view is completely wrong.

                         Q. But there         is no doubt         in you r m i n d about         the    identity.-

                 J)           It w a s by far th e most s e v e r e ca s e of v o i c e box fractures-
                              Not only d o e s t h i s in di ca te th e s e v e r i t y of the tra u m a t i c

                             possibility"' - A . It is an interesting comment, sir, because
                             it is a possibility I considered also myself and that is
                             certainly an explanation to the noise which could have been
                             made which may have mimicked the word ââmum" but it would not
                             explain the opening of the eyes, sir.

                          Q. No. - A. But it would explain the noise.

                                  NR. FRASER:   No questions, sir, but thank you very
                             much, Dr- Slater, for that sympathetic and detailed
                      B      explanat ion.

                                  THE CORONER:   Any other questions for Dr. Slater?
                             Thank you very much, Dr. Slater-  We spent a lot of time
                             thinking about this sentence because it was difficult..  I
                             didn't think it was possible from what I knew of the
                             evidence but, on the other hand, we didn't want you to feel
                             that we weren't telling you what was in the statements.   We
                      C      felt it was better for you to hear it and have it explained
                             rather than for us to keep it under wraps, so to speak, and
                             you might possibly find out some other time.  I hope I have
                             taken the right decision.  I don't know. The only person
                             who knows that is you.  We did spend a lot of time thinking
                             about it wondering what to do for the best.

                             Midlands Police.  I have previously taken the Oath.

                          Q. Could you then please, if you would, take me through the
                      E      statement? - A. At 0700 hours on Saturday, 15th April 1939,
                             Mr. James Stephen Williams saw his son, Kevin Daniel
                             Williams, leave the family home with the intention of
                             travelling to Sheffield.  He was to travel by train with a
                             number of friends to watch the Semi Final football match at
                             Hillsborough Stadium. Kevin had a. ticket for the match.

                                  Andrew Duncan travelled to Sheffield with Kevin, Thomas
                      F      James Nickson and Gregory Fagen.  They travelled by train,
                             arriving at Sheffield at 1040 hours.  Gregory Fa.gen left the
                             others at the station. The other three youths caught a bus
                             from the station to Hillsborough Stadium where Thomas
                             Nickson left them.
                                   Andrew Duncan entered the stadium with Kevin at about
                             1330 hours via the Leppings Lane turnstiles.   They initially
                      G      stood together in Enclosure 4 but shortly after they moved
                             to Enclosure 3. At about 1445 hours Andrew Duncan saw other
                             friends on the terraces, including Anthony Maxwell Grier and
                             Stuart Thompson.   Stuart, of course, also lost his life at
                             Hi 1lsborough.

                                today? - A. Yes, sir.

                         0. W h e r e I tracked you down!                   I very m u c h a p p r e c i a t e the

                             to be here.               T h a n k you very much.         Dr. Gumpert, you,
                             of course, had n o t h i n g w h a t e v e r to do w ith this case.
                      Â£)    I think you dealt w i t h quite a lot of the injured
                             f o l l o w i n g H i l l s b o r o u g h and indeed you may well kno w one
                             or two people I will be r e f e r r i n g to later, but this
                             p a r t i c u l a r case was not one you came across.                       You have
                             heard the e v i d e n c e w h i c h has been put reg a r d i n g this
                             y oung man.             What I w ould like you to do n o w is to give
                             us a short explanation, as you see death, in the first
                              instance and then we will try and relate it to this
                      E     y oung man and p a r t i c u l a r l y Mr. Bruder's evidence
                             r e l a t i n g to him. - A. In a bout 1979 or 1980 whe n it

                              k idney tr a n s p l a n t a t i o n s , it b e c a m e very imp o r t a n t that
                              the supply of kidneys of people who had died acutely,
                             u s u a l l y in accidents, could be i n c r e a s e d b e c a u s e the
                              life of a pati e n t who has ha d a ki d n e y t r ansplant is
                             c o m p l e t e l y d i f f e r e n t to the life of a patient who has
                              to have dialysis three times a week.                        They can go bac k
                              to no r m a l life.

                                A h y p o t h e s i s of brain d eath was then discussed, agreed
                                and published.             This c o n s i s t e d of c e r t a i n e x a m i nations
                                of the back part of the brain, the part we call the
                                b rain stem.            If you imagine the brain as being like a
                                w alnut, and it is, it is like ha v i n g a carrot s t u c k
                                u n d e r n e a t h the walri'ut? and it is the carrot that
                                m atters.            This is w h e r e blood pre s s u r e , piilse,

                                controlled.             Once this part of the b rain is dead, and
                                this d e a t h occurs, as you h eard from Dr. Slater, in
                                between four and six minutes after d e p r i v a t i o n or

                               re m e m b e r the c a s e in Am5erica w h i c h was kept alive for
                               thirteen and a half years.

                               Some of us were c o n c e r n e d that the g u idelines that were
                               drawn up were not strict en o u g h and that there was no
                               call for them to be repea t e d a fter a pass a g e of time.
                               Perhaps u n w isely we said this and this resulted in a
                      Â®        BBC " P anorama" p r o g r a m m e one night at ten o ' c l o c k w hen
                               the m e d i c a l p r o f e s s i o n for once a c t u a l l y d e b a t e d it,
                               eight of us.            As a result of that d e b a t e the
                               re gula t i o n s were hardened.                  T h e y had to be c a r r i e d out
                               by senior people who were used to d o i n g it and tney had
                               to be repeated.               A s a t i s f a c t o r y o u t c o m e from my
                               pe r s o n a l point of view, a l t h o u g h I d on't kno w w h e t h e r
                               the a n g u i s h was w o r t h it really.

                               As a c o n s e q u e n c e of that I s u p p o s e in the next three
                               years I had to go thro u g h this rat h e r u n p l e a s a n t
                               pr o c e d u r e many times.      It was part of my p r o f e s s i o n a l
                               duty but still to this day I cannot c e r t i f y someone
                               dead with o u t being d i s t u r b e d by it still.

                      n        From this I suppose I have gai n e d a great deal of
                               e x p e r i e n c e of brain d e a t h and brain damage.            It seems?/
                               c l e a r to me, sir, in this case that poo r K e v i n was f'
                               p r o bably dead before he was got out of the area in ^
                               w hich he was standing.                 I w o u l d agree w i t h Dr. Slater.
                               I w o u l d think c o n s c i o u s n e s s was lost p r o bably w i t h i n
                               ten seconds.            I w o u l d say loss of pain w ould be alrnos?t
                               i n s t antaneous - not quite, but almost, s?
                      E
                               I ca n n o t explain the Liv e r p o o l P o l i c e C o n s t a b l e ' s terVn
                               " c o n v u l s i o n " b e c a u s e to me a c o n v u l s i o n is a major
                               e p i l e p t i c attack and he has q u i t e c l e a r l y said he does
                               not m ean that, so I d o n 't k now wha t he does mean.                       Ifr
                               think it w o u l d be w r o n g for me to try and guess wha t he
                               means.            I think we c ould accept that he does not mean
                               any signif i c a n t movement.

                               Unfortu n a t e l y , after people are b r a i n stem dead, they
                               can tv/itch and very u n n e r v i n g it is too.          This is
                               really due to a spinal reflex.           W h a t we think happens
                               in anoxia - lack of oxygen - is that the b rain stem ,
                               dies first.          T h e cortex, that is the thinking part o f
                               the brain, your walnut, probably goes on q u i t e a bit
                               longer and the p e r i p h e r a l nervous sys t e m probably q uite
                      G        a bit long still and I think that is the e x p l a n a t i o n of
                               what has been d e s c r i b e d by the L i v e r p o o l officer*

                          Q.   I know the L i v e r p o o l officer in his s u p p l emental

                              a p o s s i bility? - A. It is a poss i b i l i t y , sir.            I w ould
                              like just to obse r v e that feeling the caro t i d p ulse is
                              q u i t e ^ d i f f i c u l t in somebody who has got a low blood
                              pressure, as w o u l d h ave been here.                    In fact it can be
                              sO d i f f i c u l t it is impo s s i b l e and you have to put an
                              e l e c t r o c a r d i o g r a m on to know w h e t h e r the heart has
                      B       stopped or not if

                              I w o u l d also like to say som e t h i n g about r e s uscitation.
                              I was very for t u n a t e when I q u a l i f i e d that I be c a m e
                              h ouse surgeon of a famous heart surg e o n called Lord
                              B rock at Guy's Hospital.                 That was in the days w hen we
                              did open c a r d i a c massage.            In other words, if somebody
                              died you opened their chest and you m a s s a g e d their
                      C       heart betw e e n your hands.               A t e r r i f y i n g experience.
                              It was while I was w o r k i n g for him that one day three
                              of us were d oing it one morning, that he stopped it,
                              and that was the start of e x t e r n a l card i a c massage.
                              Even to somebody like me who has been d oing it for
                              t w e n t y - f i v e years, it is still very difficulit.                Th'e
                              last time I tried to do it I failed completely.                           Even
                      D       to a trained person it is d i fficult. â Indeed, when
                              junior doctors are e x a m i n e d for this now, as they are,
                              a s i g n i f i c a n t n u m b e r fail rather than pass.            It is
                              quite di f f i c u l t and for the lay pe r s o n it must be
                              i ncr e d i b l y difficult.

                          0. You h e a r d Dr. Slater's account of death, shall we say.
                             W o u l d you go along wit h that? - A. I thought it was
                      E      eloquent.       I felt q uite nervous!

                          Q. You m e n t i o n e d this point about u n c o n s c i o u s n e s s and the
                             loss of pain and I think you d i s t i n g u i s h slightly
                             there.          Can you give me any idea that if a person
                             be comes unconscious, can he feel pain, and for ho w long
                             can he feel pain, in your judgment? - A. Again, Dr.
                             Sl a t e r put it very clearly.                 You all read in the
                      F      n e w s p a p e r s about p a t ients - p a r t i c u l a r l y whe n they have
                             had c a e s a r e a n sections, the ladies as usual - being
                             able to tell what the doctors w e r e talking about du r i n g
                             the operation.               Again I have e x p e r i e n c e d this at first
                             hand when I was d o i n g heart surgery b e c a u s e then it was
                             o ften very imp o r t a n t not to depr e s s the state of
                             c o n s c i o u s n e s s too far b e c a u s e things w e r e pretty tricky
                             anyhow.             When we used to r e s u s c i t a t e the patients we
                      G      used to give them an electric shock.                          Lord B rock used
                             to always shout, " Give it two fast ones."                          Th e patient
                             w o u l d then ask you the f o llowing m o r n i n g two fast ones
                             were.           The n you w o u l d ask, "Did you hear anything
                             else?" and they didn't, so it is all very m u c h a
                             q u e s t i o n of degree.

                           QUESTION                 ONE

Why was Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield put in charge of a
major semi-final only 21 days before the game, when he was
relatively inexperienced at policing football matches?

Chief Superintendent Mole, his predecessor, understood that Chief Superintendent
Duckenfield had not previously policed a Semi-Final but had policed at Hillsborough
although at Chief Inspector rank and as such had experience of the ground.
His experience of policing football and other major events was wide although he was
not as well acquainted with the finer points of policing Hillsborough as his predecessor
but he knew the area having policed it before.

Assistant Chief Constable Jackson did not consider anyone other than Chief
Superintendent Duckenfield to police the Semi-Final as he knew him to be a police
officer experienced in policing the City Centre, Sheffield United Football Club and
previously Sheffield Wednesday Football Club. Mr Duckenfield was aware of football
problems and was surrounded by very experienced ground commanders.


OBSERVATIONS

Please see pages 1- 6, Volume 2


Lord Justice Taylor - Interim Report

275. Mr Duckenfield was promoted and put in charge of F Division only 21 days
before this semi-final. The pre-planning was already in progress under Mr Mole who
had been in command both in 1987 and in 1988. It might have been wiser to have left
Mr Mole in charge of this operation. On the other hand, it is quite understandable that
Mr Duckenfield should have been expected to take command of events in his Division
from the date of his promotion. In view of his lack of experience at Hillsborough and
of a semi-final match, however, it was imperative that he be fully briefed and that he
should also brief himself


Lord Justice Taylor - Final Report

215. The ultimate control at any match must be that of the Police Commander.
He has authority to decide how many officers he needs and to deploy them in and
outside the ground. He has, if necessary, to take such decisions as to postpone kick-
off, to stop the match, to evacuate the ground or any area of it. Police Commanders
tend to remain in post for lengthy periods. They thus acquire skill, experience and
special knowledge of the problems at their particular ground. However, there must
come a time for change. It is then essential for the new Commander to have
adequate time and training to acquaint himself with his functions and the problems of
policing peculiar to the ground. Training for such functions should be the subject
of a specific course to be attended by senior officers presently acting as Police
Commanders and those in line to do so. Such a course would give induction

opportunity fo r the pooling o f experience and the solution of common problems.



Lord Justice Taylor - Recommendation 52

52. Consideration should be given to the provision o f a specific training course for
senior officers presently acting as Police C om m anders and those in line to do so.
Such a course should include training in the basic strategy o f policing football
m atches.

                        Q. But there weren't any Officers deployed on your order to
                           the tunnel? - A. At Phase 2 sir.

                           the   turnstiles and that is where they are deployed.

                        Q. I see. But what is your understanding of vii, Mr. Mole,
                           which on the face of it would appear to indicate that you
                           ought to post Officers at the back of the terraces to
                           help the Stewards to direct, inter alia to direct people
                           to fill up the terraces evenly because that is one of the
                           steward'.s duties? - A. My understanding of that is the
                           Officers are deployed to the rear of those areas and in
                           fact do direct as a matter of course people to the various
                           locations but they are not actually stood on the terraces.
                           That is my understanding of that paragraph.

                        Q. "Officers engaged on duties in the stands and terraced
                           areas will take up positions at the rear of the crowds
                           using any raised or otherwise advantageous positions
                           which might be provided or available". - A. That is
                    D      correct sir, and when they are deployed to those terraces
                           that is the position they take up, but in Phase 1 of
                           the order their duties is at the turnstiles for public
                           order searching and property and advising and directing.
                           When Phase 2 operates at the match they take up advanÂ­
                           tageous points at the rear of the terraces.

                        Q. But of course unlike the league matches, as we have
                    E      indicated, there were no Officers deployed on any duty
                           in relation to filling of the terraces, were there? - A.
                           I think I have made that point sir.

                        Q.   One small thing I ought just to have elicited.   The   1937
                             final was on a Sunday? - A. It was sir, yes.

                        Q.   In fact kick-off was due at 12 but delayed till 12.15?
                             - A. That is correct, sir.

                        Q.   That, I suppose, avoided to some extent the drink problem?
                             - A. It did sir.

                        Q. Because of course the pubs don't open till 12 and I think
                           even now it is slightly more difficult, well can you get
                           off licence drinks on a Sunday morning? - A. No, same
                           licensing hours.

                        Q. Same licensing hours as pubs? - A. Yes.

                        Q. I think that is really all I need ask you about the
                           planning because I appreciate you were not involved
                           directly with the events of the 15th of April last.

                          have to take over the policing of this event? - A. That is
                          correct s i r , y e s .

                    And although things had gone in your view well in 1988
                 Q. there was always a potential problem with a full house
                    and large numbers of supporters coming in irom far a n . l d
               B    from outside Sheffield? - A. I think whenever you have
                    54,000 people congregating together there is always
                    potential.
                     n    Tn effect Mr. Duckinfield was being thrown in at the deep
                          Ind, was he not? - A. I think his experience of policing
                          football is wide. Certainly I think he hac not policed
                          a semi-final but certainly policed crowds m large numbers

                     0     Had he ooliced Hillsborough before? - A. He had policed.
                           Hillsborough when he was there in a dirrerent rank sir.

                     Q. What rank? - A. I believe my recollection is as Chief
                        Inspector and Inspector.
                     0     So he had never been in the position of haying as it were
                D          a overview of the operation? - A. I would be guessing it
                           I said he had or h a d not but I don't think he haa ever
                           been in command of the operation at Hillsboroug.i but
                           certainly Sheffield United he had and at ouher major
                           events in the town sir.

                     0     Did you go around the ground with him? - A. No sir,
                           Mr. Duckinfield has a knowledge of the ground having
                           worked there in the past, as I have said.

                     Q- necessary? - A. No sir, in            fact I called him to a meeting^

                             ground for a period of 12 months.

                     Q       Your rank at this stage being? - A. Chief Inspector. In that
                             period I think if I am correct which was between September-
                             1979 and June 1980, I had experience of policing a Semi-Final
                             tie between Liverpool and Arsenal, and also the major tie
                             between Sheffield Wednesday and Sheffield United on Boxing
                B            Day. On both of those occasions they attracted capacity
                             crowds.

                     Q. Which was your area of responsibility within the grounds? We
                        know Chief Inspectors have the responsibility of a number of
                        serials? - A. At that time the organisation was a little
                        different, and to be Quite specific I cannot other than to say
                        I was on the perimeter track occupying a position very similar
                        to the Sergeant who now occupies that position where the
                        players run out.

                     Q. Near the players' tunnel? - A. That is right. I had that
                        responsibility.  I remained there until June 1980. In June
                        1980 I was transferred again as a Chief Inspector to the
                        Attercliffe sub-Division which deals with the industrial part
                        of the city, and at that time did not have a particular
                D       involvement with football matches or public order.   I
                        remained there for a period until 1985, when at that time
                        after promotion, I moved to West Bar Police station as a
                        uniform Superintendent and Deputy Divisional Commander.

                                  From the transfer to Attercliffe to West Bar then my
                             policing role changed considerably. As you can imagine in the
                             city centre I was regularly involved with the policing of
                 E           marches, demonstrations, on a regular basis, and also
                             responsible for the policing of Sheffield United football
                             ground. During the initial period I policed the ground on a
                             regular basis and took a regular interest in the game and also
                             the policing of the ground.

                     Q. When you say responsible for policing, were you the person who
                        drew up the operational plan? - A. No. The structure is such
                        that the s u b âDivisional Commander, that is the Superintendent
                        of the Central Division would with his planning team draw up
                        that plan, and as Deputy Divisional Commander would monitor
                        that situation and assist and supervise in the absence of that
                        Officer    The Officer at that particular time was
                        Superintendent Marshall, who is now my Deputy Divisional
                        Commander. So he and I worked together for a considerable
                        period quite closely on public order matters.

                         Q. That was from 1985 until    ? - A. Until I was promoted
                            recently   I may have got that particular date wrong, but
                            certainly for a period of three years with Mr. Marshall.

                         Q. So about three or four years before your promotion? - a. yes.

                         Q    We know you went into post on 27th March, was it, this years' â
                 H            A. Yes, sir.

From what you told u s , although you had had experience of
policing football matches and as a Chief Inspector had had
experience at Hillsborough and perhaps as a Constable? -
A. Yes, sir.
You had not had experience of planning an overall
responsibility for a big tie such as this? - A. In terms of a
Semi-Final tie. you are quite correct, but I should make the
point that during my period at West Bar I had an involvement
not so much in the detailed planning but certainly supervision
of the Billy Graham concerts that were held at Bramall lane
football ground, where there was a capacity crowd,"-and only
last year during the summer Bruce Springsteen, an American pop
artist, came to Bramall Lane football ground for a weekend,
and h e âheld two concerts on a Saturday and.Sunday evening, and
there was- an expected attendance of 48,000 people on each of
those days.    It would be wrong to say I know that 48,000
attended, bu.t. almost that number attended. So I have
experience at first hand only last year of. policing a Bruce
Springsteen concert and a large number of people attended.

But your last direct contact with Hillsborough, if I have
correctly followed what you told us, was some 10 years ago? -
A. In terms of a Police Commander, yes, sir.

,In terms of any sort    of policing? - A. Yes, it was.

So you were in need, were you not,of reconsideringor looking
again at Hillsborough stadium itself? - A. There was,
understandably, with a promotiononly a short period before
the event, I may not be so well acquainted with the finer
detail as possibly Mr. Mole, but the point is I know the area
and have policed the area before.

Yes, but things have changed since you had been there over the
last 10 years. Most particularly in that period the radial
pens had been erected, and that of course made a considerable
difference? - A. Yes, sir.

When was it you were first aware you were going to be landed
with the policing of this game? - A. I would say, as Mr. Mole
was, I think it would have been the Saturday or Sunday, the
weekend where the fixtures for the Sixth Round were decided.

20th March, I think, or thereabouts. Only about a week
before. -'A . I think the announcement was made on the Monday
morning when the draw would be made.

 I can't immediately remember what date it was.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Monday, 20th March.

      THE WITNESS:      So I learned then.

      MR. COLLINS:   You learned then, and you realised
 immediately this was going to land on your plate very shortly
 after you had taken over? - A. Yes, sir.

     that? - A. No, I was unaware of that.

     a particu1ar event'has been a'success, that is a football
     nâ?ch has been a success in terms of policing, you get
     no input at al 1 from the spectators? - A. That is correct.

                              75            W. JACKSON


whether it might not be an idea to get Mr. Mole to come over
for the day and deal with the policing of this event? - A .
It was not considered necessary.

It would not have been impossible, would it? - A. It would
not have been impossible.

Did you consider it at all? - A. No, the reason I did not
consider it is on^ that Mr. Duckenfield is an experienced
Officer; polices Sheffield United; polices the City Centre;
he would be surrounded by the same team as he was last year
of very very experienced Ground Commanders.

But of course he is the man in ultimate control and I expect
you would agree with me that if a problem arises which is
not within- the anticipation of a plan, experience; is         ^
exceedingly helpful? - A. I think experi.enc.e is. always    1
helpful but you can get a Divisional Coaua^dex who moves- â  -
to any particular Division and has to deal with a specific
problem that he may not have .dealt with, before, but in,.   ' ,.
Mr.Duckenfield's case he had been involved.with Sheffield
Wednesday before, albeit     some time ago. and he was also â 
involved with Sheffield United, so he w^s very very much-
aware of football problems.

Now were you involved directly with, the planning or did.--,
you simply let Mr. Duckenfield get on v/ith it knowing that
he was going to apply the plan which had proved successful
the year before? â .A. Basically in my conversation with
Mrv'Mole -I- asked^'him' if-he ..1wouid;Ain: the/ii^ti^.fe;S^ggS- ,.r.v-r,; â ;::â 
tackle' the problem and that was on the 20th,of.March',and
then to arrange a- very quick meeting which was.donsron .                      .
the- 22nd -of Ma*rch. M-r-. Duckenfie.ld was at that meeting
with- Mr. Mo-le 1and my Chief Superintendent (Operations).
and a number'* of-other people arid from then on Mr. Duckenfield,
took charge of-- the -planâ¢but with the same .planning.team that
prepftâ¬edi-t'he -plan -'for -Mr. Mole last .yea^

â  And you''had' approved the 'plan theyear before? ,-         I ..approved .
 the' pi air 'â
              the 'year before and -I-* listened to' Mr. ^uokehfieicU- ; t.
We did make a slight amendment to the plan.

Is that- the reduction in manpower? ,7 A.. Np,;we .did that;
but' the amendment to. be more ef feetive-
the public order patrol's. What we did:we-ar-rs^ed; for - -  -;
I think it was five serials, which is 50 men, to be in
a coach at'Leppings Lane. The year before they had been
at GlaywKeif&;:iaie;Mich was some distance away, so we
felt it would be more effective having that manpower nearby.

And the other change was, which Mr. Mole has already
identified, was the reduction in manpower. Were you
involved in that decision yourself?

                            QUESTION                  T WO

Why were there no barriers or cordons to filter the crowd and
prevent a build up outside the Leppings Lane end of the ground if,
as the fans insist, there were the previous year?


C hief Superintendent Duckenfield stated that the O perational order fo r 19 8 9
Sem i-Final w as based on previous experience. Intelligence reports did not indicate
that there would be a lot o f non-ticket holders.     Police O perations had worked
previously with fans arriving over a period of tim e and obeying instructions in the
program m e and press. It w as n ever envisaged that a situation would arise w here w e
would have to change our operational plan.

Assistant C h ief C onstable Jackson stated that at all ticket m atches it has alw ays been
the practice fo r Police O fficers to filter and w eed out w h erever possible. Those who
are boisterous and refuse to co -operate are d ealt with by strict positive control,
how ever w e would soon lose m anpow er if making w holesale arrests.

                                   Q.   In addition, ycu have the problem at all games where
                                        it is all-ticket that people turn up without tickets
                                        in the hope of buying them from what are now I think
                                        euphemistically called t i c k e t - b r o k e r s . A. On
                                        occasions, sir, for major games, there are ticket touts*

                                   Q. And people     turn up to   buy   them. A.        Yes,   sir.
                          B
                                   Q.   It is therefore necessary, is it not, in any sensible
                                        plan of action to ensure that there are Police Officers
                                        further away from the Club up Leppings Lane filtering
                                        the crowd down and indeed on the bridge filtering the
                                        crowd through there?     A.That, sir,       is a difficult task.
                                        The situation is that   the normal state of society is to
                                        allow people to pass and re-pass and to adopt a filter
                                        operation the likes of which you     deS C ribe in Leppings
                                        ^a ne is a considerable operation and not one that fits
                                        in with normal policing arrangements for a sporting event
                                        where difficulties are not anticipated.

                                   Q.   Is that quite right, Mr. Duckenfield?   You arranged for
                                        Police horses  to help in this operation?   A.  Yes, sir.

                           D       Q. Do you agree that the lsst place that the Police horses
                                      should have been operating was the area between the railings
                                      and the turnstile?   A.   Are you suggesting the outer
                                      railings, sir?

                                   Q.   I am saying that the last place they should have been
                                        operating was the area between the railings and the
                                        turnstiles - between the perimeter railings and the
                                        turnstiles.   A.   It is a difficult area for them to
                                        operate, sir.

                                   Q. You never quite come up to the question I am putting to
                                        you.     It would actually be the last place you would put
                                        them,   would it 'not?  A . â  I am not an expe.rt cn horsemanship-,â¢
                                        sir

                                   Q. If they are not intended for that area, it is plain'that
                                        they were intended for the area beyond the railings -
                                        Leppings Lane.   That is right, is it not?   A.   They were
                                        intended to assist in crowd control in Leppings Lane, sir.

                                   Q. Yes, and they assist by controlling the crowd by filtering
                                        the *numbers getting through to the concourse.  A.   They
                                        and other Officers would assist, sir, in asking people to
                                        co-operate with the Police Service and form orderly queues.

                                        That is what should have happened, is it not?   A.  Yes,
                                        sir.  We expect the general public to co-operate with the
                                        Police and follow our guidance and to form orderly queues.

             B         o, yourâ'duties is? - A. Ho, our role is to speak v/ith
                        people and if possible ensure that ticket holders join
                       the queues.

D       If :
           -he Police operation in Leppings Lane had been an
        efficient one there never would have come an occasion \:h e n
        the whole of tiiat narrow little concourse was jammed ru11

        would have been queues at the turnstiles? - A. I disagree
        sir. Vie police bv consent in this country and you are
        lavine' the blame.at the door of the Police Service. The
        ceneral oublic who were approacmnc' i_;iat location^can
        see the situation and our operation was designed foj. coÂ­
        operation and one would hope if they saw a crowd they
        would wait and form a queue.

  the turnstile. Is it your view as a Police Officer or _
  c**eat e:coerience that: at that stage all uiiess _an^ .voulci
  turn round to each other and say: "Halt, we go no f u r t h e r .
  Tie "iust not approach the turnstile railings uni.il
  crowd wi*tv>in has dispersed. ' Me will all stand on Loppings
  La^e'and wait". Is that what you really think people cc? -

         that people coming down Leppings .bane would _:ien or uiieii
         own volition halt and go no further until they_saw tne jara
         disperse? - A. I don't see why football suppor-cers snou.c

     encourage people to come early? We actually wrote to the
     people who have the match programmes; v/e wrote to Chief
     Officers of Police; we went on the media; we asked people
     to come early so that they could get into the ground in
     plenty of time.

Q. Now, Mr. Jackson, a Police operation has got to deal with
   things as they develop. We have heard much of this from
   Mr. Duckenfield about assessing the developing situation.
   By 2.30 it looks from the videos as though there v/ere
   pretty crushed crowds within the turnstile area and
   arriving at the perimeter outside the railings.

           Cain I now.deal with how that perhaps should have been
     controlled. You agree that the first essential, is not.
     to allow the turnstile area to be full? - A. Yes.

Q. You therefore need a cordon of some sort or a filtering
   system outside the turnstile area and at Leppings Lane
   the'one advantage is that you have got the railings to
   enable you to filter. Is that right? - A. Yes.

Q. But in addition you need control of the crowd down Leppings
   Lane. That is right, isn't it? - A.Well we had sufficient
   Police Officers 6n= duty to take account of matters like
   that.

Q. Well that may be. What I want to deal v/ith is what can
   be done. Whether- it -was done on this occasion is another -
   matter, but let's see what can be done.                    -
                                                              r.
                                                               :.

           Both from the point of view of traffic control,
     that is enabling traffic to pass"and repass.along Leppincs .
     Lane and "over the'bridge, and from the point of view of ..
     controlling the crowd arriving at the railings, all you. .â¢
     need do is what is done on match days in' stadium after-,
     stadium up and down the country, that is a.controlled.
     crocodile may be six, may be seven, may be four or five
     deep, but a controlled crocodile walking pn the pavement
     down Leppings Lane controlled by mounted Police? - A. Well
     I think that is what the mounted Police Of ficers ..were    .
     trying to do.

Q.   Well whether they did or did not is again another matter,
     Mr. Jackson. All I am asking from you is an acknowledgement
     that there are means of controlling a crowd arriving at
     a stadium whether late or early? - A. Yes, I accept that.

Q. So if the control of the crowd, whether they had arrived
   at 2.15 or 2.30 or 2.45, whenever the bulk of them had
   arrived, if they had been escorted down Leppings Lane
   - as we can see very clearly in photographs which I think
   were taken last year - escorted down in a crocodile and
   then only allowed into the turnstile area through the
   gates when there was room within the area, there would have
   been no crushing? - A. I think that is what the Police
   Officers were trying to do.
                                                                 12

0       The presence of the Police may, in particular
        circumstances, produce antagonism? - A. That is right.       It
        could exacerbate the situation.
0       It has been put to you by a series of questions that all
        that is needed is, for example, a filtering. Do you
        follow? In the past has there been any practice of
        filtering supporters out as they have gone along Leppings
        Lane to ensure that certain individuals do not go in or
        has that been a matter that has been left to individual
        Officers to ask, "Have you got a ticket? Where do you#
        think you are going"? - A.When you say "filtering_out ,
        coming to the ground or goingaway from the ground.

Q.        Coming to the     ground? - A.Ithas always been....
0          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    I think he means filtering in
    ' and weeding out? - A. Yes, at all ticket matches it has
      always been a practice for Police Officers, to do that
      wherever possible.
             H R.   WOODWARD: Has that been done by way of making
Q.
        hoardings across the road? - A. No.
0       B y making a cordon across the entrance at Leppings Lane? -
        A   No c e r t a i n l y not. I think on this occasion, for
        example, that would have been very, very difficult.

    O Where you may have boisterous or unco-operative
       individuals, how is that to be dealt with by individu&l
       Policemen? - A. By strict and'positive; control over the
       individuals concerned.
       And how is that, in terms of manpower, to be accomplished?
    Q. - A One of the things that you have got to be careful
       about in an operation like this - I aean, I do appreciate
       we had j u st over 800 Police Officers in and about
       Hillsborough, but you are very quickly denuded if you
       start m a k i n g wholesale arrests and, consequently, you have
       got to be careful; you have got to try and.deal with it
       in other sorts of ways.
    Q    The gates that come across the approach to the turnstn-o,
         they form the first barrier - the fi-st physical barrier -
         that the a p p r o a c h i n g spectators find. Has it been the
         practice to use those gates to endeavour to control the
         people going towards the turnstiles? - A. I am not reaiiy
         familiar with it as to whether they did or they did not,
         but I should think they would use those gates for that
         purpose.
    Q. Have you seen the video concerning the crowds outside ^he
       gate? - A. Yes.

Q. Controlling the crowds coining down towards the ground? - A.
   Yes, what we try to do is to get people that come from the
   Station to queue on the right-hand side of Leppings Lane,
   outside the sweet shop which I think appears on the photoÂ­
    graphs and queue along there until they actually get into
   the turnstile area.

Q. So the idea of controlling by queueing in Leppings Lane is
   one which you understood was long standing? - A. Yes, you
   appreciate that some teams in the lowly reaches of the
 . First Division don't bring too big a crowd and so queueing
   does not present a problem, but when you get the likes of
   Man. U td.....

Q. You -knew you were getting a full house? - A. I knev; there
   would be a queue.

Q.   And therefore you knev/ that there v/ould be. a need for
     arranging queueing even before, or likely to be a need
     for arranging queueing even before you reached, the perimeter
     cates? - A. Oh yes.

Q. You I think began your own foot patrolling about â¢quarter-:
   to-11 in the morning.  Is that correct? - A. That is right.

Q. You walked around to see that all was .going, well, around
   your area.    I don't think v/e need take this in any detail,
   but were you aware in the course of the morning and letâs
   take- it- now frorn what 10.45 up until about 1 o âclock, as:
   the general period, that there were obviously a large- number-
   of fans in the area. Would that be fair? - A. Yes.

Q. What about drinking. Were you aware of drinking? - A..Yes,
   there Was a lot of drinking going on. I walked down a s , -
   far as the precinct in Hillsborough because I made it ;,..i.n
   my mind to call at-the off-licence in the precinct because -
   there had been a robbery there committed by Liverpool ...fans
   last year and I went and spoke to the two ladies .who ran -
   that. Outside there was a youth drinking from a can of
   strong lager with another three cans of strong lager-in his -
   possession.  I spoke to him and told him if he drank.all that
   lager he might have a job getting into the ground, but.that .
   was fairly general.  I was being approached al 1 thevtirae b y
   young fans wanting.to."know the locationof pubs that were -;. .
   open and it was very much a carnival atmosphere.. Despite
   the drinking the fans were reasonably well behaved at that
   stage, but the drinking was continuing all over the area.

Q. Can I put to you the summary which I think appears at page 10
   of your statement and I hope I am right, it covers about
   the sort of time I have been talking about, where you
   summarise thus:

          "This time there was no trouble and despite
          what seemed to me to be far too much drinking
          going on the fans v/ere well behaved."


                                                                 15
                          QUESTION                 THREE

Why was the game not delayed, as a number of police officers
thought it should have been, when it became obvious that it would
not be possible to get all the Liverpool fans safely into the ground
before the 3 pm kick-off?

Consideration to delay the kick-off w as in C hief Superintendent Duckenfield's mind as
the build up progressed, through his conversation with Superintendent Murray.
H ow ever w hen the tim e to consider taking up the option to postpone the kick-off w as
reached staff in the Police Control Room w ere overcom e by other events principally
the fault with the radio com munications and soon after, as the team s w ere on the
pitch, the option to delay becam e m ore difficult. D ang er to life and injury would be the
purpose for delaying the kick-off.



OBSERVATIONS
P lease see pages 1 6 - 4 1 , V olum e 2.



Lord Justice Taylor - Interim Report

2 2 6 . At various stages in his evidence, M r Duckenfield gave three accounts of w hy he
thought it too late to postpone kick-off. O nce it w as that one of the team s had already
com e onto the pitch. T hen it w as that a group of photographers at the tunnel had
wrongly led him to think that the team s w ere coming out. Finally, he did not know w hy
he thought the team s w ere coming out. T hey did not in fact com e onto the pitch until
2 .5 4 pm, two minutes after gate C w as opened. Police C onstable Buxton had asked
for a postponem ent of kick-off before gate C w as opened. It should not, however,
have needed a Police Constable in the thick of the crowd (and there w ere others of
like mind) to think of postponing the kick-off. T h e need should have been clear in the
control room.

2 27. Th e truth w as that M r Duckenfield applied inflexibly the policy he had discussed
with M r Murray. Kick-off would not be postponed unless there w ere som e m ajor
cause for delayed arrivals eg a jam on the m otorway or fog. I accept that the thinking
behind this policy w as not callous or punitive. If kick-off is postponed w h en ever a
proportion of fans choose to leave the public houses late, the practice m ay grow and
kick-off times would becom e m eaningless. But, a com m ander must deal with the
problem of the day. F aced with a situation which w as becoming dangerous, crowd
safety should have been his param ount consideration. Kick-off should have been
delayed.



Lord Justice Taylor - Interim Report Recommendation 29
2 9. T h e option to postpone kick-off should be in the discretion of the officer in
com m and at the ground. Crowd safety should be the param ount consideration in
deciding w h ether to exercise it.

                          THURSDAY,    25th MAY,     1989

                               (MORNING SESSION)

                    DAVID GODFREY DUCKENFIELD,       re-called

                      Examined by MR.      COLLINS   (cont.):

Q. Mr. Duckenfield, when we adjourned yesterday I was about to
   ask you about contingency plans for deferring the kick-cff.
   Presumably, and I think you said that you had had some
   discussions about the circumstances in which the kick-off
   might be postponed.   A.   During the afternoon, s i r .

Q. But before - I mean in the planning stage - was there
   no consideration   as to circumstances    which might lead
   to a decision   to postpone kick-off?  A.    In general
   discussions about the planning of the operation, yes.

Q       At what stage was that?       A.     I cannot be specific;

Q. With whom were t hese         discussions held?          A.   Superintendent
   Murray.

Q.      What was the outcome of them?      A.   It was suggested that
        if there w a s an event outside the ground and beyond our
        control, for instance fog on the Pennines, a major accident
        on the motorway or some similar event     that would prevent
        large numbers    of supporters from arriving at the ground
        on time, then    we should consider the     situation.

Q. What about if, for no ascertainable reason, there were
   a large number of late arrivals?    Had that been taken into
   account at all?    A.   No, sir, not at that stage.

q   .        LORD   JUSTICE TAYLOR: That was         the planning stage?
        A.   Yes,   sir .

q   .        MR. COLLINS:   Soreally very little final was decided;
        it was just somewhat speculative at that stage, is that
        right?   A.    In what respect?

Q.      In the sense that all you had applied your mind to was the
        possibility of some outside event, not the fault of the
        fans, or not the fault of anyone, causing late arrivals?
        A.   Yes , sir .

Q. But that is as far as it had gone?                A.     We had a general
   discussion about it.

Q. Before I continue with the day in question, you, I imagine,
   have seen, have you not, Chief Superintendent, the documents
   produced by the South Yorkshire Police, or have you not?
   A.   It depends which one you are referring to, sir._-

Q.      I am talking about these documents which were produced
           -,._u Mr. Wnnriward and the Police solicitors a few days

                   0       w- know that was in fact the situation because we Java

                           information should theoccasion arise? - A. No si.,
                           would expect them to give it me.

Q. Presumably you asked him that because you were concerned
   as~to whether you ought possibly to delay the kick-off.
   A. No sir, not specifically.

Q. Why did you raise it then if it wasn't in your mind as
   something which was a possibility? -     A.    As   anew f
   Commander, and thinking through many of the developments
   in a semi-final tie, I asked him to clarify with me the
   situation for delaying kick-offs, arid it was a general
   co nversatioh.
Q. Did you not know then what was the contingency plan for
   delaying kick-off, because it was your responsibility and
   no-one else's, to decide on whether kick-off should be
   delayed wasn't it? -    A. Yes siri

Q. Had you not clear in your mind before you started what
   w=r = the circumstances under which you would delay kic<-
   off? - A. As I said earlier I had had a aiscyssion with

     things to clarify my thoughts, I asked him for advice
     once more.
q    whv did you need his advice because you surely had already
     made the decision of the circumstances under which kick-
     off would be postponed. - A. I discussed with .
     Suoerintendent Murray many things, and I just discus^e^.,
     with him that point to refresh my memory.:

0. And you go on in your statement to identify what you have
   already given us in evidence, namely that you had
   oreviously agreed that if there was an identifiable
   oroblem, f o r example a serious incident, an accident on
   th- motorway, fog or something like that which prevented
   l a r g e numbers of fans arriving on time,- you shoula con- .
   sider delaying the kick-off. - A. Yes sir.y..

 Q. You go on to say:
               "As ooposed to those who had been brought
               to the"area within a reasonable time but
               had chosen not to enter the ground as soon
               as possible."

     -   A. Yes sir.
 0   That suggests that you had taken a policy decision that if
     oroblems arose due to late arrival of fans because^ they
     chose to arrive late you wouldnât postpone the <icÂ«-o-*-;
     - A.. You-- have got to be very careful in a situation such 'as
     â"his wi^'h-regard to delaying kicicâoffs. Mow io. tfi9C2 is fi
     major incident then yes I would seriously consider?
     delaying a kick-off as I have said.

                                                                19

theca. was a crowd at 2.30, there was-a crowd of people who'
wars trying to get in, and thsra is potential for '
d If"faculties, but I didn't foresee at that timC from thÂ£
irifyrmation supplied to me, that there would be any
difficulty-â

Let me put it this way - I know you didn't foresee any
difficulty but let me ask you this: you asked your
question or Superintendent Murray at about half past two
as to whether he thought you could get them all in on
time. - A. Yes sirC

He said he thought you could.   -   A. Yes sirf?

If he had said, "Mo, I'm afraid we have got a build-up
here, I don't think we will be able to get them in in time,
we are going to have problems." what would you have done?
   A. I would have seriously considered delaying kick-off.

Exactly.  And why would you have seriously considered
delaying kick-off? - A. Because the advice I was being
given was that there was a difficulty?.

But why would you delayâkick-off in those circumstances?
What difficulty did you foresee, or what problems did you
foresee or what dangers did you foresee if you did not
delay kick-off? - A. Would you rephrase that again sir?>

You say that if Mr. Murray had said to you, "I don't think
we will be able to get all this lot in by three o'clock."
- A. At that stage I v/ould have considered delaying kick-
of f.
Why? - A. Because if you can't get the fans in, and there,
was a considerable,number outside that weren't getting
there, I would have delayed the kick-off.

But for what purpose? To accommodate the fans or because
you thought that there might be otherwise crowd control
problems and disorder problems outside, or a combination
of the two? - A.. No. We are taking the point that -
what I. am. saying is this:         if there were perceived:
difficulties that could have caused a major problem fit
2 ^B8'-*and the advice I was being given is we should djfiay,

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     We are skirmishing.   Can I try
and clarify:

All counsel is asking is iÂ£ you had decided to delay the
kick-off against what risks v/ould you have made that
decision? Why would you have thought it right to do it?
- A. If there was a danger to life and injury^
                                              D.G. DUCKENFIELD




     MR. COLLINS: Because that might arise if you didn't
delay because of people trying to g^t, right? - A, Yes^

Now why does it matter then whether people have chosen to
arrive lata, or for whatever reason, the fact is if there
is a build-up outside that is what must trigger off the
dacisicn   surely.  - A. If it is a build-up and it is going
to causaa problem and they can't get in!

But you say, and looking back to your statement, that you
had agreed that you would postpone kick-off if there was
an identifiable problem which you have talked about, as
oooosed to those who had been brought to the area within a
reasonable time but had chosen not to enter the ground as
soon as possible. What you appear to be saying is that if
they were lata because it was their fault you were not
going to    delay kick-off. - A. If you read it in that
liaht per sa it seems to say that I am lacking in
consideration for latecomers.   I don't mean that.?

What it appears to be saying is that you had made a
decision that you would not delay the kick-off if the only
reason for late coming was the fans' own decision. Is
that right or wrong because that is what the statement^
says? - A. I accept that is what the statement says*/

I simply want to give you the opportunity of clarifying
that/ - A- I retain the flexibility to delay the kick--
of f '
     J
Anyway you decided at half past two tnat it wasn'c
necessary.  By twenty to three the crowd had continued to
increase.  -   A. Yes siE).
So the situation did-'not get any better, it got worse.
k. Yes -sir!
And it was plain was it not by twenty to three that you
would not get them all in in time? - A. No sir. It was
plain that we had a difficulty at twenty to three.)

Now was the       time, was it not, to postpone kick-off?  - A.
It may have       been a consideration sir, but at twenty to 9
t h r e e I was   overcome by events-.

What events were you overcome by?       -   A. The radio
developed a fault.

Let me ask you a bit about that. Which radio developed a
fault? - A. The personal radio.

Which meant that you couldn't communicate with who?        -   A.
The Police Officers in the operational field.

                                                         D.   G.   DUCKENFIELD


                         developing,   sir.

                    Q. Well, it was more than developing, it had developed, had
                       it not?   A.   Yes.   There was a problem at that end.

                    Q. And it was becoming clear, was it not, t h a t you were not
                       going to get all that crowd in by 3 o'clock?      A.   Yes,
                B
                       sir.

                    Q. Why then, at that moment, did you not make the clear decision
                       to postpone kick-off?   A.   Because at that time my mind
                       was taken up with other things, assisting Superintendent
                       Marshall.

                C   Q.   You had a crowd there developing.   You had a situation
                         where the crowd was such that it was plain, was it not, that
                         people might be in difficulties?   A.   Yes, sir.

                    Q. By 2.47 you knew that people were indeed in difficulties
                       because you had the first request from Superintendent
                       Marshall to open the gate.   A.  Yes, sir.

                D   Q.   So that you knew you had there a real crowd problem.
                         A.   Yes, sir.

                    Q.   If kick-off was not postponed, that problem would be likely
                         not to go away but possibly to get worse as people tried
                         to get in by 3 o'clock.  A.  Yes, sir.

                    Q.   Surely at that moment you have no alternative but to say,
                E        "Kick-off must be delayed."           A.  That is incorrect, sir.,
                         Let me take you back to the situation.            We have by now
                         no incident on the roads or no fog on the Pennines but
                         v/e have a problem outside.           At ten to three we presume
                         that-. we have approaching 50,000 people already in the
                         g r o u n d and at that stage there are 50,000 people in the
                         g r o u n d ready and waiting for the game to kick-off.        There '
                         is no incident inside> the ground that is -going to          â¢
                F        affect t h e k i c k - o f f and I had a situation outside the
                         ground that is a very serious situation, as you say, so
                         I was concentrating on the very serious situation
                         outside the ground to try to resolve that serious s i t u a t i o n .

                    Q.   But what I am suggesting, you see, is that a delay in
                         kick-off would have been one of the -- perhaps one of the
                G        m o s t " important means by which you could deal with the
                         very serious situation outside the ground, because you
                         would -- the effect of delay, if properly announced,
                         the effect of delay would be to take the pressure off
                         people trying to get in because they would know that
                         they would not have to get in by 3 o'clock, they would
                         have until, say, 3.15.        A.   I think we have to address
                         two problems.        Delaying the kick-off is one thing.
                H        Communicating that to the crowd outside and getting them
                         to agree with your requests is another and the situation
                         was that already I understand that Officers were telling
                         people that the kick-off had been delayed and they were

                     Officers were asking people to ease back.   They were not
                     responding to those requests.   They were not responding

Q. But you did not know that at the time, did you, that is to
   say you did not know that individual Officers were telling
   people that the kick-off had been delayed? - A. It was
   becoming apparent that people were not responding to
   Mr. Marshall or other Police Officers' directives because
   that situation would not have arisen.

q       Did it not occur to you that one ox. the reasons why uhey
        were not responding might be because of their anxiety tc
        cret in to the ground before 3 o'clock because we are new
        approaching close to 3 o'clock and it is perfectly plain
        to*anyone stuck in that crowd outside that there might
            problems m getting in? â A. x c&n understand i u i^
        someone arrives at that situation at tnat -ime, ac tnat
        late hour, that they may believe they won't get in.1?

Q       In those c i r c u m s t a n c e s surely it must have occurred to you
        that to delay kick-off might well be to take one way of
        taking the anxiety out of the situation for those wanting
        to cet in and thus making them hold back, have seme reason
        to hold back? - A. Sir, at that time the crisis situation
        that there was toojc all m^ concentj.Â£ Li^nâ¢

Q.      jut you were trying to resolve that crisis? - A. I wasv

0       And all I am sugcestinc is that your best weapon tc
        re=olve it was delay the kick-off? - A. I did not conside:
        tha:t m y best *weapon at that time was delaying the kick-.
            ; I v/as trying to assist Superintendent Marshall.9
        off-â
0       What did you think v/as your best weapon? You must have
        had "some idea as to what you might do to try and alleviate
              situation? â A. It was the Tannoy messages; it Wca/
        the public a d d r e s s system and sending exura Officers to
        assist to calm the crowd and to get them to move, back.-.

O. You felt I imagine.., or did you feel that this- situationâ¢-
   had been created because people nad nou arrived on- ui^e?
   - A. Yes, there was a large crov/d that had obviously-
   arrived very late.
 0      So you thought effectively:   "It is their ov/n fault they
        are stuck in -this trouble" did you? - A. Sir, m a</
        situation such as that you never think things of that
        order.
    O    You see you have referred yet again to         there being "no
         maior incident", no reason. That must          have had^some
         effect on your thinking? - A. Mo, as a         Police u-j-icer I
         v/as responding to that crov/d situation       then and very-
         concerned about it-
    Q. Anyway 2.47, I think it is, v/e have the first request
       from Superin t e n d e n t M a r shall to open the ga^e. Right?
       - A. Yes sir. 7

                              Q. And you are still considering the question of postponement
                                 of kick-off, among other options? - A. It is an option sir,
                                 but when he asked me to open the gate that certainly was
                                 not going through my mind.

                              Q. Now when he made that request what was your-immediate
                                 reaction? - A. To be honest I did not want to open the gate.
                          B
                              Q. Why not? - A. To open a gate at a football ground it would
                                 have defeated the objectives of our Operation Order in
                                 that drunken fans may get in; people who had got drink;
                                 people who had got missiles and people who were without
                                 tickets would get access.

                              Q. Were you aware by now that there was a problem with a numbe;
                                 of people outside without tickets? - A. I was aware that
                                 during the day there had been people without tickets.

                              Q. Eut were you aware that there were a considerable number
                                 of fans at the Leppings Lane entrance who did not have
                                 tickets? - A. I was not aware sir.

                          D   Q. Because I think a lot cf statements, or a lot of evidence
                                  we have heard and certainly a lot of statements that I have
                                  read, refer to considerable numbers of people without
                                  tickets and asking for tickets. Is that something that
                                  had not been drawn to your attention? - A. Not at that
                                  stage sir.

                              Q. Because that was rather an important factor, wasn't it,
                                  â¢because if there were a lot of people milling around
                                   without tickets that was something which would have added
                                   to the disorder or the problems rather outside? - A. In
                                   what respect?
                              Q. well. if .you have a lot of people milling- around in a
                                 s m a l l area w h o a r e without tickets coupled with'people ;â 
                                 c o m i n g a l o n g trying to-get into"the ground, you add to
                                 the p r o b l e m s don't you, because you have cot more people
                                 there? - A. I would suggest that there are people there,
                                 there are probably people without tickets.

                              q   j See. - A.;But the crowd difficulties are there whatever.

                              Q. Anyway you were reluctant to agree to the gate being
                                 opened because of the factors you have identified? - A. Yes
                                 sir.
                              O. Were you able to make direct contact with Superintendent
                                 Marshall or not? - A. I remember receiving a radio message
                                 but having received the radio message from him, or in
                                 came into the Control Bo:-:to open the gate, I immediately
                                 looked at the monitor for the Leppings Lane turnstiles and
                          H      as I did so I would describe it as the gate burst open.
                                 I have since found looking at the compilation that might

                               gates, what action if any did you take to try to contain the
                               situation inside as a result of a lot of people coming in.
                               some of whom may be should not have been in at all? - A. Yes.
                               I gave instructions that every available Officer should attend
                               in two different locations.  In the North Stand to patrol the
                               landings and to ensure those who were going into the North
                               Stand area who did not have tickets would nor flood through
                               the exit/access entrances on to the pitch. In addition. I
                     B         asked for increased Officers around the perimeter track to
                               assist.

                          Q. To assist where? - A . On the perimeter track in observing the
                             situation in the North Stand, and perimeter generally.

                          Q. But your concern was largely in relation to the North Stand
                             and the consequences of opening gate A, is that right? - A.
                             Yes .
                          G. What about the consequences of C and the terraces? Did you
                             take any steps in relation to that? - A. No, sir, other than
                             the Officers in the control box were watching that situation
                             as with other situations in the ground, knowing what had
                             developed.
                      D
                          Q. If I may go back to your statement, page 10, you say this,
                             having dealt with the manpower request at the top of page 1 0 ,
                             the matters you have just covered in your evidence:

                                    "I watched the Leppings Lane terrace intently for any
                                    developments as a result of the gates openingâ .

                               - A. Yesr sir.
                           G. What developments did you anticipate or what possible
                               developments did you anticipate as a result of the gates
                            â¢ - opening on -the Leppings Lane terraces? - A. I was concerned to
                          .     see what, the .-effects of opening ;the gates and allowing people â 
                               into the ground would have.                 â¢â â â â â¢â  â¢-   :v â¢

                          G. What effects did you anticipate? - A. I thought that there
                             could be pushing, and I wanted to observe- the situation across
                             the terrace.
                          G.    We know the gate was in fact opened at 2.52. That is the
                               video monitor time.   It may be we are talking of a range;-
                               within a minute or so either side. We know that the teams
                               came out at about 2.54, in fact. I think 2.54, just after.
                               You do say, if I may go back in your statement that you did
                               consider again the question of delaying the kick-off, and this
                               as I understand it was before the decision was made to open
                               the gates. Am I right in that? - A. Yes, sir'.

                           0          Before you could make a final decision on that you realised
                                that the teams were about to come out on to the pitch? - A - -
                      H         With the events, sir, and that particular timing, in the :
                                statement it may be out of sequence. My perception is when I
                                was considering the teams coming - when I was considering

                             delaying the kick-off because of a request from elsewhere, I
                             looked to my right and I thought the teams were about to run
                             on to the pitch'because of the photographers. I thought that
                             the ieams were coming out. It appears my time sequence is
                             incorrect there.
                                  LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I am sorry.  "A request from
                             elsewhere"? A request from where? - A. There was a
                             suggestion over the radio'almost at kick-off timeâ
                             for the kick-off to be delayed.

                           Q. From? - A. From a P.C. Buxton, I believe, my Lord. y

                                   aEt^r the gates had been opened? - A. Sir with the
                                   oassage of time and the events as they were
                                   simultaneously, my only perception was then and is now
                    B              that there was a half circle of photographers outside the
                                   olayers' tunnel and I chought at that stage that that was
                                   when the players were coming out.

                           Q. That isn't, with respect, an answer to my question.                      -   A.

                                   were opened."

                                   came shortly before the gates were opened.

                                accurate picture, that before you could come to a final
                                decision to postpone, or to ask for a postponement o t the
                                kick-off:, that teams came out on to the pitch and thereÂ­
                                fore you considered that that option had been removed?
                                A. Yes sir, once the teams ran out on to the pitch.

                           Q. Ths fact that the teams are out on the pitch doesn't
                              itself preclude still postponement of kick-off does it?
                              A. That is correct sir..'.

                           Q. It makes it, I accept, more difficult but it doesn't
                              actually preclude it. - A. That is right sir. â  '

                              thereabouts. - A. Yes sir.,

                           Q. But they did come out earlier than that for their preÂ­
                              match warm-ao as I understand it. â A. Yes sir.-/
                       E   Q. And then went back in. Are you referring to that pre-
                              match warm-up or are you reEerring to the 2.54, 2.55?
                              A.:.,I don't m o w sir. My sequence oc events, as I can
                              hones estly recollect them, and bearing in mind the -developÂ­
                              ments of the day, I was oÂ£ the opinion that when I made my
                              statement that in iconsidering the developing.-situation- art -â 
                              2.4-7, and .the ac t ions -at -the â Leppings Lanei .end, that is
                              .when I seriously considered delaying the kick-off-, and â¢
                              whilst considering that I looked to .'my right' through the
                              Control 3ox window and saw a half circle of press
                              o h o t o g raphers waiting for the teams to come out, and
                              something occurred that made me .think the t p m s were
                               running out on to the pitch. Having 'saiti^that, since that
                               time my prception at that time was that;the teams were
                              running out to start the game. I have                    en advised,
                              because I hadn't access to the                          that
                               couldn't have occurred, that was at 2.54.               my
                               p e r c e p t i o n is that I,was thinking through that option

                                              s- than that, to say that I don't know who came out
                                               made me think that, other than to say there was a

                               thought I saw the* teams run out. It could have been for

        that at that stage the developing situation within the
        ground had gone to a situation when I had lost the option.

Q.       So what you are saying is that what you believed    at the
        time you made your statement, and presumably at     the time
        you made your decision, was theteams coming out     may in
        hindsight not have been. - A. No, it may have       been coming
        out for a kick-about as you say.?

Q. And therefore you may in fact have been earlier, or it may
   have been at a time earlierthan 2.54. It must have been
   at a time earlier than 2.54. - A. Yes.

Q. Coming back to page 10 ....

Q.LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:          If that was right and the
    teams had their kick-about and went back off again, the
    ootion would have reaopeaced. - A. To delay the tcick-cif
    sir, yes.-,
q   .        MR.   COLLIN'S:   But by then, having cegard to the
        evidence    you gave earlier this morning, the events you
        told us    about effectively made it impossible foryou to
        come to    that decision you are saying. - A. Yes.?

o. That is the breakdown of communications ....    - A.My-
   perceotion is breakdown in communications, worsening
   situation, 2.47-ish decide to take some action, think
   about delaying the kick-off, players out, straight into
   the ccisis of 2.47.

Q. Now you then you tell us watch che Leppings Lane tecrace
   intently- tor developments resulting from the gates
   opening.   - A. Yes sir.
Q. When: you- watched -that .were you /aware of "a-surge into' those
   central pens? '-      A. No sir. -    â        '--:    â¢ â¢â¢

Q. I think that there clearly was such a surge.         You didn't
   see it though. - A. No.

q    . Was it not clear from what you could see, because the
       video was still running presumably. - A. Yes.

Q       And you were keeping one eye on that I imagine from i_iine to
        time. You could" see people pouring in still, and you
        could see them going towards that central tunnel couldn't
        vou? - A. I can only refer to the compilation video I
        have just seen, and the compilation video doesn't indicate
        they were pouring towards the central tunnel.

Q. With respect Chief Superintendent, to anyone who knows the
   geography it is clear beyond any peradventure that that

                                                                      31

Q. What else could you do, having failed to raise Mr. Lock? - A.
   With regard to the club?
Q. With regard to the turnstiles which you were concerned about?
   - A. Yes.  I could not raise Mr. Lock.I was then overtaken
   by what I consider were moreserious events, that is requests
   for the gates to be opened in Leppings Lane.

Q. That of course was all related to the flow through the
   turnstile, was not it? - A. yes, sir. I would think so.

Q. Can we, as it were, go back to the chronology we were on
   before.  Did you a conversation with Chief Superintendent
   Duckenfield about the crowd and getting them in? - A. Yes,
   sir:
Q. Did you have a conversation about the delay of kick off at
   this time? - A. Yes, siir.

Q. How did that arise? - A. I think Mr. Duckenfield asked me to
   remind him what we had discussed about delaying kick-off, and
   I said that normally we would not delay kick-off if people,,
   were just late, but if there was something that kept them from
   getting into the ground or getting to the ground, i.e.
   accidents or physical problems over the Pennines, etc., then
   obviously we have to delay the kick-off.

Q. I am sorry, did you agree with that principle that you should
   delay it only in those circumstances? - A. I think the option
   is always open that that was the general rule. That was our
   sort of agreement end our perception, and I think that is k
   fairly common one.
Q   This was a discussion you had with Mr. Duckenfield about the
    reasons why you may or may not delay kick-off? First, what I
    am interested in is what time did this discussion take place,
    to your best recollection? - A. It would be about 2.30.

Q. Can you think of any event or anything that   was occurring
   outside that gave rise to this discussion?    Why should you be
   thinking about it at that time? - A. It was   about the time
   that I suggested there were a lot of people   out there and we
   would get them in.?
Q   If you were sure you would get them in, questions of delaying
    kick-off would not really arise, would they? - A. You would
    think not, sir, no.
Q. If you had thought they would not get in that is when you
   might think about delaying kick-off, is not it? - A. Yes.',

 Q. Was there a time you thought that when you were having this
    discussion? - A. Not at that time, no, sir.

 Q. Did you the question of delaying kick-off, was it raised again
    before 3 o âclock?0 - A. No, sir.?

                                                                 32

                           Q. Did you think it was appropriate at any stage before 3 o âclock
                              to consider it again? - A. i would think that it probably wal.
                              There was obviously just before the players came out it was
                              obvious the people were not going to get in through the-
                              turnstiles by 3 o'clock.

                           Q. That would be about 5-to-3, would not it? - A. 5-to-, 10-to-3,;
                    B         yes.
                           Q. Did you mention it? - A.. No, sir.

                           Q. You did, however, think it might be appropriate? - A. I did
                              not think it would appropriate, otherwise I would have
                              mentioned it. Again it was a thought that didnât come into my-
                              head. Things were happening then that were demanding my
                              attention.
                           Q. I think you had various bits of information coming into
                              your control room, had not you, from this point onwards, from
                              half-past-2 to 3 o âclock? - A. Yes, sir.

                           Q. Not just of the ground and Leppings Lane but all around, too?
                              - A. There were many things happening.
                     D
                           Q. I think you had some trouble with a ticket tout, had not you?
                              - A. Yes, sir.   I can't remember the timing, but certainly
                              there was a ticket tout selling tickets outside the Leppings
                              Lane end for the Kop, and our little contingency on the Kop
                              was already full. The tout was in fact arrested.

                           Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Selling tickets outside the
                                Leppings Lane end? - A. Selling tickets to Liverpool
                                supporters for the Kop end of the ground, yes, my Lord.

                           Q.        MR. PHILLIPS:   So I think he was arrested, was he? - A.
                                He was arrested.
                           Q. This was a report you had received by radio, is it? - A     Yes,
                              sir.

                           Q. So the radio was working then at this stage? - A. Yes, it was.

                           Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   As a matter of interest, he was
                                arrested for what? - A. He was arrested, I would think, for
                                causing obstruction, my Lord.

                           Q. Obstructing Officers in the course of their duty or what? - A.
                              By the course of his actions he would have been causing an
                              obstruction in the highway. People would have been gathering
                              round him and he would be causing an obstruction.

                           Q. If he had been selling them for the Leppings Lane end would it
                              have been any different? - A. I doubt it, my Lord, if he had
                              been causing an obstruction, no matter where he was selling
                       H      them.

        Yes.   Well, it could be 4,000, not 5,000.

Q       Yes. As far as the West Stand was concerned andthe standing
        terraces, about how many do you reckon still had to come in
        there atâ2 30? - A. The West Stand was filling.  It was what I
        would call filling.  That is over half-full and on its way to
        filling. Not full, but doing well. The terraces, it is very
        difficult to establish, but certainly there were plenty in the
        centre two pens and plenty in the raised area, and there were
        quite a lot in the rest of the terrace.

q       The situation was this, was not it , at 2.30, that the two
        centre pens were not filling; they were full; but the two
        wing pens had thousands to come? - A. That was usually the
        state of affairs on a match like this.

Q       So again we have got a situation at 2.30 wherethere are very
        many thousands of people still to come into the ground? - A.
        No you said that, sir.    I said there were probably 4,000 to
        5.000 to go into the North Stand at the extreme andprobably
        4.000 to go into the West Stand terrace.

Q.       Yes, very   many thousands.
q            LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    How many to go into the West
        Stand? - A. I would think, my Lord, probably if I had to put a
        figure on it I would think there was probably about 4,000
        spaces on the terrace at halfâpastâ2 .

Q       On the terrace or the terrace and theWest Stand? â A.
        Probably up to 4,000 spaces on the terrace, my Lord.

q            MR HYTNER:    Again, these figures may well be
        approximate, but we are getting to something like 8,000 in all
        to come? - A. Yes.
Q        Did you think you would get all those in by 3 o clock? â A.'
         Yes, I thought half-an-hour was sufficient. /

Q. Again this has been explored with Mr. Duckenfield, but I have
   to ask it you because it is certainly plain on your statement,
   one of the considerations which weighed with you as to whether
   the kick-off was to be delayed was whether it was the fault of
   -Â£^0 fans or whether it was not the fault of the fans? â A. I
   think "faultâ is not the word I would use, sir. I think what
   was said was if it was purely a case of people not turning up
   at the right time for the kick-off then it would not normally
   be delayed.
    q    Yes because it is their own fault? It is their own look out.
         Wasâthat the attitude? - A. I donât think it was ever meant to,
         be as dogmatic as that.                â ,
    q         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    What is the distinction between
         having a large crowd outside who are not going to be able to
         get in by 3 o âclock because there has been fog on the Pennines
         or having the same crowd similarly unable to get in because

                                                                        34
                                            B.D. MURRAY


they have chosen to come late? - A . I donât there was ever an
intention that because people came late deliberately en masse
that we would not delay the kick-off.   It could have been
24,000 people that came late, and obviously the situation
would have been completely different.   I think everything we
set has to have an alternative option. The option is always
there.
     MR. HYTNER:   One of the reasons for delaying the kick-
off is to avoid the impatience that arises outside the ground
of fans who think they are going to miss the kick-off and who
may indulge in some pushing or shoving in order to get into
the ground early? Is not that one of the reasons why you do
delay a kick-off? - A. That would be a consideration. ,

It is not just a reward for those who have not done anything
wrong or a punishment for those who have come late
deliberately.  It is a matter of crowd safety, is not it? - A,.
I donât see it as a reward or a punishment.  I see it as quite
an important decision to make. There are other t
considerations; the behaviour of the people inside; what
will happen after the event; the arrangements that have been
made after the event . 1 think it is something that has to be
given a lot of thought.
     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I suppose if you do it too lightly
then people just get to rely on the fact that kick-off will be
delayed? - A. This is one of the main problems, my Lord.:/

     MR. HYTNER:   And you may get impatience inside the
ground. Nobody is suggesting it is an easy question to solve.
What I have to put to you, however, is that the one
consideration you should never take into account is that
people have turned up who turned up late who might have turned
up earlier. That simply should never be part of the equation,
should it? - A. I thought that was what I was just saying,
sir.
It is not apparently what you said in your statement.     Do you
follow? - A. No, sir.  I don't. "j

Perhaps I had better read it to you,   because it  may be atotal
confusion and it may be you said something you did not mean to
say. Have you got your statement in front of you? - A. Yes, I
have.
 I think it is page 9.   The middle of the page:

      "About this time Chief Superintendent Duckenfield asked
      me to remind him of what we had decided about delaying
      the kick off.  I informed him that we had agreed that if
      there was an identifiable problem, such as a serious
      accident on the motorway, or bad weather over the
      Pennines, which prevent people   arriving on  time, thatwe
      would delay - but if it was merely that people     had
      arrived in time, but decided to go elsewhere, rather
      than the ground and arrived at the last minute, then we

                                     would not normally delay it".

                                - A. Yes, sir.   "Normally".   "Not normally delayâV.

                           Q. When you think about it that should not be a consideration at
                              all, should it? - A. What, that people come when they want and
                              we have the match when they a r r i v e ? >
                     B
                           Q. If there is a press of people outside the ground and they are
                              impatient to get in there may be a danger of crushing and
                              disorder.  It does not matter why that is, does it? - /A.
                              No. If we are talking about the circumstances you are
                              talking about, no,.

                           Q. Was it a consideration on this particular day that it passed
                              through your mind and was perhaps discussed with Mr.
                              Duckenfield that these were latecomers who had been drinking
                              around the town? - A. No, sir, not at all/.

                           Q. Can I just go on.
                           Q.          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I suppose the thinking behind it
                                is this, that people who are held up by fog or an accident
                                wo n ât take the delay of kick-off to be held up by fog or an
                                accident next time, because that is just something that
                                happened to them, but if people stay in the public houses
                                until the last minute and roll up then and know that last time
                                it happened the kick-off was delayed, then they would
                                be encouraged to do it more? Have I got it right or not? - A.
                                Yes, my Lord, exactly,

                           Q. It is a difficult equation.




                                                               /Q.   M R . HYTNER:   There were.

Q.   And the people in his immediate front, one can see almost
     down to their waists, some of them.  People standing,
     turning, looking around, lighting cigarettes? - A. I feel
     there is some room at the front, but it looks full at the
     back

Q. Whilst you were up in the Control Box before the incident
   happened, did you have any worry or concern over the state
   of those people in the terraces? - A. No, sir, I had no
   concern.

Q.   In 1988 we know that the same game had been played - the
     same venue, same teams, supporters, similar allegiance -
     and in 1988, to the best of your recollection, how had the
     terraces been? - A. The terraces were similar to what they
     were in 1989.

Q. Hay I ask you about another matter - the question of
   delaying the match? - A. Yes, sir. ?

Q.   And it was being put to you that you had the discussion
     with Hr. Ducken f ie l d? - A. Yes, sir.

Q.   About the c ircu ms ta nc es   in which the   game would be
     delayed? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. And the point was b eing made about people coming along
   late? - A. Yes, sir..-

Q.   How do you know when to draw the line? - A. I think that
     is perhaps one of the most difficult decisions that therg
     is-to make as to when you decide that you are going to >;
     d e 1ay the kick-off.    I think if you are in a situation
     where you know that there is something definite that is
     prev en ti ng people gett in g to the venue, then the decisiojfi
     is very easy, but if it is just that people are arriving
     and you are w ond er in g whether they are going to get in in
     time, the d ecisio n is very difficult,.

Q.   Of course, I suppose it might be said that even one
     car-load of angry, f rustrated and late supporters might
     cause some problem if they are rushing into the ground and
     the game is not d el a y e d for their benefit. Do you follow?
     That would be an extreme proposition, but it might be
     foreseen or foreseeable that those individuals, in their
     rush to get in, might cause problems for others?. - A. Tha/t
     is possible, sir, but my experience is that there are some
     people who come to games late anyway rather than be in /
     before kick-offi/

 Q. And is it very much a matter of judgment? - A. Very much"/
    so.




                                                                     37

    ore e asily to be e x e r ci s ed in obvious situations like

and fast rule.
             â¢+ ewer been the practice to have such a rule?
AN o ^ S 11 have never been   to a match where the kick-off                  has
been delayed.

fo? stop                    it b e m u s e they are late"? - A. There are not any
rules,                     no,         sir:

                                                         B.D. MURRAY


    ^ io Did the thought occur to you that the game snould be delayed?
      ' ' - A. The thought d i d not occur to me. I think I was probably
          p r e o c c u p i e d with other events.

         |q . Of course with hindsight we can achieve miracles? - A. With
              hindsight, yes.
    uln           Mav I now move on to ask you about the communication facilities,
    151                 Â£ little because there may be detailed evidence as to
                  its '"complexity , but first of all was a consequence of the
                  radio difficulties that were being experienced, that t^e
                  Control Room switched to using the hand-nelc portable
                  radios? - A. Yes sir.
         In       Did that mean that the Control Room by adopting that course
     T            was in iust the same position, in effect, as anybody else
     H            equioped with a hand-held radio? - A. Yes sir. when we
                  use t'-e main set we can override anyone who is sending a
                  -lesssce into control, but by using personal radios _every-
                  one is on the same circuits and everyone is competing ror
                  the same signals.
          In       in order to achieve the communication, because of the circum-
                   ,i,nro. which one understood to obtain., did it mean chat ^
     D             you in effect no longer had the control with the substantial
                   i - t i o system? - A. Yes sir, we no longer had tr.e racility
                   to be able to cut people off and override thea and pass
                   messages from control.

          Q-       - i k - t ^ o u Q h ^ - A. No sir, that was my impression on the
     r             day and'we did operate our personal radios after the
                   radio, breakdown, my Lord.
                             v7OOD'\TARD- Of course there was a radio hn.< that
                   you had with the ground, the Club's Operations Room? - A.
                   yes, we did have a personal radio on tneir system.

              h     That was a personal system which was possessed by the
                    ground which provided you the facility to lime m .
                    Yes sir.
                    That is a separate radio system from the Police radio system?
                    - A. It is a*" separate personal radio system run by the Club.

                         - Tnnn JUSTICE TAYLOR: That is the one the Club use
                    to contact S e i r Stewards? - A. Contact their Stewards anc

                                              were d evelopi ng at the tuzustilcs rather than what
                                    was hap p e n i nlgo in Leppings Lane.   Obviously the larger
                                    n u m b e r were around   the turnstiles

                              Q.    I follow that, but did it not occur to you        o r t o anyone
                                    that the two should not be looked at in isolation because
                                    the more you have coming down the w orse the problem is_
                                    ooing to get, is not it? - A. I can appreciate that point
                   B                but speaking for m y s e l f m y interest was directed at the
                                    people around the turnstile area.

                              Q.    It did not get better any way,                  did it, as minutes went by?
                                    - A. C e rtainly not, no.

                              Q.    Indeed,    it got worse?       - A. Yes,         it did.

                              Q     Did you v o l u n t e e r to Chief Superintendent Duckenfield or
                                    anyone that the p o s i t i o n was getting worse? - A. At the
                                    time that this was h a p p e n i n g Chief Superintendent
                                    D u c k e n f i e l d was stood just in front of my position
                                    on the monitors.

                              Q.     So he could see them? -A.So he was looking up at the
                                    m o n i t o r we w ere looking at and we were discussing the
                    D               general sit u a t i o n together.

                              Q.       Wha t was the d i s c u s s i o n   as far as y*-u can recall?
                                      Ob v i o u s l y do not expect y o u to remember exact words.
                                      - A. The matt e r s we wer e seeing, p a r t i cularly
                                      individual events, was in relation to a m o u n t e d Officer

                      E               his horse around.

                              0     It mus t have bee n fa i r l y obvious, surely, that the crowd
                                    was getting w orse rather than better? - A. It was obvious
                                    that the crowd was b u i l d i n g up, yes.

                              0   Was anything said as time w e n t on that you can remember
                               ââ about possible delay of kick-off? - A. A conversation
                                  did take place b e t w e e n Mr. Duckenfield, Mr. Murray',
                                  p o s sibly w h o e v e r else was in the control at that time
                                  and I remember           M r . M u r r a y saying that it was not our
                                  policy to delay the k i c k - o f f for people wh o had just
                                  a r r i v e d late at the ground.            Somebody else threw int,p
                                  that conv e r s a t i o n if there had been a problem on the
                                  m o t o r w a y or roadworks the situation is different9.

                      G        Q.    So it was your u n d e r s t a n d i n g       t   appreciate   it is not
                                     your decision. â A. Yes^

                                     that because the  fans        were choosing to arrive late
                                     then there was no q u e s t i o n of deferring kick-off? - A.
                                     Yes.  I think the s i t u a t i o n is if fans become aware
                                     that by coming late k i c k - o f f will be delayed they w i l l

0       Yes   I see.     No w a gain at about this time between 2.30,
        2.40   that sort of period, wer e you aware of the civilian
        radio communications offi c e r coming to deal w i t h the
        radio? - A. Yes, he did come in and commence wor k on
        the set w h i c h is b e l o w the desk in front of me.

Q.       We have h e a r d Sergeant G o d d a r d tell us about that and
         I am not going to as k yo u to go over the same ground.
         Did there come a           time a g a i n shortly after or about
         this tine that you heard something to do wit h the gates
         over the radio? - A. That is right.               Mr. Marshall was
         asking for the gates to be opened because of the problems
         o u t s i d e . W h e n referring to gates the gates I am talking
         about, it is just C Gate.               Mr. Duckenfield]s attention
         was d i r ected to C Gate as was mine.            That is the gate
         we were looking at.

Q        W h i c h is not s urprising because it was basically the only
         gate that you could r e a l l y see through that camera? - A.
         That is correct.

Q. And it is the outside of w h i c h together wit h the inside
   of which you could see? - A. Yes.

Q                  LORD J U S T I C E TAYLOR:           Are you simply giving us
          y our u n d e r s t a n d i n g of it or what Mr. Marshall said?
          - A. No.           Mr. Marsh a l l was referring to opening gates
          because of the proDlems outside.                    I directed Mr.
        ' D u c k e n f i e l d 1s at t e n t i o n to C Gate and,  if you like,
          w h e n reference was m a d e to gates by Mr. Marshall that
          Â£g the gate that I was looking at on the m o n i t o r and
          paying a t t e n t i o n to.

Q                MR. COLLINS:          That was certainly the gate that

                         QUESTION                  FOUR

Why didn't police recognise overcrowding on the Leppings Lane
terrace when eye witnesses, including football commentator John
Motson, were aware of the problems fifteen minutes before kick-off?


No information was received from any source to the effect that there was
overcrowding or problems with density in the central pens 3 and 4.                Chief
Superintendent Duckenfield saw nothing untoward on the terraces to cause concern
and the problems with density were not immediately obvious to him. It would be fair to
say that the view from the elevated position of football commentator John Motson in
the South Stand compared to the lower more acutely angled view afforded to Chief
Superintendent Duckenfield in the Police Control Room gave the former a more
realistic concept of the situation, and the fact that Chief Superintendent Duckenfield's
attention was focused on the continuing build up outside the turnstiles in Leppings
Lane.


OBSERVATIONS

Please see pages 42 - 52, Volume 2.

Lord Justice Taylor - Interim Report

244. As the stream from gate C flowed through the tunnel, the officers in the control
room could be expected to keep a close watch on pens 3 and 4. They had a direct
view of them from an elevated position through their window. Although they had no
field-glasses, there was the zoom facility on the TV camera. The radio was by then
working again and although reception was difficult due to crowd noise and possibly
excessive air traffic on channel 25, attempts could have been made to alert officers
on the perimeter track to watch for overcrowding and report their observations.
In the event, pens 3 and 4 became more and more crowded, surges took place, fans
were showing and signalling distress. None of this was seen or recognised in the
control room.

245. The 20 officers detailed to the perimeter track were distributed round the pitch so
that some five officers were at the west end. Their written instructions made no
reference to the avoidance or detection of overcrowding. The same applied to the
officers in the west stand. Mr Greenwood admitted that his oral briefings also
contained no mention of monitoring the pens for overcrowding.

246. The Operational Order for 1988 had instructed officers to forbid anyone "access
to the track from the terraces without the consent of a senior officer (except to receive
medical attention)". At the end of the 1988 semi-final, there was a minor pitch
invasion. Accordingly, that prohibition was emphasised in the 1989 Operational Order
by being put into capital leters. The combination of no instructions as to overcrowding
and a strong prohibition on opening the gates was likely to make police recognition of
crushing slow and their response reluctant. Small wonder that the growing pressure
and congestion between 2.50 pm and 2.59 pm went unheeded or certainly
j                  *Stv

    (''UUit-f f '[it* * * *
unremedied. Even when officers recognised there was a problem, the rule required
consent of a senior officer before a gate could be opened.

247. "Senior officer" meant an officer of Inspector rank or higher. The Inspector in
charge of the 20 officers on the track was Mr Darling. He stationed himself by the
players' tunnel, the most central position for supervising his men. In evidence he said:

"I would only take action if I thought crowding had got to such a stage that the fans
were in danger. I'd then inform ground control and I would expect someone deployed
to the back of the stand."

That underlines the inhibition against opening perimeter gates. So did the evidence of
one Constable who said it had been so drummed into officers not to open the gates
that when he saw distress in pen 4, he "debated" with himself before opening the
gate, thinking: "If I'm wrong, I'm going to get a right bollocking for this". Naturally, one
would hope that common sense and humanity would make some officers cut through
the rules and open a gate if fans were clearly in distress.

248. This is what happened, but not until officers recognised the distress and even
then not immediately. Hence, gates 3 and 4, having been opened, were shut again
before they were finally opened and at first those seeking to climb out over the fence
were pushed back. This reaction of the police did not go on for as long as some
witnesses believed.     They probably misinterpreted the hand movements from
Mr Greenwood and others aimed at persuading fans to move back and relieve the
pressure as attempts to stop those climbing out at the front.

249. Nevertheless, there was a period during which the failure to recognise the
problem and the inhibition against tackling it caused vital time to be lost.


Lord Justice Taylor - Interim Report Recommendation 27

27. The Operational Order for each match at a designated stadium and the
pre-match briefing of all officers on duty there should alert such officers to the
importance of preventing any overcrowding and, if any is detected, of taking
appropriate steps to remedy it.


Lord Justice Taylor - Final Report

204. It is convenient to mention a modification I think sensible regarding interim
recommendation 5. That provided:-

.. * 5. At each match, there should be on the perimeter track, for each self-contained
pen or other terraced area, a steward (if the club is monitoring that area) or a police
officer (if the police are monitoring it) whose sole duty is to check crowd conditions in
that area for possible overcrowding or distress throughout the period the area is
occupied by spectators. Whoever is so appointed should be in addition to any other
steward or police presence. He should have ready access to the police officer
authorised under Recommendation 9 below, and by radio to the control room."

I repeat that recommendation (with a slight change of working to achieve clarity)
but qualify it to avoid absurdity when numbers are small. The recommendation
need not be applied to any self-contained pen or other standing area where the
spectators present, or reasonably to be expected, during a particular match do
not exceed one third of the area's maximum permitted capacity, or 2,000,
whichever is the lower.


Lord Justice Taylor - Recommendations 11,12 and 16

11. There should be a written statement of intent, agreed between the club and the
police, setting out their respective functions as to crowd safety and control and in
particular as to the filling of each self-contained pen or other standing area and the
monitoring of spectators in each such pen or area to avoid overcrowding.
Any variation of the document in respect of an individual match should agreed in
writing in advance.

12.(a) At each match, there should be on the perimeter track, for each self-contained
pen or other standing area (subject to (b) below), a steward (if the club is monitoring
that area) or a police officer (if the police are monitoring it) whose sole duty is to check
crowd conditions in that area for possible overcrowding or distress throughout the
period the area is occupied by spectators. Whoever is so appointed should be in
addition to any other steward or police presence. He should have ready access to a
police officer who can authorise access through gates to the pitch under
Recommendation 20 below.

16. All police officers and stewards with duties in relation to the standing areas and
especially those with duties under Recommendation 12 above, should be fully briefed
and trained with regard to the recognition of crowd densities, to the recognition of
signs of distress and to crowd dynamics. Training should include demonstrations at
the ground and photographs, designed to enable stewards and officers to recognise
different crowd densities.

Q. That being so, the likelihood was, was it not, that fans
   coming in through A-G would most naturally gravitate towards
   that central tunnel? - A. Provided they liked to watch the
   game from the rear of the goal, yes sir.

Q. But not only that, it was the only obvious way in to the
   terracing because there was no sign at all to the left,
   indeed there was a wall with an opening in but no sign
   whatever and to the right there was a sign but it was a
   considerable distance away and frankly invisible unless
   you really looked hard? - A.Yes, that is the situation.

Q. That is a fair description, is it not? - A. Yes, that is
   a fair description.

Q. Therefore surely anyone coming in would naturally, as I
   say, gravitate towards that central tunnel whether or not
   he wanted to go directly behind the goal? - A. Yes, I
   think that is a fair assessment.

O. That being so, was there not an obvious potential problem
   of overcrowding in those central pens unless some steps
   were taken as part of the plan to ensure that people were
   directed away from those central pens should they become
   full? - A. I don't accept that sir. I think the situation
   is that people would enter the ground there and ordinarily
   assess the situation. This is my perception. They would
   assess the situation and if they chose to go into a position
   behind the goal then they would go down the tunnel. If.
   they went down the tunnel and it was an area that did not
   suit them they had got two opportunities to either (a)
   return from the direction they came or move to either side
   along the back of the wall of the West Stand.

Q. Provided those gangways were kept clear at the back to
   enable them to get through to move from side to side and
   provided that there weren't people coming down the tunnel
   behind them to make it difficult for them to turn round
   and go back? - A. Yes sir, you must bear in iaind these
   people that are coming are football fans who are accustomed
   to football grounds and the peculiarities of football grounds.

Q.   Well did you not appreciate that the vast majority of those
     fans v/ould be fans who were used to Anfield where they go
     through on to an area of terracing which has no penning
     and thus they can go down the middle and fan out all over
     the .... A. Can I make the point sir?     Liverpool played
     at Hillsborough last year and had the same accommodation'
     and as I understand it they had the same accommodation
     this year at a league match so it was not new to them;.

Q.    Thatmay be but you would expect them to remember in
     detail a year after? - A. Sir, I think that football fans
     I would think are of such a nature that they know the
     ground sufficiently to know the spots where they want to
     go and these fans it is their third visit in twelve months.

                                   That sounds like a recipe for disaster, Chief Superintendent,

                              n       It presumably must have occurred to you to ask yourself
                                      why" that was happening. - A. I was surpnsea m one
                                      raspect.
                              o       This was a PC acting contrary to instructions. - A. Well
                    B                 not so much that. He wasn't acting contrary to
                                      not

                                      I am obliged. So it occurred to you that if the Police
                              Q.      Officer was doing that it was likely to be because it was
                                      l i j w u . or diStlcoltie.. - A. The 0t4ec says that ne
                                      should ask for an instruction from a senior Orricer. I
                                      wanted to know why he had opened it because ne nad noc
                                      asked for permission.
                                      Exactly so there must have been some sort of emergency to
                              Q.      *a*e him do it m ustn't there? - A. Not necessarily a.

                                  o     But shortly thereafter you have an increased trauic on

put this to you - could not see through the           tunnel.
They could not see what the position was on           the terracing
unless they were told to go down and have a           look and if
necessary do something about it.   A.   Are           you meaning
Police Officers, sir?

Yes  I am.   A.   Police Officers, sir, who work that
area can act on their own initiative and assess the
situation.

It is not much of a controller who does not do anything
to control when he can see   something happening, is it?
A.   What are you s uggesting that I am seeing?

What I am suggesting that you are seeing is something
going wrong on the terracing.    A.   I have just said,
sir, I did  not see anything going wrong onthe terracing.

You     did. You saw people climbing over the fence.
A.   No, let me take it back a stage.      I didn't see
anything untoward on the terracing and when the gate
was  opened I could not understand why.

You   needed to   find out.   A.   Yes.

And one thing that   should have occurred to you, and I would
suggest it must have occurred to you, was, this could be
o ve rcrowding - people trying to get out for safety reasons;
right?     Or did that not occur to you?    A.   that did not
occur, sir.

It did not occur to you at all?         Not even as a possibility?
A.        Itâ is a possibility.   What I am saying is that on
that particular occasion I was looking and I saw the
O f f i c e r open the gate and I wondered why.

Did it' n o t occur t o 'you for one moment that it'was' a .
possibility ---       A.    It could have been- a possibility ---

  0 f overcrowding.      A.   It could have been a possibility
of overcrowding.

If it was overcrowding, the one thing you must do and do
quickly is to stop anyone else going down-that central
tunnel to add to the overcorwding - right?   A.  Yes, sir.

And the only way you can do that is by directing Police
Officers to go and do something to block off that tunnel
and to go down the tunnel and get people out if necessary.
 '   j am not aware, sir, that that tunnel was still
filling at that point.

 But you could see it was from the video, if you had bothered
 to look, because you could see people still coming in.
 A.   Is that a fact, that the tunnel was filling when that
                                                                                      58

                                                                                                          D.   G.   DUCKENFIELD



                                    gate was open?

                           Q.       I am sorry?                               A.   Is that a fact,   that the tunnel - â

                           Q. People were still coming in and were still able to go
                              down that tunnel because no-one had taken any steps to block
                              it off.    A.  Well, I wasn't aware of the fact that the
                              tunnel *was filling with spectators.   I was looking at the
                    B
                                    gate .

                           Q        All I am suggesting is that the one thing you should do
                                    is to take some steps to ensure that no-one c a n - no-one extra
                                    can ao down that tunnel and people should be hoiked out,
                                    if possible, to relieve the situation if it was overcrowding.
                                    A.   If that tunnel was overcrowded, as you say ---

                           Q        Not the tunnel, the terracing.              A.  If the terracing was
                                    o v e r c r o w d e d , as you say, then reasonable people going
                                    down that tunnel would surely turn round and walk back.

                           Q        Chief Superintendent, you had the possibility of a
                                    disaster on your hands as things turned out.   You had
                                    the possibiliity of overcrowding.   You have a football
                     D              match that has just started and that will encourage
                                    people to come down and get to see it, will it not.
                                    A.                It w i l l .

                            Q. And unless you take some steps - and by "you" I mean
                               the Police - take some steps to control things and ensure
                               neoole do not come down, you have the potentiality of
                               a are at disaster, do you not?    A.   Difficulties can
                               be experienced but there were Officers and stewards in
                               that area and reasona bl e people would not go down there
                               and push;       they would turn and walk out.

                            Q       And that is why you did nothing, is it,, because you thought
                                    that there was nothing that needed to be done?              A.   I .am
                           -â¢       not s a y r n q ri -di-d- nothing. :I did; not receive any information

                                     initially to cause                             concern.

                               Q     Anyway, w h e n y o u saw people coming out, you presumably
                                     wanted to get some i nf ormation from someone as it were
                                     nearer the scene?       A.   Yes, sir.

                               Q     Did youradio to any Officer on the                                 perimeter.   A.    I
                                     believe a radio message was passed,                                sir, but there was
                                         no r e s p o n s e .

                               Q. So what did you do?                                  A.      Chief Inspector â

Q. I don't know to what extent you have heard the evidence given
   so far or read it. but are you aware that spectators who were
   in the ground at 2-40 felt uncomfortably packed and were
   somewhat apprehensive? - A. no, sir.

Q.   2.45? - A. I was not aware of that.

Q. 2.45? - A. I have not seen any statements from witnesses.

Q. On your understanding today, from what you have been told,
   when do you think was the first time that people began to be
   fearful, began to feel pain, feel themselves crushed? - A. I
   don't know, sir.  I can't assess that.

Q. You have never tried to find out? - A. No. sir.        Are you
   suggesting since the Inquiry started?

Q.   Yes. - A. My role since the Inquiry started has been to remain
     detached.

G. Well, before.  I don't mean since a     fortnight    ago. Since the
   incident at Hillsborough? - A. No.      Since the    incident ar
   Hillsborough I have played no part      whatsoever   in making any
   enquiries at all.   I have remained     completely   detached.

Q. If it turns out that people were indeed being crushed before
   gate C was opened, it would rather look as though your own
   assessment of the terrace was in error? - A. Is that the
   accurate situation, sir?

Q. We donât know what facts the Tribunal will find; we only know
   at the moment what people say, although indeed I have to say
   their evidence has not been generally challenged. - A. I can
   only relate to what I saw, and as far as I am concerned,
   looking through the control box window at the crowd prior to
   the gates opening on the perimeter track.there did not appear
   to be a difficulty.                   '       .. . - . ~

Q. So if in- fact, people were being crushed and were ffea"rful:.~
   before the gates were opened, it looks as though your own
   assessment may have been in error? - A. You have got to accept
   my position and where I was standing. My assessment, I would
   suggest, is correct, because I did not see it, and that is my
   perception of the situation.

Q. One young lady who was standing on the Spion Kop looking
   directly at the terraces, said that at 2.45 the pens 3 and 4
   were overcrowded. - A. May I suggest, sir, that from possibly
   150 yards away that is a very good assessment if it is
   accurate.
Q. So what it comes to is this, is it, that by 2.49, 2.50, there
   was little doubt in your mind that even though the two pens
   were not overcrowded they were getting on to being nearly
   full.  Is that correct? - A. I would anticipate that, sir,
   leading up to the kick-off.
                                                                    49

                                                  D.G. DUCKENFIELD


Q. Not anticipate.  It is what you saw:. - A. no, I would say they
   were filling, sir, but accurately the assessment, I can't give
   it.
0. Mr. Duckenfield, you saw the terraces at 2.45, 2.50. Was it
   not your perception that even if the centre pens were not over
   full' they were getting on for being full? - A. I would say
   they were getting on for being full.

Q. Now, bearing in mind that the capacity of those pens is 1,000
   and 1.200 apiece, getting on for being full means there will
   be what, room for 100 more in each pen, 200 more in each pen?
   - A. I canât be specific, sir. You are asking me to look at a
   situation and count numbers.

Q. No. I am not asking you to be specific. That is why I am
   putting it broadly.   90% full: would that be what they were?
   - A. No. sir. what I would say is this.   I looked at the pens
   as I looked at the rest of the ground, and my general
   Dsrcect ion was that the ground was filling and that area was
   filling.   As to how much, whether it be 80%, 90%, I c a n ât say.

Q. Mr. Duckenfield, the trouble is we have got photographs. We
   have seen videos, and it really is not any use you saying
   that.  It is plain, is not it, that by 2.50 the two wing pens
   at the Leppings Lane end were pretty empty, whereas the two
   centre pens, if you wonât have them as full, were getting on
   for being full? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. You agree with that?     It must, therefore, nave been very
   important to ensure that there was no further crowding of pens
   3 and 4 ? - A . That there were not more than the number to fit
   in comfortably be allowed into those pens?

Q. Yes, and another 100 or so even on your perception would have
   putâthose pens at full? - A. You are quoting numbers, sir- I
   w o u l d s a y they- were approaching being full*

Q. Yes. Therefore: they had reached on your view a critical'-stage
   in crowd control.. There was going to come a time shortly when
   somebody would have to cut off the inflow into those pens? -
   A. Yes, sir.
Q   And that in your view was the responsibility of the club
    stewards? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. You did not, of course, know in the control room whether at
   that stage there were any stewards at the front of the tunnel?
   - A. Yes, sir.

Q. You did or did not know? - A. I did not know. sir.

G. A request was made to you at 2.49 by an obviously agitated and
   very concerned experienced Superintendent for the gate or
   gates to be opened? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. And you very naturally had a number of concerns which we all

    A Sir I think ray reply to that was that these are trainee
    Pol t ce *Officers, they know the situation ana it is my view
    they would report to me if tne re was a di^iculty.

    vour a s s e s s m e n t of whether there was crowding in that partiÂ­
    cular stand depended on your standard of people being cnes,
    to back and shoulder to shoulder. Is that right? - A. ies
    sir.
    You p^sumablv know what is laid down in tne Green Guiae
    as to tâf'e maximum number of people tnat one snoulc nave m
    ten <=Â«uare yards? - A. I am aware there is a rornula in_
        G-een Guide. When I was asked tor the information
    ;Â£S not being specific about the Green Guide, i was giâ 5
    a personal visual view.

    Guide the maximum number of people in ten square ydus,      _
    it ^s paragraph 2 2 2 : "The maximum number o. people snoul-
    be 54 persons per ten square metres"? - A. Yes sir.

 You a^-e not seriously suggesting, are you, that if you put
* 5Â° people ^ ten square metres they will be chest cO c,
  a n d shoulder to shoulder? - A. To be honest, sir, I can â
  visualise that at tne momenu.
       ^    trv and visualise, let's divide it by ten, one
â square yirdT' Do you follow me? - A. Yes sir.

     isn't it, that thesis much greater density at tne front
     than at the back?       - A. Yes sir.

     To              down over   this area, the degree or density m
     d i f f e r e n t parts of the terrace? - A. No sir, it was not
     obvious to me.

      something I would be looking for but it was not immediate y
      obvious to me.

   th e p o s s i b i l i t y of crushing was not a danger w m c h was -n

                          QUESTION                FIVE

Why wasn't the tunnel leading to the central pens closed when they
became full, the procedure adopted at the previous year's Semi-
Final?

The tunnel was not closed as Chief Superintendent Duckenfield did not perceive
overcrowding in pens and that fans entering Gate C would go in direction of tunnel.
Chief Superintendent Duckenfield took no steps to block off or stop people going
down central tunnel.

The fullness and overcrowding in central pens 3 and 4 were not identified by Chief
Superintendent Duckenfield or brought to his attention by any other person,
consequently no instruction to block off or stop fans going down central tunnel.
On giving instructions for the gates to be opened, radio on talk through,
hoped/expected for officers on concourse to take appropriate action to close tunnel.
In 1988 the central tunnel was closed at 2.35 pm, possibly because central pens full.
All fans in at 2.45 pm. However in 1989 different situation and atmosphere.


OBSERVATIONS
Please see pages 53 - 79, Volume 2.


Lord Justice Taylor - Interim Report

231. Planning apart, however, it should have been clear in the control room where
there was a view of the pens and of the crowd at the turnstiles that the tunnel had to
be closed. If orders had been given to that effect when gate C was opened, the fans
could have been directed to the empty areas of the wings and this disaster could still
have been avoided. Failure to give that order was a blunder of the first magnitude.


Lord Justice Taylor - Recommendation 9

9.   Arrangements should be made:-

(a) to limit the number of spectators entering each self-contained pen or area to the
maximum capacity figure assessed in accordance with Recommendation 8 above
either electronically, mechanically, by a ticketing arrangement, by counting or
otherwise, and

(b) to close off further access to such pen or area when its maximum capacity is
about to be reached.

        there in recent years and I was looking at recent history
        and recent history did not indicate that there would be a
        problem t h e r e .

Q. So what you are telling us is that, apart from the^
   c onversation the details of which you cannot recall with
   Superintendent Greenwood, no other steps were taken to
   monitor or to keep au fait with the situation of those
   pens   other than your own observation and those with you
   in the Control Box?    A.   There is no other means of
   monitoring at all because the turnstile counts do not
   register for the pens.

Q       There is an obvious way of monitoring, surely, with respect,
        and that is to have Officers at the back of those pens
        positioned in order to see for themselves, with a specific
        duty in the Operation Order to keep control of the numbers
        noinq into those pens and perhaps to shut the tunnel up
        and block it off when they get filled up.           A.   I make
        the point that Serial 13, who were in the West Stand,
        had many r es po ns ib il it ie s and one of which was looking over
        into that terrace, and they would have monitored that
        situation in addition to any other Officer and had the
        numbers in those pens got to a dangerous level then action
        would have been taken with serials in that concourse,
        Serials 13 and 14 â        14 and 15.

Q. Can you explain, in the light of what you have said, why
   no action was in fact taken by Serial 13 or any Serial 1?
   A.   Because they did not perceive overcrowding in those
        pens.

n       You are saying that they ought to have known that they
        should perceive it, or look for it, are you?   A.  What
        I am saying is that as trained Police Officers, if they
        see difficulties occurring then they will take action in
        respect of those difficulties.

 n       Rut surely you have said to me that there was not any
         other thing that could be done - surely the most obvious
         thina   and I do not know whether you thought of this or
         not   is, as I have said, to have Officers in the back
         available there and ready and able to shut off the tunnel
         should the central pens become too full.    A.  There
         were Officers there, sir.

         There were not.    A.   No, not at that particular point,
    Q
         sir     I take your point about you may consider extra
         Officers at the tunnel but if there was a need to shut off
         that tunnel, then other Officers - Serial 13 or the
         track serials - would point out the difficulties being
         e xperienced to the Control Room and the Control Room
         would then advise the Officers on Serials 14 and 15 to
         take some positive action in the concourse area at the
         back of the West Stand.
                                                                              53

                          Q. And did not get through? - A. And did not get through.

                          Q. Did you ask Mr. Murray to try to contact? -A. No, sir. As I
                             have said earlier there are actions that individuals take of
                             their own accord.
                      B   Q. So you knew then that when you decided the gate should be
                             opened the club did not know that that decision had been made?
                             - A. No, sir.

                          Q. So they were unaware of what was going to happen? - A. Yes,
                             sir.

                          G. So far as the Police were concerned, that is the Police at and
                             about the Leppings Lane concourse, they were not informed in
                             advance, were they, that the gate was going to be opened? - A.
                             No, sir, but we may be able to presume, and as I say I have
                             not seen other Officersâ statements, that bearing in mind the
                             radio is on talk-through so that everybody can hear it, and
                             Superintendent Marshall had made the request for the gates to
                             be opened, and we in turn, that is the control room, gave
                      D      permission for them to be opened, I can only assume that the
                             Officers who were in that location who had personal radios
                             were becoming aware of the developing situation and would
                             respond to it, but I did not give a direct instruction.

                          Q.   What on earth could they be expected to do?   Even assuming
                               they heard the message from Mr. Marshall, now could they be
                               expected to anticipate your response to it or to know what
                               they might be able to do to cater for it? - A. It is
                               difficult.  If they saw people coming in they could direct
                               them, but I can't anticipate their actions.

                          Q.   You see, you knew by now, did you not,      that there werespaces
                              at the. ends of .the terracing but that it was pretty crowded in
                           ." the middle sections? -A. Yes, sir.

                          0 ...-You knew ;that the tunnel, the central tunnel ;â gave    on to those
                               two middle sections? - A. Yes, sir.

                          Q. You knew by now that it was 10-to, after 10-to? â
                             A. Approaching kick-off.

                          Q.   You knew when people got in they were likely to get to their
                               positions in order to watch the match as quickly as possible,
                               because you were getting close to kick-off? - A. Yes, sir,

                          G. You knew, therefore, that they were likely to takethe most
                             obvious route to the terracing? Right? - A. They would take
                             the easiest route, sir, yes.

                          q. And you knew that the easiest route was that cen t r a l t u n n e l ? -
                             A. Sir, at that time you may suggest it was a consideration.
                             At that time my mind was filled with the other events that
                             were taking place.                                    ,          gÂ£

Q        What you are'saying is this, that you did not realise or you
         did not think that when that gate was opened these people
         would go down that central tunnel? -A. Sir, the situation was
         such that when I was asked to make that decision and gave^it,
         my thought
             --- â      processes were all consumed in that and did not. go
            ^ i _ _ â 4
         to the central -1 + â¢Â»1n n Q 1
                            tunnel
              LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Once that flow had started through
Q.
         the gate and vou could see it on the video - we have all seen
         it on the video - was not that a moment at which you might
         have -iven some instructions to the Officers on the concourse .
         to try and direct this flow, after you had made your decision?
         - a . Yes, I might have done, my Lord, but I did not.

              MR COLLINS:    Why not? - A. Because I was busy watching
Q.
         the events and the thought at that stage did not cross my raina
         to issue an instruction.

Q
         Did it occur to you at any time that if a large number Oj.
         oeoDle went down that central tunnel they would .be likely to
         come out straight into pens 3 and A and cause overcrowding m
         those pens'? - A. Yes, there was that possibility, but tnere is
         a point here, ands I respect what you are saying. We nave cut
         off the sequence of events as though when I issue the
         instruction to open that gate that that is the ceasing or tne
         problem.
         I am not intending to.   I am simply trying to see what was in
Q
         youT' mind, whether you thought or this possibility r - A. On
         the one hand if we cut off the sequence or events as tnougn
         the order to open the gates is the finality or it, ana tnen;
         "Why didn't you do this, this and this?â , if we go further m
         mv statement it shows that the situation is still developing
         in a crisis situation and I have not got the time to address
         the problems which people may see here have to be addressed.

â q      Can i I' h'oce, cut it fairly this way, that the fact o f 'the _ â 
    ' ' matter Is that there were no preparations jnade and no specific
        warnings given either to stewards, or .to Officers. that that
        sate was going to be opened? That as a matter of fact
        happened? Right? - A. I gave no specitic instructions.

          You gave no specific instructions.  It did not occur to you
â Q.
          that one of the consequences of opening the gate would be to
          cause a lot of people to go down that central tunnel and
          create overcrowding? - A. I was aware of the possibilities,
          but I must add we have got to add on the next development
          which takes my mind away.
          just before we come to that, can I say the fact of the matter
    Q.
              there were no preparations, but you say you simply were
          not able in the circumstances to do anything about it because
          of the pressure of time and the pressure of circumstances' -
          A That is it, sir. I think it will come out if I can go to.
          ths nGXt      .                                   "*      0

that at that stage the developing situation within the
ground had gone to a situation when I had lost the option.

So what you are saying is that what you believed at the
time you made your statement, and presumably at the time
you made your decision, was the teams coming out may in
hindsight not have been. - A. No, it may have been coming
out for a fcick-about as you say.

And therefore you may in fact have been earlier, or it may
have been at a time earlier than 2.54. It must have been
at a time earlier than 2.54. - A. Yes.

Coming back to page 10 ....

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   If that was right and the
teams had their kick-about and went back off again, the
ootion would have reappearad. - A. To delay the kick-off
sir, yes.
     MR. COLLINS:   But by than, having regard to the
evidence you gave earlier this morning, the events you
told us about effectively made it impossible for you to
come to that decision you are saying. - A. Yes.

That is the breakdown of communications .... - A. My
perceotion is breakdown in communications, worsening
situation, 2 .47 -ish decide co take some action, think
about delaying the kick-off, players out, straight into
the crisis of 2.47.
Now you then you tell us watch the Leppings Lane terrace
incently- for developments resulting from the gates
opening.   - A. Yes sir.
When you- matched that were    you aware   of a surge inEo tnose
central pens?   '~   A. No sir.

I think that there clearly     was such a surge.   You didn't
see it though. - A. No^
Was it not clear from what   you could      see, becausethe
video was still running presumably. -      A. Yes.

 And you were keeping one eye on tnat I imagine from i_ime to
 time. You c o u W see people pouring in still, and you
 could see them going towards that central tunnel couldn't
 vou? - A. I can only refer to the compilation video I
 have just seen, and the compilation vidao doesn't indicate
 they were pouring towards the central Lunnel.

 With respect Chief Superintendent, to anyone who knows the
 geography it is clear beyond any peradventure that that
                                                                56

                                                                                                       D.G. DUCKENFIELD



                                   was where they were flowing isn't it? And you did scnow
                                   the gsograohy.   - A. When I saw the compilation I saw
                                   p=ool<3 walking in, orderly, not rushing, not charging
                                   towards a particular point, and that was my perception or
                                   the situation.
                          B
                                 Buc they were all flowing, if you look: at the video, ip a
                              Q. direction which to anyone who knows the ground is in the
                                   direction of the tunnel weren't they? Of course there
                                   wer= one or two who were peeling off in other directions
                                   but~the vast bulk was going in the direction of the tunnel
                                   wasn't it. - A. I didn't perceive that situation sir.
                          C   0     But if vou were awara of the geography of the ground you
                                    must hava orceived it. - A. I looked at the compilation
                                    and I was surprised to see that people were walxing, and
                                    the directions they were going.

                              0     Don'" believe everything vou read in the papers!  But the
                                    direction they were going was clearly in the direction o-
                          D         that tunnel wasn't it? - A. That is not my beliec sir.

                              0     Where did you think they were going? - A. My concern was
                                    that they wprÂ» coming into the ground and I saw tnem
                                    wal.cing in what I thought was the general directions, ana
                                    some were going through tnat gateway in tne wall.

                                    L=t hip out: at least this: you were aware that because a
                          E         i^rg* number of people     had come in in a short space cc
                                    time that" there might be a problem if they went down into
                                    t-hose centre pens. -      A. There is a problem in any pea
                                    when a large number of     people come in. !

                                    But particularly those centre pens. ---.-A. There coula be a

     respect of the dangers of doing that, namely that people would
     come in with missiles and drink? - A. Yes. sir.

0. Just stopping   there for a moment, what concerns me is this.
   We have heard   a lot of evidence from people who entered the
   ground early,   2 o'clock, 1.30, 1.45. They were all searched,
   and of course   searching is a time consuming exercise, is not
   it? - A. Yes.   sir.

Q. You are not suggesting, are you, that at from 2.45 onwards
   with a massive crowd outside waiting to get in. it was
   contemplated that everybody coming into the ground would be
   searched for missiles or alcohol? - A. The situation at that
   stage, sir, was such that it would not be possible.

0. Exactly. So whether the gate was opened or whether the gate
   was not opened, the same problem would arise in relation to
   drink and missiles? - A. no, sir.  If people were going
   through the turnstiles they would be passing Police Officers
   who, whilst they may not stop them and search them d i r ectly,
   would have a visual view, or a view of them going through the
   turnstiles, and they would not if the gate was opened.

Q. Mr. Duckenfield, with great respect, people don't usually
   carry offensive weapons into a football ground in their hand
   in full view of a Police officer, do they? - A. No. but you
   can see if they have anything sticking out of their pocket
   like a billiard ball or a beer can.

0. Yes. all right.  Let us accept that for a moment.  In addition
   to the problems you have just outlined and which you properly
   took into account, in favour of opening the gate was the
   danger to the crowd outside of being killed? - A. Yes, sir.

Q.   Which you had been warned about.   Did you or did you not have
     at the forefront of your mind in addition .to missiles and beer
     that, the incoming fans if the gates were opened would or might
     get on to the terrace that was already nearly full? - A. It
     did not specifically cross my mind.   I knew."they -were going to
     enter the terrace as a whole.

Q. Since you knew from your own inspection that there were no
   warning signs and no directional signs leading to the two wing
   pens, and since you knew that the tunnel was directly in front
   of the gate, did it not occur to you that the one thing that
   was essential if the gates were to be opened was to have
   people directing fans to the wing pens? - A. Yes, sir. but I-
   made the point that other agencies who have a responsibility
   for the ground and had not seen the lack of signing or
   foreseen difficulties of this nature, and I had to accept the
   ground as it was.

G. Yes, that is quite right. You could not rush and put signs up
   yourself, but when you police an operation you take a ground
   as you find it? - A. Yes, sir.

0. There were no signs.     Therefore if as you say it was in your
                                                                  60

    mind that people were to be directed away from the centre
    pens, that could only have been done by stewarding? - A. Yes,
    sir.

Q. The stewards, of course, the Sheffield Wednesday Football
   Club, would not have anticipated that gate C would be opened
   10 minutes before the kick-off. would they? - A. No. sir. but
   the stewards in that locality would be aware of the developing
   situation.

0. Well, that is what I had better ask you about. Unless they
  ' were told how would they know? - A. I presume anyone in the
    concourse area at that time would be aware of the situation
    outside.

Q. Why would somebody in the concourse area be aware that
   somebody outside might be crushed to death against the outer
   wall? - a . Those coming through the turnstiles may have a view
   and express that view.

Q       That is a fair answer. How would those in the concourse know
        that one of the options being considered by the Police was the
        opening of gate C? - A. Who in particular, sir? Do you mean
        the stewards?

G. The stewards.  The.chief steward, the man in charge of the
   stewards from Sheffield Wednesday Football Club? - A.
   Superintendent Murray tried via his personal radio' link with
   Sheffield Wednesday Football Club to get in touch with Mr.
   Locke, the chief steward. Unfortunately, he was unable to do
   so.
Q       Are you saying that before the gate was opened Superintendent
        Murray tried to warn the chief steward to get stewards on to
        the tunnel? - A. Superintendent Murray spoke or tried to-speak
        with m.r.. Locke, The specific time I can't be certain, but .,
        certainly at this particular moment of crisis .     - :;       â¢

         .   LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I am sorry. When you-had'made the
        decision you were going to allow the gate to be opened, or
        when? - A. About that time, my Lord.   I can't be accurate. I
        know he spoke.
Q. What I would like to know is. if he had managed to get through
   to Mr. Locke, what as you understood it was he going to say to
   him? That "We are going to open the gateâ , or "We are
   considering opening the gate"? - A . That we were considering
   opening the gate, because I understand an incident had
   happened previously where the Police had taken a course ot
   action and not informed the club, and the club wanted to know
   about it. So Mr. Murray, of his own accord, tried to make
   contact with the club.

q   _        MR. HYTNER:   You see, you appreciate, Mr. Duckenfield,
        so far I have not made any criticism of the decision to open
        the gate, nor am i going to make any criticism of that
        decision   There may be criticism of the situation that led to
                                                                    01

    the opening of thegate, but that is a different matter.   Once
    you had had the request made it must have been obvious to you,
    that is at 2.49. it must have been obvious to you, must nor
    it. that one of the dangers of opening the gate was people
    swarming into the already almost full terrace? - A. As I said
    earlier, sir, the decision I was asked to make and the opening
    of the gates was such that I was concentrating upon that, and
    I did not issue a directive about the tunnel.

Q. But this is the whole point, is not it? You have said that
   every decision you made on that day was a correct one. You
   may not have been thinking about the tunnel. What I have to
   put to you is that it was a plain error not to have considered
   the tunnel, and as it turned out a fatal error? - A. I
   consider, sir, that at the time I was faced with a very
   difficult ;situation.   I made a decision and I did not
   follow it up with a direct instruction, but as I said
   earlier, the radio was on talk-through. Police Officers
   were patrolling the concourse area and I would hope
   there were stewards in that concourse area, and whilst
   I did not issue a specific directive. Police Officers
   are trained to act on their initiative, and I would
   have hoped they would have taken some action at the
   tunnel j
Q. Let us just deal with you first. Everybody here sympathises
   with you, I am sure, in having been put into an emergency
   situation.  It would be a harsh person, indeed, who did not
   have that sympathy. What is being put to you is this, Mr.
  .Duckenfield. that in dealing with that emergency you took into
   account very properly some factors, but having made your
   decision, which was probably the right one, you completely
   forgot to deal with one of the foreseeable consequences of
   your decision? - A. In view of making the decision, sir, I did
   not follow it up. but there are Officers in that area who I
   would have hoped would have taken a course of action.

0. That i s :a different matter which I will come to. The fact
 â  that you may hope, and expect that others will remedy your own    ;
   error"is a separate issue, but, Mr. Duckenfield, can you face
   this problem? You made a mistake in forgetting this
   consequence, foreseeable consequence, of making your decision
   to open the gate? - A. Sir, I didnât issue a direct
   instruction to close that tunnel.

Q   But that was an error, was not it? - A. Sir, it was a moment
    of crisis, and I was dealing with a difficult situation.

0. That is accept, but it was a mistake., an error, an omission,
   to have forgotten to give an instruction to close off the
   tunnel? - A. Sir, I am not wishing to evade the issue.   I
   have said I did not give an instruction. There are many
   occasions as a Commander you give instructions and you
   expect others to take a course of action.   I am not
   moving that responsibility whatsoever. All I am saying
   is I did not issue an instruction.

                                                               62

                     Q. I am sorry to have to press you, and I really am sorry, but it
                        has to be got clear what you are saying. There are two wholly
                        different ways of putting this, Mr. Duckenfield. One is, "I
                        did not give the instruction because I was entitled to expect
                        O f f i c e r s on the ground to take the initiative to do what is
                        SUggested. Therefore I did not make a mistake". The other
                        way of putting it is, "I made a mistake but in fact other
                  -p    Officers should have remedied that mistake by using their
                        initiative". Now. which of them is it? - A. The latter, sir.

                       Q. You made a mistake but you would have hoped that others would
                          remedy it? - A. Yes.
                       Q   Well, that at least is very frank, and I am sorry to have
                           pressed you to that answer, but it was my duty to do so. Mr.
                           Duckenfield.

                       I ought I think to follow it up by asking you about
                       Officers on the ground in fairness to them. You, having
                       forgotten to give that instruction, are you saying that
                       either an Inspector in the concourse or individual
                       Officers with their personal radios should have realised
             B         what was happening and raced to the tunnel? - A. Yes, I
                       would have expected that they would t a o a course of
                       action.

                  Q. We know that there was one steward in the concourse, we
                       see him on the video, but he was near gate C. Are you
                       saying that you would have expected the information that
                       the gats was being opened to have been relayed
                       sufficiently to the stewards that they would .<now to go to
                       the tunnel? - A. Because we couldn't contact Mr. Locke
                       the only means of contact would have been verbal contact
                       between"* the Police Officers and the steward.

                  Q. This was an appalling breakdown in comiT'.unication wasn't
                     it, that the Police couldn't get hold of the chief steward
                     at a critical time.   Do you know why the Police couldn't
             D       get hold ot Mr. Locke? - A. I don'c sir.

                  Q. The whole point of having the, Ithink he is called the
                     chief security officer, and the Police on the ground is
                     that they liaise together don't they?   - A. Yes sir.

                  Q. How would those in the concourse have known the state of
                     packing of pens 3 and 4? - A. Police Officers or
                     stewards sir.

                  Q. Both?            - A. Police Officers would be looking, serial 13
                       from the too of the West Stand, for activity there and
                       they w o u l d monitor it there, but as I have said the
                       s t e w a r d ' . s responsibility, which is the prime-. â¢
                       responsibility /. I c a n 'c be categoric how- they would;d o it;'
                       other than looking.

                  Q. Were the Officers in the stand, who I accept should have
                     seen the state of overcrowding, were they under any orders
                     to pass on by personal radio their assessment of crowding
                     in "the oens? - A. Sir specific instructions would have
                     been given to chose people by Superintendent Greenwood,
                     and I would expect them, as trained Police Officers, and
                     trained in crowd control, to assess the situation and ii
                     they saw a difficulty relay that back.

                  Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   But short of eithec the
                       Officers or the stewards on the concourse, assuming there
                       were Officers and stewards on the concourse, short of
                       their being told, "Pens 3 and 4 a r e getting to be nearly
                       full" bow would they know? - A. They wouldn't sir.

                                 of supporters walked - because they did wal<, they didn't
                                 rush -"through the tunnel and into the overcrowded pens,
                                 it is fairyland to suppose that they could turn back when
                                 they saw the overcrowded terraces and push their way back
                     B           with everybody pushing forward.     A. I don't know what
                                 the situation was sir.

                         Q. Well you know crowds don't you?          -   A. Yes.

                         Q. If there is a crowd moving forward down a tunnel ....
                            A. There is a possibility oÂ£ a difficulty as you say.

                         Q. I only have to put that to you you see because in your
                            answers to Mr. Collins you suggested otherwise, and I have
                            to out to you that you have given wholly unrealistic
                            assessments of how people can behave in this sort of
                            situation.  I am not going to go over the territory
                            already trodden by Mr. Collins, I'm sure you will be
                            relieved to know, I just want to see how the matter is
                            summarised. You didn't really appreciate until far too
                     D      late that there was real trouble on the terraces did you?
                               A. Do you mean prior to the stopping of the game sir?

                         Q. Yes.       -   A.   From my visual inspection I wasn't aware sir.

                         Q. You see a pitch invasion is a term of art, we all ,<now
                            what it means.  It is fans deliberately getting out of the
                            terraces and invading the pitch for a purpose, either to
                            spoil the game, or to abuse the referee, or to go for an
                            opposing player with whom they are displeased, or
                            occasionally to invade properly to get to the other end to
                            get at the opposing fans. That is a pitch invasion isn't
                            it? - A. Yes sir.

                         Q. You are well aware of that.          -   A. Yes sir.

                         Q. This was the beginning of the game. There was no incident
                            on the field that could have provoked anger among the fans
                            and above all the fans never got on to the pitch. How
                            could it possibly have been interpreted as a pitch
                            invasion?" - A. Sir my view from the Control Box was such
                            that there was no abnormality and I questioned in my mind
                            why the gate was opened.

                         Q. Well that is a separate thing. You are now going back to
                            the very beginning. What I have to ask you about that is
                            this: that knowing full well that you had just given
                            orders to ooen the gate, and they could be called the
                            f l o o d g a t e s a n d knowing full well that the tunnel was very
                            much in line with the gate, and knowing that the pens were
                            nearly full, again it only would take a child of less than
                            average intelligence to say, "Well if that has all


                                                                                                   bb

     happened and people are spilling out of the front of the
     crowd it is because people have crowded into the pens at
     the rear. There is overcrowding in the pens." That is
     right isn't it? - A. That is your suggestion sir. It
     wasn't my perception.   I didn't see any pushing.  I saw a
     state of normality and the gate opened.

Q. But it must be obvious mustn't it that it the gate was
   opened and then people were climbing over thefences that
   what has happened is that there has been no stopping the
   fans getting into the back of the pans. - A. There has
   been no stopping, yes sir.

Q.   And when the fans don't go on the pitch but stand
     docilely on the track and wal.c around in a dazed fashion
     the one thing it plainly wasn't was a pitch invasion.
     A. No it wasn't at that stage sir.

Q. It clearly wasn't was it?        -   A. No sir.

Q. You see today you have said rather frankly that at some
   stage you realised it wasn't a pitch invasion, but in your
   statement at page 12 you said this:

               "The Assistant Chief Constable (Operations)
               Mr. Jackson, joined me in the Control Box
               and as<ed for an appraisal of the situation.
               I was unable to give an accurate account of
               what the situation was other than a possible
               pitch invasion which had resulted in us
               stopping the game."

     CQow that is after the match had been abandoned, or at
     least after the game had been stopped. You still thought,
     and so:told yaur Assistant Chief Constable, that'it'was a
     possible 1 pitch invasion.  - A. In fairness ,' â
                                                     sir ,'the' term
     "'oitch invasion 1 was used to describe a crowd coming'out of
     the gate on to the perimeter track.

Q. And it still had not dawned on you that they had spilled
   on to the track and climbed the fence because of possible
   overcrowding as a result of opening the gate. - A. It
   was a possibility sir, but at that stage I was waiting for
   information.

Q. And lastly, can you explain a mysterious message, of which
   we have only heard so far from Mr. Collins in his opening
   speech, but no doubt we will hear more in due course, at
   fourteen minutes past three the Police told the Fire
   Brigade that fans had broken down or broken through a gate
   and that was the cause of a major incident.  I have to
   speak from memory but I think those are broadly the words.
      A. Can vou tell me where that came from?


                                                                        86

                        Cross-Examined bv MR. HYTNER:

Q. Sergeant, in the course of duties, particularly in crowd
   control and in other emergencies you are accustomed to
   receiving orders as it were on the ground and obeying them? -
   A. That is correct, sir.
Q        If at something like 2.40 or 2.45 or 2.50, at any of those
         times, if you had received a message, "Pens 3 and 4 are full.
         Pens 1, 2 and 5 are virtually empty. Get spectators
         diverted" what would you have done'.'' - A. I would have acted
         on instructions, but I donât think that is my responsibility
         inside the ground.
0        That may well be, but supposing you as a Sergeant were there
         and there were just stewards without a chief steward there and
         you received that order? Suppose control had sent you the
         order "Pens 3 and A are full.   It is dangerous to have any
         more in.  Make sure the crowds are diverted to the wing pensâ ,
         what would you actually have done? - A. I would have acted on
         instructions, sir, like I said.

Q. And what would you have done? - A.          I wouldhave tried to get
   them in the pens either side.

G. Can we see it a little more practically.  In the area between
   the turnstiles and the stand wall there was you, your serial
   and some stewards? - A. There were not any stewards apar^ from
   the bottom of the stairs to the West Stand, and ofcourse
   there was one steward on gate C.

Q. I was thinking of him because we saw him on the video. There
       -+. loast him was not there? - A. Yes, and there was
   someone selling programmes either side, one up at the side of
   the wall, and one beside gate C selling programmes.

         Can we just examine this.   I am sorry to take a little time
G    .
         but it is very important.   It may well be that you are rignt,
         although there is some conflict of evidence, but it may well
         be you are right in saying that the position of the crowd into
         the various pens was nothing whatever to do with you    Let_s
         suppose that is right and it was the responsibility then or
         the stewards.   Is this the position, that when pens 3 and 4
         had been observed to be full from the ground side because
         that is only where they can be observed, what could anybody
         hav^ done about it if it was not your responsibility and
         there were no stewards in the area? - A. In answer to that
         question they could have been deviated or diverted to the
          flanks at the rear of the West Stand.
          By whom? - A. I suppose the Police Officers if they were
    G.
          there.
    o     This is what I am really trying to get at. Somebody, and it
          will presumably be somebody in control, somebody in control
          has observed or has been told at 2.40 or 2.45 that the centre

                                                                      69,

        pens are full, therefore it is necessary to divert fans to the
        wing pens.     If it is not the responsibility of the Police to
        do it and it is not your job, and there were no stewards
        there, what could have been done about it? Are you saying you
        w o u ld then have had to step into the breach? - A. That could
        have been the situation.

0. So far as you were concerned it was not your job, and you
   would have expected somebody else to be doing it? - A. The
   responsibility is the stewards.

Q. And there were none there? - A. There were none on that
   particular bit, yes, apart from the places where X ha\/e
   indicated.
Q       Now, that is that situation.     That is simply a normal crowd
        situation where some pens are full and some are empty. Now we
        come to a wholly different situation. Suppose you had been
        told at 2 .4 7 , a messenger comes running up to you because the
        radios are off, he has just come from control: "Mr.
        Duckenfield is going to open the gates because of the crowd
        outside.   Pens 3 and 4 are full. Make sure the people coming
        in go to the wing pens. This is an emergency". Now, you know
        what the situation was. You know who was there. What would
        you have done? - A. The only thing I could have done in those
        circumstances is form a line-.with what serial I had across the
        top to divert them either side.

Q. Can I help you a little, because this is not a case where
   anyone is trying to trap anybody into an unwary answer. Think
   back and take your time. Would you have said in answer to
   that "If Mr. Duckenfield wants me to do that he must send
   reinforcements", or would you have said, "All right, I can do
   it"? - A That is a difficult question not knowing what the
   situation is outside.   If they said, "There are several
   thousand outside.  They are going to burst in or they are
   going to come through gate C if it is open", I doubt very much
   whatsoever if 10 men could contain several thousand people.   I
   doubt very much if I could have done anything.

Q        You say "What is going to happen?".   "There are hundreds
         outside! and they have got to be let in through the gate.
         Make sure they donât go into pens 3 and 4 . Are you saying
         your answer would have been, perfectly reasonably, that it
         would have been, â1 can't do it with the serial at my
         disposal.  He will have to send me reinforcements"? - A. I am
         not saying that.  If I was instructed to do it I probably
         would have taken my serial up and done it.

    Q    I don't know what briefing you had had, but did you know that
         there were gates at the entrance to the tunnel? - A. There are
         wooden gates, yes.
    q    Obviously there are dangers in closing both those gates_
         because they open towards the turnstiles, and if you haa shut
         them and then there had been a crowd trying to get out of the
         tunnel from the terraces you might not have been able to open

                                                                     70-

          them against the crowd.          Do you follow?     - A. I think it is
          the opposite way.
                    LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      They open towards the pitch.

               MR. HYTNER:    I am sorry, towards           the pitch. - A.   I was
G.
          going to correct you on that, sir.

Q.
          That is right, is not it? - A. Yes, they open towards the
          pitch.
Q         So if there is a crowd coming from the pitch you can't open
          them then very easily? - A. That is correct, and tnerrue haye
          a situation which could have been even more serious than the
          one we had.
a         Certainly   The first thing you can without any difficulty at
          all is close one gate, and that immediately halves the area
          you have to monitor with your serial. That is right   is not
          i + - a I doubt very much if that was going to De the answer.
          It'could have been more difficult and it could have been a
               dangerous situation if we had closed the gates, but there
          m o r e

          again....
 0     No. closing one gate. - A. There is only one gate. It is a
     ' double gate, a wooden gate at the tunnel. There again m a t i-
       for the stewards.  That is not for us.
           Sergeant what we are trying to find out is what could have
 Q
           been done. Are you saying that appreciating the situation at
           the time your view would have been that you would have been
           unable with the serial and the stewards in the area to seal
           off the tunnel and point the fans to the wings wnere there was
           plenty of room? - A. Under those circumstances it would h=ye
           been impossible to deal with a crowd of that size and do wndt
           you are saying.

    Q .
           It is possible?       - A. It is not possible.

    Q. It isn't? - A. I doubt very much.
                 LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   You would not be stopping them
    G.
           eoing into the match at all. All you would be doing is
           saving âGo round there. There's space there . I quite
           understand if you were blocking their way to get in at all.
           rhpv might say "Get out of my way. I âve paid. I'm coming
                       5
           in"', b u what is suggested is simply^that you indicate "Full
           in here    Plenty of room round there".-' - A. I can accept that,
           mv Lordâ . We could have stood there and we could have tried tc
           divert them. Whether they would have paid any attention is *
           different story.
                  MR HYTNER-    But you see, Sergeant, what we are looking
            at is a serious "situation-,- serious in the sense-it did-happen,
            ? Â£erl were crowds outside.    Pens 3 and 4 were full and you Â«â¢Â«
            being told, "There are hoards coming in. They hdve got to be
            stopped coming into the pens". If that is right you would ;


                                                                                 71'"

        have known immediately that if you fail to keep them out of
        the tunnel there would be or was likely to be a terrible
        tragedy in pens 3 and 4 because of overcrowding. That would
        be the consequence of failing to keep them out of the tunnel,
        would not it? - A. Possibly.,
q       Think carefully.  If you had seriously thought on receiving
        such an order that you would be physically incapable of
        complying with it you would have said so, and asked for
        reinforcements, would not you? You would have advised your
        chief that what he was asking was a policing impossibility?
        - A I think match control would have been aware of the
        situation, but there again it is a hypothetical question.
        Y es.
0. It is hypothetical only because nobody asked you to do it? -
   A. That is correct.
O       If you had been faced with such an order, if you had thought
        it was possible to comply you would have done, and if you had
        thought it was impossibly to comply you would have advised
        your superior Officers so that they could make an alternative
        strategy? - A. That is possible.
G     It is not just possible, it is the only alternative. - A.
    ' Well, but that was not the case, but my concentration was on
      gate'C and suddenly bursting open.
q             LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Sergeant, I don't think anybody is
          criticising you because you were never asked to do it. - A. '
        : That is true.:
q            MR. HYTNER:    You do understand? - A. Yes, I can see what
         you are getting at, sir.
Q        You must not be too defensive if nobody is attacking you.
         Going back. I want to deal with this. At about 2.30 fans were
         coming through the turnstiles and being abusive, and indeed
         obscene in their language to you, but what they were
         indicating with their obscenities and ill-manners was that
         there was a likelihood of somebody being killed because
         outside the Police had not got control. That was what was
         being conveyed to you in this obscene language, was not it? -
         A. Yes, that was the message.
    G    Of course, there is now way I am going to attempt to defend
         either bad manners or obscenities aimed at Police Officers,
         but drunk or sober, foul mouthed or not, these people
         understood at 2.30 or believed at 2.30 that the Police had_
         lost control and that fatalities were a possibility, and that
         was what was getting them excited? - A. It was after half-
         past-2, sir, when the abuse was directed. Nearer quarter-to.

    Q. Nearer quarter-to.     It was between half-past and quarter-to? -
       A. Yes.
    Q. Just one last thing.     This may seem a silly question but there

                                                                     1 2

    has oddly enough been a conflict of evidence. You were there.
    You saw what was happening. You in fact were very worried and
    concerned about the size of the gates in the perimeter fence,
    were not you, when the tragedy had already occurred? - A.
    Inside the ground? Inside the actual track?

Q. Yes. - A. Yes, I did think the exit gates were a bit on the
   narrow side.
Q. And it was your view, being there, that had they been bigger
   it would have helped the evacuation of the bodies rather than
   hindered it? - A. Yes, up to a point, I would think, but there
   again more people could have tried to get out and there could
   have been a bigger situation.

Q. Anyway, it would have assisted in evacuation, the larger the
   gates? - A. It could have done, yes.
                  Cross-Examined by MR. JACKSON:

Q. Would you look for a moment, please, at the fat bundle of West
   Midlands photographs, No. 18. May I emphasise, Sergeant,
   again, no-one is attacking you, but is not it quite clear from
   that that by the use of that portable barrier and the Officers
   in your serial that there was little problem for the Force
   that has managed the miners' strike to block that tunnel? - A,;
   I didn't realise that barrier was there, sir.

         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I don't know there is any evidence
    that it was.  It is on this photograph, but I donât know
    whether it was at the time.
q        MR. JACKSON:    I think we can see from the video there
    were lines of these portable barriers just behind gate C. I
    think if we look on the line there I think we will see on the
    video a number of portable, or there was available.... - A. I
    think those barriers that were inside or close to gate C were
    blocking the programme sellers.   There were about 3 or a .
    They were being used to stop the fans getting in close
    proximity to the programme sellers, and that is what their
    purpose was.   It was not anything else.




                       /G.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   You mean....




                                                                     73-

q   .         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:             You     mean programme-sellers
         needed to have that kind of protection?              A.   That is
         correct, and this is one of the reasons I put P.C. Burton
         up beside one of the p r o g r a m m e -s el le rs . There was another
         one just up alongside the wall and that was being fenced
         off and we had had in previous matches there, Semi-Finals,
         one or two snatches - you know, taking the money off the
         programme-sellers and disappearing into the crowd - and
         that is one of the reasons why P.C. Burton was there in the
         first place, supervising.

q   .         MR. JACKSON:    I make it quite c l e a r ,âS e r g e a n t ,
         there is when policing a football crowd a number of
         activities you have to combat which would be outside the
         experience of most people thinking about a crowd, such
         as snatching programmes and the proceeds from the programme-
         sellers.   A.    We were talking about the actual money
         from the programme-sellers.

Q. Sergeant, if we looked back at the order - you have no need
   to do it yourself - we will find that Serials 14 and Serial
   16 were the two at either side of the Turnstiles A-G.
   A.    Yes, sir.

Q. Serial 16 was outside it.   You have no need to look unless
   you need to particularly. . Serial 16 was outside and
   Serial 14 was inside.  At about half past two, who was
   your senior Officer?   A.   Inspector White.    He was in
   charge of us.   He was in charge of two serials inside
   the actual concourse.

Q. During the time of the build-up outside,                 did you see the
   Inspector at all?   A.   No.

Q. Do you         actually know where he was?         A.      No.

Q. We know that the Sergeant outside was processing a prisoner
   and you, as it were, were the only non-Constable inside.
   A.  There was Sergeant Burns.  He was on the other side
   of the wall.

Q.       The other side of the wall?         A.    Yes.

Q.       Seraeant, we have heard an awful lot about radios going
         down at the same time.    What we have not heard is surprise
         that they did.   No-one - not a single Officer - has added
         to his evidence about radios going down that he was surprised
         or worried.  A.  No.   Well, nothing surprises me in this
         job these days, sir.

    Q. Do I take it that it was expected that the radios would
       qo d ow n 7 A.   Sometimes that does happen.  It has
       happened at other football matches, not just Cup Finals.
       I regularly police the Barnsley football matches and it
       has happened there.

    Q.    In particular,    you see,   if we have a chain of command that

              year, of course it was a different story.            Last year
               they were all in position at that particular time,
               fifteen minutes oefore uha game.

              came in gate C.     Therefore, my Officers were pulling
              them to Sne side otherwise the injuries would nave been a
              lot greater at gate C.     If you ask me waere tney wenu I

- A      YÂ°s       I clid say that.   I presume if you look at the
a c t u a T t h i n g , gate C is directly in line with the^ central
runnel and I pea suae that is where taey were all Heading,
but I did not actually see them go in the tunnel.

          MR. G L A S G O W : If I can take it in stages,
Ser-^nt.          Did you see that the first time?       I know you
s     âin your statement that you saw it the second time,
b-u{ did you appreciate that the first time the gate
o o e n ^ â v-hen there was the burst with people running, tnat
they'"had gone into the tunnel? - A. That did happen tne
first t i m e .

tryin*Â°~toÂ°close the gate,        which I eventually did do_, so I
did not actually see...           I presume that is wnere tney

Q. Dealing generally with the 1988 match, were you aware
   of the situation on the West terracing in this sense, that
   there have been some complaints that there was considerable
   crowding, although no-one was physically injured?
   A.   I was not aware of that.

Q. You were aware of no complaints               about any form of o ve r Â­
   crowding?   A.   No.

Q. What arrangements were made, as far as you can recall, in
   1988 to try to ensure an even distribution of people on the
   West terracing?   A.   The same as  this year.

Q.     This year there         were none, so --      A.      There were    none.
      last year.

Q. None at all?           A.     None     at all .

Q. We h a v e had some evidence, as you probably are aware,
   that in 1988, towards the l a t t e r :stages before the kick-off,
   there was some sort of a physical barrier put up at the
   concourse end of the tunnel, formed I think by people rather
   than any inanimate object - a c o m b i n a t i o n .of stewards and
   Police - to stop people going down that middle tunnel but
   to go round the edges.       A.   I was not aware of that.

Q.    You have heard nothing of            that at   all?    A.   No.

Q,    Other      than, of course, the evidence that has been given,
      in t h e    course of this Inquiry.    A.   Yes.

Q.    I cannot put to you at what stage it happened but it would
      appear to have been towards the latter stages, some tirae
      shortly before kick-off.   A.   As I say, I have no knowledge
      of t h a t , s i r .

      So as far as you were aware the strategy was the same in
Q.
      1988 and 1989, namely let the fans find their own levels
      on the West terracing.   A.   Yes, sir.

           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Can you just help me a-moment?
 Q.
      Have you got the thick bundle of West Midlands Police
      photographs?   A.   Yes, my Lord.

      16 and 17.       They show the entrance to the tunnel,              do they
 Q.
      not?   A.        That's right.

      And they show a barrier there - a temporary barrier - you
 Q.
      can see in profile in 16 and you can see it again in 17.
      Presumably that is there, is it, to enable that entrance
      to be shut off temporarily, or, if not, what else is it
      there for?   A.   I am not quite sure why those barriers
      are there, my Lord.

       There is only one there, I think, the one I am looking at.
 Q
       A.   There are some more off to the side on Photograph 17.


                                                                                    78

Q. Against        the wall,   yes,   that is true.    A.   Yes.

Q. But there seems to be one  by the tunnel there.   That
   could easily be used to shut off the tunnel, could it not?
         A.   Yes.
q             m r . COLLINS: Whether or not that particular barrier was
         there on the afternoon in question, it would not have been
         difficult to provide for some form of temporary barriers to
         be available in order to shut off the tunnel, or restrict
         access to the tunnel, should that become necessary.
         A.   That's right.

Q.       It is simply   that it appears that that manoeuvre was never-
         thought of.     A.   Mo, sir.

Q. That is right, is it?    So far as 1988 was concerned, you
   say in your statement that apart from minor problems of -
   drunkenness, theft, discharge of a pyrotechnic during the
   match, the game passed off without serious incident.
   A.    It came to my recollection after I compiled this
   statement there was a stabbing in Hillsborough Park.

Q.       That is outside.      A.     That was outside but. it involved
         football fans .

Q        And there was, of course, a pitch invasion, as we know,
          at the end of the match.   A.   Well, I have heard that
          evidence but I cannot specifically remember it myself..

Q        Well, it does not sound as if it was a very serious one,         by
         all accounts.   A.   I think Liverpool had won the Semi-
         Final tie and that was the result.

Q. A bit of over-enthusiasm by a small number of fans.
   A.   Possibly.

Q.       In 1989 you knew that you were to have the same fixture
         in the same ground and it appears from the evidence we
         have heard that effectively the same plan was used.
         A.   Yes.

    Q.   The only modifications       being you switching with Mr. Greenwood
         and s o m e modifications    of man-powex basically.   A.   That's
         right.

    Q. What I want to ask you about is this:          you were responsible
       for the Liverpool fans, effectively;          is that right?
       A.   That's right.

    Q     And that is r e s p o n s i b l e , is it, for bringing them from
          wherever they arrived in Sheffield or to covering their
          movements, I should say, from wherever they arrived in
          Sheffield to the ground entrance?              A.   We had a dual
          role as well and that was to look after the local population
          and see that traffic moved with the minimum of inconvenience
          and to protect shops, property, our own local residents, as
          well as looking after the welfare of the fans.
                             QUESTION                  SI X

Why did Chief Superintendent Duckenfield mislead the Secretary of
the FA by telling him that fans had forced open Gate C, when the
officer knew he had given the order for it to be opened?


C h ief Superintendent Duckenfield accepted that he m ay have said the gate was
forced but referred to the first occasion the gate w as forced open. A ccepted th at he
gave impression that fans had broken down the gate but had not w anted to
com m unicate to the world a t large that it w as a police instruction for the gates to be
opened. H e w as concerned it would cause m assive disorder not so much inside the
ground but outside. N eed ed to keep routes open for em ergency services. A cted as
he believed correct in a crisis moment.

Did not tell M r Kelly a lie as gates had b een opened without authority earlier.
H ow ever did not tell him w hole truth that gates opened on police instruction as he w as
concerned that if this information conveyed to fans they would cause m assive public
disorder outside ground playing havoc with the em ergency services arriving at the
ground.



OBSERVATIONS
This question w as raised at the Lord Justice Taylor inquiry. A num ber of witnesses
gave evidence concerning this m atter and their observations would have been
considered by Lord Justice Taylor in his eventual conclusions.

Lord Justice Taylor - Interim Report

98. A t about 3 .1 5 pm, M r G raham Kelly, C hief Executive of the FA, M r Kirton also of
the FA and M r G raham Mackrell, S ecretary of Sheffield W ed n esd ay, w ent to the
control room for information. M r Duckenfield told them he thought there w ere fatalities
and the gam e w as likely to be abandoned. H e also said a gate had been forced and
there had b een an inrush of Liverpool supporters. H e pointed to one of the television
screens focused on gate C by the Leppings Lane turnstiles and said "That's the gate
that's been forced: there's b een an inrush". Inevitably M r Kelly w as interviewed a little
later live on television. H e spoke o f the two stories concerning the gate - the fans'
account that the police had opened it, the police assertion that the fans had forced
their w ay in.

99. About 3 .3 0 pm there w as a further m eeting in the Club's boardroom.
M r Duckenfield w en t there and m et M r Kelly, the referee and representatives of the
three clubs. A C C Jackson w as also there. M r Duckenfield indicated the m atch w as
likely to be abandoned although no firm ruling w as given. He added that he did not
w an t people to know it w as to be ab andoned lest the dispersing crowd ham per the
em ergency operations.

                              Q. And you are still considering the question of postponement
                                 of kick-off, among other options? - A. It is an option sir,
                                 but when he asked me to open the gate that certainly was
                                 not going through my mind.

                              Q. Now v/hen he made that request what was your-immediate
                                 reaction? - A. Tc be honest I did not want to open the gate.
                          B
                              Q. Why not? - A. To open a gate at a football ground it would
                                 have defeated the  objectives ofour Operation Order in
                                 that drunken fans may get in; people who had got drink;
                                 people who had got missiles and people who were without
                                 tickets would get access.

                              Q. Were you aware by now that there was a problem with a numbe:
                                 of people outside without tickets? - A. I was aware that
                                 during the day there had been people without tickets.

                              Q. Eut v/ere you aware that there were a considerable number
                                 of fans at the Leppings Lane entrance who did not have
                                 tickets? - A. I was not aware sir.

                          D   Q. Because I think a lot of statements, or a lot of evidence
                                 we have heard and certainly a lot of statements that I have
                                 read, refer to considerable numbers of people without
                                 tickets and asking for tickets. Is that something that
                                 had not been drawn to your attention? - A. Not at that
                                 stage sir.

                          E   Q. Because that was rather an important factor, wasn't it,
                                 because if there were a lot of people milling around
                                 without tickets that was something which would have added
                                 to the disorder or the problems rather outside? - A. In
                                 what respect?

                              Q. Well if you have a lot of people milling-around in a
                                  small area who a r e without tickets coupled with'people'
                                 â coming along trying to get into the ground, you add to
                                  t h e problems donât you, because you have got more people
                                  there? - A. I would suggest that there are people there,
                                  there are probably people without tickets.

                              Q. I see. - A. But the crowd difficulties are there-whatever.

                              Q. Anyway you were reluctant to agree to the gate being
                                 opened because of the factors you have identified? - A. Yes
                                 sir.

                              Q. Were you able to make direct contact with Superintendent
                                 Marshall or not? - A. I remember receiving a radio message
                                 but having received the radio message from him, or it
                                 c a m e into the Control Box to open the gate, I immediately
                                 looked at the monitor for the Leppings Lane turnstiles aha
                          H      as I did so I v/ould describe it as the gate burst open.

                                not be correct, but my perception of the situaLion when the
                                first request was made and whilst X was considering it,    ^ ^
                                was that "the gates burst open anyway, why am I being asked?/"

                           Q. The gate was in fact opened cu that occasion, as we now know
                              to eject someone? â A. Yes>
                     B O        I can understand how you may have made a misuaxe, bu>_ it
                                was not ooen then for more than a rew seconds, was i<_? -
                                A. No, it was momentary. The mounted Officer came along
                                     recovered the situation and the gai_e was closed once
                                more -
                           0. So it was clear, indeed it was obvious to you that that_was
                              nothing to do with you, you. had made no decision? - A. 1 /
                              had made no decision sir/.
                                    Tndeed am I right that no gate would have been opened unless
                           Q.
                                    you made the decision and instructed? - A. Yes sir.

                           O        Is that something that was in the briering or is tnat: some-
                                    thing which would have been known to all? - A. it woulc nave
                      D             been known to all sir.
                           0. So if but only if you gave the instruction could a gace^be
                              opened? - A. In an emergency situation that is ngnt, sir.

                           n     And this was of course an emergency situation because as you
                                 cruise i-ichtly point out, one of the problems of opening a
                                 gate is you let in a whole lot of people unsupervisec? -
                                â¢A. Yes sir.
                           o. But the gate was opened, as you say for a rew seccnas
                              momentarily, and then shut again? - A. Yes sir.

                           -o APhis is 2.48 I think on the timing that we have.or thereabouts
                              You then'' get another:, message 'from Superintendent-Marshall?
                              - A. Yes sir.
                            0 Again he asks for the gates to be opened, but he goes does
                               he rather further on that occasion? - A. Yes tne situation
                               was different then sir. The first message I woula describe
                                       ^-eauest  T h e - second message was a rather urgent message
                               a n d more of a demand and he asked for the gates to be^openea
                               and coupled it with the words similar to the words:          ^ iou
                               d o n ât open these gates somebody is going to be seriously
                               injured or killed1.
                               0. Now you had had that first message at 2.47. You had seen
                                  the gate open and close again? - A. Yes sir.

                                     qurelv the first thing you would do in those circumstances
                               Q.        to try to contact Superintendent Marshall ana speak to
                       H             h-in direct if you could to ask him what actually was uhe
                                     situation? - A. Sir, if I can set the scene, a very tense
                                     situation in a Police Control Box. A message came across â

                    Cross-Examined by MR. DYSON:

Q. Mr. Duckenfield,  I would like to take you back, please, to
   the control room at about 3.15 or thereabouts. Do you
   remember that amongst the visitors you received at about that
   time there were Mr. Graham Kelly and Mr. Glen Curtain of the
   FA. Do you remember them coming? - A. I certainly remember
   Mr. Kelly, and if you say there was another gentleman with him
   I will accept that.

Q. And together with Mr. Mackrell, the secretary of Sheffield
   Wednesday Club.  Do you remember him coming as well? - A. I
   remember Mr. Kelly and Mr. Mackrell.

Q. And they were anxious to know what was going on, and in
   particular what you were proposing to do about it and whether
   you were proposing to abandon the game. Do you remember that?
   - A. Yes, sir.

Q. And I think you told them, did not you, it was going to be
   necessary to abandon the game but you did not want that
   decision to be disseminated just yet for the reasons you have
   explained this morning? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Do you remember also telling those gentlemen that the problem
   had been created by a gate, the gate being forced open by the
   fans? - A. I may have said that, sir, referring to the first
   gate, because I thought there was a gate that had opened at
   first. â

Q. By the first gate, you mean gate C? - A. Yes.

Q. Are you referring to the first time gate C opened? - A. Let me
   take you back to the conversation.

Q.       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Where is the conversation? - A. In
     the Police control box:                 â¢   -      â  --- â¢ â 

Q         MR. DYSON:   In the Police ..control room, about .3.15. - A..
     Mr. Kelly came in, and I was asked what had happened. The
     specific conversation I cannot remember, but I may have been
     loath to tell him exactly what'the situation was at that
     point.
q         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    What aspect of it? What had
     happened, or causation? - A. What had happened,my Lord.    The
     blunt truth that we had been asked to open agateand that we
     had opened a gate.   I was not being deceitful.  It was just a
     case of at that situation we were all still in a state of
     shock, one might say.
q        MR. DYSON:   So you accept you did not tell him the truth
     at that stage, that the gate had been opened as a result of
     your instruction? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. You accept that, and you accept that you may have said that
   the gate had been forced open by the fans? - A. I may havi

                           referred to the first one, sir, yes.

                        Q. When you say "the first one", what do you mean? - A. The first
                           gate I believed at that time had been forced open, gate C.
                           If you look at my statement my interpretation was when the f
                           first request for the gates to be opened I said in my said,
                           "Why do you want the gate open because it is burst open
                    B      already?".

                        Q . You are referring to the first request? - A. Yes
                        G. But that gate was shut very smartly, was not it? - A. Yes,
                           sir;
                        Q. And you knew perfectly well that it was not the influx of fans
                           as a result of that opening which had caused the problem, did
                           not you? - A. Yes. that was not the majo-r opening.

                        Q. And you knew the real cause of the problem and the casualties
                           was the second opening? - A. yes, sir, that was the
                           possibility.

                        Q. You see, I put these questions to you because Mr. Curtain and
                    D      Mr. Kelly are quite clear that they were told.    Mr. Curtain is
                           clear that it was you who said it, and Mr. Kelly is not
                           certain whether it was you or one of your colleagues. At all
                           events. they are both quite certain they were told by the
                           Police in the control room that the casualties had been caused
                           by the gate being forced open by the fans? - A. I would go as
                           far as to say that.   I am trying to be helpfulin recalling
                           the events at a moment of crisis.

                        Q. Why were you being so coy about telling them what had
                           happened? - A. The reality of the situation is that shortly
                           after the events had occurred many people were in a state of
                           shock, and I thought it correct to collect my thoughts and to
                           assess the situation. .. I did not exactly information;- and- I am
                           n o t ; b e i n g disrespectful to Mr. Kelly or the other gentleman, I
                           just -thought at. that stage-that I should not communica-te fully
                           the situation until possibly a senior Officer of mine knew the
                           situation.
                        Q. Did you know that subsequently and as a result of what you had
                           said to Mr. Kelly that Mr. Kelly when he gave interviews to
                           the media, of which he gave a number later that day, he told
                           the media there were in fact two theories circulating as to
                           the cause of the disaster, the fansâ theory and the Policy
                           theory, the fansâ theory having been that the gate was opened
                           by the Police and the Police theory, as Mr. Kelly told the
                           media and the world, the Police theory being that the fans had
                           forced the gate open. Do you know he had said that? - A. I
                           had no idea, sir.

                        Q. Thank you very much.

 were easing themselves out satisfactorily between hal 6-
 past-2 and a quarter-to-3? - A. Yes sir.

 You realised of course that the Club's control in the
 bowels oÂ£ the South Stand did not give them any video
 pictures of that stand, didn't you? -    A. Yes sir.

And so it you had been concerned, and I accept that you
say you were not, but that it you had been concerned the
Club control would only know of that if you either âphoned
them or radioed them? - A. Yes sir.

Did you know that in addition to the radio there was a
direct land-line telephone between the Police Control Box
and the Club Box? - A. Yes sir.

And so that any difficulty in getting through on the radio
could immediately, instantaneously, be solved by picking
up a telephone with a direct link? - A. Yes sirl

If anybody, any of your Officers, was seriously concerned
to contact Mr. Locke, or the Police Liaison Officer In the
Club Box at any time, the most obvious thing to do would
be to pick the 'phone up wouldn't it? - A. Yes sir.

And would we be right in supposing that the onlyâreason
why abortive attempts were made to use the Club's radio
was because you simply didn't know where Mr. Locke was
stationed on that day? - A. I didn't know sir.

Because if you or Superintendent Murray had known that he
was where he ought to have been, with respect, in the
Control Room, you would have usied the telephone? - A.
Yes sir.      '

Finally., Chief.Superintendent, may I come to the account
which you gave of this incident after it had occurred,
because I am concerned with the effect that that has had
on my clients as   wall as others.  It is right to say isn't
it that when youdecided to withhold the information that
the decision to let people into the grouned had been a
Police one, you withheld that information from everybody on
the afternoon in question.    - A. Yes sir.

For my part I can accept that the initial embarrassment, if
you like, to say something to Mr. Kelly may have been done
on tne sour of the moment, you persisted in that deceotion
throughout the afternoon.  - A. There was good reason sir
not to tell the crowd what had occurred.

Was there good reason not to tell my clients, the officers
of the Club? -     A. I felt so sir at the time.

   A s s i s t a n t C h i e f C o n s t a b l e had come into the Police Box.
   A.        Yes, sir.

Q.   And you had the o p p o r t u n i t y , if necess ary , to take him
     on one si de and tell him the truth in one sentence.
     A.    Yes, sir, but the s i t u a t i o n is that at that stage
     I am not su re that S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Ma rs hal l had come in

Q. How w o u l d th at a f fe ct the po s i t o n ? A.  Be ca use Mr.

   the s i t u a t i o n had been as he saw it.

Q. But was not the fair thing to S u p e r i n t e n d e n t M a r s hal l

   p u t t i n g it bl un tly , ca rr y the can unle ss you put the

O f f i c e r s , sir, try t h e i r h a r d e s t in the most d i f f i c u l t of
circumstances .
Of   co ur se, I th in k one a p p r e c i a t e s that.         Iâ certainly,
do   not w i s h to s u g g e s t a n y t h i n g to the c o n t r a r y but it
is   a l i t t l e hard, is it not, to expect them to do an yt hin g
if   th ey do not know w h a t the p r o b l e m is.             A.      It wo uld
be   b e t t e r if they had had the best i n f o rma ti on.

I s h a l l le av e it at that.              The only other thin g I th ink I

q u e s t i o n s Mr. W o o d w a r d was ju st p u t t i n g to you about

No no.       I w a n t e d to see          wh at your th i n k i n g was, that is

  No no              I fo llow th at but did it not occur to you ---
  You see w h a t you did - it was not so much that you did

  I do not k n o w w h e t h e r you i n t e n d e d it and I am not

O   I follow that thinking but what I am concerned about is
    that you appear to have conveyed the impression as part
    of not tellinq what actually had happened, that it w<=.s
    the b r e a k i n g down of a gate by the fans that had actually
    caused the trouble. That is what the media picked up ana
    that is what the media broadcast? - A. When I was m uia.
    Control Room, very difficult, very tense situation, and
    vou have seen the size of the Control Room and from tne
    pitch you have seen the difficulties that we were racing.

0   Chief Superintendent, I don't want to interrupt you but
    tha? is not an answer to the question? - A. I know, I am
    coming to the point.          There were many people asking _
    questions of :me. There              many people wanting_decisions
                                               w   e   r   e


    and the opening and--the closing of tha. aoor          Mr. Kelly-,
    came in with Mr. Mackrell, another person wanting an
    imme diateâ¢answer to a difficulty and I was in tne miast a.
    other things:. I tried as best I could to aeal with my :
    own situation-satisfying my policing needs with-the crowc
    a   n  in s o m e ' ways, this may seem unusual, being polite to
            d                                                                            ,


    H?" Kelly and saying.. "Look, this is the s i t u a t i o n " .
    whatever words I said it and hoping he would leave me
    v e r y quickly so that I could get on with the matter:in aang.

0   The only reason I-am asking you this is that m the light
    of your answer to Mr. Woodward, I am wondering why you
    thought it would be less likely to leaa to disorder uO
    tell the true position than to imply that it was the -ault
    of the'fans.  Some might say or -might:
    be more likely to create disorder? - A.. Sir ,.,wiuh aindsi^- .
    todav we can all- look differently at that situation. I .acteq,
    as I*believed to be correct in a crisis moment. .

                        MR. COLLINS:       Yes, very well.
               MR. -HYTNER: May I just correct something Mr. Collins
        has- put because it-may not be absolutely accurate, -

                    The impression I have from the vast nurapp^oÂ£.:âst^te- . -
                    fl .i. T have read and from the evidence that nas oeen

              MR. COLLINS: Yes, I am obliged. I think that may
        well be right and although I think it was a combination
        of the two and actually those who listened t o t h a t video
          little later will hear, I think we all heaia on the

                                were 'D' Division Serials.
                           0        These are the ones that have been in the City Centre bringing
                                    the fans from the Midland Station? - A. These are the ones
                                    that bring the fans from the Midland Station, if tney arrive
                     B              after quarter-to-3 they go and stand by in the gym. He had
                                    eiciht or ten Serials and I asked for five Sergeants and
                                    50 men. These were eight_man Serials so Inspector Sewell
                                    despatched six Serials, which would be six Sergeants and 43
                                    men sir.

                              to ooen the gate? - A. Before the instruction was given,

                                    dÂ°soatcned from the gymnasium, how would they have gone to
                                    Leppings Lane end, from the inside or round tne outsice?
                                    - a . From the inside, my Lord.
                               o. So when they got there they would have remained on tne inside
                                  of the turnstiles? - A. Yes, they would.
                                           MR. PHILLIPS: Would they in fact have been in tnat
                               Q.

                                     the North Stand. The gymnasium is at the back of cue i.c^n
                       G             S^-and isn't it? - A. That is the area they would approacn.
                                     They would approach along the north Stand concourse anc
                                     they would come out this side.

                               Q- On this side of the fence? - A. Yes.

                                  Some witnesses speak of there being a line of Officers in
                               Q. that area on the approach to the North Stand when Gate A

                                  was opened. This would be some of the men who had come

                               Q.         MR. HYTNER: There were four requests in all by
                                    Mr. Marshall for the gates to be opened? -A. Yes sir, I
                                    would say there were four.

                               Q. And quite a bit of time elapsed between the first and the
                                  last? - A. Yes sir.
                           B
                               Q. I am not sure whether we can work it out exactly. It was
                                  well over five minutes, wasn't it? - A. No sir, I would
                                  say under five minutes, probably about 3, 3%.

                               Q. What was happening in that 3^ to 4 minutes. Was the
                                  matter discussed between you and Mr. Duckenfield? - A. The
                                  first thing that happened was the request came in to open,
                           C      the gates. Mr. Marshall was told to stand by presumably
                                  while the situation was assessed as to what would be the'
                                  effect of it and see if it could be recovered. At the
                                  same time the request was coming in for other Serials to
                                  be despatched. Serials were despatched from the gymnasium,
                                  p .c . Ryan was possibly still passing his Tannoy messages
                                  over the Tannoy. In between the first and the last request
                                  the gates were either opened or burst open or forced openâ
                           D      or whatever. That is what was happening sir.

                               Q. I will come to the burst gate in a moment. We weren't
                                  there, you were.  It is difficult to get the flavour and
                                  the atmosphere, but the words you actually spoke after
                                  the fourth request:  "Mr. Duckenfield, are you going to
                                  open the gates". On one reading of them have a flavour
                                  of you being concerned that Mr. Duckenfield was dithering,
                           E      that he had not made up his mind, and you were rather
                                  urgently trying to get him to do so. Is that a fair
                                  interpretation? - A. I don't think Mr. Duckenfield was
                                  dithering.  I think Mr. Duckenfield was weighing all the
                                  considerations and I turned round to him and said:   "You
                                  have got to make the decision now" virtually. I used
                                  the words you use but what it meant was "vie have got to
                                  make that decision now".
                           F
                               Q. Again I don't want to put words in your mouth in this way
                                  but that is not far from what I v/as putting to you, that
                                  you were concerned that he had not made the decision
                                  after four requests for the same thing to happen? - A.
                                  I v/as not concerned sir and he was not dithering. He
                                  v/as obviously still considering whether we could retrieve
                                  the situation or not and it v/as my opinion then that we
                           G      had to open the gates with the final request of Mr. Marshall.

                               Q. At that particular time everybody's minds were really
                                  adverted to the fans causing trouble, weren't they? A
                                  gate opened and it v/as immediately assumed that the gate
                                  had been broken open? - A. Ho. The words' that v/ere given
                                  to me was "The gate has gone" or "The gate has burst"
                           H      and they were given by the Video Operator.

                               Q.   The impression being that they had gone through crowd
                                    pressure? - A. That is what it conveyed to me, yes/.

                               Q. And similarly when you saw for the first time the fans
                                  climbing over the gates, the fence, the perimeter fence,
                                  it conveyed to you the impression, did it, that there had
                           B      been some sort of pitch invasion? - A. Ho, not pitch
                                  invasion. V7hen I saw people climbing over the fence, are
                                  we talking over on to the perimeter track?

                               Q.    Yes? - A. They were getting on to the pitch. They probably
                                    wanted to see, probably wanted a better view. There was
                                    something happening, I don't know what it v/as.

                           C   0. It was pretty obvious, wasn't it, in the way in which they
                                  were climbing over and standing aimlessly around on the
                                  track that they were out through pressure, not because
                                  they wanted to spoil the game or anything of that sort?
                                  - A. It was not obvious to me and I never considered they
                                  wanted to spoil the game.  I thought they wanted to get
                                  on to the track to get a better view.

                               Q. Mr. Murray, may I take up the very last matter. In the
                                  briefing you gave before the game was there any particular
                                  attention paid to crushing? - A. No sir.

                               Q. Am I right that in every case when we check the briefings,
                           E      we check the notes, we check everything that was said,
                                  nothing v/as ever said to any of the Officers on the ground
                                  about crushing? - A. I don't know sir, but it v/as not
                                  mentioned in my brief.

                               Q. Because at the end of the day there was a great deal of
                                  distress, was there not, shown by the Officers and anger
                                  by the fans on the pitch? - A. Yes, there was.
                           F
                               Q. And if we look at the video we will see, will we not, at
                                  well after 10-past-3, many many Police Officers standing
                                  apparently doing nothing? - A. That is what it appears,
                                  yes sir.

                                    And is that   because no one ever briefed    them as to what they
                                    ought to do   if there was a crush at the    front of any one of
                           G        these pens?   - A. I think it is possibly    because they did
                                    not realise   the full extent of what v/as   happening.

                               Q. Is it correct that no one v/as ever briefed as to the method
                                  of extracting people from inside these pens if there v/as a
                                  crush? - A. No one v/as briefed on that subject, no.

                                          lord justice   TAYLOR:   Is there some specific way of
                       H            doing it?

O. Do you remember Gate C being opened at about 2.48 v/hen a
   number of fans cane through? - A. That is correct,.

Q. Were you party to the opening of that gate or was that one
   of your other Officers? - A. I don't believe - I was not
   party to it - I don't believe it v/as an Officer on my ;
   Serial. The gate aid open v/hen I v/as standing up near
   to Turnstile A and of course as it opened my attention
   was"â drawn, to it. I ran, with other Officers from my
   serial to try and close the gate, which eventually we c.fid
   do. The only reason we did do this is because I understand
   there was a Police horse there and the Police horse cane
   between the fans and Gate C and that assisted us quite a
   bit and v/e managed to close the gate then.

O. Can you help us with the number of people who came through
   Gate C when it was opened on that ocasion? - A. I said
   initially in the report I made probably a couple of days
   afterwards, I said approximately 50, but having watched
   it on the video there was nigh on 200 easily.

q   . vie know that Gate C opened again approximately four or
      five minutes later? - A. Yes.

Q. And on that occasion stayed open for some time? - A. That
   is correct. It v/as about five minutes later.

p. How close v/ere you to Gate C v/hen it v/as opened the second
   time? - A. Well I think my position would be between
   Turnstiles A-G, central position, when the gate suddenly
   opened.

Q. Did you see who opened it? - A. No, I was not in a position.
   There was one or two fans around that area and of course
   that restricted my view. I have no idea who opened it,
   if it was a Police Officer, a Steward or what, I have no
   idea whatsoever.

Q.   Were there any other Police Serials working in the area
     immediately behind that gate apart from your Serial 14?
     - A. I did not see anyone.

Q. Did you hear any traffic on the radio about the opening
   of.the gates? - A. None whatsoever.
Q. Did you not hear an instruction that the gates should be
   opened? - A. 1-Tone whatsoever.

Q. Did you have any warning that the gate would be opened
   and left open for the influx of fans? - A. Kone at all.

Q. If you had known that it was going to be opened, v/as there
   anything" you'would have done before it v/as opened? - A.
   Well there is a possibility if v/e had been aware it v/as
   going to be opened v/e could have moved further back perhaps
   to the tunnel and diverted, but if there is several fans
                                                          50



                                                                                  T.    B IC H A R D


                                    - A. I would accept the differences in time, yes.

                               Q. Well, we have got the timing from the video and obviously
                                  that is more accurate than your memory.  But when that
                                  gate opened just after Mr. Marshall had asked for the
                                  gates to be opened what did you think had opened it? - A v
                                  There had been some conversation on the radio regarding
                                  pushing at the gates and gates bending and buckling and
                          B       when that gate appeared to open- my immediate reaction
                                  was that the fans had in fact forced open.that gate.

                               Q. Did you make some comment to that effect? - A. That is
                                  right, yes.

                               Q. I think you said something like they have broken down the
                                  gate? - A. That is the words I would have used, yes, sir.

                               Q. Yes.  But in fact after about 20 seconds or so it was
                                  closed again? - A. That is right, yes.

                               Q. And according to your notes you put it thus, you say
                                  after 20 seconds gate closed.  Appears that it had been
                                  opened on purpose - sorry - appears that it had been open
                          tj      on purpose? - A. Is that on my original statement or the
                                  notes?'

                               Q. No.   I am reading out from the notes.  You have got a copy.
                                  In fact you time it at 2.40 which we know to be slightly
                                  inaccurate.   It is page 6 of my copy of the notes.  I have
                                  a typed copy.   I do not know.  It may not accord with the
                                 ''original. - A. Yes.
                          E    Q. You have got that? - A. I have got that, yes.

                               Q. As you see, it says after 20 seconds gate closed.  Appears
                                  that it had been open on purpose? - A. Yes.  I was unsure
                                  about actually who had opened it or why it had been opened.

                               0. I want to see whether this is hindsight or whether this is
                                  what you thought at the time.  Your immediate reaction was
                                  to think the gate had been broken down? - A. That is right,

                               Q. That is what you said? - A. Yes.

                               Q. It v/as open for a very short time and then closed again?
                                  - A. Yes.

                               Q. Did you then appreciate that in fact it had been open on
                                  purpose or v/as this something you were told later on in
                                  the afternoon? - A. It is quite possible that that is
                                  something that has come out during the events and me
                                  actually writing it down.

                               Q.   I follow.  In any event we know that there was again a
                                    request from Mr. Marshall?"- A. Yes, in relation to

                                                Cross-Examined by MR. GIBSON-WATT:

                               Q. Officer, one point first which you ha ve touched on but I
                                  want to get it clear. When Gate C first opened, just for
                                  a few seconds, you instinctively said: "The fans have
                                  broken down the gate" or words to that effect? - A. I did,
                                  yes. ;
                           B Q. That is what you thought.      It then closed and soon after
                                    that you were getting very strong requests or commands
                                    fromSuperintendent Marshall that the gates should be opened?
                                    - A. Yes, that is righ>t.

                               Q.   So by the time you were getting these commands through it
                                    must have been obvious to you that the Police had at any
                                    rate regained control of Gate C? - A. I believe that, yes.

                               Q.   And indeed that the opening of Gate C originally had been
                                    deliberate, not a break in by fans? - A. That may be an
                                    assumption in between the incident happening and me writing
                                    that down.

                               Q. Well what I am suggesting to you is it is an assumption
                           D      between the incident happening when you first blurt out
                                  your thoughts instinctively and realising that Superintendeni
                                  Marshall was still asking for the gates to be opened?- A.
                                  I am unclear on what you are actually to gain, sir. '

                               Q. Let's take it slowly.  If Superintendent Marshall is asking
                                 ,for the gates to be opened, the fans have not broken in
                                 â and not broken down the gate, have they? - A. There is more
                           E      than one gate though, sir.  It may well be he was not aware
                                  that that gate opened.

                               Q. Well you are aware when Superintendent Marshall is giving
                                  his orders or making his requests for the gates to be
                                  onened, that fans are no longer coming through Gate C.  You
                                  can see that? - A. I can see that, yes.

                               Q. Therefore at the least Gate C is then under Police control
                                  and no fans are coming in? - A. Yes, and I am assuming
                                  that Gate C is the one that everybody is referring to.
                                  That is where my attention is drawn.

                               Q. Precisely   so. So you assume    v/hen Superintendent Marshall
                                  is making   his requests, that   everybody is concentrating
                                  on Gate C and Superintendent     Marshall is asking for Gate C
                                  to be opened? - A. Yes, that     is right, sir.

                               Q. Which means it must have been opened and closed the first
                                  time and not forced by the fans? - A. It could v/e11 have
                                  been forced.  If the gate has been opened or just taken
                                  off lock, the fans could well have forced the gate open and
                                  we managed to close it again, it does not mean to say it
                                  is damaged.

                             2. You did not- hear any conversation specifically from Inspector
                                Murray about a difficulty making contact with the Club? -
                                A. Again I can't, obviously it is a very active time. I
                                have no recollection of any conversation.

                             Q. Hr. Bichard, is that the position that a number of people
                                were doing different things and not everybody v/ould have
                                known what everybody else was doing? - A. Once v/e v/ere aware
                           B    about the fullness of this incident each individual took
                                upon themselves their individual tasks, so you would not be
                                fully aware of what v/as happening elsewhere.

                             Q. Mr. Bichard, I am sure we all sympathise with that, but the
                                conversation that I v/as putting to you as to whether you could
                                help v/as somewhat earlier. Mr. Murray thought that he had
                                tried to get in touch with the Club before the decision to
                                open the gates v/as made. Again I can only ask you this: if
                                in fact there were difficulties at that stage, something let
                                us say at about a quarter-to-3 .... A. Again it is not
                                in my recollection.

                             Q. And the last matter, and forgive me there is only one question
                                on the question of the opening of the gates. Can I just
                                ask you to clarify this: Mr. Duckenfield and Mr. Murray have
                           D    both told the Inquiry that they had expected all the gates to
                                be opened? - A. f would accept that if that is what they are
                                saying.

                             Q. That is what they expected and you have told us that your
                                expectation was different? - A. That is right, Gate C.

                           E Q. And I think you have also said that the reason for that you
                                believe, from recollection, is that because your camera
                                happened to be looking at Gate C at that time, you had
                                assumed that v/as the gate about which Superintendent Marshall
                                v/as speaking? - A. The actual scene is available on that
                                camera. It shows a clear picture of Gate C. Gate B is out
                                of view. Gate A is out of view.

                             Q. And that is what you were concentrating on personally? - A.
                                That is right.

                             Q. And you were unaware of the fact that Mr. Duckenfield, and
                                Mr. Murray wanted all the gates opened? - A. I am unaware
                                of that, yes.

                             Q. It is just this question in the light of that background,
                                Mr. Bichard. After the order to open the gates v/as given
                                on the first occasion, v/e can see on the video that you
                                zoomed in on Gate C first of all? - A. Yes.

                             Q. Do you remember that? - A. I don't actually, because I have
                                not had an opportunity .... I have seen a compilation tape
                                but I have not seen the tapes I produced.

                           H Q. All I v/anted your help with v/as when you did zoom in on Gate C

                                  you said this morning that you drew that to"his attention"?
                                  - A. Yes.:

                               Q. Whose attention did you draw to the fact that Gate C was
                                  being opened? - A. When I made the comment about it being
                                  forced open?

                             Q. Yes? - A. It would be directed at Mr. Duckenfield, bu^ also
                           B    to everybody who was in the Control Box.

                               Q. But are you saying that you have a specific recollection
                                  of drawing Mr. Duckenfield's attention to the gate which you
                                  were zooming in on at the time v/hen the first entry v/as
                                  made? - A- When the gate was, as I believed forced, and I
                                  have shouted out the comments that I have put in my statement
                                  and it has been directed to Mr. Duckenfield who has been
                                  stood just in front of me.

                               Q. And likewise approximately five minutes later when there was
                                  conversation specifically about Gate A, and I think we can
                                  tell you without fear of contradiction that you zoomed in
                                  on Gate A as well? - A. Yes, I have got that recollection
                                  now of seeing two lines of Police Officers behind Gate A.

                           D Q. And zooming in on them? - A. And moving in on that scene, yes

                               Q. When you zoomed in on Gate A, those minutes later after
                                   the initial zoom on Gate C, can you recall whether anythi-âig
                                   was said at all inside the Control Box about v/hy Gate A
                                   had not been opened earlier? - A. No, I know v/hy I zoomed
                                  ;ln on Gate A because of the radio message from Sergeant
                                   Higgins, that is v/hy I v/ent there, but I have no idea of
                           E       any conversation after that.

                                        MR. GLASGOW:   Thank you very much.   Thank you sir.


                                                 Cross-Examined by MR. WOODWARD:

                               Q. Mr. Bichard, may I ask you about the monitoring at Snig
                                  Hill. Until the major incident was declared, was Snig Hill
                                  listening in to the communications that were passing?
                                  - A. To my knov/ledge they v/ere listening to Channel 25,
                                  personal radio.

                               Q. During the time that you were in the Control Room up to the
                                  moment that Gate C was opened and caused you to shout out,
                                  had you been expecting that gate to open? - A. Certainly
                                  not.
                               Q. When you observed v/hat was shown on the television screen,
                                  v/as it a matter of surprise to you? - A. Yes.

                               Q. Did you shout it out? - A. Yes.

                           H   Q. However, did you make any specific communication to Snig Hill

            - A. That is right, but I have a vague recollection that it
            is sometime during all the melie and I think you will
            appreciate there was a lot of stress in dealing with the
            problem- I have a feeling that somebody mentioned something
            about storming the gates.

  Q. It may be that we can help you about that. We have heard
     some evidence, or rather it has been put, that you were
B    present when Mr. Duckenfield spoke to Mr. Kelly and I think
     a Mr. Kirton from the F.A. and Mr. Mackrell, the Secretary
     of the Club. Do you recall a meeting at which those three
     were present, together with you and Mr. Duckenfield? - A.
     Is that the one in the boardroom?

    Q. Well I am n o t sure whether it was in the-.Boardroom or. the ...
       Control Room. I think it was in the Control Room? - A. Yes,
       there were a lot of people came to the Control. Room that
       day and I remember Mr. Mackrell being in there, so ..probably
       Mr. Kelly was in there as well.

    Q. B e c a u s e it has been suggested, and I think Mr. Duckenfielc
       has actually accepted this, that he certainly conveyed the
       impression, whatever precise words he may have used, that
       fans had broken a gate down and that that, had led to the.     .
D      trouble? - A'. I don't remember what the actual conversation
       was.        I remember Mr. Mackrell saying something about "What
       was the plan?" Certainly I briefly said we were trying to
       get the people out who had been injured.

    Q. But you said that you had some vague recollection.that at .
       some s t a g e someone said something about "storming the
       gates"? - A. Yes, I d b .

    Q. Could that in fact be the occasion which has been spoken to
       by Mr. Duckenfield? - A. It could have been.

    Q. Is your recollection that whoever said something about
       storming the gates was someone who was.official, if I may
       put it that way? - A. Oh yes, yes.,,

    Q. So it was not a sort of mere rumour? - A. No, Mo, I have
       got a feeling it'was somebody in the Box that said that.
       In fact I think it may have been Mr. Duckenfield.

                  MR. COLLINS:   I am obliged.

    q   .        - LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: But when you said it was only
            about 4.15 that you heard what had actually happened, do
            I understand that is v/hen you had called Mr. Marshall?
            - A. Yes.

    Q. Was it f r o m him that you heard that the gate had been
       opened? - A. Yes, my Lord, during that period, as everyÂ­
       body appreciates, we were extremely busy and trying to
       make sure that the areas were sterile, that doctors had
       been called and all the necessary things were being done

                                                                     1 0 2

Q. The time, of course, is approximate, but the point is
   this: you did not appreciate that there had been a Police
   order to open the gates until you spoke to Hr. Marshall? -
   A. That is correct.

Q.   You have also told us that ona previous occasion - an
     occasion before that - somebody in authority had made a
     reference to storming the gates? - A. Yes, I think that
     was right.

Q. And you believed that that could have been Mr.
   Duckenfield? - A. Yes.

Q. And it could have been on the occasion when Mr. Kelly was
   in the Po-lice control box? - A. Yes.;           .â 

Q. D o es :it fo 1 low- from that that, until you spoke to Hr. :
   Marshall at about q.uarter-past four, you-were under the
   impression that fans had somehow forced their way,into the
   grbund? - A. That was my recollection. Vv                   - .

Q. Thank you. There is one other matter. Do    yo.u, have a
   recollection, on any occasion before 4. 15, when you were
   in the Police control box, of some reference being made to\
   the television monitoring screens to illustrate what had
   happened? - A. No, I do not.

Q. You do not have any recollection of that at all? - A. No,
   I do not.

             LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    What context are you putting
     that?

             .HR, GIBSON-WATT:       Sir, I am putting it in the., :
     context of Hr. Kellyâs visit,. I deliberately put it in
     g e n e r a 1 terms'because. Mr:. Jackson had .been a little vague. ,
     It was not put to Mr. Duckenf ieId, which is why I raise it
     no w, but the recollection of Mr. Ke1ly arid Mr. Kirtonjwas
     that they were referred to a picture on the- monitoring
     screen.

             LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Then and there?

          MR. GIBSON-WATT:   On the occasion that' they were in
     the Police control box.

        - LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        I see.   Thank you.

          MR. GIBSON-WATT:   It was not thought necessary to
     put it when asking Mr. Duckenfield, but, of course, a good
     deal of evidence has emerged since then.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:       Thank you.    Yes, Mr.
     Kallipetis?



                                                                   103
                         QUESTION                  SEVEN

Why did it take half an hour after the first crushing began to pull
down the 10 foot spiked fence which trapped the fans, and why were
the gates which led on to the pitch too small to be effective in an
emergency evacuation?

C h ief Superintendent Duckenfield recollects that a request w as m ade at the Police
G arag e at C layw heels Lane for cutting equipm ent but none w as readily available.
Fire brigade called at 3 .1 4 pm. T h ere w ere difficulties in the rescue due to the width
of the perim eter gates.

M r S eam an , Fire Service, stated th at the gates in the perim eter fence w ere
discounted for m eans o f escap e purposes, and only saw a minor need for use of the
gates, such as a small localised em ergency not a m ass evacuation to the pitch.
T h e evacuation tim e which w as calculated for the Leppings Lane terrace did not
include the perim eter gates.

M r Hopkins, S Y M A S stated that the S Y M A S am bulances located at the Ground and
used as a base com m unication vehicle and possibly those that w en t onto the playing
area, carried a breaking-in kit which includes small bolt croppers, but his impression
w as that he w as doubtful if they would have fulfilled the task in question, and had the
experienced am bulance m en thought that they had the tackle on their vehicle that
could have helped, they would have used it.

M r Eastwood, an engineer, agreed the perim eter gates should have been 1.1 m etres
but w ere not. T h e treasury counsel stated "A breach of S afety C ertificate requirem ent
- m ay have been causation". Eastwood stated prime purpose of perim eter gate for
localised problems, not used in determ ining capacity.        H e took into account the
perim eter gate w hen considering escape. H e agreed that it w as within his knowledge
that the width of the perim eter gates, rightly or wrongly, had been a conscious and
deliberate decision of the certifying authority and they decided that the gates should
be less than the recom m ended guide. T h e effect of a certificate w as to ratify the
decision to leave the gates.

Superintendent M urray believes he w as the person to ask for cutting equipm ent. T h e
first request w as m ade to C layw heels Lane and the accident unit w as directed but
would have to travel som e distance. If it had been at C layw heels Lane it could have
been at ground very very quickly.

Lord Justice Taylor, in response to M r Jackson's statem ent "that anyone who had
considered the possibility of crushing at Leppings Lane end would have instantly
realised that the gates at the front w ere pathetically inadequate" said, "I follow that
point. As I think I have said earlier in this inquiry I don't think I am going to require a
lot of persuasion about that".

W h e n Police C onstable Bichard realised that the request for cutters from Clayw heels
Lane w as unsuccessful, passed a m essage requesting the fire service to bring cutting
equipm ent.

Assistant C h ief Constable Jackson refers to C hief Superintendent Duckenfield's
request for the police vehicle carrying cutting equipm ent from C layw heels Lane and
the two requests to Force O ps from the Fire Service.

T h e views of Inspector C alvert on the perim eter gates w ere that they w ere for security
access and em ergency egress purposes. W h e n used in past have been ad equ ate for
the num ber he had w anted to bring out.

Every effort w as m ade to arrange for bolt cutters to be brought to the stadium,
how ever before that task w as accom plished the fans and police had taken matters
into their own hands and rem oved fencing panels them selves. T h e police vehicle
which carried such equipm ent and lodged only minutes aw ay at C layw heels Lane w as
aw ay and not im m ediately available. Unfortunately bolt cutters which form part of the
'Breakin-Kit' on S Y M A S am bulances w ere not used as they w ere possibly considered
not up to the task by the am bulance crews.

T h e use of the perim eter gates w ere generally thought to be for security access and
evacuation for small localised em ergencies N O T a mass evacuation. T hey w ere not
used in the calculation of evacuation times and should have been 1.1 metres w ide but
w ere not; 'A Breach of S afety C ertificate Requirem ent'. T h e certifying authority issued
a S afety C ertificate which ratified the decisions to leave the gates, not as w ide as they
should have been.

Lord Justice Taylor - Interim Report


Gates

258. T h e perim eter gates in the pens w ere not designed as exits.         T h ey w ere
intended to afford access by the police to cope with any local disorder or with an
em ergency. T h e kind of em ergency contem plated w as not massive crushing but, for
exam ple, the collapse or illness of an individual. Em ergency evacuation of the pens
had been considered by the O fficer W orking Party. Although fire risk w as minimal
since the terraces, w est stand and tunnel w ere of concrete construction, the fire
brigade w ere the principal arbiters of evacuation procedure. T hey aim ed to be able to
em pty the pens in six minutes. T h e plan w as to evacuate spectators via the tunnel
If for any reason that option b ecam e impracticable, eg due to a bomb threat, then the
alternative route would be along the back of the terraces, through the gates in the
radial fences and round the sides of the w est stand. T h e fire brigade w ere satisfied
that each of these routes would enable the pens to be evacuated in less than six
minutes, without relying on the gates to the pitch. Th o se gates would also be
available, but their use w as excluded from the calculation of evacuation time.

2 6 4 . Even if the width of gates 3 and 4 had complied with the present G reen G uide
standard, they would have been wholly inadequate to relieve pressure and release
spectators swiftly on 15 April. M oreover, the G reen G uide says nothing about the
num ber of gates required for a pen of given size. Whilst the Club, Dr Eastwood, the
O fficer W orking Party and the local authority can be criticised for failing strictly to
conform to the Guide, the real failure w as com mon to all those w ho have been
responsible for considering safety on the terraces. T h e anxiety to protect the sanctity
of the pitch has caused insufficient attention to be paid to the risk of a crush due to
overcrowding. C ertain it w as, that once the crush occurred on 15 April gates 3 and 4
w ere wholly inadequate for rescue purposes.



C u ttin g E q u ip m e n t

101. M eanw hile the em ergency services had been in action. A t about 3 .1 0 pm a
request cam e from the perim eter fence to control for bolt croppers to cut the wire
mesh. S erg ean t G oddard contacted the police g arage close by without success.
A t 3 .1 3 pm, P C Bichard requested H eadquarters to call the fire service to bring
hydraulic cutting equipm ent to the Leppings Lane entrance.

104. A t the Kop end, Leading Firem an Housley arrived with an em ergency tend er and
Station O fficer Fletcher in another appliance, each with a crew. T h e em ergency
ten d er cam e along the roadw ay by the south stand but owing to its height w as unable
to proceed further. It therefore backed out and w en t to the Leppings Lane entrance
losing som e eight minutes. From there, Mr Housley and his crew w en t onto the pitch
with resuscitation equipm ent. T h ey rendered help there and later a t the gymnasium .
Mr Fletcher and his m en ran along behind the south stand carrying cutting equipm ent
and oxygen cylinders. W h en they arrived at the fence, the cutting equipm ent w as not
required as by then the last of the dead and injured w ere being rem oved from the
pens. M r Fletcher set up a casualty clearing area under the police box and firem en
assisted in carrying victims as well as rendering first aid on the pitch.



Lord Justice Taylor - Final Report


G a te s

2 0 1 . I m ade an interim recom m endation to leave gates fully open w hen the pen or
enclosure w as occupied. This w as for three reasons; first, to afford instant access to
the pitch; secondly, to provide visual reassurance to fans after Hillsborough that there
w as an escape route and thirdly, to keep police and stewards alert to conditions inside
the gatew ay. I also had in mind that the num bers and size o f gates might at som e
grounds be inadequate and I w as not m aking any recom m endation for structural
change at that stage. Along with reduced capacities, provision of sufficient gates and
lower fences, I must now consider w h eth er to keep or modify my recom m endation to
leave gates fully open. I know that som e Police C om m anders have been anxious that
to do so is an invitation to pitch invasion; h ence the practice at som e grounds of
closing the gates n ear the end of the g am e or keeping them shut but not locked.
I w o u ld still h o p e th a t g a te s w o u ld b e left fu lly o p e n w h e re v e r th o s e in c o m m a n d
fe e l th is c a n s a fe ly b e d o n e . H o w e v e r, I re c o m m e n d th a t w h e th e r th e y b e fu lly

th e p en o r e n c lo s u re is o c c u p ie d .       T h e y should thus be easily available for
em ergency exits and spectators should be confident of this.
C u ttin g E q u ip m e n t

2 0 5 . In the im m ediate afterm ath of Hillsborough, I recom m ended that suitable and
sufficient cutting equipm ent should be provided to en ab le spectators to be released
from behind perim eter fencing. Assum ing the recom m ended m axim um capacities are
observed, that fences are lowered, that sufficient gates are provided and left
unlocked, cutting equipm ent should not be necessary. Som ething in these provisions
would have to go badly wrong for such equipm ent to be required. N e v e rth e le s s , I
re c o m m e n d th a t th e e q u ip m e n t sh o u ld b e m a in ta in e d in c a s e o f s o m e

Lord Justice Taylor - Recommendations 17 and 21

17. T h e re must be provided in any perim eter fen ce of a pen or other self-contained
area sufficient gates of a minimum width of 1.1 m etres to en ab le that pen or a rea to
be evacuated onto the pitch in the tim e prescribed for an em ergency evacuation of
that pen or area.

21. Suitable and sufficient cutting equipm ent should be provided by the club at each
ground w h ere there are perim eter fences to perm it the im m ediate rem oval of enough
fencing to release num bers of spectators if necessary. A g reem en t should be reached
as to w h eth er the equipm ent should be used by police, the fire brigade or stewards.
W h o e v e r is to use it should be trained to do so. W h e th e r to use it should be a
decision of a nom inated senior police officer at the ground.

Q. And he did take charge, did he not? - A. Yes, on the pitch.

Q. And he began tc achieve a semblance of order with a chain
   of Officers getting the bodies out of the pens? - A. But
   there is a series of events before that in that as soon
   as I realised the severity of the situation I asked fcr
   assistance and a fleet of ambulances and implemented the
   riajor Incident Plan and v/e have jumped to that particular
   scenario.

      I am sorry, I thought you had already dealt with that? - A.
      That point has not oesn mace clear.

      But that cf course is to get help from outside? - A. Yes,
      but as soon as I realised the severity cf the situation,
      which v;as very promptly, and the Superintendents who were
      on the ground there assessed it very quickly and they had
      no delav whatsoever, communicating to me what the situation
      v;as and wh a t action v/e should take.

      I follow that, but did it not occur to you that unless
      vou QOt people out of those pens more might be injured?
      - A. Yes.

      If this was crushing, which is by now what you realised,
          sicwe; the process of emptying the pens, the more likely
      it is that more people are going to be hurt? - A. Yes.

      And therefore it is not enough, of course it is essential
      and one thing vou do is get the ambulances in from outside
      but you have got to take steps inside? - A. Can I make the
      rjoir.t, I have to accept the ground as it is and I am not :
      making anv excuses for the Police Officers in the tunnel,
      but v/e the Police Officers and the emergency services have
      tc work within the framework in that ground and there are
      difficulties.

r>,          jOR d j u s t i c : TAYLOR: Did you send for.anything_to ,
      cut the- framework away? - A. Yes' sir, wire.cutters, bolt,
      cutters -and also the Fire Service to attend,        v/e 'had to -
      work within those difficult areas and Officers' were trying
      their best under very difficult circumstances to effect a
      rescue.

o.          MR. COLLIMS: I am not intending or implying the
      slichtest criticism of individual Officers when I tali;
      about "chaotic situation". Of course they were doing their
      best. T.;hat I am suggesting is their best was less than the
      most effective if they were not under proper -command and
      if they were not given proper directions as to how they
      should do their work. That is what I am suggesting?
      - A. Can I make the point, under normal circumstances
      Officers would respond to command and the Superintendents
      who work for me are excellent Officers, s.'iiat you cannot
      compare is v/hat you call "normal circumstances".

                                                                       104

Wall that is what I am asking you.    -   A. Well I have
never heard of that.

Who called the Fire Brigade?   - A. I recall a request
for bolt croppers or wire cutters and following on from
that I understand the Fire Brigade attended, but as to'who
made the calls, and from what Control Room, I don't <cnow.

You didn't yourself specifically ask for the Fire Brigade?
   A. No. I was in the situation then by implementing a
major incident plan and others in support were ....

So you can't help us as to the genesis of the belief of a
Police Officer that there had been the breaking down of a
gate by the fans? - A. No sir.

      MR. RYTiNSR:   Thank you Mr. Duckenfield.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Mr. Jackson?

                Cross-examined by MR. JACKSON;

Superintendent may I make very clear that I don't
differentiate between you, your colleagues, your junior
Officers, your Constables, or the stewards. Together,
collectively, do you accept as a body of people who are
responsible for the safety of the people who go to
football matches? - A. Yes sir.

May I take the bull by the horns? Am I right in saying
that the man in charge thought there was a great deal of
similarity bet.wen 24,000 Liverpool supporters anxious to
beat Notts Forest again, and the people queueing for
'Bambi1 at the local Odeon? - A. Queues, sir, are queues.

You   mean
         yes there is a similarity? ft'ay I suggest'that
you don't mean that, it has never been the case arid it is
completely different.   - A. Why should a crowd of
football supporters -wish to behave differently to a crowd
of cinema-goers?

Chief Superintendent, regrettably I can't answer that
question1, but I can say they do and everybody knows they
do, and to suggest that you didn't .... - A. I am not
suggesting that sir.

May I therefore move on. Would you take please two photoÂ­
graphs and compare them. The first is in composite aloum
number 1 at MWL10/20A.  It may well be you don't need to
be referred to the documents, but you will accept will you
not that the duties of the three serials immediately
outside was to take part in the forming of orderly queues.

                                         exit by the tunnel?   A.   No, what I am suggesting is
                                         this - I am being helpful, I think - that question wants
                                         addressing to the authorities other than myself.

                                    Q. Because it is     quite clear, is it not, even with hindsight,
                                       or maybe only     with hindsight, that the attempts to
                                       rescue people     by means of the perimeter gate were close
                                B      to pathetic?       A.   There are difficulties associated with
                                       the perimeter     gates because of the width and the fencing.

                                    Q. Chief Superintendent, that is a nice polite answer.
                                       Of course there were difficulties.   My word was "pathetic".
                                       A.   I would not choose that word.   I would say that the
                                       ground was there as it was with the fence and gates and wÂ§
                                       tried to rescue people as best we could;

                                    Q. Chief Superintendent, I am not suggesting for the moment
                                       that Officers did not do more than anyone could possibly
                                       expect them to do.   What I am suggesting is the ground
                                       that they had to do it on had a gate which was pathetic
                                       from a point of view of rescuing, people crushed against
                                       the perimeter fence.    A.   The gate was a gate that had
                                       been accepted by all the authorities concerned'.
                                D
                                    Q. And that makes     it right?

                                              LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Well, I do not think it is
                                         likely to be in the future,    so I do not think you need
                                         to pursue that.

                                              MR.   JACKSON:   I am obliged to you,   sir.

                                    Q.   Perhaps on the very same point, did you ever have any
                                         problems with the p ositioning of the emergency services?
                                         A.   In what respect, sir?

                                    Q. Would you turn to-' Tab 15, a memo on emergency â¢evacuation f       â
                                       procedure.   A . Yes, sir.

                                    Q. Dated August, 1988.      Third paragraph:     "A Senior
                                       Ambulance Officer already attends all home matches at
                                       the Sheffield Wednesday ground and is allocated complimentary
                                       tickets for the South Stand.        He is in direct radio contact
                                       with Ambulance  Patrol," etc.        Last paragraph:    "It
                                       was considered that this Ambulance Officer would be better
                                       based in the North Stand so he could get to the gymnasium
                                       without problems.     However, the Senior Ambulance Officer
                                       who attends is off-duty and the Sheffield Wednesday
                                       Football Club only wish to allocate the complimentary
                                       tickets to the Amb ul an ce Service for use in the South
                                       Stand so that the Club Physio, Alan Smith, can signal
                                       straight away to the A m bu la nc e Officer if an ambulance
                                       is required for a Wednesday player."        It does seem that
                                       the priorities are a little bit askew, are they not, Chief
                                H      Superintendent?    A.     I have got to confess, sir, it is
                                       the first time I have seen that report.
                                                                                                        106

                               Do you think the possibility may be that v/hen you were

                               about the possibility of crushing? - A. Mo sir, I v/as
                               looking for movement in the crowd and difficulties in the
                               crowd as a result of the gates opening and from v/here I v/as

                                specifically, no, I was looking for indications.

                             Q. If you now look over the page in those photographs which is
                                at 4-mir.utes-past-3, that is a tine I think when you agree
                                that you realised there v/as serious probleras and it was no
                                longer a pitch invasion? - A. Excuse eig sir, are you talking

                             o. It is PR2/1 and that is actually at 4-minutes-past-3.     Get
                                that? - A. Yes.

                             Q. I think you will accept, because it has been drawn to your
                                attention already by Mr. Collins, people lying on the ground
                                and so on and so forth? - A. Yes sir.
                         D
                             Q. At that time it must have been apparent to you that people
                                were trying to get out of that pen? - A. Yes sir.

                             Q. And they v/ere having difficulty in doing so by getting
                                through the gate? - A. Yes sir.

                             Q. I am not necessarily suggesting this v/ould be the solution,
                         E      but one of the possibilities that v/ould arise would be. to
                                cut some of the fence down? - A. Yes sir.

                             O. That v/ould be a pretty obvious thought that v/ould go through
                                anybody's mind, isn't it? - A. Yes sir.

                             Q. Did it go through your mind? - A. -Not immediately, sir.v,-

                             Q. Do you knov/ hov/ long it took before anybody asked- for the
                                Fire Brigade to come with their cutting equipment after
                                that photograph v/as taken? - A. I don't sir>

                             Q. Ten minutes.   Does that strike you as a very long time? -
                                A. Yes sir. â ]

                             Q. Well are you saying then even though you knew there v/as
                                crushing up against the front and you knew there v/as
                                difficulty in people getting out, it never crossed your
                                mind to get somebody to bring some cutters to release the
                                ueople? - A. Sir, there v/as a request for cutters very
                                early on. At the moment the calf v/as put out for other
                                assistance and a request was made then for cutters and I
                                believe that because none were readily available from the
                                Police Service the Fire Brigade v/ere called.

                . That is not the way you told us about it before, nor is it
                  quite the way it appears in your statement. You seem to be
                  in your statement in the same breath talking about the calling
                  of the Fire Brigade and also the request for cutters, When
                  are you now telling us that you first heard somebody ashing
                  for cutters? - A . I can't specifically say. When I realised
                  there w a s a disaster situation I gave instructions as to
              B   e s s e n t i a l services to be called and implemented and Â£ gave
                  a list of instructions. The comment in my statement is that
                  I called for assistance generally. I gave a list of instrucÂ­
                  tions and I was aware at that tine in that moment of crisis
                  that somebody wanted some wire cutters.

                      . Chief Superintendent Duckenfield. v/hat I am suggesting tc
                        you is that somebody in your situation faced with pecple
                        not being able to escape from the front of the pen and been
                        climbing over the top, somebody would think? "well he needs
                        some cutters", not general assistance, specifically cutters?-A.
                        And that request was made.

                  3. What I an asking you about then is this:       at 14-minutes-?ast-3
                          somebody actually summoned the Fire Brigade? - A. Yes sir.
              D 2 . Asking for cutting equipment.         Can you help us   as to how
                          long before that you realised that the Police     had got no
                          cutting equipment? - A. From the. information I   have got to
                          hand at this moment, sir, I cannot give you an    'answer.

                  R. Can you remember? - A. No sir, I can't.       There must be a
                          message somewhere but I have not got the information.

                  Q. Where did you expect the Police to be having the cutting
                     equipment? - A. I have a recollection that someone asked
                     for cutting equipment from the Police garage at Claywheels
                     Lane.
                  q   .   was a message- sent to Claywheels Lane?..-, A..   I ^a^-sorjry?_
                          Claywheels L-ane is nearby and it is a Police transport.
                          garage.

                  O. You are familiar with the facilities which can be offered
                     by the Fire Brigade on their emergency tenders, are you?
                     - A. Yes sir,'.

                  Q. And they have on those tenders equipment, cold cutting
                     equipment which can cut through without causing any fire
                     or injury to anybody in termh of direct injury, very thick
                     pieces of metal.   Are you aware of that? - A. Yes sir,
                     I know they have got equipment to cut metal sir.

                  Q. But they could have gone through the stanchions without
                     any problem if that was thought appropriate immediately.
                     Did you knov; that? - A. No sir.

              H   Q. So you were not aware of v/hat facilities the Fire Brigade
                     could offer? - A. I v/as not aware that they had got equipment
                     that could do that sir.

    Q. Exhibit 4, page 27. On to page 4 of the statement.
       Exhibit 5, page 307. Exhibit 6 is not copied. Can we
       just look at it perhaps, Exhibit 6 in your bundle refers
       to the abolition on reconstruction of Local Government
       and the need to establish;, lind' maintain liaison and so
       on. It is a general note requiring the Fire Service to
       have their usual input in advising and liaising with
       the relevant Authorities. - A. Yes.
B
    Q. Exhibit 7 is also not copied and is a letter from the
       City of Sheffield to the Fire Service anticipating the
       transfer of responsibilities under the Local Government
       reorganisation and suggesting a meeting of the 13th of
       March. We have got the record of that meeting.

             Exhibit 3 is again not copied and is a memorandum
       from the County from the County Solicitor of South
       Yorkshire to the Chief Fire Officer of the 5th of March 1936
       referring to the arrangments for a meeting and general
       discussion because of the impending changeover.

             Exhibit 9, page 312. Exhibit 10, page 381.

D
              LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: I am just wondering., Mr. Collins,
       I am not being offensive but insteac of playing bingo if
       v/e got a list v/e could ....

             MR. COLLINS: I can give you a list. I will give
       you a list which you v/ill have by tomorrow morning.
E   Q. May I go to page 10. Mr. Seaman, you refer at    the bottom
       of page 10 to a meeting of the Officer Working   Party on
       the 12th of February to discuss Mr. Eastwood's   report
       and to consider the views which will be put to   the Club.

             Nov/ that meeting or minutes of that meeting,
       Exhibit 17, are referred to at page 57 of our bundle.

             Then over the page you say:

             "With regard to the West Terrace you consider
             due to the lack of depth of the terrace the offer to
             reduce to 7, 200 and so on all would be v/ell ...."

       Now you specifically refer to "total movement laterally
       throughout the terrace and the three entrance/exits in
       the terrace being well situated and the West Stand
       providing a minimum of fire risk. You go on:

             "The existing gates in the perimeter fence were
             discounted for means of escape purposes."

          A. That is correct sir, yes.

     Q.    Was thisyou at the time, Mr. Seaman, or someone else
          actually at the meeting. I think it was someone else,
          wasn't it. You weren't there, yourself. But the three
          exits that are referred to* those presumably are the
          three tunnels, two at the ends of the Stands and one in
          the middle. Is that right? - A. That is right sir, yes,
          the three tunnels.
B
     Q. And those were looked upon, were they, as the natural
        means of escape if there v/ere a fire? - A. Yes.

     Q.   It being assumed that there v/as very unlikely to be a
          fire in the Stand itself? - A. That is right sir, yes.

     Q. Of course I suppose it v/as possible that the tunnels
        might be blocked off or one or more of them might be
        blocked off because of fire or possibly a bomb scare or
        something like that? - A. We thought it was very unlikely
        that we v/ould lose one but' anything is possible.

     Q. Yes, but doing the best you could you considered, did
        you, that having regard t<p the lack of any constraints
j)      on the terraces themselves, all should be well in the
        sense that it met the reasonable requirements? - A. Yes
        pir.

     Q. Did you know of the width of the perimeter gates? - A.
        I can't say specifically.   I am not aware that anybody
        took particular regard of the width of the cates at that
        time7.
g
     Q. Was that because it really was not contemplated that the
        perimeter fence would form any sort of means of egress
        in case of fire? - A. Yes.  We only saw a minor need for 7
        the use of the gates.

     Q. Only a minor need for the use of the gates? - A. Yesv

     Q. And itv/as on that basis that you v/ere prepared to approve
        the capacity of 7,200? - A. Yes sir.

     Q. Can I go on please to page 14. You refer there to the
        Safety Certificate and then inthe middle you refer in
        1930 to a memorandum from the Council stating:

                "Despite the fact that the Certificate had
                been issued as recent as the 21st of December,
                it was felt that the Sheffield District
                Officer ... to review the situation due
                to the pending F .A. Cup semi-final -- "

          Nov/ so theseare not in fact or this aspect   is not covered
          in our- bundle? - A. No.

H    Q. I am not sure that it is of vital relevance and I can

                                                                    lio

     half way down the radial fence is a disadvantage?
     A.   I think it would be better to have it at the rear.

Q. You have got one at the reaj^ . A.    Again, I think you
   have got to look at the irrdiv-idual circumstances.   The
   terrace itself was relatively shallow;    it was not
   a deep terrace.

Q. May I move on to another matter?   In your evidence yesterday
   you spoke of - in answer to Mr. Collins - the terraces
   having access via three tunnels.  A.   Yes.

Q.    That is not right, is it? A.      Well,   I agreed with Mr.
     Collins' description, in fact.

Q.    Very well.    The perimeter gates that you were asked about.
     Is this the situation, that the Fire Service did not regard
     the perimeter gates as having any emergency egress purpose?
     A.    Not other than a localised ---

Q.   Very local, to let someone  out who might be by the gate.
     A.   Well, a fight inthe crowd, for example.

Q.   A fight in the crowd?      A.   Well, that would be a crowd
     disturbance, would it not?      People could be below that
     a n d in those circumstances might need to use the gate to
     evacuate.     The Police could also need to be able to get
     access to get in.

Q. But was the Fire Service thinking this, that the perimeter
   gates really should be discounted as means of emergency
   egress?   A.   We didn't count them as means ----    For the
   evacuation time which was calculated, they were not included.

Q.   You were aware that Dr. Eastwood attached some importance
     to the perimeter gates as a means of egress, were you not?
     Would you have a look, please, I think it is in your bundle
     at page 54.   Sir, it is in the core bundle at 240.    A
     letter from Dr. Eastwood dated 8th May, 1985.    You see
     that letter, the last two sentences?   A.   Yes.

Q.   "It is our view that in the event of emergency spectators
     can be evacuated quickly enough by the gates to go on to
     the   pitch and by   the normal exit gates at the rear."    You
     saw   the order in   which Mr. Eastwood put those -matters.
     Did the Fire Service ever contradict that and say, "No, no,
     it was wrong;   the gates on to the pitch should not be
     taken into account"?     A.    Can I say that what that letter
     was   referring to   was the requirement for the second gate
     at the bottom   of    the radial fence.   He was not complaining
     about the one that we wanted at the top of the radial fence.

Q. Mr. Seaman, please, we may be at cross-purposes but would
   you just.look at the sentefree, "It is our view that in the
   event of emergency spectators can be evacuated quickly
   enough by the gates on to the pitch and by the normal exit
   gates to the rear."   He is there giving a reason for not
                              54

                                                     A. K. SEAMAN


     having other radial gates,    is he not?   A.    It can be
     interpreted in that way.

Q. Do you understand it to mean anything else?   A.   I don't
   know why the Police specifically requested the additional
     gate.                    ^~ ~

Q.   It is Mr. Eastwood's observation, do you see?   Mr. Eastwood
     there seems to be attaching some significance and value to the
     evacuation of spectators in emergency through the perimeter
     gates.   A.   I don't think we ever said that the gate could
     not be used but for a small localised emergency, not a mass
     evacuation to the pitch.

Q. But that would be insignificant in terms of emergency
   evacuation, would it not?   A.   Yes.

Q. The Fire Service were asked, I think, to check by the South
   Yorkshire Countyd Council on the working of the radial
   gates and I think indicated...in      Sir, I have gone back
   in time to 1981.   It is document 44 in your bundle, if
   that perhaps helps us.    it follows a letter of 23rd December
   1981 and is dealt with in your statement at page 19, and
   this is on the radial fence question.    Had the Fire Service
   actually checked upon the working of the radial fences,
   do you know, in order to answer that question?   A.   I
   could not be specific.    I think what it probably refers
   to was the reports that they were working well that came
   from the Police.

Q.   I apologise for coming to that point out of order,      but
     may I go back to the perimeter gates?   A.   Yes.

Q. As a means of access and egress and for purposes of emergency
   egress, the Officer Working Party did pay regard to those
   gates, did it not?   A.   They certainly asked for those
   gates.   When the pens were created there was a requirement
   for a gate in a pen that would not otherwise have had one.

Q.   Is it not rather to overstate the Fire Brigade's case to
     say that they never regarded the perimeter gates as playing
     a part in the evacuation process?    A.   What we have said
     all along is that they were not counted for the evacuation'
     time.

Q. At Tab 62 in your bundle, page 265 in the core bundle,
   there is a meeting of the 29th July 1985 attended by
   Hr. Allcock. It talks about having pitch perimeter fences,
   pitch perimeter gates for the purpose of both security
   and emergency egress purposes, That is right, isn't it?
   - A. Yes, we have always SsriLd for localised emergencies.

Q. May I move to one other matter please and I need your help,
   Mr. Seaman.

         In your bundle, and I need to deal with it this way
   because the documents are in a sequence there, in your
   bundle at page 50 there is a letter from Dr. Eastwood,
   dated the 9th April 1985? - A. Yes.

Q. He is there preparing a scheme:

         "We have prepared the scheme shown on the
         attached print of our drawing 6705/2."

   I think, Mr. Seaman, that the drawing that then follows
   is that which is in the bundle at 50? - A. Yes.

Q. Now that drawing has got some writing on it? - A. Yes.

Q. It is not a scale drawing. It has the various areas of
   the West Stand and terraces labelled A, B, C,D and E and
   there are bits which have been put in in manuscript? - A.
   Yes.

Q. Do you recognise that writing? - A. Yes.

Q. Whose is it? - A. I believe it is Divisional Officer
   Grimshaw's.

Q. And on that drawing the only measurements that appear to
   be for gates of any description relate to gates in the
   radial fences?   That is right, isn't it, between C and D
   and D and E? - A. Yes.

Q. The drawing isthen considered, if we  follow your documenÂ­
   tation through, at the meeting on the 18th April 1935?
   - A. Right, sir.

Q. And     the gates that are    there referredto areat B. Do
   you have that?    It was said in opening yesterday that the
   gates that one was concerned with .... Do you have the
   letter of the 2nd May 1935 which is your document number 53.
   It has the paragraph E on the second page:

         "Certain gates to have the minimum widths and
         metres indicated on the attached plan."

   A. Yes.             ..   __

Q. Nov; that is the plan that^ you have just looked at, isn't it?

                                                             113

Q.   But did it have the effect that we can see - is that
     right?   A. Yes, sir.

Q.   In fact, as far as Mr. Bownes is concerned, he, as you
     said, did not produce an^.Minutes as Mr. Vaughan had
     done - is that the posi'fron? â¢ A. The Minutes produced
     by Mr. Vaughan were always very, very prompt. Sometimes
     there were no Minutes at all when Mr. Bownes took
     meetings.

Q.   If we look please at 78, would you just have a look at
     that? Look at 78. That is a report made by, I think,
     Mr. Bownes to Mr. Mackrell relating to an annual
     inspection which had taken place on the 6th August?
     A. Yes, sir.

Q.   Mr. Bownes is actually making the report to the Club
     on the 4th December, 1987?   A. Yes.

Q.    Many months later?   A.    .Yes.

Q.   Well into the next season?          A.   Yes.

Q.   Can I ask you now please to go to page 11 in your
     statement?   I just want to ask you a little bit more
     about the perimeter gates.   You have made the point
     quite clearly there that the existing gates were
     discounted as a means of escape. You have made that
     point very clearly. They were intended,, as far as you
     were concerned, to deal with a localised difficulty.
     Can you just please look at the old green guide, if I
     can describe it in that way, and ask you to look at
     7.9?   A. Yes, sir.

Q.   The position is there that there is a specific requireÂ­
     ment, is there not, to have such gates?   A. Yes, sir.

Q.   This is 7.9, "Pitch perimeter fence/wall: This fence
     should be designed to keep spectators off the pitch
     but gates or other access points should be provided
     for use in an emergency..."? A. Yes. '

0.   Was that the emergency to which you regarded those gates
     as being directed?   A. Yes.;/

Q.   That kind of emergency that might arise in the vicinity
     or round about the gate?   A. Yes.

0.   And I think the position has already been made clear
     that at that time there was no specific requirement as
     to how wide those gates should be? A. No, sir, there
     wasn't.'

0.   As far as the absence of exit signs at the perimeter
     gate is concerned, did'tfou think it would be desirable
     to have an exit sign above the perimeter gate? A. No,
     not at all.

                                                                    114

Q.   So if 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 and so on were all evacuated,
     which wav would you expect the people in 1 and 2 to
     move when they were told to evacuate? A. To the corner
     exits of the terrace.                                                a
                                                                          a
Q.   Would that then create ;aâvacuum or an area at the radial
     gate?   A. Yes, it would.

Q.   And it is into that radial gate that the people would then           -
     go?   A . Yes.

Q.   From pen 3?   A.   Yes.

Q.   Can I ask you then about another matter    please, if you
      will go to page 17?    Paragraph 2.10.    This refers to
      the problems that there had been at the   Wolves -v-
      Tottennam Hotspur game in the summer of   1981? f A. Yes ,,

Q.   You, I think, have looked through all your files in
     your possession?    A. Yes.

Q. Have you been able to find any letter or document which
    gives details about what actually happened on that
    occasion? A. No, sir, none whatsoever.

Q. In particular, Ithink, in   the general bundle      at page 144,
    146*and 147, you have now seen those letters?        A. Yes,
    I have seen them.

Q.   For example, the letter written by Sheffield Wednesday,
     but none of those letters have you been able to find in
     any of your files?    A. No, sir.

Q. Or any report by the police or anything of that kind?
    A. No.
Q.   And such enquiries as youhave been able to make with
     the various officers, can you help us as to what detail
     they actually had about what the problem was in 1981?
     A. I donât think they ever had any information other
     than that there had been some sort of crushing incident.
     They never knew the extent of the actual incident.

Q.   In that connection, can you help us about this from the
     enquiries that you have made: Was there at that time,
     or at any time, any complaint about the size of the
     perimeter gate?   A. No, sir, none at all. ;

Q.   Or anv problem that anybody had felt had arisen in
     evacuating people, bearing in mind the size of the
     gate?   A. N o .

Q.    As far as you are aware, has there at any time been
      any general complaint by the Police or by anybody that
      there was difficulty in_Â£ontrolling the number of people
      going into the pens?   A. No, sir.

Q.    Or into the terrace as a whole?   A. No.
                                                                    115

            A.   I got information a little later about casualties
            at Leppings Lane end and deceased at Leppings Lane end
            of the ground.

            What was your means of communication at the ground itself
            with other Officers?   A.   Verbal.

B   Q. Speaking to them directly?           A.'   Yes.

            Could you not use any other form of radio or anything like
            that?   A.   You could use radios on talk-through but, I
            mean, it is not an ideal situation.   I think when you take
            charge of an incident, we were virtually operating in a
            given area - an agreed area - so communication did not
            become a problem.

            So now I think you went back to the gymnasium end and you
            spoke to Control and asked for the major accident vehicle.
            A.   Yes, I did.

            You very kindly supplied this morning a list of the equipment
            which is carried -- an inventory of equipment carried by
            this vehicle.   I    do not want to go into it all but I do
D           notice one of the    things that it carries are bolt-crops
            and saws.   A.    That is correct.

    Q.      Is this in fact confined to the major- accident vehicle or
            do other ambulances carry them?   A.     No, not at all.
            Emergency vehicles have what we call a breaking-in kit which
            includes small bolt-croppers and   saws and rope and gloves.
E
            Do ordinary ambulances have these?     A.    What do   you mean
            by ordinary ambulances?

        . An ambulance from the County Ambulance Service, does it
          have ---   A.    An emergency County ambulance carries a
          breaking-in kit.

    Q. So the ambulance that Hr. Higgins had brought to the ground,
       would that have this breaking-in  kit?   A. It would have
       had a kit, yes, sir./

    q   #          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I do not know - you have seen
            the   fencing, have  you, at the Leppings Lane  end?
            A.     Yes, my Lord.   Yes-:.

    Q.      I do not know what your bolt-croppers and saws were able to
            deal with.   Would they have been able to deal with that?
            Cut the wire or --- ?  A.   I think the big ones may have
            done.   The ones that were carried on the ambulance would
            probably have had problems.   The major incident - the large,
            gauge - one  would probably have cut it but ---

    Q. Can I get it clear?   The ambulance which was standing by
H      at the ground which Mr. Higgins had had sane equipment of
       this kind but are you saying that would not have worked on
       this wiring, or what?   A.   I think the equipment carried
                                          A. HQPOKINS


on an emergency ambulance, my Lord, is equipment for
gaining access to properties rather than breaking down
security fences, and that is basically what it is on
the ambulance for, for gaining access to property, really,
when someone has collapsed inside.

It comes to this - it might have worked but it was not
designed for that, does it?   A.   My impression would be
I would be doubtful on whether it would have, in fact,
fulfilled that role.

     MR. PHILLIPS:   Perhaps we can get round that, sir,
if I ask for a set of these bolt-crops to be provided
and we can have them looked at to see whether they would.

       LORD JUSTICE   TAYLOR:   Yes.

     MR. PHILLIPS:   You then ask for the major accident
vehicle to be brought to the ground.   A.   To be despatched,
yes, sir.

By the time you got back to the Penistone Road end you
clearly had the idea that this was a very serious matter.
A.   There was no doubt in my mind it was a serious matter,
sir.

And you did then everything you could to get everybody
there that you wanted.   You saw,   I think, some St. John's
people, did you at the gymnasium?     A.    Isaw a group of
St. John's Cadets, sir.   My initial reaction was to
utilise them but they were quite distressed children, really,
and not in a position to be utilised on what I wanted doing.

Now,   you went into the gymnasium,      I think.   A.   Yes,   sir.

Did you see anybody in charge there   from the Police?
When you first went in?    I am looking at Paragraph 22 of
your statement.   A.    I didn't see anybody at that time,
sir.

You describe   the situation as chaos.       A.     That's right,
sir.

Did you try to do anything to bring order to the chaos?
A.       Not really, sir.      The main concern I had was getting
resources to the ground to remove what I had seen on the
pitch.           At the time I came off the pitch I was conscious
of two things - (1) that at that moment in time I hadn't
the resources to remove the casualties from the pitch,
and I was conscious of the fact that the people on the
Penistone Road end of the ground seemed to have a total
unawareness of what was going on at the other end of the
ground and there was s till quite a lot of cl a p p i n g and
chanting as I came off.           My immediate reaction was to
get an ambulance on to the pitch.           That was the forefront
o f m v m i n d , mainly, yes, to deal with casualties but so the
rest of the people -- to bring home to them that something j j â1

Q.   May I ask you just about the problems of access that you
     have mentioned.   I think you said that ambulances were in
      fact able to get in and out?   A. We were able to reverse
     two or three ambulances in at any one time.

Q.   You were?   A. There were a number of vehicles in the yard
     which were Police vehicles, but one understood why tnev
     were there.

Q.   Are you saying, in fact, that their presence was an
      inconvenience but it did not really prevent you getting
     on with the job?    A. No, it didn't.

Q.   And if you had wanted them to be removed, you would have
      taken some steps?   A. Well, we did eventually get them
     moved, sir.

0.   And tney were moved as you requested?        A. Yes, sir.

Q.   The horses that you have spoken aboutwere no problem        for
      you, were they?   A. I acknowledged their presence.        They
      did not give me a problem as such.

Q.   I imagine you are talking about horses with men upon them,
      are you?   A. Yes, sir.

Q.   And if you wanted a horse moved, it would have       been a simple
      job to get it done?  A. Yes, sir.

Q.    And although you have mentioned horses, you are not
       suggesting that the vehicles there or the horses were
     ' really an impediment to getting your job done? A. They
       didn't stop us doing the job, sir.

Q.    Thank you. Is it      right that you   did not in fact   haveany
      conversation with     any of the men   on the horses? A. I have
      a recollection --    I don't think     I did,no. One spoke to
      me as I got to the   ground, but I     didn't have any
      conversations with   them regarding    the incident.

Q.    May I ask you about one further matter. Bolt croppers or
      equipment on the ambulances have been referred to. I think
      three of your ambulances actually went out on to the pitch?
      A. There were three ultimately, yes, siri

Q.    What equipment is it that you have in mind on the ambulance -

           Mr. KALLIPETIS:    Sir, if it helps, I am having them
      brought here.

           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Thank you.

q              WOODWARD:    Are you aware of any of the equipment
      having been used?     _A._No, I'm not aware of it, sir.

Q.    It would follow, would it, that your experienced ambulanceÂ­
      men, if they thought they had got any tackle on board that
      could have helped, would have soon had it out? A. I tninkÂ£j
      they would have used it, sir, yes.

        Can I go on to 57: "Comprehensive system of signposting".
        There was not a comprehensive system, indeed there was
        hardly any system at the Leppings Lane end of signposting
        as to where people should go. Was that ever anything that
        you considered to be your concern? - A. No.

              MR. COLLINS:      It may be arguable that is not structural.

              MR. GLASGOW: With the greatest of respect I would like
        to know on behalf of the Club whether it is being put that
        a signpost is a structural part because if it isn't we are
        playing games.

              MR. COLLINS:     No, I think probably not.

Q. 215, sorry to jump around a bit but this is a point effectively
   I have already made. The perimeter gates ought to have been
   1.1 metres, they were not? - A. Yes.'

Q. A clear breach of the Safety Certificate requirement.           That
   may have been a causative one too.

              LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Sorry, Mr. Collins, I keep asking
        you this: are you coming back to gates any more?

            â¢ iffi.â¢â¢COLLINS :-...~$o > I don ât .think I was    ,r<.

q   .      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: I would just like to ask you
     this; youâwere talking about the conflict between the ...Police-. -
     desire not to let too many people out but to be able to let
    /themselves in in that kind of situation and the need to let
     people out in an emergency? - A. Yes.

Q. There mav be various designs which we have heard about in
   France and goodness knows else we will perhaps hear about,
   but in ordinary terms there is not a lot of difficulty
   is there in doing what one finds in many garage gates, of
   having a large gate when you want to get something- big out
   and a"small one in the middle of it when you want to get
   one person in? - A. That is a very good point sir.

q   . ilo problem? - A. no problem, no. Only one, of structural
      strength but that can be overcome or two different gates,
      one big and one small.
q   .         m r . COLLINS: Yes, one thing I should have come back
        to on gates, you put you remember your special bolt oa?
        - A. Yes.
Q. I am not going to go into the details of tnat. - A. v-ould
   I come back to my Lord?

O              LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Yes, by all means. - A. Just
        so that you should be clear sir, if you donât mind, as^to
        what the thinking was about the gates, could I pass this
        to ray Lord?


                                                                        119

      Now, that would be the normal way out, and it gets you out
      well inside the 8 minutes which is required in emergency. My
      thoughts when we were putting the gates at the top, the 2
      units and so on, were rather like this.   Suppose there was
      some emergency that shut that tunnel. Obviously there could
      not be a fire in that particular tunnel but say somebody put a
      bomb there, you have now got to get people out in 8 minutes.
      If you look at the 2 units to the top left, 2 units to the
      top right through these gates, that is 4, and if you count the
      gates on to the pitch, which are very adequate for 1 unit, you
      have 6 units of exit from that area. My belief was that even
      if somebody blocked the tunnel there were 6 units of exit,
      which at 360 per minute, 60 per unit width, would take
      something like 6 minutes to completely empty those two pens.
      This appeared to me to be very reasonable secondary emergency
      exit. I had no idea it could possibly happen that gates could
      be open, that gates would not be open, and that there would be
      people trapped there for a long time as there were. I
      believed I had a very reasonable secondary escape system in
      place, even though only two were on to the pitch. With the
      other two you could completely replace the tunnel and get
      everybody away.

  Q. I am not sure that can be right, with respect to you, because
      the one thing we have made absolutely clear throughout all
w :'â thisyis.vthat-the exist gates or thÂ©agates on â¢tos-atfeeâi
      not- ~trfeated and were never treated as emergency evacuation -- â¢'
      gates for the purpose of determining capacity?

 Q.         LORD JUSTICE JAYLOR:Speed of evacuation.    - A. A gate
      'is a gate. The gate has a quick release device.It has got
       somebody outside.  It could therefore in my thinking become an
       exit gate.
 q          MR. COLLINS: If it    was to be an exit gate then even
       under the 1976 Guide it must be 1.1 m at least, if it is going
       to be used as an exit gate. That-is paragraph 15.5.3. - a.
       This is looking at it, if you like, legalistic is the wrong
       word, but the common sense view is that there is a gate with a
       quick release device, a Policeman standing beside it, and if
       people want to get out they can get out of that gate.

 Q. But all I am suggesting is that this is a ex post facto
    justification for something which was not actually part of the
    thinking at the time? - A. That is completely incorrect. At
    the time when these radial barriers were put in I 'had great
    cause for concern to think what the effect would be, and I did
    think about it.

 Q. Particularly when in pen 3 you were concerned that it would
    have been perfectly all right for there to be no exit gates
    through the perimeter fence? - A. We still had 5 units of exit;
    just like the tunnel .7

             MR. COLLINS: Sir, I have very little more. Do you want
       me to finish it? I have got about two or three minutes, I
       hope.
                                                                  120

Q. So whatever they did with it, they certainly knew .what your
   opinion was?   A. Yes.

Q. And as far as you were concerned, it was important, as far
   as practicably possible, to adhere to those figures? A.:Yes

Q. I just want to ask you now please one or two things about
   the perimeter gates. As far as the perimeter gates are
   concerned, they were never intended, were they, to be
   anything other than a means of escape if there was some
   localised problem which would require people to come out
   at the front?   A. That was their prime purpose. Obviously
   we must have in mind that in emergency they could be used,
   but that was their prime purpose, I agree.

Q. Obviously if there is an emergency somebody might              open the
   gates. A. But the prime purpose.

Q. For the purpose of any calculation that was done, those
   gates did not feature in terms of determining the capacity?
   A . N o .V

Q. You have mentioned the width of various gates that you have
   had to deal with elsewhere. Am I right in saying that you
   mentioned one which is 1.7 metres and that was at Bramall
   Lane?   A. That is so.       â                             ;o.

Q. That is for a gate on a wooden stand, is it not? A. Not
- on a~ vrot3d-en-strand/'-'Iir'*s a -terrace very like* -tlrrs'â¢oneâ-a'nd *~
   the stand behind .has a lot of timber in one half of it.

Q. So that is obviously a consideration which certainly does
   not apply here?   A. Everything is analogous except at
   Bramall Lane there is a lot of timber in the stand.

Q. And, of course, there being a lot of timber, you have to
   have a quicker rate of escape?   A. Yes.

Q. And hence you have to have either more gates or wider gates?
   A. That is so.

Q. As far as the others at Bramall Lane are concerned, where
   I think you said it was 1.2 metres, I am not sure that the
   situation has yet been resolved, has it? Is there a safety
   certificate as far as Bramall Lane is concerned yet? A. I
   believe there isnât, but I donât know. I mean I have
   discovered since this incident that Bramall Lane didn't
   have one either.

Q. But am I not right in saying that Sheffield United Football
   Club - perhaos you as well - are urging for those gates,
   which are 1.2 metres, to be used as part of the normal
   route of escape? Isn't that right?    A. You say "are
   urging" now?

Q. Yes, the discussion is still going on. In other words, the
   position is not analogous to this at all In the case of
   Bramall Lane where you are talking about 1.2 metres, the
                                                                             1
                                        W. EASTWOOD

idea is that those gates are used as part of the recognised,
normal route of escape? A. Yes. Well, this is not now.
Going right back ten years or so, this was part of a
recognised picture.

But that is a totally different situation from the one
here?   A. Yes.

Can I ask you to look at 7.9.2 which deals with perimeter
fences in the gate. 7.9.2:    "Access points should be
controlled" - and the word used is "controlled" as opposed
to "manned" - "so that immediate access to the pitch or
perimeter track can be ensured in the event of an emergency"
Now, the vital thing about any perimeter gate is that that
should happen?   A.   Yes.




                             /Q. And that there should be

                                            W. EASTWOOD


Q. And that there should b e extreme vigilance and speed in
   opening the gates if the necessity arises? - A. Yes.

Q.      And it is essential that everybody involved in operating
        the system should be fully aware of that? - A. Yes.

O. Can I ask you please in the core bundle to have a look
   at 240. It is a letter dated the 8 th of Hay. I raise
   this with you because it does rather appear that you
   are taking a slightly different view as to the function
   of the perimeter gate in that, latter, because what you
   say in the penultimate sentence on that page:

              "It is our view that in the event of an
              emergency spectators can be evacuated
              quickly enough by the gates on to the pitch
             'and by the nor::ial exit gates at the rear."

        It is certainly an   unhappy way of phrasing it, isn't it?
        - A. Yes, a rather daft letter in a sense.

0. Because it really rather sounds there as though you are
   putting pri;ne emphasis o n the gates on to the pitch and
   then going on to a           secondary basis dealing with    the
   ezcit gates at the rear. The position being that             really
   you-donLt;take the gates -on the pitch âintc^aocQia^.^-^r.

              LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Ive looked at this this
        morning and at the letter to which this was a reply.

               THE UITiiESS: Oh sorry, we are back to Sheffield
        'Wednesday. I thought we v/ere still at Sheffield United.
        I am sorry, I am with the wrong Club.

q   .              ::r . ilULLER: The position is simply this, isn't
        it, that in considering escape you really should net
        be taking into account the perimeter cate at all, should
        you? - A. I did. You see I explained this morning with
        this drawing that my own calculations for the secondary
        ueans of escape this was me satisfying myself. I did
        take account of the fact that the gates were there
        and the 0 minutes 29 seconds or:whatever it was that
        you worked cue, when I added in that third gate became
        whatever it is, 5h minutes/ so I had been taking into
        account" the'^'act that with my quick opening device in
        position, which-it was going to be any d i y ,-it was -
        i n S f a c t several months away, we could be sure that it
        would be possible to open the gates.




                                                                        123

           :ii of course that reduces it. The acre gates you put
         in the more it is going to reauce it? - A. Yes.

    o. But v/hat I am suggesting to you, Dr. Eastwood, that
       even without including those gates, the radial gates as
       a secondary means of escape, which of course is a very
       unlikely eventuality, are perfectly adequate bearing in
       mind the kind of Stand you have got? - A. It is a very
B      aood Stand from that point of view.

         Can I then turn to another matter. In 1981 there w c:o
         an incident of which you have some knowledge at a Cup
         Final between Wolves and Tottenham Hotspur and the
         position is this, isn't it, that although that incident
         had occurred, there was no suggestion or complaint at
         that time by anyone about the width of the gate? - A. So
         far as I know there was no suggestion.

    Q. You certainly at that time fron what you knew, you weren't
       saying:  "Well perhaps we ought to have wider gates than
       we have already got"? - A. Mo.

    0 . Can I then go to another matter as far as that is
         concerned. As early as 1981 you talked about this
D        embryo, the plan of having separate turnstiles for each
         part of the terrace? - A. Yes .

    Q. Mow that was something which wasi private as it were
       between you and the Club? - A. Yes.                           .:    -

    Q. It was not something that was made known to the Local
       Authority? - A. I did not make it known.
E
    0 . well it certainly does not appear in any of the correspondence
         And at that time in 1981 when you are emphasising that
         of course control is important and people were appreciating
         that control was important, there was no suggestion was
         there that you are aware of, that people were having
         difficulty in controlling people in numbers going into any
         of those pens? - A. The pens had not appeared at the time
         of the Spurs, incident.

    0. But they subsequently appeared in 1901 and when they were
       put in in 1981 you were not saying to anybody on the
       Working Party, nor as far as you were aware was anybody
       saying to the Working Party: "Look, we have got problems
       with controlling people getting into these pens"? - A. l!o,
       I was not saying that. You will know that there -/as
       correspondence as to how well the pens were worKing anc
       indeed' the Chief Constable went to look and there are
       references in the Working Party ilinutes that they appear
       to be working well up to to the moment and so on.

    Q.   You see if there had been concern on your part or on the
         part of the Club .oron the part of the Police about controllint
H
                                                                    124

not it complied with the technicalities of the Green code?
- A. Yes.

May I give you one example?  I take it very shortly.  It
was within your knowledge that the width of the perimeter
o-ates rightly or wrongly, had been a conscious and
deliberate decision of the certifying authority? - A. Yes.

Had been discussed at some length and the two opposing
views considered? ~ A. Yes.:

And they had decided in their wisdom that the gates should
be less than the recommended guide? - A. Yes.

They having expressed their satisfaction with that position,
did you believe that the effect of the certificate was to
override that satisfaction and to impose an absolute legal
obligation on you and your clients? - A. I believed^that
the effect of a certificate was to ratify the decision to
leave the gates.

And looking at paragraph 15 and the full context and the
words that were omitted the last line with the words and
in all cases to the satisfaction of the Council did you
believe that if you had a decision, for example, on the
width of the gate which was to the satisfaction of the
Council that you could lav/fully act on that satisfaction?
- A. I did. >

     MR. GLASGOW:   Excuse me one second.   Thank you
very much. Dr. Eastwood.

            Cross-examined by MR. WOODWARD :

Dr. Eastwood, yo.u held a continuing retainer from the club,
did you not? - A. No, sir.   I was retained from time to time
throughout this period.

I see. - A. It would be wrong to say I had a continuing
retainer.

But there was no other consulting engineer acting on behalf
of the club throughout this period, was there, in relation
to these matters about which you have spoken? - A. No, no.

And the appointment or your part begins by documentation
by document page 7 in the bundle, 1st December, 1978,
commissioned to act on our behalf in our dealings with
the club, and that is indeed what you did? - A. Can I
just come back, please, to your previous question? There
was another engineer employed on some works in the club
during my period of office.

 Any of the works to which we have been giving our attention
 here? - A. No, no.

                                Did you stay down on the track or did you go back to the
                                Control Room?   A.    After the game had been stopped,
                                I immediately went down to the Control Room and then
                                returned to the pitch and requested Mr. Duckenfield.
                                When I was leaving the Control Room I can remember
                                P.C. Bichard asking for an ambulance or a couple of
                                ambulances to be on stand-by.    When I got down on to
                       B        the pitch, I could see. the people distressed against
                                the fence who were obviously injured, and there were
                                obviously many of them, and an ambulance ---    Excuse
                                me.

                           Q.   You realised,   I think ---

                                     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:       Just a second,   he wanted to
                                complete something.

                                     THE WITNESS:   One ambulance or two ambulances were
                                not going to be enough.

                           Q.        MR.   PHILLIPS:    So what did you do about that?

                                        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Officer, would you like a
                       D        short break?      A.   No, thank you, my Lord.     I didn't
                                have a radio.     My radio was on the desk.     I wanted some
                                ambulances.      I went and I approached a Sergeants and I
                                took his radio off him.      I called the-Control Room and
                                I was acknowledged.      I asked for a fleet of ambulances.
                                I could see at the back of the Leppings Lane Stand that
                                people were just standing there, looking but on to the
                                field as though nothing was happening.        I had realised
                                that people were jammed against the fence, that Officers
                                were having great difficulty in getting them out of the
                                gates and that the only relief would be if people would
                                move b a c k .  I asked for tannoy messages to" be passed -to
                                tell people to move back and I think I asked for some
                                cutting equipment for the f e n c es .   If I didn't ask for
                                it then somebody who was immediately in my vicinity
                                d i d , but I seem to think it was m e .

                           Q.        MR. PHILLIPS:     Were   those tannoy messages played?
                                Did you hear any?      A.     I cannot say I heard any.

                           Q. Did you make any further request for tannoy messages?
                              A.   Yes, I did.   As I stood I noticed that the people
                              were still standing there, there was still no movement
                              and I asked for further messages to be passed, keep
                              passing messages to tell people to move back, and while
                              I stood there and watched I could see no movement at
                              all at the back of those pens.

                           Q.   In response to your later request were any tannoy
                                messages played to your recollection?    A.   I can't
                                recall messages being played.    I can't recall that I
                       H        could hear them but I don't know whether I would hear
                                them on the field of play anyway.

                                       MR. JACKSON: My Lord, it would have been, or will
                                 be my submission that anyone who had considered the
                                 possibility of crushing at the Leppings Lane end would have
                                 instantly realised that the gate at the front was pathetically
                                 inadequate.

                                       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: I follow that point. As I think
                       B         I have said earlier in this Inquiry, I don't think I am
                                 going to require alot-of persuasion  about that.

                                       MR. JACKSON:     I â a m 'obliged,ny Lord.

                                       M R . WOODWARD: Sir, I do apologise for interrupting,
                                 but if the Officer    is being askedthat men on thefield
                                 should have done something and it is being put that things
                       C         could have been done, sir in fairness to the Officer perhaps
                                 Mr. Jackson would put what it is precisely suggested those
                                 Officers should do. He has not answered that point.

                                       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: I was raising that point and
                                 then I rather think Mr. Jackson shifted his ground on to
                                 saying that the gate was inadequate.

                       D               MR. JACK SOLI: My Lord, may I make it very clear.
                                 My point is exactly the opposite of that which apparently
                                 I have given the impression.

                                       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Oh by all means let's see v;hat
                                 it is.

                                       MR. JACKSOil: The Officers were distressed; they were
                           E     standing apparently doing nothing; there was nothing they
                                 could do in the circumstances, but the picture that would
                                 be presented to the fans would be a large number of Officers
                                 doing nothing at a time of emergency. That would be why
                                 the Officer would receive and his colleagues would receive
                                 abuse from fans thinking they were doing nothing.

                                       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Again I am not wanting to stop
                           F     you but I think that is pretty clear, isn't it?

                                       MR. JACKSON: That is v/hat I thought.         That iswhy
                                 I am rather surprised at the intervention.

                                       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: With Mr. VJoodward I thought
                                 you were suggesting there was some special technique for
                                 getting people out of a tennis court gate if they all got
                           G     crushed inside, but you are not saying that.

                                        MR. JACKSON:   I am obliged.

                               Q. Mr. Murray, may I take just one aspect of the evidence that
                                  you have given and extend it a little.

                       H                We have heard throughout the Police evidence that
                                  this was unprecedented the crush at the Leppings Lane

                           Q. What I am suggesting to you is that those gates should
                              have been manned in order to encourage people to do
                              precisely that? - A. Well, I cannot see, if you are going
                              to lock the gate back, there does not seem to be any point
                              in manning it, sir.

                           Q. Precisely the reason I am putting it to you.  In order
                      B       that the Officers who are there will keep the gangways
                              clear to make sure that people do not pack up right to the
                              back, but go through, into the next pen?

                                   LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Mr. Muller, do you mind my
                              asking how this matter is related to the Fire Service?

                                   MR. MULLER:    It relates to the situation that the
                              Fire Service was concerned with matters of egress from the
                              pen and, of course , they were responsible, with others on
                              the Working Office rs Committee, for allowing that position
                              to arise which did arise, namely that there was the gate
                              at the back and it was part, as the Fire Service
                              understood it and said to the Working Party, that it was
                              to be a condition of those gates being there, and only
                      D       those gates being there, that would be under the manning
                              of the Police:

                           Q. Can I now ask you about another matter. Can you help me,
                              please, am I right in understanding that it would be no
                              later than about seven minutes past three when you were on
                              the pitch itself or the perimeter of the pitch and then
                              realised that people were being crushed up against the
                              perimeter fence? - A. Seven or eight minutes past three,
                              yes.
                           Q. And at that time you say, âI think I asked for cutting
                              equipment"? - A. Yes, sir.

                           Q. Am I right in understanding that, although you do not
                              specifically remember it, you would not at all be
                              surprised if, in those circumstances, you would be asking
                              urgently for just such equipment? - A. I think I did.  If
                              I did not,-someone else very close to me did.

                           Q. But was it something that struck you as being obvious that
                              was required at that time? - A. To get the fences down.

                           Q. And can you help us at all, from anything you may have
                              discovered since or otherwise, if that happened about
                              seven minutes past three, how it came about that it was
                              not until 14 minutes past three - some seven minutes later
                              - that somebody was asking the Fire Brigade to provide
                              cutting equipment? - A. Well, my enquiries revealed, sir,
                              that the first request was made to our Cilaywheels Lane
                              Depot and an Accident Unit was directed, but I think that
                              would have been travelling from some distance.   Presumably

                                at Claywheels Lane there was no cutting equipment
                                available.

                           Q. Was it within your knowledge, as a Superintendent of
                              Police, that the Fire Brigade had all manner of cutting
                              equipment which could, if required, have cux down that
                       B      fence very quickly, without causing direct injury from the
                              cutting to people in the pen? - A. I would certainly hope
                              so sir.
                                  .




                           Q. But did the Police have similar cutting equipment? - A.
                              It is to my knowledge that we do have power tools in
                              Accident Units and, if there had been an Accident Unit on
                              standby at Claywheels Lane, as there could well have been,
                              he could have been there very, very quickly indeed.

                           Q. It depended, therefore, on there being such a unit
                              available at the time? - A. It did, indeed, sir, yes:;

                                            Cross-examined by HR. MAXWELL:

                           Q.        HR. HAXWELL:   Hr. Hurray, your understanding was
                       D        that it was the responsibility of the Police and the Club,
                                by its stewards, to monitor the fans that went into pens 3
                                and 4? - A. I think it is a general responsibility, sir.

                           Q. And that was done for the purposes of seeing whether there
                              was overcrowding, not by counting heads, but by a visual
                              check? - A. Yes, sir

                           Q. And that would be generally true in the event of any kind
                              of problem arising on the terraces, that you would carry
                              out that visual check? - A. Yes, sir.

                           Q. Having in mind they are fighting or drinking or any sort
                              of disorderly behaviour? - A. If there is something wrong,
                              I would expect a Police Officer to bring it to our
                              attention or a steward to bring it to a Police Officerâs
                              attention.

                           Q. Thank you.  Now, in the context of your understanding, I
                              want to draw your attention to this, that it was evidently
                              part of the standing instructions that there was to be
                              a pre-match briefing of stewards? - A. Yes, sir.

                           Q. Hr. Duckenfield thought that you might be able to assist
                              the Inquiry about that. Was there on this occasion a
                              pre-match briefing of stewards? - A. The Inspector in
                              charge of the four stands briefed the si&wa.rds working in
                              those particular areas.

                           Q. So my enquiries should be put better to an Inspector
                              rather than to yourself? - A. Well, the Inspector of the
                              stand that you are interested in, yes, sir.

                                              T. BICHARD

Q. Did you know why you were calling the Fire Brigade?
   What I am getting at is did you know what you wanted
   from the Fire Brigade?   A.  I was paying attention to
   what Sergeant Goddard was doing in relation to the
   Brymac and obtaining the cutters, and when the realisation
   was that he was not successful in getting those from
   Claywheels Lane, I offered to contact the Fire Services.

Q. But the Fire Brigade would want to know what they were
   dealing with, would they not?  It was not a fire, for
   example, and they would ---   A. Certainly I can remember
   passing a message that we required the Fire Service
   and for the Fire Service to bring cutting equipment.

         Hr. COLLINS:  I think that is all I need ask you,
   thank you, Mr. Bichard.

                Cross-examined by Mr. H Y T N E R :

Q. Mr. Bichard, I want to investigate, if I may, just what
   your duties were.  You clearly were an expert in
   investigating the monitors and the cameras?   A. I think
   'expert' might be an exaggeration;  experienced.

Q. Experiened.   Were yourduties simply to operate your
    machinery, your technology, under supervision and
    direction, or did you have duties which derived from
    your own initiative?    A.   The supervision of the monitors
    and the operation of them is my initiative.    If I could_
    perhaps explain:  if I see an incident or notice something
  / on the monitors, I will bring it to the attention of
    the Control Room staff.    Obviously if they see something
    in particular, they will mention it to me.

Q. So this may be two ways.  Somebody may say to you, "Zoom
   in on the centre of the South Stand, there's something
   happening over there", and you will do it?   A.  Yes.

Q. You, on the other hand, if you are watching the monitors,
   may 5spot something and zoom in yourself? A. Yes.

Q. And if you can see it, youwill then say to somebody
   "There is trouble there"?    A.  Yes.

Q. Is there always an officer of the rank of Inspector or
   above in the Control Room?    Are there occasions when
   the senior officer there is Sergeant Goddard?  A. There
   are odd occasions when Sergeant Goddard, P.C. Ryan and
   myself are in the Control Room.

Q. But would it be normal for the officer in charge of the
   game or the commander on the ground to be in the Control
   Room?   A. It would be normal for Superintendent Murray
   to be present.



                                                                   130

                                       T. BICHARD


Q. Now one other matter I would like to ask you about. We
   have been provided with the VHF Channel 1 tape. I don't
   know whether you have had an opportunity of seeing it? -
   A. No sir.

Q. I think it may well be that this records what you say
   to Snig Hill, and I put it to you, it is at page 16? - A.
   May I have an opportunity to look at it?

Q. If there is one available. You see in the top left-hand
   corner it gives the time between 15.13 and 15.14 at the
   bottom. Have you got that? - A. Yes, I have that.

Q. If you look at the right-hand side, just over halfway down
   it says:

                               "Hillsborough ground control could
                               you contact the Fire Service,
                               Fire Service, we want some
                               hydraulic cutting equipment to
                               the ground to cut some of the
                               metal fences. Fire Service urgent
                               required Leppings Lane over".

   Then the reply comes, am I right:

          "Roger Fire Brigade
          urgent up to Leppings
          Lane Roger".

   A. Yes.

Q. Am I   right in saying v/hat we see on the right is   what you
   were   saying? - A. That is correct, yes.

Q. Therefore no mention there, if this transcript is right,
   about anybody breaking down the gates or anything? - A. No.

Q. And what is important, a specific mention by you of Leppings
   Lane? - A. Yes, I did.

Q. Have you any idea, because subsequently we shall hear, that
   when a message was sent from Snig Hill, the people at
   Snig Hill apparently did not know where the FireBrigade
   was required? - A. Well it is quite clear, it is the
   Leppings Lane end of the ground. Obviously the Fire Service
   are not going to bring their fire equipment, the tender
   actually into the ground. They are going to bring it to
   the nearest point, it is the actual cutting equipment that
   we would require in the ground and that would be dealt with
   on the ground.
Q. But your recollection certainly accords with that, not only
   did you say Leppings Lane but the person at Snig Hill
   confirmed Leppings Lane? - A. That is right.


                                                                    131

Q. Can you help us about that, Hr. Jackson? - A. Yes, that
   would be Officers who were summoned for Operation Support
   coming from the various Divisions.

Q. Then I think, at 3.17, over the page, ue have a reference
   to Hammet, RHSH Casualty put on standby for large numbers
   of casualties? - A. Yes.

Q.      Canyou help us about that, Hr. Jackson? - A. Yes, during
        the implementation of the major incident, I asked for
        certain additional things to be done, such as turning out
        the Head of CID to look into what had actually happened
        and also to make sure the casualty....

Q.           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Sorry, was that because you
        thought that it had resulted from misbehaviour? - A.. Well,
        I thought basically that we would need to have the matter
        investigated when, quite clearly, we had a number of
        people injured, sir.

q   .        HR. COLLINS-    Ithink the other relevant message
        that we might look at is over the page, on page 12. At
        3.19 there is a reference to cutting equipment.   "GC21
        with cutting equipment to scene. GF11 COMMS vehicle.
        GBS1 Leppings Lane to block road." GC2/21. Is that a
        Police reference? - A. Can you just tell me where that one
        is?
Q. I am sorry, it is on page 12. It is the next page from
   one we were just looking at about RHH. Have you got it?
   It is 3. IS, about four lines down.  "GC21 with cutting
   equipment to scene?" - A. Yes, that would be a Police
   veh icle.
Q. Because              I think we heard from Hr. Duckenfiela that the â
        Police garage was communicated with in relation to cutting
        e q u i p m e n t rat-her than the Fire Br igade initially? â¢--Av;
        Yes, I heard him saying that.

Q. And is GC21 a Police garage or someone from a Police
   garage or is it just a Police car? - A. I think that would
   be a Police car â the Police car with this equipment.

                                                          W. JACKSON


Q.                LORD JUSTICE.TAYLOR:      Was any cutting equipment brought
        to bear upon these fences that afternoon? - A. No, I think
        what happened, my Lord, was that when we implemented the Major
        Incident Plant the Force Operations room have certain
        responsibilities.          In those responsibilities they turn out the
        e s s e n t i a l services, the ambulances and the Fire Brigade. ;,I
        think on this occasion, having reviewed the situation, the
        Force Control room did not immediately ask for the Fire
        Brigade.          I think we had another call for the Fire, Brigade and
        we asked again. That was how the calls went out.

q   ,         MR. COLLINS: I think the Fire Brigade was not in fact
        summoned until... - A. 15.13.

Q.            LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I am sorry, that did not quite
        answer my question, which was, and I put it more specifically,
        didany cutting equipment ever get to bear on these fences? -
        A. Other than the     Fire Brigade, no, my Lord. â 

q               MR. COLLINS:   I donât think the Fire Brigade did,      in
        fact?

G.              LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Did any?

q             MR. COLLINS: It had already been kicked in by then as
        far as it could be. Were you were - you could-see, no doubt;
        you were up in the control room - Police Officers and others,
        and fans, trying to kick the wire in? - A. Yes, I could. I
        was not quite sure when the Fire Brigade had.arrived because
        of the crowd whether they had still used some of their
        equipment.

Q. Yes, I follow. Effectively, whatever could have.been achieved
   5 y getting the fencing out of the way had been'achieved before
   the Fir.e Brigade came, as I understand? - A. Yes, that is :â â â â 
   correct.
                LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      They were sent for at 3.13?

             MR. COLLINS:   3.13 or 3.14, and they arrived at 3.17, I
        think, the first fire tender.

                MR. MULLER:     3.22.

                MR. COLLINS:      3.22.   I am obliged:

Q       Mr. Jackson, did you remain in the control room during this
        stage when we have been looking through these various
        messages? Were you in the control room all this time? - A.
        Yes I did.   I went down to the pitch a little later on to
        speak to Mr. Nesbit.

    q   That was when you saw him arriving on "the pitch, was it, and
        obviously taking charge on the pitch? -A. It was a little
        bit after that.

    Q. Were you aware of him taking charge? -A. Yes, sir.                133

     pressing for this, as far as you know, because they were
     quite satisfied with the existing means of control? - A. I
     don't know about that situation, I am sorry.

Q. Can I then ask you about another aspect. The perimeter fence
   round the pitch, the track perimeter fence and the gates in
   it, am I right in understanding that the Police never regarded
   those gates as being a means through which the whole of the
   pens would be evacuated? - A. I think the evacuation in
   normal circumstances can be one of two ways depending on
   the circumstances, whether on to the pitch or through the
   various exits.

Q. The exits being through the tunnel or through the gate in
   the radial fences? - A. Yes.

q. T h o s e would be the norual means of .escape.;if .there-was an
   emergency? - A. Yes. -

Q. N o w -as far as the â perimeter fence- -Is concerned, and .the gate ;
                                                                       .
                                                                       :r.
â ' in that, that was only considered, am I right ' by the Police,
   as being a means of taking out a few.people if the need arose,
   not a means of taking out the full 1,000 .people? - A. I would
   accept that. â /

            MR. COLLINS: Sir, I don't know whether it helps my
     learned friend and I am trying purely to help, we will be
     calling Mr. Calvert who is the Police Liaison Officer with
     the Ground between 1979 and 1987 .. He. will be..the^ Officer
     who can deal -with;all these matters in'conjunction with           ,â¢
     the production of all the relevant Minutes of the working
     Party.
             It would seem, as I understand it, that Mr. Jackson
     was' not directly in charge of -this in the sense, that he .was- .
     n o t directly1involved and this was something whieh was
     clearlv delegated to others and Mr. Calvert I think would
     be the*right man to deal with this aspect of the matter.

           MR. MIJLLER:   I shall do it" in that way.

Q. Then there is just one other matter I want to ask you about..
   Could you have a look please at the log to which you were
   referred to earlier on and particularly at page 12. Can
   you help me to interpret that. That is. at 19-minutes-past-3,
   am I right, there is an entry in relation to cutting equipÂ­
   ment? - A. Yes.

Q. Does that mean that that is when it has been called for
   or when it is actually on its way, or v/hat does it mean?
   -~A. I think that means when it is supposedly on its way.

q. would one expect to find in this log anywhere the request
   for such equipment. I say that because I confess I cannot
   find it? - A. If we call through the extended incident

                                                                  134

                            Q. When the 1985 proposals were being considered and going
                               through there was a suggestion at one stage from the
                               Police that there should be a second gate in the radial
                               fences. - A. I have seen that on the papers.

                            Q. Was that something that you initiated, that suggestion?
                               - A. I   have looked at it and I will be
                                                   â¢   *â¢    â¢        * ouitehonest, * I
                               cannot remember initiating it.    I can remember it now
                      B        but it   was not one ofmy main priorities.

                            Q. Can you remember whatthe specific purpose     of   the
                               suggestion was? - A. Not really, no.

                            Q. Go to page 265 and 6. Notes of an officer working party,
                               You were not present. - A. Mo.

                            Q. The matter I would iust like your help with is on page
                               266, Letter I, a reference to the gates in the pitch
                               perimeter fence being for both security access and
                               emergency egress purposes. - A. Yes.

                            0. Was that your understanding? - A. Yes.  I heard the
                               comment about the gates and I have always considered
                       J)      the gates were used for both purposes

                            Q. Did you' giver .any thought as to what emergencymight ' :c -vv
                                occur at that end of the ground? - A. One of the reasons
                                I have seen the gates used for is when there has been
                                fighting on- the terraces and I have also seen it used
                                when there has been a flare discharged, an emergency ships
                              / flare discharged on the terraces, which has caused
                                total chaos. '

                            Q. And has that resulted in large numbers of people being
                               evacuated on to the pitch?- A. We have certainly brought
                               them out.  I would not say large numbers.

                            Q. Because we now know that on the day this disaster occurred
                               the gates were not large enough for people to come out
                               either quickly or in any numbers.   Is that not something
                               you have considered beforehand?- A. When we have had to
                               use them for any purpose in the past they have been
                               adequate for bringing the numbers out we wanted to bring
                               out.  Wie have brought them out to transfer them round
                               from,one pen to the other when they have got themselves
                               into the wrong area of the ground and certainly it has
                               been adequate.

     fences?  Could you please turn to 153 in the bundle?
     Now, I appreciate that you v/ere not present at that
     meeting.  It was the meeting at which the radial fences
     were first approved af in 1981, is that right, by the
     working party and the stipulation was made that they
     should be under Police control?- A. T h a ; is the record, yes.

0. And it was of course for the Police, once that had been
   drawn to their attention, to carry out that instruction?
   - A. Yes.

Q.    To control it. Were you aware when you were trying or
     when the Police weretrying to interpret that of the
     way in which the Green Guide at that time, that is to
     say, in 1981, dealt with the question of controlling
     the perimeter gates? -A. Mot offhand.

Q. You see, if we look at the Green Guide, and I do not
   want to be tedious about it but I must draw your
   attention to it since I asked the question, what it
   says at 792 is access points should be controlled -
   this is perimeter gates - so that immediate access
   to the pitch or perimeter track can be ensured in
   the event of an emergency. - A. The perimeter gates
   were controlled'.

Q.   They    were controlled and how were they controlled? . .
     - A. The perimeter gates always had a Police Officer
     on the track.

0/ Yes.  What was happening, when it came to the question
   of control in relation to perimeter gates, the requirement
   for control was carried out by having an Officer in the
   immediate vicinity of the gate? -A. Yes.

0. N o w , in the context of that Green Guide, a further
   requirement for controlling another gate is imposed
   on the Police? - A. I do not think we ever understood
   it as that.

0. What I am asking you, you see, is why when the word
   control is used in that way in relation to the perimeter
   gate you applied a different meaning to it when it came
   to the radial gate? - A. I do not think we, understood it
   as an evacuation gate.  Merely an access gate.   Certainly
   the senior Officers who attended I am sure did not believe
   it to be an evacuation gate, merely an access gate.

0. If the position arose that the tunnel was blocked, which
   could happen, I suppose, could not it? - A. Yes.

0. And you realised in the Green Guide there had to be.an.....
   alternative means of escape? - A. Yes.




                                                                     136

People would have to be taken to left and right through
those radial gates, would not they? - A. The perimeter
gates.

Through the perimeter gates? - A. Yes, the perimeter ....

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      No, no, you are at crossÂ­
purposes. - A. Sorry.

He is talking about the gates at the top of the radial
fences. - A. Yes, sir.  I am saying he is talking about
evacuation through there.  I am saying the evacuation,
as far as we were concerned, would be on to the pitch
if we had to.

     MR. MULLER:   You are suggesting the alternative
route would be through the perimeter gates.  Is that
       - A. We would use them.

If the perimeter gates were to be envisaged as a means
through which the whole of the pen should be evacuated
in an emergency then the Green Guide required that'it
should be 1.1 metre wide even in 1975, did not it? - A.
It did, sir.

Were not you then concerned about that if that is how
vou saw'it? -A. No, sir, I was not concerned.  We have
heard that the gates on either end would be used for
evacuation in an emergency.

Either end of what? - A. Of the ground.

Yes. - A. And they would be and these gates were put in
and our understanding of control is that if they were
locked or closed there would be a Police Officer behind
them and that was the case and is the case and if they
were open they would be open for people to flow through.

Can I iust understand? Are you saying that it was the
P o l i c e ' understanding
                     that if the tunnel became blocked
the alternative means of escape for all the people who
were in pens 3 and 4 was to be through the perimeter
gate? âA. That would be one of the uses.  You have brought
these up.  Obviously you would.  You would use whatever
means possible.

But did you not appreciate, the point I am putting to you,
that "if a n y b o d y , including the Police, were contemplating
that the perimeter gate could in any circumstances be used
to evacuate all the people in those pens ....

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I do not think^that is v/hat is.,
being said, Mr. Muller.   As I understand it - we have been
through this a number of times - v/hat the Officer as sayin
                          QUESTION                EI GHT

Why was no public address announcement made - either informing
the fans as to what was happening, asking for their help or for any
medical personnel at the ground to help - until 3.30 pm?

C hief Superintendent Duckenfield South Yorkshire Police indicates th at instructions
w ere given for tannoy m essages be transm itted for fans to e a s e back in the pens in
the Leppings Lane terraces, also for fans to clear the playing area, the latter because
they w ere ham pering the rescue attem pts. His impression is that he had asked for all
doctors and m edical staff to got to th e Leppings Lane end of the ground, and that as
a result of this request the perceptive fans in the crowd m ust realise there w as a
difficult situation.

T h e reason the announcem ent to inform the fans that the gam e had been abandoned
w as delayed due to the need to keep the routes clear which w as one of the duties of
the site com m ander. T h e likelihood of the fans leaving the ground once a tannoy
m essage had been transm itted w as a serious consideration for him and their leaving
the ground m ay ham per the rescue. T h ere w as also the fe a r of an adverse reaction
by the fans.

and drove to the perim eter fence close to gate 3. T h ere w as no call for doctors and
nurses on the public address system until nearly 3 .3 0 pm. Nevertheless, as the
m inutes ticked past, som e of them cam e onto the pitch to help of their own accord
w hen they saw the casualties and the am bulance and realised the gravity of the
situation. M any fans also worked prodigiously in attem pts to revive the dead and the
dying, in som e cases their own relatives and friends. Artificial respiration, mouth to

but usually in vain. Those capable o f survival mostly cam e round of their own accord.

Th e police feared violence m ight result on top o f the existing disaster. Accordingly,
they deployed a large num ber of officers to form a line across the width of the pitch at

Lord Justice Taylor - Recommendation 57

W ithin the control room, there should be a public address system to com m unicate with
individual areas outside and inside the ground, with groups of areas or with the w hole
ground. Im portant announcem ents should be preceded by a loud signal to catch the
attention of the crowd despite a high level of noise in the ground. This arrangem ent
should be prominently advertised on every program m e sold for every match.

Q.       Did you feel then that he had the responsibility    and not you
         to take the lead, as it were, on the pitch, andto   sort out
         the situation? - A. He was the senior Officer on    the pitch,
         sir, and he in my view was taking command of the    situation
         there, until Mr. Nesbitt arrived.

Q.       The sad fact is that he did not achieve ve'ry much, did he, Mr.
         Duckenfield.   It was not until Superintendent Nesbitt arrived
         on the scene that anything was achieved? - A. In fairness to
         Mr. Jackson., he came back at one point to see me when I
         implemented the major incident plan, and he then returned, but
         Mr. Nesbittobviously was in uniform.

G. Yes, I see.  Now. what about use of the Tannoy? - A. Use was
   made of the Tannoy by P.C. Ryan to ask people to move back, in
   addition to the Officers indicating for people to push back in
   the pens.

Q.       What message was sent over? - A. I donât know, sir.

Q.        Did you not give instructions? - A. Sir, in the crisis
         situation I was issuing instructions for ail manner ofthings
         to be done, and that was one instruction which I expected to
         be carried out,

0. Yes, out what was your instruction? - A. My instruction was to
   give Tannoy messages for people to ease back.

Q. To ease back where? - A. Towards the tunnel. I did not say
   specifically the tunnel.  I said, "Ease back".'

0. We have heard some evidence that a Tannoy message at some
   stage was also given for people to clear off the pitch. Do
   you know anything about that? - A. Mo. sir.

Q. What about the possibility of the game going ahead? Were you
   thinking- in :terms :of whether the game should, be postponed
   sitogether .or...whether it might be possible .to ;stari.' it- again
   after-a,period?     .A. At that-stage, sir J     - -

q    .        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Forgive me, at which stage are you
         telling us? You say "at that stageâ . Which stage are you
         referring to? - A. May I ask for guidance as to what time you
         are asking me about?

G.           -MR. COLLINS:   At what stage was it you were getting or
         you instructed Mr. Ryan to broadcast that the fans should go
         back in the terraces? - A. I can't be specific, sir. About
         the time that we have appreciated the people on the pitch, but
         I canât be specific. There were many instructions given very
         quickly.
 Q       You say that you c a n ât recall now instructions to clear the
         pitch.  Can I ask you to look at page 13 of your statement.
         Chief Superintendent? - A. Yes, sir.

 Q       You have just been dealing with your calling for operation
                                                                     138

                              support. - A. Yes.

                           Q. For instructions to implement the major disaster plan. - A.
                              Yes .

                           Q. To warn hospitals, etc. which of course was at a fairly early
                              stage that you did this. You reacted quickly, you told us.,
                     g        and you sent these messages out. You say this:

                                   "Whilst all this was taking place I asked Police
                                   Constable Ryan to continue broadcasting for calm among
                                   the supporters and for them to clear the pitch so we
                                   could determine what people were injured and where
                                   because the fans were milling around and obstructing the
                                   viewâ .

                              - A. Yes, sir.

                           0. So it appears you did give instructions for a broadcast to
                              clear the pitch? - A. I misunderstood what you said. The
                              situation was one of the difficulties in the situation you
                              describe is that with so many people coming on the pitch, and/
                              this could link in with the suggestion you have raised that
                      D       people did not know what they were doing, there were fans on
                              the pitch who were hampering rescue attempts because you just
                              couldn't see who was injured or who was not injured who might
                              want attention, because the pitch was filling up, and we
                              wanted people to move away so we could see who required
                              attention.   ,

                           Q. Where were they supposed to move to? - A, To the sides.

                           Q,. Which, sides and where? - A. Either side    the North Stand side
                               and the South Stand side.

                              There.was,a public order problem if they moved to the South
                              Stand- s i d e w a s .not there, because they-would be brought up-'
                              against;..:.Nott.ingham- Forest fans in that- stand? -vAâ. Sir-in
                              situation such, as that I would :âhave .hoped that -a public order
                              problem may not have developed, although it is a possibility;
                              My concern...-

                           Q. Well, it did develop. - A. Yes. My concern was for the
                              injured and for those who required attention, and I could not
                              and I d onât think anybody else could, deal with the injured,
                              which was of prime importance, until people who could walk
                              could walk away from the situation.

                           Q. It did not occur to you there might be a number in shock? - A.
                              Very much so.

                           Q. And they would not be likely to respond, would they, to
                              requests to clear the pitch? - A. No, but there were a number
                              of Police Officers in a state of shock also.
                       H
                           Q. I know.   Were you aware of that at the time? - A. No, I was
                              not.

Q. As the situation developed there was a problem from the
   Nottingham. Forest end, the Kop, because fans were clearly
   annoyed by what they perceived to be Liverpool fans coming on
   the pitch and effectively, as they thought, doing a Heysel all
   over again? - A. I donât know of that, sir.

0. Did not you hear     it? - A. No, I can't commenton that.    I was
   engrossed in the     events that were taking place,and-chat was
   at the other end     of the ground.

0. But you were aware, were not you told by anyone, that there
   were problems with the Nottingham Forest end because they
   believed that the Liverpool fans were disrupting the game? -
   A. I was not told that, sir.

Q. Was not it obvious that might arise? - A. The obvious problems
   before my eyes, sir. was dealing with the situation as I saw
   it.
Q. I am not suggesting this is something you should have
   necessarily done immediately, but did there not ccme a time
   when you should have used the Tannoy to appeal for calm, to
   explain what was happening? - A. What would you suggest I
   explain to people?

Q. Explain that there were injuries, people had been hurt, and
   that that was what it was all about, and would people please
   remain calm and enable the injured to be treated ana ce
   attended to? - A. I took the view, sir. that on that occasion
   we said nothing. We would use the Tannoy to try and clear the
   pitch and we would say nothing to the crowd because it might
   cause a reaction.
Q. Saying, nothing did cause a reaction, did it not? It caused
   the Nottingham Forest fans to shout anc yeil and taunt
   L i v e r p o o l ? : A .- I;.disagree , -sir . â¢ That might have-been the 'â¢
   initial reaction from your perception. . My view-is that'my
   â¢decision-.to-tell no-one was. the ^correct decision to- ensure
   that the. emergency services could get in and out, that the
   routes were clear, and that was a correct operational decision
   on the day.
Q    Well, when was it you were first aware you might have some
     deaths on your hands? - A. I think at the time I went to see
     the FA in the board room at Sheffield Wednesday.

G. When was that? - A. It is difficult to be accurate, sir.

 0. At what stage? - A. I would suggest possibly half-past-3,
    shortly after, when all the major incident and operation was
    running.
 G. Was it at this stage you agreed the game should be postponed?
    - A. Yes, sir,

 G   I think Mr. Jackson was with you? - A. Yes.
                                                                           1 4 I

                                                                         D.G. DUCKENFIELD



                      Q. But you decided that the announcement should .not be made that
                         .there had been postponement, and the reason as I understand it â 
                         was you did not want people leaving until all the ambulances
                         had been able to get there and get away and ferry the injured
                         out? - A. There are two aspects to it, sic. The first one, as
                         you suggest, was that to announce that to the fans it was
              B          going to be postponed, some of them, even if we requested them
                         to stay, might leave immediately, and that could cause a
                         problem.   Furthermore, if the 54,000 fans or thereabouts in
                         the stadium decided to create a public order situation because
                         of the postponement of the game, because of their anger, then
                         I had not got the resources to deal with it, and I was playing
                         for time.

                      Q. Eventually we know that Kenny Dalglish made an appeal for
                         calm, and this was, I think, if I remember rightly, at 3.45? -
                         A. I am not sure of the time, sir. I had returned from the
                         board room, and Mr. Clough and Mr. Dalglish came to the Police
                         control box. They asked what they could do to assist, and Mr.
                         Dalslisn very kindly offered to pass a message to the
                         Liverpool fans, appealing for assistance and calm, and that
                         was appreciated.
              D
                      Q. The effect of your decision - I am not now saying whether it
                         was right or wrong - the effect of your decision on giving no
                         information was that for 40 minutes or thereabouts, between
                         about 5-past-3 and about 3.45. no-one in that stadium, none of
                         the fans knew what was happening? - A. Yes. sir;.

                      Q. Apart from what they could see happening on the pitch? - A.
                           Yes. sir.      I correct you.  I have an impression that I asked
                      ... for medical attention, andall doctors who were in the stadium
                           or medical staff to go to the Leppings Lane goal to assist.
                           Now. I. made a decision not to tell the crowd about the kick-
                           off, being postponed, but those who were watching and those who
                        .' were, per-cept-iye must have realised there was'a âdif fi c u l t '~
                           situation because ,;I -had asked for medical staff ana-âdoctors f" ;

                      0.   But there was still noise and shouting going on, certainly in
                           the earlier stages--of the disaster after the game was stopped,
                           was not there? - A. I don't know. sir. The reason I say that
                           is the control box is to some extent sound proof, ana the
                           Nottingham fans are at the furthest end of the ground.

                      0. Anvway, you say you think the decision not to tell was on
                         balance a better decision than one to tell? - A. I don't
                         think, sir.  I know.

                      0    Very well.  In fact, when you did make the announcement in due
                           course, some time around shortly after 4, the reaction of the
                           fans was wholly co-operative, was not it? - A . It was
                           excellent, sir. They applauded.

                  H   0. Once they were told the full circumstances, not only as you
                         say did they applaud but they sat quietly or stood quietly for
                         about 10 minutes before the dispersed in an orderly fashion? -

   A. I can't recall exactly what they did. I was relieved that
   there had not been an adverse reaction, and they then left the
   ground.

Q. I am not going to ask you about what went on later in the
   evening, because that really is not material to this Inquiry.
   Thank you. Chief Superintendent. That is all I would ask.

                  Q.      What instructions did you give to implement that duty and
                          responsi b i l i t y ? A. I personally did not give any
                          instructions but I understand that Force Control set    up
                          motorcycle escorts.

                  Q.           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I am sorry?   A.   I say I
             B            personally did not give any instructions but I understand
                          that Force Operations Room set up motorcycle escorts.

                  q   .        MR. KALLIPETIS:    Were you aware of that at the
                          time or was that something you learned subsequently?
                          A.   I have learned   that subsequently.

                  Q. Did you know at the time that one of the duties of the
                     Site  Commander was to provide adequate control of all
                     routes?   A.   Yes,  because that was one of the decisions
                     as to not to tell the crowd,to keep the routes clear.

                  Q.      Very sensibly keeping the crowd in the ground.     What
                          other instruction did you give to make sure the ambulances
                          could get in and out?   A.   I personally did not but I
             D            was being supported by the Force Operations Room/.

                  Q.       Although      you were not aware of that.                     A.    No,   sir.

                          You would accept, would you not, Mr. Duckenfield, that
                          it is essential for any emergency service, especially
                          the ambulance service, to have as much accurate detail
                          about the nature of the emergency they are dealing with
                          as soon as possible?    A.   Yes, sir.

                          Do you also know that under the Hillsborough Plan that
                          SYMAS had produced that the Chief Ambulance Officer
                          on site would be situated in the gymnasium to co-ordinate
                          the ambulance d u ti e s from there? A. I was not       ; -
                          specifically aware' of that, sir.

                  Q.       Did you know,          Mr. Duckenfield,          that ---

                          following that.'  He is there before any trouble blows
                          up?

                               MR. KALLIPETIS:   No, sir.   When the most senior
                          officer on site is directed to go to the gymnasium and
                          that is his station to co-ordinate the reception of
                          casualties, the assessment ---

  happened once the incident had blown up. Have you been able
  to identify any deficiencies as far as you can see it in the
  arrangements that were made either by the Police or by anyone
  else for that matter, for coping with the problem when it
  arose? -A. I think one of the big problems is in relation to
  an incident like this is the human element, and certainly the
  people that I saw on that day were extremely stressed, were
  extremely concerned. When I went on to the pitch we talked
  about fans being on the pitch and the possibility of the
  Police taking them off. That really was not an option,
  because the people I saw there were extremely concerned and
  did not know what they were doing. So really, the human
  element is the .thing that causes most concerned in a rescue
  attempt like that.

       In terms of deficiencies I would say in hindsight we
  should look at the improvements you can make such, as; I have
  suggested, the combined control room, different types of
  fences, perhaps in the control room we could have some sort
  of system where you press the button and it goes straight       -
  through to the Ambulance Service, straight through to the
  Fire Brigade. So those are issues I feel we could
  consider, but in terms of on the day my view is that
  everybody was doing what they possibly could under
  tremendous stress, under tremendous strain, under a great
  deal of confusion.

G. Can I ask you this.  It has been suggested that the Tannoy
   ought to have been used in a more positive fashion than it
   was? - A. Yes.

G. What do you say about that? - A. I listened to Mr. Duckenfield
   regarding that, and I do agree with him it is. a very, very ...
   difficult one,--.because if you start announcing over the Tannoy
   you: have injuries or fatalities, etc., then you could very
   likely cause- a problem and people: may panic,: and therefore. '
   it is a case of trying to do it as calmly and as
   professionally as possible, and I agree with that
   decision.

Q, In fact, nothing was said, was it, at least nothing to explain
   what was happening or why it was happening? - A. No.

G. The result :is .that certainly the Nottingham Forest fans at the
   other end, some of them anyway, were getting rather impatient
   with the Liverpool fans, because caused its own problems? - A.
   Yes, but I think that probably would be nothing like the
   problems that may have been caused if he did go over the air
   and he did say, "We have fatalities, injuries", we may have
   caused panic. So I think that option was probably the most
   preferable one.

Q. Did you think of it yourself as to whether or not you should
   use the Tannoy more, or was that something that was just left
   to Mr. Duckenfield? - A. The Tannoy was being used ;asking
   people to keep calm.

                                                              144

Q. Yes, but that was at a rather later stage, was not it, when
   Mr. Dalglish was asked or did send out a message, and that was
   about 3.56, I think? - A. I had a feeling the Tannoy was being
   used at some stage to tell people to keep calm.

Q.           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Mr. Jackson, I am not doubting
        what you say about that, but I just don't quite follow why
        there would be panic. Obviously if you said there was a bomb
        scare or something of that sort I can see that people might
        panic, but to tell the people at the other end of the ground
        or other parts of the ground that there had been some injuries
        at the terracing at the west end, some quite serious injuries,
        why would that cause people to panic do you think at the other
        end? - A. I think basically at the time, my Lord, we did what
        we thought was appropriate, and certainly in relation to that
        that was not thought about.

Q. You did just say you thought it might cause people to panic.
   I am wondering whether an announcement to that effect would
   for any reason make people panic? -A. I donât know; In
   hindsight it may not have done.

q   .            MR. COLLINS:      Surely it is more likely to cause trouble
        if you say nothing, and as indeed happened let the Nottingham
        Forest fans continue in the belief that the Liverpool fans
        were misbehaving themselves? - A. I think a bit later on when
        I went down to the pitch and spoke to Mr. Nesbit we then
        decided to make an announcement, but certainly during the
        rescue a t t e m p t we.certainly did not think in doing that, and
        p e r h a p s ,in hindsight in a wash up situation, it may have been
        advisable to do it.




                                       /Q. In fact, when you did make....

                                                           W. J A C K S O N


Q.       In fact, when you did make the announcement the Nottingham
         Forest fans behaved as one would have hoped they would have
         behaved initially, namely very well, did they not?
         A.   Yes, they did.

Q. Oo you think perhaps there may have been an attitude that
   football fans will not act reasonably in the decision
   that was made?   A.   I think if we look back at the
   history of football, you know, there are tremendous problems
   with it and sometimes these react on the individual in
   terms of what they should and should not say, and all I can
   say is that decisions were made in the h e s t i n t e r e s t s of
   everybody concerned.

Q.       I am sure but do you think there is, perhaps, in the Police
         a sub-conscious even thought that football fans cannot be
         trusted to behave reasonably and therefore one approaches .
         it on that basis?   A.   Well, I think I make it quite
         clear in my.standing order.that we are talking about s;
         minority;  we are not talking about th.e total football
         f ans .

Q.            LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    But in relation to.that
         minority, do you accept what counsel says?     A. Yes.

Q.M R . C O L L I N S :  Now, we have really brought you up
     to about quarter past four.   You were then talking or
     about then talked to the Chief Constable.   A.  Yes,
     sir, I did.

Q. How much longer did you stay at the ground?       A.    Chief
   Superintendent Mole arrived, I think it would be round
   a b o u t quarter to five time, and I then briefed him, told .
   him to take control of the ground and to co-ordinate
   matters.       I briefed him as to what had hapened and
   told him that I 'was going to Police Headquarters.

q   ,         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    So you really had taken over
         control then, had you?    I mean, if you were putting Mr.
         Mole in charge, that was really acting over and above
         Mr. Duckenfield.   A.  Yes, sir, I would say ostensibly
         I was in control then.

q    .         MR. COLLINS:              And you were responsible for the
         arrangements about the temporary mortuary in the gymnasium-,
         is that right?              A.     Yes.   What I did - I asked the
         Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t - Detective Chief Superintendent - to
         contact me and he contacted me about 3.35 p.m. on that day.
         I briefed him and asked him to come to the ground.                 I
         saw him there about 4 o'clock.                I told him to take charge
         of the temporary mortuary, to set that up.                I also told
         him to link up with Casualty Bureau and I told him to set
         up what we call our Home system for major investigations
         so that all the statements could be collated regarding the
         incident because quite clearly there would be need to
         collect the evidence for the Coroner's Inquiry.
                                                                              146

Q.   Now, in fairness I should say this. Many of my clients
     initially have put that down to indifference on the part of
     the Police, but it now seems that two causes operated, and I
     put this in the form of a question to you. Firstly, was there
     not some inactivity by Police Officers due to lack of
     leadership until Mr. Nesbit came on the scene, and secondly,
     was not some of it due to younger Police Officers freezing
     from shock? - A. All of our Police Officers are trained to act
     either individually or collectively in terms of saving life.
     In terms of the efforts going round the gates, the gates are
     narrow.   I have said already Police Officers were coming down
     the back in Leppings Lane. Police Officers were round the
     gate. There were Police Officers hanging about in the
     background, as it were, who couldnât get themselves involved.

Q.   Do you accept-the evidence given by a number of people ^hat a
     lot of Police Officers suffered from shock? -A. Yes, I would
     accept that.

Q. And froze.  In other words, their inactivity was simply due to
   being frozen with shock? - A. I think if I could make a
   broader statement in relation to that, I think probably most
   people in the stadium were shocked at some stage.

Q. The only reason I am putting this to you is that a large
   number "of my clients, now that they appreciate rather more
   clearly what did happen, have expressed surprise, and I have
   to say a little anger, that Police Officers were frozen when
   fans were, taking:initiatives. In other words, when fans were"
   a little more active, and they have asked and I ask as a
   result whether:Police Officers are given any or if so adequate
   training to enable them to overcome the'horrors that occurred
   on this occasion? - A. I think as much training as is
   practicable is.given to Police Officers.

Q. I don't think I:can take that further.~ The other thing
   obviously which I am instructed to ask you, which I do, is why
   Police Officers, and I am not now dealing with the situation
   that arose after some Liverpool fans very foolishly advanced
   on the Nottingham Forest end, when we know a cordon was put
   across the pitch, but why, before that, a-cordon of Police was
   drawn up parallel to the terraces instead of those Police
   Officers being utilised in rescue? -A. Iâ,think as I have
   already mentioned to you only a certain number of Police
   Officers could.be used in the rescue situation. You could not
   use all of the Police Officers.

,Q. That is a fair answer.  I have asked you and that is your
    answer.  Coming to the Tannoy, nobody so far as I know has
    suggested that the Tannoy could have been used or should
    have been used to announce that there had.been a disaster;
    but I want to take the questions of Lord Justice Taylor a
    little further.  The Tannoy could have been used not only
    to pacify the Nottingham Forest fans by explaining there
    had been overcrowding and some injuries, and would they
    please be patient, but also to give the vital message to
    the Liverpool fans at the back of pens 3 and 4 to move
                                                                 147

     back, to go back through the tunnel, because that is what
     a number of Police Officers in the second stage as it were
     of the emergency were attempting to do from the front of
     the perimeter fence? - A. Well, certainly Mr. Greenwood
     who was down there was trying to achieve that at close
     level.

Q. That is the problem, because he was doing it from the pitch? -
   A. He was.

Q. And he was trying to get people to push back, but of course,
   people at the front were not the people to be talking to
   because they .could not push back because of.the pressure at
   the back. The Tannoy could have been used-effectively -to- get
   the people at the back of the pens to move out of the tunnel
   a n d thus.relieve the pressure o n .those at the front who were
   probably not only being crushed but were also probably
   panicking? - A. I think at that stage there was a lot of
   people on: the. ground .and the pressure certainly in that
   respect had been released.

Q. I am also asked to make some enquiries into the alleged
   confusion, because my clients allege a:great deal of
   c o n f u s i o n , in. the situation after the bodies had been taken to
   the gymnasium, but do I take it you are not really the person
   to ask about that? - A. No, that would be Detective Chief- -
   Superintendent Addis.

                    Cross-Examined by MR. JACKSON:...... .

Q. Mr. Jackson, may I adopt most of the matters put by my learned
   friend,- M r . Hytner, to you. about the events of the day. May I
   g o â¢back, and I hope not to be personal, to this ridiculous â¢
   suggestion that fans should be expected to level themselves
   cut. May I say: that is against the spirit....

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   You are not making a speech, Mr.
     Jackson. Would you ask questions, please.

q          h r . JACKSON:   Is that not against the spirit of
    : everything you thought when you planned your operation for the
      day? - A. I said it twofold. I said, (1) you would expect the
      fans, or hopefully the fans would find their own level, and
      secondly,   the stewards have the responsibility in that
      respect.
Q. May'I take the second part first. May I suggest that rightly
   or wrongly the Police have in this case given the stewards of
   Sheffield Wednesday the task of planning the packing of the
   ground? - A. I am not quite sure what you mean there.

Q    May I suggest it is quite clear that everyone knew and has
     known for years that it is proper that someone should oversee
     the packing and loading of the ground? May I suggest in this
     case that rightly or wrongly the Police gave that task to the
     Sheffield Wednesday stewards? - A. Yes, I would accept that.

                                                                    148
                          QUESTION                 NI NE

Why, when 42 ambulances reached the ground, did more not get on
to the pitch where the dying and severely injured were in urgent
need of trained medical help?

The SYMAS ambulance located at the ground was for use in the event of a major
incident as a base for communication and not for use in the rescue operation.

Mr Hopkins SYMAS was aware of damage caused to ambulances who had in fact
been onto the pitch and of the problems encountered by the drivers of the
ambulances as they attempted to negotiate the ramp giving the only access and
egress to the playing area.

Mr Higgins SYMAS took the view that it was impracticable to take ambulances onto
the playing area due to the crowd and melee that was going on there. A bottleneck
would have been formed by there being only one route into and out of the playing
area. The evacuation of the injured and dead to the Gymnasium was carried out very
quickly and because of the involvement of the police and fans it helped the operation
of dealing with them more smoothly than if they had been dealt with in isolation out on
the pitch.

Mr Eason SYMAS describes actions taken by Mr Higgins in radioing for assistance
and preparing Gymnasium area to receive casualties.

The problems experienced with the only ramp giving access and egress to the playing
area, the crowd, the melee, in contrast with the speed in which the casualties were
evacuated from the playing area by the rescuers would indicate that the decision not
to allow the ambulances onto the playing area was correct.


OBSERVATIONS

Please see pages 149 -156, Volume 2.


Lord Justice Taylor - Interim Report

296. I say at the outset of this chapter that no valid criticism can be made of the
response by the St John Ambulance Brigade, by SYMAS or by the fire brigade on 15
April. Indeed, no represented party ventured any criticism of them. The only attack
on SYMAS came from two Liverpool doctors. One claimed that ambulances did not
arrive swiftly or with sufficient equipment and that there was a lack of triage. He was
proved to be wrong in all three respects. Unfortunately he had seen fit to go on
television on 15 April when he said more lives could have been saved if staff and
equipment had arrived earlier. Apart from being proved wrong in fact as to the times
of arrival of ambulances, he conceded in evidence that it was not possible to say
whether lives could have been saved. His comments on television were irresponsible.
The other doctor complained of the absence of defibrillators. I am satisfied on
overwhelming evidence that to attempt to use a defibrillator on the pitch with people

milling about would have been highly dangerous owing to th e risk of injury from the
electric charge.

3 02. Finally, there w as evidence th at an advertising board had to be knocked down at
the north-east corner of the ground to allow an am bulance onto the pitch and th at the
top of the ram p leading to the pitch the access for am bulances w as inadequate.
T h e re w as also evidence th at the pre-m atch arran gem ent for am bulances to use the
two gates from Penistone Road at the north-east end of th e ground as in and out
routes w as frustrated by th e presence of vehicles just inside th e ground. In the event,
none of these matters affected operations. T h e hoarding w as quickly knocked down.
T h e difficult access to the ram p w as negotiated and am bulances used one entrance
satisfactorily by backing out w hen loaded.



Lord Justice Taylor - Recommendation 64 to 69

6 4 . T h ere should be at each sports ground at each m atch at least one trained first
aid er per 1 ,0 0 0 spectators. T h e club should have the responsibility for securing such
attendance.

65. There should be at each designated sports ground one or m ore first aid rooms.
T h e num ber of such rooms and th e equipm ent to be m aintained within them should
be specified by th e local authority after taking professional m edical advice and should
be m ade a requirem ent of every S a fe ty Certificate.

66 . (a) A t every match w h ere the num ber of spectators is expected to exceed 2 ,0 0 0 ,
the club should em ploy a m edical practitioner to be present and available to deal with
any medical exigency at th e ground.        H e should be trained and com petent in
advanced first aid. H e should be present at th e ground at least an hour before kick-
off and should rem ain until half an hour after the end of the match. His w hereabouts
should be known to those in the police control room and he should be im m ediately
contactable.



   (b) A t an y match w h ere th e num ber of spectators is not expected to exceed 2 ,0 0 0 ,
the club should m ake arrangem ents to enable a m edical practitioner to be sum m oned
im m ediately to deal with any m edical exigency at the ground. H e should be trained
and com petent in advanced first aid. T h e arrangem ents m ade should be known to
those in th e police control room.

67. A t least one fully equipped am bulance from or approved by the appropriate
am bulance authority should be in attendance at all m atches with an expected crowd
of 5 ,0 0 0 or more.

68 .  T h e num ber of am bulances to be in attendance for m atches w here larger

th e am bulance service and should be m ade a requirem ent of th e S a fe ty Certificate.

69. A "major incident equipm ent vehicle" designed and equipped to deal with up to
5 0 casualties, should be deployed in addition to other am bulance attendance at a
match w h ere a crowd in excess of 2 5 ,0 0 0 is expected.

from the Ambulance Service that there were two ambulances
there before the match began. Is that right?

     MR. KALLIPETIS:       So sir, one was there.

     LORO JUSTICE TAYLOR:       And one within a mile.

     MR. KALLIPETIS:       And one was on standby.

        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    We saw on the film that the
St. John's Ambulancesingle ambulance comes on first and
it seems to be quite a long time before one sees any other
ambulance. What happened to the SYMAS ambulance that was
a c t ually at the ground?   What happened to that, do you
know, in the early stages?

      MR. KALLIPETIS:    That stayed in situ according to
the plan to act as the base tor communications. The
Officers from that ambulance went to the Leppings Lane
end to find out what was happening because they couldn't
see from where they were. There was then a call through
to' Headquactecs at 15.13 declaring that there was a major
Incident, and by that time, 15.13, already ambulances had
arrived at Leppings Lane end in response to the eaclier
call from the Police.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Am I understanding correctly
that the ambulance that was on at the ground as the SYMAS
ambulance on duty so to speak was not an operational
ambulance, it was a communications ambulance was it?

       MR. KALLIPETIS:   It is an operational ambulance sir
but as you will see from the:plan the first ambulance on
site does not rush-straight into the scene.-' -There^has goE
to be an assessment of exactly what is -rexjuired. There-
a c e several reasons for this, sir, which will become
apparent.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    I donât want to anticipate. I
just wanted to know why we had not seen it at an early
stage on the ground but I thi-nk you have explained it, and
we will hear the evidence later.

     MR. KALLIPETIS:   You will hear why it is not a good
idea for the ambulances to go right on to the pitch.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:       Very well, thank you.

     Now, Mr. Collins I understand that - of course the
video that was shown last Friday as a compilation of
about two and a bit hours out of many, many hoars of
video.

     serious had happened at the other end of the ground.

Q . A St. John's ambulance had gone on to the pitch, had it
    not?   A.   With hindsight, yes, sir, but I wasn't aware
    of that at the time.

Q . You did not see it when you were there?   A.  I know it
    was there, looking at the video, but I was not conscious
    of the fact that it was there.

Q . When you were outside the gymnasium, did you have any
    problems with vehicles?   A.   There was- quite a lot of
    vehicles there, sir, yes.

Q . Did it make any difference to the use to which you could put
    your ambulances, because by that time you would have had
    some attend at that end of the ground, would you not?
    A.   Yes, we did.   It caused us to reverse in, which is
    negligible, really.

Q . You also mention horses.        A.   There were some horses
    there, yes, sir.

Q . You see, Inspector Hand-Davies said that they had gone
    before the fixst ambulance arrived.  Is it your recollection
    that they were still there when the ambulances arrived?
    A.   I know they were there when I arrived, sir.

Q . You were not in an ambulance, you were in a Range-Rover.
    A.  Well, they were there when the ambulances arrived
    as well, sir.

Q . I see.    I think Mr. Beevers and Mr. Edwards came in an
    ambulance and you wanted to get them on to the pitch;
    that is right, is it not?    A.   Yes, sir.

Q.    And you aLso got Mr. Morley lining up ambulances outside?
     A.    That is correct, sir.

Q . Did you send   an ambulance on to the pitch driven by Mr.
    Wadsworth?     A.    Yes, I did, sir.

Q . I think that  went on to the pitch.   Did you see the St.
    John's ambulance coming off the pitch?    A.  Yes, I did,
    sir.   We were, in fact, trying to get one on at the top
    of the slope and there was a problem there which, frankly,
    surprised me because I had not seen it before and there
    was a ramp running down the side of the Stand on a large
    block of concrete at the bottom of it.

Q . That leads to the disabled area, the Westfield enclosure,
    I think, in the North Stand, does it not?   A.   Yes, but
    I had never seen it before, sir, and my ambulance came in
    on a left-hand lock andfTTe moment he hit the concrete
    his body on the other side went over on to the gate-post.
    You could not negotiate the gate-post unless you came at itÂ«
    straight and we were attempting to push the vehicle off    i-

        come off the pitch at the bottom and his bumper was
        fast on the stanchion holding the perimeter railing up
        and I recall he had a couple of runs at it and bounced
        off it again and then had a real- run at it and came off
        it minus his number-plate and I think some damage to
        his bumper.

                LORD JUSTICE      TAYLOR:         Can we see this?

             MR. KALLIPETIS:   Sir, if I may, I think these
        photographs are easier to demonstrate what Mr. Hopkins
        is talking about.

                LORD JUSTICE      TAYLOR:         Are these some new ones?

                M R .KALLIPETIS :     Sir,    yes.      (H a n d e d )

                MR. PHILLIPS:        I have not got them but do they
        help,    sir?

             LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I think they may do, yes, because
        they look at it from the top of the ramp whereas the
        photographs we have got I think look at it from the bottom.

Q.           MR. PHILLIPS:    Yes.  Can you just perhaps point to
        the particular post that you say the ambulance was getting
        caught on?    We can see the ramp there.   A.'  It was the
        gate and the post, sir.

Q . On the left-hand side of the large photograph?     A.  Yes.
   â¢â¢We were having to come in and turn sharp left and the moment
     the front wheel hit the concrete nodule, it threw the
     ambulance across on to the pillar - both ambulances that
     went on to the  pitch - sort of identical damage.

Q.          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    The bit of lighter coloured
        concrete on the right is a rise, is it? A.       My Lord,
        I think the concrete is to accommodate the ramp.

Q.          MR.     PHILLIPS:    So it is the thin end of the ramp,
        is it?       A.   I don't.know what one calls it, b u t ---

Q.          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    You are talking about coming
        in past where you are standing there.   A.   Yes, sir.

Q. Turning          left.    A.      Turning left in.

Q. And the right-hand front wheel goes up, does it?
   A.  Up on to the concrete, sir, and throws the offside
   on to the gate-post.

q   .        MR. PHILLIPS:    Was that the same gate-post that the
        St. John's ambulance got_stuck on?    A.   Yes, but ___                                __
        No, no, he was at the bottom of the ramp trying to come
        off.    There are some angles holding the perimeter fence.
        He had come down and tried to turn right up the ramp and
        got fast.                                                                    " 1 5 1

Q . You had not seen that      before, you say?    A.    No,   I hadn't.

Q . When had you last been to the ground?   A.  I went to the
    ground the year before merely on a courtesy visit oecause
    Officers were on duty there and I wasn't conscious of it
    then, and I was quite surprised.

Q.           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Had anybody actually tried
        driving an ambulance in there before, do you know?
        A.   No, sir.   I am sorry, before the ramp, my Lord?

Q.           MR. PHILLIPS:   Yes, before the ramp was put on.
        Do you know if an ambulance had been sent through on any
        earlier occasion?   A.  No, I don' t, sir.

Q. Well now, these two or three of your ambulances went on
   to the pitch, did they not?   A.   Yes, sir.

Q . I think you then came into contact with Mr. Hornsby, the
    Assistant Chief Fire Officer.   A.   That is correct, sir.

Q . Can you say what time that was?    Paragraph 30 of your
    statement, you just sent a couple of ambulances down to the
    pitch.    How long had you been there before you spoke -
    perhaps you can remember it that way - how long had you
    been there when you spoke to Mr. Hornsby? - A.    I think
    possibly around 15.44 I spoke to Hornsby.

Q . By then you still had not spoken to a senior Police
    Officer?   A.   Bearing in mind, sir, I hadn't .been back
    to the gymnasium and I hadn't seen one in the area where I
    was working.

Q . But you had been in the vicinity of the gymnasium, had
    you not?   A.   Yes, sir, I was there all the time.

Q . In the yard, sending ambulances to the pitch and getting
    people sorted out into ambulances?   A.   Yes, sir.

Q . And I think you gave various other instructions and the
    major incident vehicle arrived.   That was about 15.45, was
    it?   A.   Yes, sir.

Q . And then you started to use the body-bags which had been
    provided with that ambulance, is that right?             A.            Yes--

Q . You tell us then t h a t ---

q   .         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I am sorry, did you want to
        say something?  A*   1 thought around that time, sir, I
        went into the gymnasium and met Chief Superintendent Addis.

        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Thank you.

     Hr. KALLIPETIS: Just look at these items, Mr. Kiggins?
(Handed to the witness). Do you have there a bag and mask?
A. Yes, sir.

Can you just produce it?   A. That is it. You fit that
over the mouth, press the bag and it inflates the lungs.
(Demonstrating) .

     Mr. KALLIPETIS: Do you want to see it, sir, and then
it can be handed round.

        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Thank you very mucn.

     Mr. KALLIPETIS: Can you be getting some airways out,
Mr. Kiggins?   Do you have some airways there? A. Yes,
sir.

Just pass those to his Lordship, will you, and tell us
briefly what they do.  (Witness demonstrating to Lord
Justice Taylor).   Forgive my ignorance, Mr. Higgins, but
how do they compare with the Brooks airway?   A. Basically
you achieve the same objective. You are keeping the tongue
down and maintaining a clear airway, sir.

And do you have a minuteman there as well?        A. We have
got a new pack, sir, which is similar.

Let us have a look at that, please. A. That is just a
mechanical resuscitator which inflates the lungs and
empties them.  (Demonstrating).

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   And that fits inside them?
(Indicating).   A. Yes, that is the mechanical part,
and this piece is in the yellow box.  (Indicating).

        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I see.   Very well, thank you.

        Mr. KALLIPETIS: Is that portable, Mr. Higgins, in
fact?      A. It is carried on all the emergency ambulances.

So you could take that on to the pitch,       for example, on
this occasion, and use it?   A. Yes.

        Mr. KALLIPETIS:   Thank you.

               Re-examined by Mr. GOLDSACK:

Mr. Higgins, just two very brief matters, please. I should
have dealt witn one of them earlier. On the day, I think
you took the view that it was impractical to taxe the
ambulances on to the pitch?   A. It was impractical, yes.
Because of the crowd and the melee that was going on, it
would have been impossible to take people round there,
and it formed a bottleneck anyhow with there being just
the one access point.

With a better access point, would you have considered
taking the ambulances on to the pitch?   A. If there haft;-q
been a dual access point, it would have been practical ,1 3 Â«V
                                                           56
                                                                                      P. HIGGINS

                                    but with just one access point it became impossible,.

                               Q.   Do you think it would be advisable if you were able to get
                                    ambulances on to the pitch? A. In some instances, yes,
                                    possibly, but in an incident similar to the one that
                                    happened this year, I don't think it would be practical.
                                    It would still have sufficed to use the gymnasium and the
                                    methods that we used this time, sir.
                           B
                                         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: The only thing is that all
                                    these people carrying the injured quite a distance on
                                    improvised bits of boarding added greatly to the amount
                                    of physical effort, I suppose, and also the time taken.
                                    Do you think it would create more confusion if you had an
                                    ambulance on the pitch?   A. Well, the way it worked, my
                                    Lord, the patients got to the one focal point very quickly
                                    because of the involvement of the police and the fans
                                    and it helped the operation of dealing with the patients
                                    to run more smoothly tnan it would if we had had isolated
                                    incidents out on the pitch.

                                         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Yes, I see.   Thank you.

                               Q.        Mr. GOLDSACK: The other very brief point is this:
                           D        You heard Dr. Purcell's evidence this morning?  A. Yes.

                               Q.   The ambu-bag that he was describing, is that similar to
                                    one of the items that you have just shown us?   A. That
                                    is the one, sir.

                               Q.   That is the same?    A. Yes.
                           E             Mr. GOLDSACK:   Thank you very much, Mr. Higgins.

                                         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Thank you. I gather that you
                                    have problems of your own, Mr. Higgins. Thank you very
                                    much for coming.

O. Were you able to do anything about him? - A. When we got
   back to him Ambulanceman Worrell and Chippendale dealt
   with his leg injury. They splintered his leg and myself
   and Station Officer Kiggins tried to assess the situation.

Q. What view did you come to then when you went back the
   second time? - A. Well things as I say sir had started to
   develop. There were far more people spilling on to the
   pitch; there was a lot more noise and people who w e r e
   injured were starting to come on to the pitch.

Q. So I think it was Mr. Worrell and Mr. Chippendale who
   started attending to them as quickly as they could? - A.
   What happened sir was Station Officer Iiiggins and myself
   discussed the matter and it was decided he would return
   to the ambulance and then start preparing the gymnasium
   area while I stayed up the field in an assessment
   situation. That then released Worrell and Chippendale
   to deal with casualties as they found them.

Q. You were putting into effect the plan you already had to
   use the gymnasium as a clearing station, a casualty
   station? - A. Yes.

Q. And to leave it to Mr. Higgins to deal with Control? -
   A. That is right sir.

Q. Were you able to report back to Mr. Higgins what you saw
    or indeed to Control? - A. No, the only method of comrauni-
  - cation after that that I had with Mr. Higgins was by
    running myself.  I left Worrell and Chippendale working
    with patients and I was doing assessment and running with
    the information.

Q. Do you think you would have been assisted by having a
   direct link with each other in the ground? - A. It is
   possible but it is difficult to say. You asked earlier
   about earpieces. It is quite possible that may have
   been of assistance but I have experience in the past
   where it has not been because of thenoise around.

Q. Now I think you left Mr. Higgins to deal with the situation.
   Did you come to the view that this was a major incident
   at some stage? â A. At that time I considered we were
   developing a serious incident, not a major incident.

Q. What did you propose to do about that?- A. In what way
   sir?

Q. What steps did you propose to take when you came to that
   conclusion? - A. What, that we had a serious incident?

q. Yes? - A. We had alreacLy^decided that we were building
   up to a serious incident. The idea .would be that Higgins

  would go bach to the vehicle; v/ould radio for assistance
  which I believe he did; would then prepare the gymnasium
  area and all the casualties and injured and people
  helping casualties and injured v/ould be funnelled towards
  the gymnasium area, which is what happened.

Q. Did you at any stage think to yourself: "Now this is a
   major incident. I have got to do something about that"?
   - A. I only considered the incident in terras of a major
   incident as the bodies started coining on to the pitch
   and I saw multiple resuscitations taking place.

0. What sort of time would that be. Can you help us? - A. I
   believe it would be something round about quarter-past,
   16-minutes-past-3.

Q. That would be about the time when the St. John's Ambulance
   first went on to the pitch? - A. I think the St. John's
   Ambulance was on the pitch a little earlier than that sir.

Q. You I think went to deal with a small boy? - A. My attention
   was drawn to the fact that there was a small boy laid on
   the pitch sir, yes.

Q. This was I think over by the player's tunnel, wasn't it?
   - A. If you look at the player's tunnel, come inside into
   the field, round about there, it v/ould be round about
   that area.

O'. I think there was a doctor working with that boy? - A. A
    gentleman who claimed to be a doctor was resuscitating him,
    yes.

Q. You went to get help did you? - A. I went to see what was
   going on. Again I have been dragged by a fan and informed
   about this child and he said "There is a doctor with him".
   I went to speak to the doctor. The doctor told me in his
   opinion there was a chance for the child and could I get
   an ambulance to him straight away.

O. Vie know that Ambulanceman Flack arrived on the pitch at
   about this time? - A. Yes.

Q. Was that in response to a request from your or just a
   coincidence? - A. As I got back to the area of tie ramp
   I was aware of coming into contact with Flack. I v/ould
   say that was a coincidence sir.

0. And you sent him to fetch this little boy, did you? - A.
   No. I pointed out where the child was roughly situated
   but again at ground level you could not see anything,
   so we took the cot out of the vehicle we had originally
   used as a control vehicle and I ran with Flack to where
   the child was.         â -

                             QUESTION                   TEN

Why did only 14 of those who died go to hospital?


M r Higgins S Y M A S took a leading role with the injured and fatalities at the
gym nasium. A triage w as im plem ented and the casualties w ere assessed, those who
w ere injured and capable of surviving being placed in am bulances which conveyed
them to hospital and those apparently dead placed in the tem poray mortuary.
This w as a difficult task for M r Higgins d u e to the speed casualties w ere arriving at the
gym nasium. A num ber of casualties had already been assessed by M r Higgins and
conveyed to hospital before a doctor arrived and assum ed control of the triage, w hen
m any m ore casualties w e re conveyed to hospital.

M r Higgins also arranged the am bulance operation which in spite of problems with
parked vehicles still ran smoothly.

In M r Higgins experience within the am bulance service he didn't think they could have
saved m any lives. T hose that died had been in the pens fo r a longer period than you
would normally expect to be able to successfully resuscitate anyone, they w ere
cyanosed, the worst cases he had e v e r seen in his service.

W h y only 14 of those w ho died got to hospital is that the triage im plem ented by
M r Higgins S Y M A S and continued by the doctor w as successful in so much that
valuable spaces in the am bulances w ere taken up by those capable of
recovering/surviving and not those who w ere in fact dead.



OBSERVATIONS

This question w as raised at the Lord Justice Taylor inquiry. A num ber of witnesses
g ave evidence concerning this m atter and their observations would have been
considered by Lord Justice Taylor in his eventual conclusions.

P lease see pages 157 - 159, V olum e 2.



Lord Justice Taylor - Interim Report

2 9 6 . I say at the outset of this chapter that no valid criticism can be m ade of the
response by the S t John A m bulance Brigade, by S Y M A S or by the fire brigade on
15 April. Indeed, no represented party ventured any criticism of them . T h e only
attack on S Y M A S cam e from two Liverpool doctors. O n e claim ed that am bulances
did not arrive swiftly or with sufficient equipm ent and that there w as a lack of triage.
H e w as proved to be wrong in all three respects. Unfortunately he had seen fit to go
on television on 15 April w hen he said more lives could have been saved if staff and
equipm ent had arrived earlier. A part from being proved wrong in fact as to the times
of arrival of am bulances, he conceded in evidence that it w as not possible to say
w h eth er lives could have been saved. His com m ents on television w ere irresponsible.
T h e other doctor com plained of the ab sen ce of defibrillators.     I am satisfied on
overwhelm ing evidence that to attem pt to use a defibrillator on the pitch with people
KttSUsyiAJ*
milling about would have been highly dangerous owing to the risk of injury from the
electric charge.

3 0 1 . T h e re w as insufficiently close co-operation betw een the police and the
em ergency services. It is clear that S Y M A S and the fire brigade should have been
called earlier than they w ere. How ever, in view of the nature and extent of the
crushing, the tim e w hen police rescue began and the pathetically short period for
which those unable to breathe could survive, it is im probable that quicker recourse to
the em ergency services would have saved m ore lives.

             is correct, sir.   We tried to maintain 10 outside the ground.

     q          practice they reversed in, collected their patients and
             then came out forwards? - A. That is correct.

   Q. Did that in practice cause any appreciable delay? - A. I don't
      think so. It went rather smoothly once the operation got
B|    underway.
     Q. I think the arrangement as per the plan was that initial
        casualties would be taken to the Northern General? - A. That
        is correct.
     Q. With the Hallamshire as the reserve? - A. Yes.

     Q. Again, on the day did that part of the plan appear to work
        smoothly? â A . As far as I could see it did s yes, sir.

     Q       And also the plan to use the Herries Road bus station as the
             holding point for ambulances, again many were there within a
             short period? - A. Yes, sir.

     Q. In fact, possibly surplus          to requirements? - A. We had too
Dj      many in the later stages,         yes, sir.
     Q       Once Mr. Hopkins had taken over from you at the ambulance did
             you divert your attention to the gymnasium? - A. It was
             between the gymnasium area and the ambulance loading area. I
             was trying to assess patients, priority to move them, sir.

     Q.' Is it right again at the time you declared at major incident
E       you had visited the gymnasium at that stage? - A. Yes, sir,

     Q. It was then being used as a dining room, but you made the
         request that that be cleared away, and that was done
         immediately? - A. That is correct, sir.

      Q. Mr. Higgins, you then spent the rest of the day taking a
 i? i    leading role in ensuring that the casualties and fatalities
 * I      were then attended to and moved from where they were to where
         they had to be taken? - A. Yes, sir.
                          Cross-Examined by MR. GIBSON-WATT:

         Q   Mr Higgins, when you were asking to be able to attend the
             Semi-Finals you told us that the reason or excuse given to you
             was that the ticket allocation was a matter for the Football
             Association and not the club? - A. That is correct, sir.

         Q. You have confirmed, I think, you did not suggest to the club
            that they should take up the problem with the Football
            A sso c i a t i o n ? - A. I didn't press it, sir.

         Q. You did not press i t ,- and-'-s-o far as you are aware no-one in
 H          SYMAS took up the problem direct with the Football
            Association? - A. Not that I am aware, sir.

                                                                         157

0           When  in fact, you did come back at about quarter past, you
            found there were some vehicles and particularly can you
            remember whether there was anything other than a Police
            vehicle there?   A.   I can't, sir.

n           You definitely saw Police vehicles but you cannot remember
            whether there were any others?   A.   J / Â® Â® 1 there was a
            hired mini-bus sort of thing but I couldn t specifically
            say .
Q. But again, to reassure others, Mr. Higgins, your understanding
   and belief is that the arrangement that you in fact sensibly
   put into operation did not lead to any of the ambulances
   actually being delayed in coming in and out of the ground.
   A    I don't   think it stopped the movement  of patients
   at all   sir.    I think it went as smoothly  using the first
   entrance as it would have done using the in/out method.

                           Cross-examined     by MR.    WOODWARD:

Q. Mr. Higgins,             you had trouble with your radio that day
   on a number             of occasions, is that correct?   A.   Yes, sir.

n           It was not just related to a particular part of the
            around or to a particular moment;  it was something which
            came and went?   A.   It was more difficult towards the
            Leppings Lane area where the crowds were, sir.

    0       Not only did you have trouble with your communication, did
            you understand also that other of your fellow Officers did.
            A.   I understand so, sir, yes.

    Q        However, are you aware in fact of there having been any
             fault in your radio equipment?   A.   I am not, sir, no.

    0       Is it correct that the problem of the radio was not simply
             Well  what was the problem that you experienced?   A.   i
             was trying to call Control and I wasn't receiving messages
             back    As it turned out, most of my messages got through to
             Control but I wasn't getting anything back.

    n        Ytu were using your radio and so far as you know,  and in
              the light of what you have learned since, your messages were
              getting through.    A.   As I understand, sir, yes.

    n        Rut- in fact, your problem was not getting answers from
             Control    A.   Well, whether I was getting them or whether
             it was not being able to hear them in the melee down at
             Leppings Lane, I couldn't really say, sir.

        n Fnr example         you say at Paragraph 41 of your statement,
           "Still having problems communicating with Control because
           I was r e c e i v i n g no r e p l ^ Â» Do y o u s e e ?  When y o u g o t

                                                       you   repeat  your message.
           A.   I carried on trying to call, sir, yes

              And I suppose it is right you tried it in different places
        Q
              and different positions.   A.   'hat is correct.

                                                                   P. H I G G I N S

     0.        You were in charge, until Mr. Hopkins arrived, of tne
               qvmnasium area, dealing with casualties. May I put to
               you some criticisms that have been made by aoctors ana
               the press and ask you to comment on rhem please? A. Yes,
               sir.
     0         The first one is that people were being put into ambulances
B              in anv order. What do you say to that? A. No, that's
                not correct, sir.  I was assessing patients as tney came
                through.  It was rather difficult, as they were coming
                rather quickly.
     0         The second suggestion is that it required a doctor who was
                a soectator in tne crowd to assume control ana ma*e sure
                that those srill alive and most seriously injurea g o t o u
                to nosoital first. What do you say about tnat?         well,
                we had* transported a number of casualties berore tnat
                doctor arrived on the scene, sir, and many more atter.

                There is also an allegation that at least 30 people would
     Q.
                still be alive if there had been a rapid response witn
                basic medical facilities. What do you say about that?
                A   It's difficult to say. In my experience witnintne
**             Ambulance Service, I don't think we could have savea many
                lives down there, sir.
                W h y is that, Mr. Higgins? A. The people that were
      Q.
                coming out of the ground, when the bodies started to
                come o u t ---
xr o                  LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: You mean out from the pens?
           '    a. Out from the pens, yes, sir. They had been there _
                for a longer period than you would normally expect to loe
                able to successfully resuscitate anyone. By the colour
                of them, they were so cyanosed, they were tne worst cases
                jiV 0 ever seen in my service, sir.
                     Mr. KALLIPETIS: Lastly, Mr. Higgins, can you nelp
         Q.
                us with'some of the equipment that has been variously
                described here, and I think inaccurately descnoea in
                terms of its function?   Could you just looK at ana snow
                his Lordshio what a Brooks airway Iooks liKe, please.
                You cannot tell us what a Brooks airway looks like,
                because we have not got one!  But we have got some ir.outn-
                pieces here, I think.
                   '* LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:               Perhaps in the course of tne
                 day we might see one.
                            Mr. KALLIPETIS:          We can arrange for one to be orought,
                 s ir   .
                      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: And perhaps also it would be
                 helpful to me, Mr. Kalti-petis, if on one sheet of paper
                 you could put the hierarchy of your orricers.

                            M r . KALLIPETIS:        Certainly we will do that, sir.

W ed n esd ay 2 4 S ep tem b er 1997.

Ken G reenw ay and I have carried out an examination of the video tape and have produced a
schedule which shows the cam era location and the view of the various shots, based on the time
visible on screen. W e have also produced a code index for the cam era locations and for the
views shown. Copies of this documentation are enclosed.

W e have com pared the timed sequences on the above tape, with tapes in the
Hillsborough Archives and have positively identified that the sequences timed from
1 2.36 and 2 8 seconds to 15.32 and 31 seconds are from the South Yorkshire Police C C T V video
tape of 15 April 1989, reference TB 2. Th e sequences timed from 1 5.36 and 4 5 seconds to
17.22 and 52 seconds are also positively identified as being from the South Yorkshire Police
C C T V video tape of 15 April 1989, reference TB3.

Police Constable Trevor Bichard was the C C T V operator at the Hillsborough Football Stadium on
15 April 1989 and the video tapes T B 2 and TB 3 are referred to in his statements, copies of which
have been forwarded to you under separate cover.

Following the screening of the dram a documentary "Hillsborough" on Thursday 5 D ecem ber 1996
and your letter dated 2 0 D ecem ber, I have now had the opportunity to study in som e detail the
contents of the program m e and to conduct further research.

As a result of the research into the material collected by W est Midlands Police for the Lord Justice
Taylor Inquiry and the transcripts of evidence given at that inquiry, two volumes of documents
have b een compiled which cover the matters raised in your letter. It would serve no useful
purpose for me to transcribe certain parts of the evidence into this letter and it seem s appropriate
to provide the docum ents to you in their present form.

Volum e O ne deals with video evidence, together with comments from the coroner, Doctor Popper,
Home Office Pathologist, Professor Usher, Doctor Gum pet, a consultant neurologist, and
Doctor Slater. Also in these documents are comments from Police Constable Bichard concerning
the operation of the video cam eras in question.

Let me say at the outset that no new evidence has em erged and the issues raised in the television
program m e have all previously been aired in Lord Justice Taylorâs Inquiry or the coronerâs inquest.

Perhaps I can address specifically the concerns mentioned in your letter dated 2 0 Decem ber. First
of all I must em phasise once again that there is no new evidence. Secondly, you seek clarification
on w hether film from a video cam era trained on the central enclosure was available to the Taylor
Inquiry. Such a video film w as m ade available to the Taylor Inquiry and a copy is enclosed for your
information, together with another video film, completing the video record available from police
sources, that day. T h e second video, like the first, was m ade available to Lord Justice Taylor. You
will see that they did not provide any useful information to the match com m anders on the day of
the disaster and the program m e makers may be mistaken in thinking that they did.

Police C onstable Bichard gave evidence to Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry concerning the workings
of the cam era on the day in question and his evidence can be seen in volume one of the
docum ents provided, at Section Two.

Police Constable Bichard told the Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry that whilst some pictures were
available from the cam era in question they were of poor quaiity although the cam era was in fact
working.

T h ere does seem to be som e confusion about the video tapes and perhaps I can clarify the
position. Evidence given by Police Constable Bichard concerns the cam era filming inside the
ground although, as I have previously mentioned, it was not working properly. W hilst it was
focused on the Leppings Lane end of the ground exclusively, the recorded material on the tape
enclosed is a compilation of a num ber of cam eras situated around the ground. Several cam eras
are used by control room personnel to scan the ground and its environs but these record footage
only when transferred to certain monitors in the control room. It will be seen from the enclosed
video that footage from several cam eras had been recorded on the day in question. W h ere the
reproduction is of poor quality then that is the cam era trained on the Leppings Lane end of the
ground.    For your information I have also included a video schedule (prepared by the W e s t
Midlands Police for the Taylor Inquiry and included here in their original form) of these particular
tapes which form the basis of a transcript of the film which was m ade available to Lord Justice
Taylor's Inquiry. Please see Section O ne in Volum e One.

Although your letter of 2 0 D ecem ber does not refer specifically to the aspect of missing tapes, it
has been an issue causing som e confusion. W e clarified this for the Minister, David M acLean, for
his intended contribution to the Adjournment D ebate of 17 Decem ber. For your convenience, I
repeat that clarification here. T h e missing tape is a separate issue entirely from that of w hether or
not the police cam eras w ere working. In addition to the police control centre within the ground,
Sheffield W ed n e s d a y Football Club also had a video recording facility and indeed had their own
recording suite. This was entirely under the supervision of Sheffield W ed n esd ay Football Club and
the police had no control in its operation. During the night following the disaster two video tapes
w ent missing from that particular room. Sheffield W ednesday em ployees say that the room was
locked and the alarm set. W h e n they returned the next morning the room was still locked with the
alarm still arm ed. T hey did, however, discover that two video tapes w ere missing. O ne of the
tapes was of no use w hatsoever owing to the fact that following building works around the ground
the cam era w as trained on a brick wall. The other tape was from a cam era at a fixed point outside
the playing area and w as trained on the turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end of the ground. As
such it did not give a view of the terracing or indeed any internal part of the ground.

Following the discovery of the theft the crime was recorded and W e s t Midlands police officers
m ade enquires to trace the person responsible. To date that crime remains undetected. I hope
that clarifies the position concerning the video tapes.

A further point raised is the m atter concerning the coroners imposing a 3 .1 5 pm cut off point after
which he would not take any evidence. In Volum e O ne of the enclosed documents this issue is
explained in som e detail. Doctor Popper took evidence from, among others, Professor Usher,
Doctor Slater and Doctor G um pet concerning the injuries to the deceased and their likely time of
remaining alive after the initial crush.      That evidence, coupled with Doctor Popper's own
observations of the disaster, led him to believe that 3 .1 5 pm was an appropriate point at which to
call a clearly defined cut off time.

Finally, if I might turn to the ten questions posed to the Hom e Secretary, then once again I have to
inform you that there is nothing new in these questions. They have all been asked previously at
either Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry or the coroner's inquest. T h e second volume of documents
enclosed deals exclusively with the ten questions and you will see, from the copy of the transcripts
provided, that the questions w ere indeed addressed and debated at some length. In fact eight out
of the ten questions resulted in a direct recommendation from Lord Justice Taylor. The two
questions which did not result in a recommendation w ere questions six and ten - the first about the
allegation of C hief Superintendent Duckenfieldâs lying and the latter about why only fourteen of
those w ho died w ere taken to hospital. Though there w ere no recommendations from these two
points, they w ere fully addressed.

A separate section has been allocated to each question with the relevant comments from
witnesses highlighted for ease of reading. I have also added a brief resume preceding each
section, again to facilitate reading.

Extracts from Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry have been included to illustrate the fact that all the
issues raised in the ten questions have been fully exam ined. Having heard all the evidence of
events surrounding the disaster, Lord Justice Taylor arrived at his conclusions and m ade
recommendations.

It is my considered opinion that the dram a docum entary "Hillsborough" provided no evidence upon
which to launch a new inquiry or anything to affect Lord Justice Taylor's original findings.
ADJOURNMENT DEBATE:        HILLSBOROUGH - DRAFT SPEAKING NOTE FOR           MR
MACLEAN


I would like to join with the Hon Member for Liverpool Walton in
expressing my deepest sympathy for the families of those who were
involved in the tragic events at Hillsborough.              I know I speak
for the whole House in saying that our thoughts will remain with
them this Christmas, which I know they must find a particularly
difficult time of the year.


Anybody who saw the news reports that dreadful Saturday - 15th
of April 1989 - will have been overwhelmed by those terrible and
distressing pictures. I know that for the families who suffered
such appalling tragedy their loss was made all the worse by the
fact that they arose out of an event which should have been a
normal family outing.


Factual drama means points can't be challenged.
The   Hon   Member   for   Liverpool     Walton   has   however   drawn    the
attention of the House not so much to the events themselves but
to a programme - a so called factual drama - which was shown
recently on Channel 4. The makers of the programme Hillsborough
have emphasised that they were acting on behalf of the families.
But   I must    admit:   that   I have   a deep    sense   of   unease    when
programme makers choose to make their points through a dramatic
format,     which plays upon the emotions of viewers rather than
through a documentary which can allow points to be discussed c-r
challenged.


Programme wrong about the missing video
iO the programme makers made a two hour "drama documentary" in
which they claim they raised a number of fresh points. In fact
many of these points had already been considered by Lord Taylor's
inquiry. In particular I understand the programme makers claimed
that evidence had come to light about a so called missing video
tape and that the Coroner had been wrong in considering that
those who died were dead by 3 .1 5 .


If the programme makers had used a normal documentary format and
invited   South Yorkshire Police            to comment On the charges,        I
understand that South Yorkshire Police could have told them that
the alleged missing video which is supposed to have shown
evidence of overcrowding on the terraces is not missing at all.
It never      has   been.    The    film   is   in the    possession of   South
Yorkshire Police and was given both to the Taylor inquiry and to
the inquest.

Xt is true that a video from a fixed camera, directed not at the
enclosures where the tragedy took place but at the turnstiles,
did indeed disappear on the night of the disaster. I understand
that this particular video was never in the possession of the
police. The loss of the video was reported as a crime but the
culprit was not detected. This video has never been found and it
is not the video that the programme makers appear to be claiming
as new evidence.

If the programme makers had used a normal documentary style they
would have been forced to show that the matter of the timing of
the deaths and whether the Coroner had made a mistake in taking
a 3.15 cut off point had already been considered by a judicial
review.  The producers chose not to give audiences that
information. Instead they called for another public inquiry. I
will discuss that call in a moment.


Four investigations already taken place
But   first    I would like         to remind    the House that there have
already been four independent investigations or reviews of the
Hillsborough tragedy:


              there was Lord Taylor's inquiry


      â¢        there was the inquest into each of the 95 deaths


               there   was    the    investigation       into police   behaviour
               supervised by the PCA.

               finally, there was the judicial review of the inquest.
Each of these a different purpose; I think it might be helpful
if I were just to say a little about of each of these inquiries
and their outcome.


Lord Taylor1s enquiry
First,    the    formal    inquiry by Lord     Justice     Taylor.    This   was
commissioned by then Home Secretary on the second day after the
disaster. It terms of reference were not only to inquire into the
events but also to make recommendations about the needs of crowd
control and safety at sports events.


Over 31 days between the 15th of May and the 29th of June, Lord
Taylor heard oral evidence from 174 witnesses at a public hearing
in   Sheffield.     He     also   received    evidence     in   the   form    of
submissions and letters. The inquiry considered video film from
three separate sources which provided in all some 71 hours of
further evidence.


Lord Taylor published an interim report in August which set out
the causes for the disaster and made immediate recommendations,
he found that there were a number of causes why the disaster took
place. He found that:


            the immediate cause of the gross overcrowding was the
            failure to cut of access to the central pens which
            were already overfull.


            they were already overfull because no safe maximum
            capacities had been laid dcwn, no attempt was made to
            control       entry   to   individual   pens   numerically,      and
            there was       no effective     visual monitoring        of   crowd
            density.


      Â«     he found that when the influx from gate C entered pen
            3, the layout of the barriers there afforded less
            protection than they should have done and a barrier
            collapsed.


            he    found    that the need to open gate C was due               to
          dangerous       congestion      at     the    turnstiles.       That
          congestion occurred because, as both the club and the
          police should have realised, the turnstile area could
          not easily cope with the large numbers unless they
          arrived steadily over a lengthy period. The police had
          failed to draw up plans as to how they would control
          large numbers should they arrive in a short period.
          Unfortunately that event, which Lord Taylor considered
          was forseeable, took place,


     â¢    Finally    he   found    that    the   presence    of   an    unruly
          minority    who    had   drunk       too   much   aggravated     the
          problem. So did the Clubs's confused and inadequate
          signs and ticketing.


So we have it: a number of reasons for the disaster; no single
person or organisation to blame. But Lord Taylor clearly put a
significant portion of the blame for the disaster at the door of
the police.


Indeed he was particularly critical of the attitude of South
Yorkshire Police to the disaster. I quote from the report:


     "It is a matter of regret that at the hearing and in their
     submissions,    the South Yorkshire Police were not prepared
     to concede that they were in any respect at fault in what
     occurred.   Mr  Duckenfield,  under pressure of cross-
     examination, apologised for blaming the Liverpool fans for
     causing the deaths, But that apart, the police case was to
     blame the fans for being late and drunk and to blame the
     Club for failing to monitor the pens. It was argued that
     the fatal crush was not caused by the influx through gate
     C but was due to barrier          124a being defective.           Such an
     unrealistic approach gives cause for anxiety as to whether
     lessons have been learnt. It would have been more seemly
     and encouraging for the future if responsibility had been
     faced."
 if n e e d e d

[He also considered the reports that had been published in the
press about the behaviour of Liverpool fans. Again I quote from
his report:
          Before this Inquiry began there were stories reported in
       the press, and said to have emanated from police officers
       present at the match, of "mass drunkenness".                    It was said
       that       drunken   fans   urinated     on   police   whilst    they    were
      pulling the dead and injured out, that others had even
      urinated on the bodies of the dead and stolen their
      belongings. Not a single witness was called before the
       inquiry to support any of those allegations, although every
      opportunity was afforded for any of the represented parties
      to have any witness called whom they wished. As soon as the
      allegations I have mentioned were in made in the press, Mr
      Peter Wright, Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, made a
      dignified statement dissociating himself from such grave
      and emotive calumnies. Those who made them and those who
      disseminated          them would have done better          to hold       their
      peace."



Members     or     the   House.    This   is   strong   criticism:      it   hardly
suggests that Lord Taylor in any way had the wool pulled before
his eyes.


But I must: stress that since the report the police have accepted
responsibility for the part they played in                thm                  Most
recently, the present chief constable of South Yorkshire Richard
Welis said on the Today programme that the police saw their
responsibility in three particular areas. He said
              once the gates were open the police                 should       have
              foreseen where the fans would go


      â¦       he accepted that they might have reduced some of the
              pressure by changing the kick off time.


              he also accepted that officers did not recognise soon
              enough the. distinction between disorder and distress.
So, the South Yorkshire Police have accepted that they were at
fault   in those respects.               They have paid compensation to              the
families. This is apart from money paid out by the Hillsborough
disaster appeal.


The inquest
The second investigation into events was the inquest conducted
by   Her     Majesty's      Coroner       for    South   Yorkshire.     This    was    a
difficult task partly because of the number of deaths and partly
because the Taylor inquiry was itself in progress. The coroner
conducted      an       inquiry    into    the    deaths   of    each    of    the    95
individuals and sat for a total of 96 days.


I think it is important that I remind the House of the purpose
of an inquest; it is a fact finding inquiry conducted to
establish reliable answers to four important but limited factual
questions. They are:


        â¢      the identity of the deceased


               the place of death

               the time of death; and finally


               how the deceased came by his death.
That is all an inquest can consider. Rule 36 of the Coroners'
Rules       1984    requires      that    the    proceedings     and    evidence      are
directed      solely at finding the answers to these questions and it
forbids any expression of opinion on other matters.


As members         of    this House       are aware,     the    jury examining        the
evidence found that the cause of death was accidental death. But
the findings of an inquest do not bind any person affected by
them. The inquest conclusion must not be framed in such a way as
to determine any question of criminal responsibility on the part
of a named person or any question of civil liability. A finding
 of accidental death does not prevent further proceedings.
Investigation by West Midland' Police


The third investigation into the events was conducted by West
Midland Police supervised by the Police Complaints Authority with
a view to establishing whether the disaster resulted from or was
made worse by criminal activity on the part of any individual.
It also considered whether any officer should be subject to
disciplinary proceedings. The investigation involved the taking
of 5,341 statements as well as a scrutiny of all the material
which had previously been examined. The evidence was sent to the
Director of Public Prosecutions who concluded that the result did
not indicate that any one should be made the subject of criminal
proceedings. This meant that neither Chief Superintendent
Duckenfield, nor Superintendent Murray not for that matter any
other person has been charged with any crime.


For any o t h e r p e rson apart from a police o f ficer that w o u l d have
been     the    end       of    the   proceedings.            For     a    police       officer        there
remained       th e q u e s t i o n of w h e t h e r t h e y h a d f a i l e d in t h e i r d u ty.
The    PCA decided             that   both    Chief     Superintendent               Duckenfield            and
Superintendent             Murray      should      face      disciplinary            c h arg es.     Police
disciplinary             hearings      are    held      in    pr i v a t e ;    they    are    concerned
o n l y w i t h w h e t h e r an o f f i c e r m a y h a v e f a i l e d to c o n f o r m to p o l i c e
discipline.           A    disciplinary            hearing         doe s       not     consider        wider

 issues.


But,     a f u r t h e r p o i n t a b o u t p o l i c e d i s c i p l i n a r y h e a r i n g s w h i c h is
 o f t e n f o r g o t t e n is t h a t w h i l s t t h e r e are a n u m b e r of p u n i s h m e n t s
 which      can     be     imposed        for     bad        discipline          the     most       serious
 ounishment          a     disciplinary           tribunal          can        impose     is       t h at    O j.
 dismissal        o r of a r e q u i r e m e n t     to resign.


 This is the heaviest punishment which it is possible to award an
 officer for the very worst offence which he could have committed.
 It means that his conduct must have been so                                   badthat it would be
 inappropriate for him to remain an officer.


 In the event Mr Duckenfield retired because                                    of his ill health in
 advance of a disciplinary tribunal's ruling                                    on whether or not he
was guilty. But by doing so he took on himself what the worst
disciplinary        judgement could have imposed upon him to do- He
stopped being a police officer. The disciplinary hearing could
not continue because such hearings can only be held on police
officers.

On 13 January the Police Complaints Authority announced that
disciplinary proceedings against Superintendent Murray would be
withdrawn. When explaining their decision the Authority stated
that    the    retirement      of   the     Chief    Superintendent     on medical
grounds meant that what             in effect was a joint allegation of
neglect of duty could not be fairly heard in the absence of the
more senior officer. But, some time later, Superintendent Murray
also decided that he did not wish to remain as a police officer.


So that is three separate examinations of events surrounding
Hillsborough;         each    one   with    a separate      purpose.    The   fourth
examination was the judicial review of the Coronerâs proceedings.



Review of the inquest


Again it might be helpful if I remind the house that neither the
Home Secretary nor the Attorney General has the power to order
a fresh inquest. That can only be done if my rt hon and learned
Friend        makes an application under section 13 of the 1988 Act.
There    is     a     statutory requirement         that   in   order     to justify
directing       a     fresh   inquest      there should not only          be specific
grounds,       such    a   fresh    evidence,       but   circumstances    that   the
interests of justice require a fresh inquest.


The High Court has also developed a doctrine of judicial reviews
so that the vast majority of issues arising from the conduct of
inquests can be considered by the High Court. Mr Taylor whose son
Kevin was so tragically              killed put forward an              application under
 section 13 of the act ;the main points were:



                that the coroner wrongly failed to direct the jury as
           to the verdict of lack of care or accidental death due
           to or "aggravated 'by lack of care" relating to the
           negligence of the police which caused the tragedy.


           that the coroner wrongly excluded evidence of lack of
           care in the emergency services and police reaction to
           the deceased initial injuries, wrongly insisted on a
           cut off point of 3.15 pm for the evidence heard at the
           main inquest.
and
           wrongly failed to direct the jury on the availability
           of a verdict of accidental death by lack of care or
           lack   of   care    based   on    the   failure   of   the various
           responsible agencies to provide the deceased with
           adequate medical attention after they had sustained
           their original injuries.


It was also asserted in relation to Kevin Williams that there was
evidence to justify the coroner in concluding that he was alive
beyond the 3.15 pm cut off time adopted by the Coroner and that
pressure had been put on two witnesses to retract their evidence
about the signs of life they described in Kevin Williams after
3.15.

My    Hon and   learned       friend   the    Attorney General     carefully
considered the evidence and concluded that none of the matters
raised    afforded     a   realistic        likelihood of     a    successful
application to the High Court.


The applicants proceeded by way of judicial review. In giving the
judgement of the Divisional Court, Lord Justice McCowan ruied
that none of the procedural or technical points raised justified
the intervention of the Divisional Court. It found that the cut
off point of 3.15 was a reasonable and sustainable point.


As a Minister it is clearly not possible for me to know the
truth of what happened on that terrible Saturday. None of us here
can. But we can be satisfied that those dreadful events nearly
seven years ago have been fully investigated and examined. It is
impossible to guarantee that a tragedy will never occur again but
measures have          ben taken to ensure that British football stadia
are among the          safest in the world.


The hon Member for now calls for a further public inquiry into
these events.          I fully sympathise with those families who feel
that in some way they have not been given the truth about their
loved one's deaths.             Certainly           in an appalling           tragedy    such as
Hillsborough it is perhaps inevitable, though deeply distressing
for    the    families,         that    there        will    be    confusion         about        some
details. After all the investigations and examinations that have
taken to place, could we ever achieve greater certainty about the
events       after     nearly     seven years? I believe                 we    could         not.    I
believe that Lord Taylor did an excellent job at                               the time and one
for    which     sports     fans       have    reason       to    be     grateful.      I do not
believe we could better it now.


What     would       be   the    purpose        of     a    further        inquiry?      I    fully
understand that some families still feel bitter about the way
that events were handled that terrible day; things were done, or
not done, things were said that should not have been said but the
fact that we know about them proves there has been no cover up.
Lcrd Taylor criticised the police; South Yorkshire have accepted
that thev were partly responsible for the consequences and have
paid compensation.               The DP? considered and rejected criminal
proceedings against any police officer and though disciplinary
proceedings          were   not    taken:           Superintendent            Duckenfield,          who
might,       and we must remember this, not have been found guilty,
 chose himself to take the strongest measure which he could be
 forced to take and stop being a police officer.


 Positive lessons have been learnt. Lord Taylor made far reaching
 recommendations which have been implemented:
            All clubs of the Premier League and First Division
                have converted their stadia to all seated grounds.
                Second and Third Divison clubs should have all seater
                 stadia by August 1999.


                 The      Government          has    made        Â£l39m     available         to     the
              Football   Trust   to,    fund   Taylor    related   work   at
              foortball grounds for projects totalling Â£437m


Britisn stadia are now recognised as beang amongst the safest in
the   word.    This   was   commented    on    by   overseas   visitors   and
officials during EURO 96.Thankfulkly there have been no major
incidents since Hillsborough. So, we should not forget the very
positive things which have been achieved.


My current belief is that a further public inquiry would serve
no useful purpose.


What if there is fresh evidence? Now a drama documentary is not
in itself evidence. I donât often agree with the hon Member for
Blackburn but he too recognised that it was important to examine
the evidence, not the programme.


But what if in making the drama, the researchers have discovered
new information? As I have explained I am not yet convinced that
they have. But .if, ::hey have, what then? The Chief Constable of
South Yorkshire has already made clear that if there is fresh
evidence he would wish to have it examined. I understand that if
there were fresh evidence he would not wish it to be examined by
police from the South Yorkshire force, who might be considered
to have a vested interest in the outcome, but by officers of a
different force. Furthermore, he would wish this investigation
to be supervised by the independent Police Complaints Authority.
The Police Complaints Authority have themselves indicated their
willingness to undertake this supervision.              If evidence of any
wrongdoing were uncovered those papers would be passed to the
Director of Public Prosecutions in order to determine whetÂ»her
charges should be brought against anybody.


But all this is, at present, entirely hypothetical. At present
we have no new evidence. As I have already made clear I am not
convinced that it exists.
                                Interventions


How is that police officers h2Lvc been awarded substantial sums
in compensation and the families have not?


The judgement on the management of the claims for police officers
was a matter for the Police Authoroity. I understand that on the
basis of legal advice the police authority settled 14 cases out
of court. There are a further 25 cases outstanding. Five cases
have been taken to court;     of these,   four were successful   in
achieving compensation: one was not. The Police Authority have
said that they will appeal against the four successful claims.


The question of compensation for members of the public is one for
the courts.     I understand that the courts have awarded
compensation only in thoese cases where there is a close familial
tie. I understand that over Â£12m has been awarded in damages and
costs to members of the public.


If further pressed
This is entirely a matter for the courts.


Background
The fact that police officers have received substantial sums in
compensation when many friends and relatives appear not to have
done is a natter of continuing controversy.      South Yoprkshire
Police Authority received 1,567 claims in respect of the tragedy;
33 are still outstanding. Many claimants have been found not to
be eligible.


Damages and costs to members of the public have totalled Â£12m;
South Yorkshire Police say that they cannot immediately provide
details of how many claimants have been succesful. The figures
involved suggest that the sums going to relatives will in some
cases nave been smaller than those going to police officers.
Whilst this appears unjust the courts reach their decisions on
the basis of loss of expected earnings rather than the grief
suffered by family members.
Why was an officer from the former West Midlands Serious Crime
Squad chosen to undertake investigations into the tragedy?


I     understand     West       Midlands      was    chosen    to   undertake       the
investigation        of   the    Hillsborough        tragedy    because      it   was   a
negihbouring force. This was a choice approved by the Police
Complaints Authority. The head of the investigation wasthe
Assistant Chief Constable Mervin Jones now Chief Constable of
Cheshire; he was reporting to Geoffrey Dear now an HM Inspector.


3ackcrround
A story cmplainin that Detectiuve Superintend Stan Beechy former
head of the controversial West Midlands Serious Crime Squad which
was disbanded in Auugust 1989 after a PCA investigation.He was
said by the report to be the second most senior policeman. Mrs
Williams        is   claiming     Mr   Beechy       was   in   charge   of    evidence
    concerning her son Kevin and should have presented the jury with
    the evidence to suggest that an ambulance did not stop which
    could have saved her son. Mrs Williams also claims that she has
    a witness who says that Kev-n was alive after 3.15. The Attorney
    General's    office   explain      that    the medical      evidence has        been
    examined and they are convinced that the 3.15 cut off point for
    time of death was correct. This was also the conlusion of the
    judicial review.

As you will be aware, following the Granada programae,
Hillsborough, a number of representations were wade to the Hose
Secretary calling on him to reopen the public inquiry into the
disaster. Whilst the Home secretary emphasised that he would not
take a decision to reopen the inquiry lightly and would need to
be convinced that it would be in the public interest to do so*
he, nonetheless, made a conaaitment in the House of Con&ons
carefully to eonaider the issues raised.
 in coming to his decision the Home secretary ie particularly
 anxious to establish whether any new evidence has emerged, I
 would therefore be grateful for your views on this matter in
 relation to the ten points raised by the prograiwse which 1
 attach. It would also be helpful if we could have clarification
 on the point about whether the film from the video camera trained
 on the central enclosure was available to the Taylor inquiry. The
 programme makers have specifically alleged that the Taylor
 inquiry was told that the camera was not working# when this was
 not the case; Z would be grateful for your cotwnents on this
 particular point. I understand that the film is available and it
 would be helpful if we could receive a copy and of any transcript
 of the film which the Taylor inquiry may have received.
 Whilst the Hoitie Secretary does not have the power to reopen the
 inquest - that is a matter for the High court on the advice of
 the Attorney General - the relatives have expressed continuing
 anger that the Coroner imposed a 3.15pa cut off point after which
 he would not take any evidence. Whether this was the correct
 course might have a bearing on the Home Secretary's decision. I
 would also be grateful therefore to receive any relevant
 information you might have on this matter, I understand that the
 issues will be investigated by the Complaints and Discipline
 Department who have already indicated to us that they could
 provide a f u l l report by the end of January.

           HILLSBOROUGH

           Thank you very much for your letter, faxed to us this afternoon.

           i Ke the Home Secretary, I have given a public undertaking to scrutinise the Granada "drama
           documentary" with a view to seeing if it contains any new evidence and to pursuing such new
           material if it emerges.

           It is the professional view o f those o f our officers completely familiar with the material
           afforded to the previous enquiries - Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry; the Inquest before HM
           Coroner and the Judicial Review - that there is in fact no new evidence brought forward. We
           are content to have this view challenged.

           The programme is also inaccurate in a number o f respects. Whilst this is expected in a
           programme with any dramatic content, the observation should be seen in the context of
           Granada's assertions as to the film's factual base.

           I will have staff examine the ten questions you have relayed to me as soon as possible and
           certainly before the end o f January,

                   ONE

                   Why was Chief Superintendent David Duckenfteld put in charge of a major semi-final
                   only 21 days before the game, when he was relatively inexperienced at policing
                   football matches?

                   TWO

                   Why were there no barriers or cordons to filter the crowd and prevent a build up
                   outside the Leppings Lane end of the ground if, as the fans insist, there were the
                   previous year?

                   THREE

                   Why was the game not delayed, as a number of police officers thought it should have
                   been, when it became obvious that it would not be possible to get all the Liverpool
                   fans safety into the ground before the 3pm kick-off?

                   FOUR

                  Why didnât police recognise overcrowding on the Leppings Lane terrace when eye
                  witnesses, including football commentator John Motson, were aware of the problems
                  fifteen minutes before kick-off?

                  FIVE

                  Why wasnât the tunnel leading to the central pens closed when they became full, the
                  procedure adopted at the previous year's semi-final?

                  SIX

                  Why did Chief Superintendent Duckenfield mislead the Secretaiy of the FA by telling
                  him that fan* had forced open Gate C, when the officer knew he had given the order
                  for it to be opened?

                  SEVEN

                  Why did it take half an hour after the first crushing began to pull down the 10 foot

ADJOURNMENT DEBATE: HILLSBOROUGH - DRAFT SPEAKING NOTE FOR MR
MACLEAN


I would like to join with the Hon Member for Liverpool Walton in
expressing my deepest sympathy for the families of those who were
involved in the tragic events at Hillsborough.             I know I speak
for the whole House in saying that our thoughts will remain with
them this Christmas, which I know they must find a particularly
difficult time of the year.


Anybody who saw the news reports that dreadful Saturday - 15th
of April 1989 - will have been overwhelmed by those terrible and
distressing pictures. I know that for the families who suffered
such appalling tragedy their loss was made all the worse by the
fact that they arose out of an event which should have been a
normal family outing.


Factual drama means points canât be challenged.
The   Hon   Member   for   Liverpool    Walton   has   however   drawn    the
attention of the House not so much to the events themselves but
to a programme - a so called factual drama - which was shown
recently on C h a n n e l T h e makers of the programme Hillsborough
have emphasised that they were acting on behalf of the families.
But   I must    admit   that   I have   a deep    sense   of   unease    when
programme makers choose to make their points through a dramatic
format,     which plays upon the emotions of viewers rather than
through a documentary which can allow points to be discussed or
challenged.


Programme wrong about the missing video
So the programme makers made a two hour âdrama documentary" in
which they claim they raised a number of fresh points. In fact
many of these points had already been considered by Lord Taylor's
inquiry, in particular I understand the programme makers claimed
that evidence had come to light about a so called missing video
tape and that the Coroner had been wrong in considering that
those who died were dead by 3 ,1 5 .


If the programme makers had used a normal documentary format and
     invited South Yorkshire Police                      to comment on the charges, I
     understand that South Yorkshire Police could have told them that
     the     alleged           missing   video     which     is    supposed     to   have    shown
     evidence of overcrowding on the terraces is not missing at all.
     It never            has    been.    The    film    is   in the     possession of        South
     Yorkshire Police and was given both to the Taylor inquiry and to
     the inquest.

      It is true that a video from a fixed-camera, directed not at the
      enclosures where the tragedy took place but at the turnstiles,
      did indeed disappear on the night of the disaster. I understand
      that this particular video was never in the possession of the
      police. The loss of the video was reported as a crime but the
      culprit was not detected. This video has never been found and it
      is not the video that the programme makers appear to be claiming
      as new evidence.

      If the programme makers had used a normal documentary style they
      would have been forced to show that the matter of the timing of
      the deaths and whether the Coroner had made a mistake in taking
      a 3.15 cut off point had already been considered by a judicial
      review.        The        producers       chose    not      to    giveaudiences         that
      information.              Instead they called for                another public inquiry. I
      will discuss              that call in a moment.


      Four investigations already taken place
      But first I would like to remindthe                              House    that there    have
      already been four independent investigations or reviews of the
      Hillsborough tragedy:


                         there was Lord Taylor's inquiry


                         there was the inquest into each of the 95^ deaths


                          there    was    the    investigation         into    police   behaviour
                          supervised by the PCA


                          finally, there was the judicial review of the inquest.

Each of these a different purpose; I think it might be helpful
if I were just to say a littlfe about of each of these inquiries
and their outcome.


Lord Taylor's enquiry
First,    the    formal   inquiry      by Lord Justice     Taylor.    This   was
commissioned by then Home Secretary on the second day after the
disaster. It terms of reference were not only to inquire into the
events but also to make recommendations about the needs of crowd
control and safety at sports events.


Over 31 days between the 15th of May and the 29th of June, Lord
Taylor heard oral evidence from 174 witnesses at a public hearing
in   Sheffield.      He    also    received   evidence     in   the   form     of
submissions and letters. The inquiry considered video film from
three separate sources which provided in all some 71 hours of
further evidence.


Lord Taylor published an interim report in August which set out
the causes for the disaster and made immediate recommendations,
he found that there were a number of causes why the disaster took
place. He found that:


      *     the immediate cause of the gross overcrowding was the
            failure to cut of access to the central pens which
            were already overfull.


            they were already overfull because no safe maximum
            capacities had been laid down, no attempt was made to
            control       entry   to   individual   pens   numerically,      and
            there was       no    effective   visual   monitoring     of   crowd
            density.


      *     he found that when the influx from gate C entered pen
            3,    the layout of        the barriers    there afforded        less
            protection than they should have done and a barrier
            collapsed.


      *     he    found that      the need t o .open gate C was due           to
                 dangerous        congestion      at     the     turnstiles.     That
                 congestion occurred because, as both the club and the
                 police should have realised, the turnstile area could
                 not easily cope with the large numbers unless they
                 arrived steadily over a lengthy period. The police had
                 failed to draw up plans as to how they would control
                 large numbers should they arrive in a short period.
                 Unfortunately that event, which Lord Taylor considered
                 was forseeable, took place,

             â¢   Finally     he   found    that    the   presence    of   an    unruly
                 minoritywho       had    drunk   too     much    aggravated       the
                  problem.    So did the Clubs's confused and inadequate
                     signs and ticketing.


  So we have it: a number of reasons for the disaster; no single
  person or organisation to blame. But Lord Taylor clearly put a
  significant portion of the blame for the disaster at the door of
  the police.


  Indeed he was particularly critical of the attitude of South
  Yorkshire Police to the disaster. I quote from the report;


             "It is a matter of regret that at the hearing and in their
             submissions,    the South Yorkshire Police were not prepared
             toconcede that they were in any respect at fault in                  what
             occurred.   Mr  Duckenfield, under pressure of     cross-
             examination, apologised for blaming the Liverpool fans for
             causing the deaths, But that apart, the police case was to
             blame the fans for being late and drunk and to blame the
             Club for failing to monitor the pens. It was argued that
             the fatal crush was not caused by the influx through gate
             C but was due to barrier          124a being defective.           Such an
             unrealistic approach gives cause for anxiety as to whether
             lessons have been learnt.         It would have been more seemly
             and encouraging for the future if responsibility had been
             faced."




DEC   â 96   17:18                                                               PAGE. 0 0 5
           if needed
           [He also considered the reports that had been published in the
       press about the behaviour of Liverpool fans/ Again I quote from
       his report:
                   "Before this Inquiry began there were stories reported in
                   the press, and said to have emanated from police officers
                   present at the match, of "mass drunkenness".                          It was said
                   that     drunken      fans     urinated      on    police    whilst    they    were
                   pulling       the dead and injured out,                  that others had even
                   urinated       on     the    bodies    of    the    dead     and    stolen    their
                   belongings.         Not     a single witness was            called before       the
                   inquiry to support any of those allegations, although every
                   opportunity was afforded for any of the represented parties
                   to have any witness called whom they wished. As soon as the
                   allegations I have mentioned were in made in the press, Mr
                   Peter Wright, Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, made a
                   dignified statement dissociating himself from such grave
                   and emotive calumnies. Those who made them and those who
                   disseminated          them would have done better                  to hold    their
                   peace."



       Members         of    the       House.    This    is    strong       criticism:    it    hardly
       suggests that Lord Taylor in any way had the wool pulled before
       his eyes.


       But I m_u.5..t stress that since the report the police have accepted
       responsibility for the part they slaved in the disaster. Most
       recently, the present chief constable of South Yorkshire Richard
       Wells said on the Today programme that the police saw their
       responsibility in three particular areas. He said
                   *      once     the    gates    were       open    the    police    should    have
                           foreseen where the fans would go


                   â¢      he accepted that they might have reduced some of the
                           pressure by changing the kick off time.


                           he also accepted that officers did not recognise soon
                           enough the distinction between disorder and distress.




!6   DEC    â 36   17:19
 So, the S outh Yorkshire Police have accepted that they were at
 fault       in those respects. They have paid compensation to the
 families. This is apart from money paid out by the Hillsborough
 disaster appeal.


 The inquest
 The second investigation into events was the inquest conducted
 by    Her         Majesty's        Coroner          for    South    Yorkshire.      This        was    a
 difficult task partly because of the number of deaths and partly
 because the Taylor inquiry was itself in progress. The coroner
 conducted               an    inquiry        into    the     deaths    of    each     of    the       95
 individuals and sat for a total of 96 days.


 I think it is important that I remind the House of the purpose
 of     an        inquest;        it     is   a   fact      finding    inquiry       conducted         to
 establish reliable answers to four important but limited factual
 questions. They are:


                     the identity of the deceased


             *       the place of death


             *       the time of death; and finally


             *       how the deceased came by his death.
  That is all an inquest can consider. Rule 36 of the Coroners'
  Rules          1984         requires    that       the    proceedings       and    evidence          are
  directed solely at finding the answers to these questions and it
  forbids any expression of opinion on other matters.


  As members              of     this House          are    aware,    the    jury examining            the
  evidence found that the cause of death was accidental death. But
  the findings of an inquest do not bind any person affected by
  them. The inquest conclusion must not be framed in such a way as
  to determine any question of. criminal responsibility on the part
  of a named person or any question of civil liability. A finding
  of accidental death does not prevent further proceedings.




DEC   â 96       17:20                                                              PAGE . 0 0
Investigation by West Midland" Police

The third investigation into the events was conducted by West
Midland Police supervised by the Police Complaints Authority with
a view to establishing whether the disaster resulted from or was
made worse by criminal activity on the part of any individual.
It also considered whether any officer should be subject to
disciplinary proceedings. The investigation involved the taking
of 5,341 statements as well as a scrutiny of all the material
which had previously been examined. The evidence was sent to the
Director of Public Prosecutions who concluded that the result did
not indicate that any one should be made the Subject of criminal
proceedings.        This   meant   that    neither   Chief      Superintendent
Puckenfield, nor Superintendent Murray not for that matter any
other person has been charged with any crime.


For any other person apart from a police officer that would have
been    the end of     the proceedings.      For a police officer          there
remained the question of whether they had failed in their duty.
The PCA decided that both Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and
Superintendent Murray should face disciplinary charges. Police
disciplinary hearings are held in private;               they are concerned
only with whether an officer may have failed to conform to police
discipline.     A    disciplinary    hearing    does   not   consider      wider
issues.


But, a further point about police disciplinary hearings which is
often forgotten is that whilst there are a number of punishments
which    can   be    imposed   for   bad    discipline    the     most   serious
punishment     a     disciplinary    tribunal    can     impose    is    that   of
dismissal or of a requirement to resign.


This is the heaviest punishment which it is possible to award an
 officer for the very worst offence which he could have committed.
 It means that his conduct must have been so bad that it would be
 inappropriate for him to remain an officer.


 In the event Mr Duckenfield retired because of his ill health in
 advance of a disciplinary tribunal's ruling on whether or not he
     was guilty. But by doing, so he took on himself what the worst
     disciplinary judgement could have imposed upon him to do.                                   He
     stopped being a police officer. The disciplinary hearing could
     not continue because such hearings can only be held on police
     officers.

     On 13 January the Police Complaints Authority announced that
     disciplinary proceedings against Superintendent Murray would be
     withdrawn. When explaining their decision the Authority stated
     that        the      retirement      of   the     Chief    Superintendent     on    medical
     grounds meant that what in effect was a joint allegation of
     neglect of duty could not be fairly heard in the absence of the
     more senior officer. But, some time later, Superintendent Murray
     also decided that he did not wish to remain as a police officer.


     So that is three separate examinations of events surrounding
     Hillsborough;               each    one   with    a   separate     purpose. The      fourth
     examination was the judicial review of the Coronerâs proceedings.



     Review of the inquest


     Again it might be helpful if I remind the house that neither the
     Home Secretary nor the Attorney General has the power to order
      a fresh inquest. That can only be done if my rt hon and learned
      Friend           makes an application under section 13 of the 1988 Act.
      There          is   a      statutory     requirement       that   in order     to justify
      directing           a      fresh   inquest      there should not only          be specific
      grounds,            such    a   fresh    evidence,       but   circumstances      that    the
      interests of justice require a fresh inquest.


      The High Court has also developed a doctrine of judicial reviews
      so that the vast majority of issues arising from the conduct of
      inquests can be considered by the High Court. Mr Tayibr whose'son
      Kevin was so               tragically killed put forward an application under
      section 13 of the act ; the main points were:



                 â¢        that the coroner wrongly failed to direct the jury as




6   DEC   59 6    17:21                                                                        PAGE.00
                        to the verdict of lack of care or accidental death due
                        to or "aggravated by lack of care" relating to the
                        negligence of the police which caused the tragedy,


                â¢      that the coroner wron g l y excluded evidence of lack of
                        care in the emergency services and police reaction to
                        the deceased initial injuries, wrongly insisted on a
                        cut off point of 3.15 pm for the evidence heard at the
                        main inquest*
   and
                â¢      wrongly failed to direct the jury on the availability
                        of a verdict of accidental death by lack of care or
                        lack   of   care    based   on    the   failure   of the various
                        responsible agencies to provide the deceased with
                        adequate medical attention after they had sustained
                        their original injuries.


    It was also asserted in relation to Kevin Williams that there was
    evidence to justify the coroner in concluding that he was alive
    beyond the 3.15 pm cut off time adopted by the Coroner and that
    pressure had been put on two witnesses to retract their evidence
    about the signs of life they described in Kevin Williams after
    3.1 S.

    My          Hon and     learned        friend   the   Attorney General     carefully
    considered the evidence and concluded that none of the matters
    raised            afforded      arealistic      likelihood     of      a   successful
    application to the High Court.


    The applicants proceeded by way of judicial review. In giving the
    judgement of the Divisional Court, Lord Justice McGowan ruled
    that none of the procedural or technical points raised justified
    the intervention of the Divisional Court. It found that the cut
    off point of 3.15 was a reasonable and sustainable point.


    As a Minister it is clearly not possible for me to know the
    truth of what happened on that terrible Saturday . None of us here
    can. But we can be satisfied that those dreadful events nearly
    seven years ago have been fully investigated and examined. It is

impossible to guarantee that a tragedy will never occur again but
measures have ben taken to ensure that British football stadia
are among the safest in the world.

The hon Member for now calls for a further public inquiry into
these events.          I fully sympathise with those families who feel
that in some way they have not been given the truth about their
loved one's deaths. Certainly in an appalling tragedy such as
Hillsborough it is perhaps inevitable, though deeply distressing
for    the    families,        that   there     will   be   confusion   about     some
details. After all the investigations and examinations that have
taken to place, could we ever achieve greater certainty about the
events       after nearly       seven years?         I believe we    could not.        I
believe that Lord Taylor did an excellent job at the time and one
for which sports fans have reason to be grateful. I do not
believe we could better it now.

What     would    be     the    purpose    of    a     further   inquiry?    I    fully
 understand that some families still feel bitter about the way
 that events were handled that terrible day; things were done, or
 not done, things were said that should not have been said but the
 fact that we know about them proves there has been no cover up-
 Lord Taylor criticised the police; South Yorkshire have accepted
 that they were partly responsible for the consequences and have
 paid compensation.             The DPP considered and rejected criminal
 proceedings against any police officer and though disciplinary
 proceedings       were    not    taken:      Superintendent      Duckenfield,        who
 might, and we must remember this, not have been found guilty,
 chose himself to take the strongest measure which he could be
 forced to take and stop being a police officer.


 Positive lessons have been learnt. Lord Taylor made far reaching
 recommendations which have been implemented:
            All clubs of the Premier League and First Division
                 have converted their stadia to all seated grounds.
                 Second and Third Divison clubs should have all seater
                 stadia by August 1999.


                 The    Government      has     made     Â£139m   available       to   the
              Football   Trust   to,    fund   Taylor    related   work   at
              foortball grounds for projects totalling Â£437m


British stadia are now recognised as being amongst the safest in
the   word.    This   was   commented    on    by   overseas   visitors   and
officials during EURO 9 6 .Thankfulkly there have been no major
incidents since Hillsborough. So, we should not forget the very
positive things which have been achieved.


My current belief is that a further public inquiry would serve
no useful purpose.

What if there is fresh evidence? Now a drama documentary is not
in itself evidence. I don't often agree with the hon Member for
Blackburn but he too recognised that it was important to examine
the evidence, not the programme.


But what if in making the drama, the researchers have discovered
n e w information? As I have explained I am not yet convinced that
they have. But if they have, what then? The Chief Constable of
South Yorkshire has already made clear that if there is fresh
evidence he would wish to have it examined. I understand that if
there were fresh evidence he would not wish it to be examined by
police from the South Yorkshire force, who might be considered
to have a vested interest in the outcome, but by officers of a
different force. Furthermore, he would wish this investigation
to be supervised by the independent Police Complaints Authority,
The Police Complaints Authority have themselves indicated their
willingness to undertake this supervision.              If evidence of any
wrongdoing were uncovered those papers would be passed to the
Director of Public Prosecutions in order to determine whether
charges should be brought against anybody.


But all this is, at present, entirely hypothetical. At present
we have no new evidence. As I have already made clear I am not
convinced that it exists.

How is that police officers have been awarded substantial sums
 in compensation and the families have not?

 The judgement on the management of the claims for police officers
 was a matter for the Police Authoroity. X understand that on the
 basis of legal advice the police authority settled 14 cases out
 of court. There are a further 25 cases outstanding. Five cases
 have been taken to court;       of these,     four were successful in
 achieving compensation: one was not. The Police Authority have
 said that they will appeal against the four successful claims.


 The question of compensation for members of the public is one for
 the     courts.     I   understand    that   the   courts   have   awarded
 compensation only in thoese cases where there is a close familial
 tie . I understand that over Â£1 2m has been awarded in damages and
 costs to members of the public.


 If further pressed
 This is entirely a matter for the courts.


 Background
 The fact that police officers have received substantial sums in
  compensation when many friends and relatives appear not to have
  done is a matter of continuing controversy.            South Yoprkshire
  Police Authority received 1,567 claims in respect of the tragedy,
  33 are still outstanding. Many claimants have been found not to
  be eligible.

  Damages and costs to members of the public have totalled Â£l2m;
  South Yorkshire Police say that they cannot immediately provide
  details of how many claimants have been succesful. The figures
  involved suggest that the sums going to relatives will in some
  cases have been smaller than those going to police officers.
  Whilst this appears unjust the courts reach their decisions on
  the basis of loss of expected earnings rather than the grief
  suffered by family members.

      why was an officer from the former West Midlands Serious Crime
      Squad chosen to undertake investigations into the tragedy?


      I      understand        West      Midlands       was    chosen     to   undertake     the
      investigation           of   the    Hillsborough         tragedy    because      it was   a
      negihbouring force.             This was a choice approved by the Police
      Complaints          Authority.       The    head    of    the investigation        wasthe
      Assistant. Chief Constable Mervin Jones now Chief Constable of
      Cheshire; he was reporting to Geoffrey Dear now an HM Inspector,


      Background
      A story cmplainin that Detectiuve Superintend Stan Beechy former
      head of the controversial West Midlands Serious Crime Squad which
      was disbanded in Auugust 1989 after a PCA investigation.He was
      said by the report to be the second most senior policeman. Mrs
      Williams           is   claiming     Mr    Beechy       was   in   charge   of    evidence
      concerning her son Kevin and should have presented the jury with
      the evidence to suggest that an ambulance did not stop which
      could have saved her son. Mrs Williams also claims that she has
      a witness who says that Kevin was alive after 3,15. The Attorney
      General's          office explain          that    the medical      evidence has      been
      examined and they are convinced that the 3.15 cut off point for
      time of death was correct. This was also the conlusion of the
      judicial review.

     Gate A - that is the    alignment   of the camera puts it out
     of view.

Q. Which camera was it that was used to go in on Gate A?
   A.  It would be the camera on Leppings Lane.

Q    So the same camera?     A.    It is the same camera; it  is
     â just that its position is high up and directly in line
     with the top of the   doors and therefore you cannot actually
     see the gate, you see the tcp section to it.

Q. Gate A you can see just inside the gate, can you not?
   A.   You can see into the rear area heading towards the
   rear of the Stand.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        This camera is on the south
     corner of the West Stand,       is it?

          MR. COLLINS:      I think    it is on the model,       where the
     Usher is pointing.

Q,          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Yes, that is it.             That is the
     one?     A.   That is correct, sir, yes.

q          MR. COLLINS:   There is also a Club camera, is there
     not, which has a view of the Leppings Lane turnstiles?
     A . * 1 do know Lhat there are Club cameras but I have
     not really been involved in that system at all;   it is
     purely a Club system.

Q t The purpose of the Police system is basically what?
    What is it there for?   A.   Command and control initially
    but we are now going into areas of evidence-gathering,
    and I would say that the trend is moving into that field.

Q.   Is that what   the c lo se-up   is really for?        A.        That's right,
     sir, yes.

Q.   So you can zoom in on an individual if there is a t r o u b l e Â­
     maker?   A.   That's right.              People sometimes misunderstand
     the video system that you . are quite capable of identifying
     somebody from a pict ure just by enlarging it but, in fact,
     if you look at your t el e vi s io n screen and have more than
     six heads and shoulders on it, you will not be able to
     get sufficient i d en t if i c a t i o n from that, and therefore
     you either have to increase the power of your lense or
     move your camera nearer to the people you want to take
     a picture of.

Q. Apart from the camera that looks over the turnstiles you
   have, I think, a camera which looks over the West terracing?
   A.   That is correct, yes,>

Q. Where is that posi ti on ed ? ^ A.  I ^ i s situated just to the
   left-hand side of the C on tr bl Box and near to the s c o r e Â­
   board.

Q. Ag'ain, roughly where the Usher        is pointing?          A.      That .is
   fhp nnsition. ves. sir.

                                               T.   BI CHARD



Q. We have heard that on the day in question there was something
   wrong with that one;             is that correct? ^ A .     For a number.
   of..wÂ£eks we have had d if ficulty with the.:ca*era and they
   h a v e ' ^ e n l o ok in g into having the. camera replaced or
   imprfiveraents made.            In f a c - t h e day when I .'.arjrived
   gt-'the' g r o u n d ' M r . Roger Hal.svior.th, who is the Technical
   Officer for the Club, was in fit:t working on that camera
   to tTy and u pg ra de the picture that- we were actually
   getting.

Q.    What was the t ro uble?  A.  When the system had been
     switched on, after an amount of time, the picture would go
     white - you woÂ«Jld.-io3Â«^sNUially ..what you could see.    We
     believed initially it was' in                     lighting inside
     thtfâ ground but we seem to                      be a problem
     with the electrical supply to that c a m e r a ;

Q.    What was the effect of that on the day in relation to your
     ability to look properly at the terraces, the West terraces?
     A.    On that p a r t i c u l a r day, the picture had been -- the
     quality had been improved.             It was not  up to mark but it
     was   a lot better than it had been.            We were getting
     pictures, that       is the besc way of describing it.

Q. Could you zoom    in in the normal way on to the terraces              if
   you wantec-to?  A.    The actual control facilities weFe
   fully available.

Q. What I am getting at is this, would it have been possible,
   if you were afraid, for example, that they were becoming
   overcrowded, could you take a close-up with that camera?
   A.   You can move -----      A  close-up is available to move
   into those centre two pens.     However, because of its
   position and angle, it does give you a false impression about
   the crowd that   is in there.  It is quite low down and it
   is set at 90 degrees to the pens rather than looking face
   on.

Q. So what is the falsity of the impression?        Does it show it
   fuller than it really is or emptier, or what?        A.   It is^
   just the illusion.       The picture creates a bit of an illusion
   about the crowd that is in there.        You may be looking at
   somebody who is stood in the far corner of Pen 3 and it may
   give you the i mp re ss io n that in fact he is stood in the
   far corner of Pen 4.        It is because of the angle of the
   camera.

Q.    I follow that but we know that those pens did            become o v e r Â­
     crowded. A.   Yes, sir.

Q.    Is there something in the positioning of that     camera which
     means that it is more dif fi cu lt to assess that?    A.    The
     physical position it is in is difficult to assess that the
     pens would be getting overcrowded.

Q.   Is there anywhere else where you think the camera could be^
     which would improve on that?   A.   That is available?
     Really you are looking at a position directly in front of
                                A8




                                                              T. BICHARD

     that were developing at the turnstiles rather than what
     was happening in Leppings Lane.      Obviously the larger
     n umb e r were around the turnstiles.

Q.   I follow that, but did it not occur to you        or to anyone
     that the two should not be looked at in isolation because
     the more you have coming dow n the worse the problem is
     going to get, is not it? - A. I can appreciate that point
     but speaking for m y s a l f m y interest was directed at the
     people around the turnstile area.

Q.   It did not get bett e r any way,        did it, as minutes wen t by?
     - A. Certainly not, no.

Q.   Indeed,   it got worse? - A.     Yes,    it did.

Q. Did you volunteer to Chief Superintendent Duckenfield or
   anyone that the p o s i t i o n was getting worse? - A. At the
   time that this was h a p p e n i n g Chief Superintendent
   D uckenfield was stood just in front of my position
   on the monitors.

Q.    So he could see them? - A.So he was looking up at the
     mo n i t o r we were looking at and we were discussing the
     general situation together.

0.    What was the d i s c ussion as      far as y u can recall?
     Obviously do not expect you to remember exact words.
     - A. The"matters we wer e seeing, particularly
     individual events, was in r e l ation to a mounted Officer
     who seemed to be s t r u g g l i n g w i t h crowds who were pushing
     his horse around.

Q.   It must have been fairly obvious, surely, that the crowd
     was getting worse r a ther than better? - A. It was obvious
     that the crowd was b u i l d i n g up, yes.

0. Was anything said as time w e n t on that you can remember
   about possible delay of k i c k - o f f ? - A. A conversation
   did take place between Mr. Duckenfield, Mr. Murray,
   possibly whoever else was in the control at that time
   and I remember    Mr. M u r r a y saying that it was not our
   policy to delay the k i c k - o f f for people who had just
   arrived late at the ground.         Somebody else threw into
   that conversation if there had been a problem on the
   mo t orway or roadworks the situation is different.

0.   So it was your u n d e r s t a n d i n g - I appreciate it is not
     your decision. " A. Yes.

Q    Senior Officers.  It was you r understanding, was it,
     that because the  fans        w e r e choosing to arrive late
     then there was no q u e s t i o n of deferring kick-off? - A.
     Yes.  I think the s i t u a t i o n is if fans become aware
     that by coming late k i c k - o f f will be delayed they will
                                                             T. BICHARD

continue to come      late.

Yes, I see.        N o w again at about this time between 2.30,
2.40, that sort of period, were you aware of the civilian
radio co m m u n i c a t i o n s of f i c e r coming to deal w i t h the
radio? - A. Yes, he did come in and commence w ork on
the set w h i c h is b e l o w the desk in front of me.

We have h e a r d S e r geant Go d d a r d tell us about that and
I am not g o i n g to ask you to go over the same ground.
Did there come a         time again shortly after or about
this time that you h e a r d something to do wit h the gates
over the radio ? " - A. That is right.              Mr. Marshall was
ackinÂ® for the gates to be opened because of the problems
outside.    W h e n referring to gates the gates I am talking
about, it is iust C Gate.            Mr. D u c k e n f i e l d 's attention
was directed to C Gate as was mine.                 That is the gate
we were looking at.

W h i c h is not s u r p r i s i n g because it was basically the only
gate that you could r e a l l y see through that camera? - A.
That is correct.

And it is the outside of w h i c h together with the inside
of w h i c h you could see? - A. Yes.

      LORD J U S T I C E TAYLOR:        Are you simply giving us
your u n d e r s t a n d i n g of it or what Mr. Marshall said?
- a . No.      Mr. M a r s h a l l was referring to opening gates
because of the p r o blems outside.           I directed Mr.
Ducker.field's a t t e n t i o n to C Gate and,     if you like,
when reference was made to Â®ates by Mr. Marshall that
is the gate that 1 was looking at on the mo n i t o r and
oaving a t t e n t i o n to.

     MR. COLLINS:          That was certainly the gate that
vou could see in the video.             Die you understand or
did you think Mr. M a r s h a l l was simply referring to
that gate or to that and the other gates or did not
you know? - A, My belief was that he was referring
lust to  C G a t e / p o s s i b l y because that is where my
attention was d i r e c t e d fro m what I could see.

And you d rew Mr. D u c k e n f i e l d 's attention to Gate C?
- A, Yes, that is right, sir.

You were aware, I imagine, that Mr, Duckenfield was not
experienced at p o l icing or overseeing the policing at
football m a t c h at H i l l s b o r o u g h ? - A. I knew he was new
to the specific duty.

Yes,       N o w , again, you r timing is a little out on your
notes.         We k n o w that it w a s at 2.4S t h a t _the gate in
fact opened and it w a s at 2.47, just a minute or so
b e f o r e â, Mr. M a r shall r e q u e s t e d the gates be opened?

     Br ymac and obtaining the cutters, and w hen the realisation
     w a s that he was not s u c c e s s f u l in getting those from
     C l a y w h e e l s Lane, I o f f e r e d to contact the Fire Services.

Q.    But the Fire Brigade w o u l d w a n t to k n o w what they were
      d e a l i n g with, w o u l d they not?  It was not a fire, for
      example, and they w o u l d             A. Certainly I can remember
      pa s s i n g a message that we r e q u i r e d the Fire Service
      and for the Fire Service to b r i n g cutting equipment.

            Mr. COLLINS:  I think that                  is all I need ask you,
      thank you, Mr. Bichard.


                       C r o s s - e x a m i n e d by Mr.   HYTNER:

Q. Mr. Bichard, I wan t to- investigate, if I may, just what
   your duties were.               You c l e a r l y w ere an expert in
   i n v e s t i g a t i n g the m o n i t o r s a n d the cameras?     A. I think
   'expert' m i g h t be an exagg e r a t i o n ;            experienced.

Q ; Experiened.           Were y o u r d u t i e s simp l y to operate your
    m a c h i n e r y , your technology, under supervision and
    direction, or did you h ave duties w h i c h derived from
    y o u r own initiative?              A,      The supe r v i s i o n of the monitors
    and the ope r a t i o n of them is m y initiative.                    If I c o u i d t
    perhaps explain:           if I see an incident or notice something
  / on- the monitors, I wil l bring it to the attention of
    the Control Room staff.                  O b v i o u s l y if they see something
    in particular, they w i l l m e n t i o n it to me,

q   . So this may be two ways.            Someb o d y may say to you, "Zoom
      in on the centre of the South Stand, there's something
      h a p p e n i n g over there", a n d you wil l do it?     A.  Yes,

q   _ You, on the other hand, if you are watching the monitors,
      may'spot something and z o o m in yourself? A, Yes,

Q, A n d if you can see it, y o u w i l l then say to somebody
   "There is trouble there"?            A.  Yes.

Q,    Is there always an o f f i c e r of the rank of Inspector or
      above in the Control Room?            Are there occasions when
      the senior officer there is Sergeant Goddard?           A, There
      are odd occasions w h e n S e r g e a n t Goddard, P,C, Ryan and
      m y s e l f are in the Control Room,

Q.    But w o u l d it be normal for the officer in charge of the
      game or the commander on the g r o u n d to be in the Control
      Room?       A, It w o u l d be n o r m a l for Superintendent Murray
      to be present,                      ,




                                                                                         130

Q.   H o w o n e o t h e r matfcei. I w o u l d like to a s k you about.          We

     c o r n e r it gives the time b e t w e e n 15.13 a n d 15.14 at the
     bottom.       H a v e y o u got that? - A. Yes, I have that.

Q.   If y o u look at the r i g h t - h a n d side,       just o v e r halfway doi*n
     it says:

                                           " H i l l s b o r o u g h ground control could

     T h e n the r e p l y comes,    am I right:

             "Roger Fire Br i g a d e
             u r g e n t up to L e p pings
             Lane Roger".

     A. Yes.

Q, Am I right in saying w h a t we     see on the right is                       what you
   w e r e saying? - A. T h a t is correct, yes.

Q. Therefore no mention there, if this transcript is richt,
   about anybody breaking d o w n the gates or anything? - A. Iio.

Q. A n d w h a t is important,        a s p e cific m e n t i o n by you of Leppings
   Lane? - A. Yes, I did.

Q. Have you any idea, be c a u s e s u b s e q u e n t l y we shall hear, that
   w h e n a me s s a g e was sent fro m           Snig Hill, the people at
   Sni g Hill a p p a r e n t l y d i d n o t     k n o w w h e r e the Fire Brigade
   was required? - A. Well it is q u i t e clear, it is the
   L e p p i n g s L a n e end of the ground.            O b v i o u s l y the Fire Service
   are not g o i n g to b r i n g t h e i r fire equipment, the tender
   a c t u a l l y int o the ground.        T h e y are going to bring it to
   the n e a r e s t point, it is the actual cu t t i n g equipment that
   we w o u l d r e q u i r e in the g r o u n d a n d tha t would be dealt with
   on the ground.

Q. But your r e c o l l e c t i o n c e r t a i n l y ac c o r d s w ith that, not only
   d i d you say L e p pings Lan e b u t the p e r s o n at Snig Hill

g                     C r o s s - e x a m i n e d by MR. GIBSQN-WATT (cont.)

        Q,   Officer, can you go back to that Photograph 48 in the bundle
             which you had in front of you.    A.   Yes,  I have that
             photograph now,

        Q. We have just got Mr.         Kelly to the door of the Police Control
           Box, I think.   A.           That's right, sir.

        Q.   On that photograph     just to the left.             A.      Yess,   that's
             right.

        Q.   You are there,   Mr.    D u ck e n f i e l d   is there?      A.     Yes.

        Q. Assistant Chief Co ns ta bl e Mr. Jackson is there,                    I think
           in civilian clothes.      A.    That's right, yes.
D
        Q. Did Mr. Kelly ask what had happened?  A.   There was a
           conversation took place between Mr. Duckenfield and Mr.
           Kelly, yes.

        Q. Speak a bit louder, please.          A.   There was a conversation
          '.between Mr. D u ck en fi el d and Mr. Kelly.

        Q.   In the ceurse of that c o n v er s at i on did Mr. Duckenfield tell
             Mr. Kelly that a gate had been forced and there had been
             an inrush of Liverpool s up po rt er s into the ground?
             A.   Yes, that was said.

        Q. And did he, in fact, point to one of the TV monitors in the
           course of that c o n v e r sa t io n ?   Can you remember that?
           A.    He could well      Have done, I don't remember it.

        Q. And I think from your answers this morning if he did so it
           would ha.vo been a mo ni to r showing the current situation;
           it would not have been a replay of what had happened earlier
           A.   That's right, it is the scene that would be showing
           at that time.

                           C r o s s - e x a m i n e d by MR. KALLIPETIS:

        Q. Mr. Bichard, you have got Photograph 48 in front of you
           which shows your position.   A.   That's right, sir.

        Q.   Primarily, as you told us, controlling the video
             cameras throughout the ground.   A.   Yes, that is ny main
             function.

                                             T.   BI CHARD



Q. One point, please, on the two video monitors in the right-
   hand corner of our picture.  Who decides what should be
   recorded on each of those video tapes?   A.   As with
   actually dealing with the monitors, either I see something
   and switch it on to tape or I am instructed to tape a
   particular incident.

Q. I think about the time that Gate C was ordered to be opened by
   Mr. Duckenfield, did he not ask you vfether or not the scene
   outside Leppings Lane ws being recorded?     A.   Certainly
   before 3 o âclock I was asked, "Are we taping the scenes
   out there?"

Q. Can you recall, Mr. Bichard, whether you were taking it
   down on both videos or just on one of them?   A.   I
   cannot recollect whether it was both or one.

Q. And the tapes from those videos, were they kept by you       and
   then handed over in due course to other Officers?   A.        Yes,
   that is right.

Q. Did either of them stop in the course of that afternoon?
   A.   Yes, the tapes are 3-hour VHS tapes.    One expired
   just after 3 o'clock.

Q. What about the other?   A.   The other tape, somewhere
   between 2.30 and 3, the actual function of the taps, the
   mode of operation, was altered inadvertantly.

Q. By whom?   A.   Again, the assumption is that when the radio
  "repair-man came into the Control Box, Mr. Duckenfield
   actually came and stood to my right-hand side, behind the
   controls and I would then move into the left-hand corner
   and I have caught the video with my knee - the actual
   operating buttons.

Q. With your knee?   A.    Yes,    sir.

Q. One of the buttons on the desk there that we see?
   A.  No, sir, the two videos themselves are actually mounted
   to the left-hand side of that control pannel at knee height.

Q. When you were asked by Mr. Duck en fi el d whether or not the
   scene outside Leppings Lane was being recorded, did you not
   check the video monitor to make sure that they were - that
   is the machine itself?   A.   Yes, I looked down to the
   machine and they were both functioning right.

Q. Did vou then not notice that     one of them was not running?
   A.  * It did not stop running    until after 3 o âclock, sir.

Q. Did you not notice that one of them was not running?
   A.    They were both running, sir.   We are talking about
   the t ime.around half past two to quarter to three.

Q. Yes.   A.   And it finished about      6 minutes past 3,   1 believeâ
   one of the tapes.

                                                T.   BI CHARD



Q. I thought you told me a moment     ago that one of them, due
   to an inadvertant malfunction,     I think is how you described
   it.   A.   Yes.

Q. Did you not notice when you checked to see whether or not
   the pictures that Mr. Duck en fi el d wanted recorded were in
   fact being recorded?   A.     Yes.

Q.   That one of the machines - had it been switched off, or
     what?   A.   No.   What happens was the system was designed
     to operate on a time-lapse mode so that a 3-hour tape would,
     in fact, cover 18 hours of pictures* . Basically it is ---

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    A   picture every few minutes,
     is that it?   A.   Seconds we are dealing with really, sir,
     and I, when I took over the system, altered it so that the
     tapes would run at a normal speed so that people could view
     them on normal video recorders.      However, that also means
     that the tapes have to be ch an ge d during the match.   At
     this particular time when I checked them, they were running
     in the correct mode, that is normal speed.

Q.        MR. KALLIPETIS:   Yes, the time that you are talking about
     is when you were asked whether the scene outside Leppings
     Lane was being recorded?   A.   T h a t âs right, sir.

Q. So you are ^aying it is after that that somehow the switch
   is knocked, are you?   A.   Yes, that's right.

Q . A n d which switch was knocked?  A.   There are three buttons
     on the front of the video recorders and one of those which
     changes it from normal mode to 18-hour time lapse system.

Q.   When you were asked to take over the VHF link with Force
     Control, can you remember when that was?   A.   My con ce nt ra ti on
     was applied to that just after 3 o'clock, basically when we
     realised that things were going wrong.

Q. Because up to that time your main and primary duty would be
   with the videos, would it not?   A.   It was, yes.

Q.   You have had a chance to see the transcript from Snig Hill,
     I think, Mr. Bichard, have you not?   A.    I have now got
     that with me, yes.

Q. Can you tell me when, in fact, you took over from looking
   at the transcript?   Do any of the messages ring a bell with
   you?   A.   There were certain messages that were passed
   by me prior to 3 o'clock.   I would say around 5 past, 6
   minutes past 3 is when I made a conscious decision to pay
   the full attention to the VHF radio, if you like, when the
   rescue operation had begun.

Q. Who was operating the VHF radio in contact with Force Control
   before you gave your con sc io us attention to it? A.   I was
   monitoring it and operating it on the odd occasion when I
   used i t .                                             i-
                                                                      T. BICHARD


                             2. You did not hear any conversation specifically from Inspector
                                Murray about a difficulty making contact with the Club? -
                                A. Again I can't, obviously it is a very active time. I
                                have no recollection of any conversation.

                              . Mr. Bichard, is that the position that a number of peopie
                                were doing different things and not everybody would have
                                known what everybody else was doing? - A. Once we were aware
                         B      about the fullness of this incident each individual took
                                upon themselves their individual tasks, so you would not be
                                fully aware of what was happening elsewhere.

                             Q. Mr. Bichard, I am sure we all sympathise with that, but the
                                conversation that I was putting to you as to whether you could
                                help was somewhat earlier.  Mr. Murray thought that he had
                                tried to get in touch with the Club before the decision to
                                open the gates was made. Again I can only ask you this:    if
                                in fact there were difficulties at that stage, something let
                                us say at about a quarter-to-3 .... A. Again it is not
                                in my recollection.

                             Q. And the last matter, and forgive me there is only one question
                                on the question of the opening of the gates.  Can I just
                                ask you to clarify this: Mr. Duckenfield and Mr. Murray have
                         D      both told the Inquiry that they had expected all the gates to
                                be opened? - A. I would accept that if that is what they are
                                saying.

                             Q. That is what they expected and you have told us that your
                                expectation was different? - A. That is right, Gate C.

                         E        And I think you have also said that the reason for that you
                                  believe, from recollection, is that because your camera
                                  happened to be looking at Gate C at that time, you had
                                  assumed that was the gate about which Superintendent Marshall
                                  was speaking? - A. The actual scene is available on that
                                  camera.  It shows a clear picture of Gate C. Gate 3 is out
                                  of view.  Gate A is out of view.

                                  And that is what you were concentrating on personally? - A.
                                  That is right.

                             Q.   And     you were unaware of the fact that Mr.Duckenfield and
                                  Mr. Murray wanted all the gates opened? - A. I am unaware
                                  of that, yes.

                             Q. It is just this question in the light of that background,
                                Mr. Bichard.  After the order to open the gates was given
                                on the first occasion, we can see on the video that you
                                zoomed in on Gate C first of all? - A. Yes.

                             Q. Do you remember that? - A. I don't actually, because I have
                                not had an opportunity ....   I have seen a compilation tape
                                but I have not seen the tapes I produced.

                         H   Q.   All I wanted your help with was   when you did zoom in on Gate C

   you said this morning that you drew that to"his attention"?
   - A. Yes.

Q. Whose attention did you draw to the fact that Gate C was
   being opened? - A. When I made the comment about it being
   forced open?

Q. Yes? - A. It would be directed at Mr. Duckenfield, but also
   to everybody who was in the Control Box.

Q. But are you saying that you have a specific recollection
   of drawing Mr. Duckenfield's attention to the gate which you
   were zooming in on at the time when the first entry was
   made? - A- When the gate was, as I believed forced, and I
   have shouted out the comments that I have put in my statement
   and it has been directed to Mr. Duckenfield who has been
   stood just in front of me.

Q. And likewise approximately five minutes later when there was
   conversation specifically about Gate A, and I think we can
   tell you without fear of contradiction that you zoomed in
   on Gate A as well? - A. Yes, I have got that recollection
   now of seeing two lines of Police Officers behind Gate A.

Q. And zooming in on them? - A. And moving in on that scene, yes.

Q. When you zoomed in on Gate A, those minutes later after
    the initial zoom on Gate C, can you recall whether anyth; -.9
    was said at all inside the Control Box about why Gate A
    had not been opened earlier? - A. No, I know why 1 zoomed
   ;ln on Gate A because of the radio message from Sergeant
  âHiggins, that is why I went there, but I have no idea of
    any conversation after that.

         MR. GLASGOW:   Thank you very much.   Thank you sir.


                  Cross-Examined by MR. 1700017ARP:

Q. Mr. Bichard, may I ask you about the monitoring at Snig
   Hill. Until the major incident was declared, was Snig Hill
   listening in to the communications that were passing?
   - A. To my knowledge they were listening to Channel 25,
   personal radio.

Q. During the time that you were in the Control Room up to the
   moment that Gate C was opened and caused you to shout out,
   had you been expecting that gate to open? - A. Certainly
   not.
Q. When you observed what was shown on the television screen,
   was it a matter of surprise to you? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you shout it out? - A. Yes.

Q. However, did you make any specific conmunication to Snig Hill


                                                                l u l
                                                                               A




with is this; you were not present but you will be aware
that in April/May this year we sat for two-and-a-half weeks
approximately and we dealt with the 95 deceased and we
dealt with three issues which Coroners deal with; who the
deceased was, when he/she died and where he/she died.    I
specifically excluded from discussion at that time the
question of how he or she died because as you will
recollect the DPP was still actively considering the matter
and we did not want to trammel his investigation but, on
the other hand, I felt it was right we should allow people
to hear what we could deal with.

     I will raise the second point at the same time because
it may be easier for you to deal with the two things
together.   At those hearings we dealt in considerable
detail, in fact infinitely more detail than we would
normally deal with in an Inquest, with events after the
pathological cause of death and I did it because I realised
that the families were desperately anxious to know what had
happened immediately after the incident.   My question to
you is - and I think this is what we need to deal with and
get right - bearing in mind we have only dealt with the
question of who, when and where and that we have done it in
considerably greater detail than one would normally expect
to do, why is it necessary to review that very activity
again which I think is what you are really asking me to do?

      MR. KING:       Sir, as I u n d e r d u a l
Inquests there was not an e n q u i r ^ ^ ^ v ia^W6^^-**dividual
cases, the impact of the organisation rescue on the
survival or ottii^swise of the particular loved one.                     All

death was certified.           In many of theiSÂ£ases there^^s^ a

services available to deal with those being brc^&iit off and
|J:..I can just give one or two examples of^fchat, '
                                                   âyi&u have
examples of people who are brougfctoff at                it is
j^aid /that there was an effort to resuscitate by

heard of again, or lire                       it i s ^ ^ i d that
the given loved one arrives at tiie temporary mortuary.
Tiere has beett Ho ij^^Sti^atiotf dir^cted to the g!|i|>al -
otg^nisation <|^iaba^^H^^^ed immediately after ^fcllfy were
||^aghtL Qff the terraces. Certainly I have been through

                         that.issue and those witnesses who
were called could not deal with those issues, sir.
   ' THE CORONER:   Are you suggesting that the cause of
death in respect of these individuals is not in fact the
pathological cause of death which we have been given but due
to a novus actus in effect by person or persons whose
evidence you have not yet heard?
      HR. KING:    Certainly the families, and I put it as
openly as this, sir, and putting it bluntly, cards on the
table, are not conviiiiiaâ* f c - b e e n                  a far
more sensible, logical organisation of-the rescue services,
Qf the major disaster%Â£im iswB&ng,Jarc^gj^t:j fa Si^ f proper_
medical equipment being available, of proper triage being
carried out, that those measures, had they been there, in
SHYSjral cases, would not have resulted in the survival Of
       loved ones.    They cannot - obviously they were not
there - produce through me concrete evidence of that at this
stage but at every stage of an Inquiry into this disaster,
and this certainly is true even in the Taylor Inquiry, that
particular aspect of the disaster has never properly been
gone into.
     Again putting it very simply to you, sir, most of the
families I represent feel there has been a complete blanket
(not a deliberate blanket) been held down over what happened
after they were brought off the terraces and before
individuals were certified dead and there has been no effort f
made systematically to analyse what was the organisation at
the time for the rescue, what might have been, and what could
have made a difference.    A 'Vftry simple example again is that
I am instructed there is ev i Alte of Dr.       Gumpertgiven at the
Inquest that without an elecOfccardiogram we can never be
sire whether or not there is W pulse and when dealing with
individual loved Â©fies taken off the terraces and simply dealt
with by lay people, the absence of such sort of equipment
means that one would never know whether or not that
individual wasâ_alive or dead at that stage.         It is a
matter - and Iido not mean this                     â which is swept
undertime carpet as if 'to say,' *All"':
                                       'ii6;'"^#;:i.nterested in is
the immediate crushing leading to those beingbrc*ught Qff the
terraces".   I cannot put it any more firmly tnaji that, sir.

     THE CORONER:    You have put it very plainlyand I
appreciate it.    I will give a ruling onyour application in
a few moments but do you want to develop it further?
Obviously I want an opportunity to hear from your colleagues.

     MR. KING:    Have you the individual statements which
were supplied?
     THE CORONER:   I do have those in front of me.   I would
not want to go through all of them but if you wish to pick
one or two as examples I am prepared to listen to you and
indeed it also makes it easier for everybody else.
     MR. KING:    Sir, if you were to turn to No. 11 to start
with, which is the submissions to you of the Jones family,
Richard Jones, I do not know whether you have been given one
or two documents.    I have two documents in relation to Mr.
Jones one headed "Dear Miss Steel" and one headed "Dear Mr.
King".

     THE CORONER:      No. 11, did you say?

     MR. KING:   Yes, sir.    Ibeg your pardon, sir, it is
No. 10.   Sir,   if you look --

     THE CORONER:    Mr. King, may I just stop you for one
moment because something has occurred to me, and I have been
reminded, which I ought to say to the Press before we go
further?    The session this morning is being heard without
the Jury and the reason we have not got the Jury is because
we are dealing with legal points.    That means no doubt that
you can report we are in session but you should not actually
report what is being said.    You will no doubt be familiar
with the provisions of Subsection 2 of Section 4 of the
Contempt of Court Act and I say you must not report what we
are discussing.    If we had wanted the Jury to hear we would
have had them present but we do not wish them to hear at this
stage.   You may, when we have finished the Inquest, if you
still feel it is a reportable and interesting aspect then, of
course, that is a different matter but for the moment please
do not report the content of the legal matters we are
discussing.    Mr. King, I am sorry to interrupt you, would
you continue?                 *

     MR. KING:   Sir, the document I am looking at and I
appreciate those alongside me are not looking at any document
but it is just to help you is one headed to myself, "Dear Mr.
King".

     THE CORONER:   I have a document headed "Dear Miss
Steel" dated 22nd October.

     MR. KING:      Sir, this is dated 7th November.

     THE CORONER:   I have not got it I am afraid.     It is
not in front of me.

     MR. KING:   I apologise for that and I will take you
through, if I may, through five points which are raised by
Mr. and Mrs. Jones.   Sir, they make the basic point that the
report into the death of their loved one, Richard, was
certified at 1600 hours in the temporary mortuary and,
therefore, so far as the family are concerned, so far as
evidence is concerned, they presume, as they say they must be
entitled to, up to that time the evidence of death is not
clear as having already occurred.

     Point No. 2, sir, is extracted from the evidence given
by Dr. Gumpert at the Inquest already held here and in fact
it was evidence given on the occasion of Kevin Tyrrell and,
sir, it is a quotation from his evidence which you may
recall:
     "I would like to observe that feeling the carotid pulse
     is quite difficult in someone who has a low blood
     pressure as would have been here.   In fact it can be so
     difficult it is impossible and you have to have an
     electrocardiogram on to know whether the heart has
     stopped or not."
     Then there is the statement of Mr. Eccleston, which is
certainly a statement in the large bundle of statements given
to the West Midlands Police, and indeed Mr. Eccleston gave
evidence to the Taylor Inquiry in which he says this:


                                  /"For an extremely long.
     "For an extremely long time we were without an/ form
     of medical equipment of any description.   I still
     cannot understand wny the local health authority's
     major medical disaster team were not called upon.  I
     understand that all health authorities in this
     country have a major disaster policy.   It is
     impossible accurately to estimate the difference this
     would have made in saving life.  I do, however,
     believe that the Liverpool fans should have been
     given tne chance".

And the question raised by Mr. and Mrs. Jones is this,
sir: tnere was a major incident vehicle. Why was it not
called? Lack of equipment undoubtedly resulted in deaths.

     Sir, I pause tnere. Of course, Mr. and Mrs. Jones
were not there and of course they are not experts, but you
will see, sir, from the basis of that evidence they are
firmly of the belief that one cannot just ignore an
inquiry, an inquest, into that aspect.

       Sir, number 4 point made by Mr. and Mrs. Jones comes
from tne statement made, again in the large bundle* sir,
from Dr. Glynn Phillips, particularly where he says that
after 3.15 p.m. he gave mouth to mout resuscitation to a
man ^ o r 15 minutes, and just as he w j i v i n g up the heart
sprang to life, and after that tne man started breathing
do#his ow-n.   We-? know that this does not prove this mao.,
liv^Sf^âdf^ if he did he may have been brain damaged, but
the point we are trying to put across to the coroner is
that after 3.15 p.m. not all the people who were later
certified dead were necessarily dead.

     Sir, finally Mr. and Mrs. Jones direct your attention
to the long statement which I am sure you have seen, sir,
of Dr. John Asnton in which tnere is a series of reasoned
critical comments on the disorganisation of the medical
and the rescue attempts, honest and in good faith tnough
they were, after the people were brought off the terraces.

     Sir, that is Mr. and Mrs. Jones in t.iose comments and
in the short letter, sir, which you have, which you have
already referred me to, sir, they emphasise an issue as to
the failure to implement triage after the disaster
happened, again, concentrating on what Dr. Gumpert has
said as to the fact that without an electro-cardiogram it
is not possible to know wnether a heart has stoppped.

     Sir, can I move on from Mr. and Mrs. Jones' comments
and just give you one or two more examples - I appreciate
that in man/ ways it is repetitious but it is making the
point - to number 14, sir, which is in the case of William
Roy Pemberton.

     THE C030NER:    And this one is addressed    to you.
                                                                   9




     MR. KING:   Sir, it is not often that instructions           to
Counsel are given in advance to the Tribunal, and I
suspect, sir, that it is not a wise move in most cases.

      THE CORONER:     You are probably right.

     MR. KING:   Sir, it was an effort in tne relatively
short time since we were before you to put before you the
various matters which the families wished to place before
you and it was felt this was the easiest way to do so,
sir.

       Sir, if I can then turn to Mr. Pemberton, you will
see that he makes the following points:         the report into
tbp death of his loved one Roy that             l*Sa | n iâ¢ his cape
wat'pronounced extinct at 16.00 h<>4arsl^^rs,''arid a g a i n in
the absence of medical evidence to the contrary, the
family can only assume that tneir loved one was a l i v #
until that hour, and sir, if you then go to paragraph 3 of
that document you will see there is a reference to tne
statement of Mr. Saxton of the St. John's Ambulance
Service, because he refers to tne resuscitation of a youtig
roan .a:i.,jLÂ§*50' hours, in4icaÂ£4i#g in the heart-felt view of
Mr. Pemberton, as with all the other families, that death
must have occurred after 3.15 p.m*

     Again ne refers you, sir, in paragraph 4, to the
statement of Dr. Byrne wnen he quotes that he was
approacned by a senior Police Officer and asked to start
certifying the dead as tnere may be some still alive, and
sir, again, the point has been made that as we only know
for certain that death was at 4 o'clock, to ignore these
concerns as to the adequacy of the attentions and the
rescue efforts after 3.15 is to not investigate what could
well have been a major reason for why somebody died and
did not survive.

     The final point on Mr. Pemberton, sir, in paragraph
7, is the question he asks:  why was it that the very
seriously ill and dving, and those who appeared to be
dead, were not taken to the hospital in the very first
available ambulance, and ne raises himself the issue as to
why the serious accident response vehicle was not called
out to the stadium, as he understands to be the case.

     Sir, if I can then deal with perhaps one example of
minutias, of detail, if one turns to the cases of the
Hicks sisters, of Victoria and Sarah Hicks, sir, wnich is
at numbers 7 and 3 in your list, sir, you will notice the
case of Victoria, tnat on tne face of tne summary wnich
was produced at the Inquest prior to today, there was a
gap in time.  There is a gap in time between 15.21, which
was the time when Police Constable Mc#ainness r e s c u e ^
Victoria from a pile of those who unfortunately had
fallen, and 15.23 when Mr. Turner was seen helping -
Victoria out onto the pitch?
                                                                   10




     Mr. Hicks has drawn to your attention, sir, that he
has drawn to the attention of this Inquest the evidence of
a gentleman, a Mr. Taylor, whose evidence is that he was
on the very terrace where Victoria was after she had been
 rescued" by P.C. McGuinness, and that for some six
minutes he did not, in fact, resuscitate because the poor
man did not know wnat to do, and one can understand that,
but as Mr. Hicks says, those six minutes could have been
vital to the survival of his loved one Victoria, had she
received the proper attention.

     Sir, that is just an example of matters which,       in Mr.
Hicks's submission tc you, through me, ought to be
investigated.

       Sir, if one turns to Sarah Hicks at number 8, again
if one looks at the timings we know that at 6-minutss-
past-3 a Miss McCaffery sees Sarah, who clearly has
fallen, and we know at 2l-minutes-past-3, helps the fallen
Sarah through onto the pitch.     Again, the time gap there
between S-minutes-past-3 and 21-minute3-pafst-3* ^ f e j ^ n o w
it was not unti,l ;*20-past-4 that Dr..*...Bull exaffl&B^ed Sarah
and certified ner death, and we know from the summary that
i t i s said that at some time between 15.38 and 15.50 an
unidentified member of the medical team stated in his view
that Sarah was at that time beyond help.

     All tnose times, sir, go beyond 3.15 and they again
illustrate the need in the submission of the families for
tne times after 3.15 to be thoroughly investigated^'

     Sir, those are just four examples but, sir, if you
read tiff papers which I understand and I am sure you have
they express the flavour of all the other submissions
that, in fact, we cannot know that a cut off point at this
stage is the right cut off point at 3.15 and it is
premature, sir, so to do, in my submission to you.   That
is how I put it.

     THE CORONER:     Thank you very much indeed, Mr.  King.
I think ^hat we will now do is to give the rest of you an
opportunity to make points.     I think we ought to start
with Mrs. McBrien.    I think you would probably support
what has been said, but is there anything in addition to
vhat Mr. King has said that you feel you would like to
tell me.   Mrs. Mc3rien can I say if you are more
comfortable sitting down - indeed, that goes for all of
you - if you are more comfortable sitting down, sit down.
I don't mind - it does not make any difference.     I know
some of your legal colleagues sitting around you are used
to standing so they will tend to rise, but you do what is
comfortable.   Mrs. McBrien, is there anything you want to
aid   r,o what Mr. Kingnas told me?

     MRS. McB RIE N: No, I go along with everything       that
Mr. King has said, thank you.
                                                          13




That is a matter which my learned friend will, I am sure, fully
understand.  I merely mention it now so it is not said that it is
mentioned with hindsight afterwards.  There may, indeed, be a
great deal of difference between the responsibility or lack of
responsibility on the part of some of those who died, and
separate representation would in normal circumstances be required
because it may be that one family would make an allegation
against another. Again, I give as an example, and I am not
saying that any such person exists, but if it were shown that
someone who died had come at the very last minute with a great
deal of alcohol inside him and had made his way right down to the
front, pushing and crushing, and had caused some deaths, then
that would be a matter where he or his relatives might well
require to be separately represented.

     THE CORONER:   Yes. Mr. Manning, if I may say so, the issue
of representation is (a) for the families, because that is to
whom you were applying your mind, and (b) for the legal
representatives who obviously have to weigh whatever conflict of
interest there may be between their clients.  So that is really
not a matter for me, and it is not probably even a matter for
you.  It is a matter for Mr. King and his instructing solicitors,
and, of course, primarily for the parties themselves.

      Perhaps I should say one other thing.   You have mentioned a
couple of verdicts and matters like that.    I am not getting into
an argument at this stage as to what verdict if any the Jury
would bring in, or even what directions, if any, I am going to
give them, because the objective of this Inquest as far as it has
one is to hear the evidence and to enable the Jury to reach a
verdict on the evidence.   I have the advantage of having seen
loads of statements.   I do acknowledge that, but experience has
taught me in much simpler Inquests than this that it is not
infrequent that what you think is going to be the verdict does
not turn out to be because the evidence when it actually comes,
or the nuance, if you like, or the innuendoes, or any word you
care to use, is different to what I had anticipated from just
looking at the statement. So I have made it as far as I am
able a rule not to predetermine the answer but to wait until I
have heard the evidence.   I say this not as a criticism of you
but just as a clarification for everybody.    I do intend to
listen to what is said, which is the reason why we are here
this morning. Obviously, I have read statements and I have
ideas myself, but the crucial thing is the Jury, they have got
to make up their mind, and they do it in the light of the
evidence, and I will do my best. I can't do more than that.     I
am sorry, Mr. Payne.

     MR. PAYNE:   Sir, with regard to the .submissions by Mr.
King, the position of the Chief Constable is that he is neutral.
I have got no submissions to make about what Mr. King is asking
you to do, but I wish it to be heard that the position of the
Chief Constable is that he wants to do everything he can to â
assist you in the conduct of this Inquest, and certainly does, not
wish to do anything to put in the way of Mr. King any obstruction
into any enquiry that he wants to make on behalf of the relatives
of the people who died. Sir, that is the position.
                                                            14




    , As a comment on what Mr. King has said, strictly it appears
to us that he is saying that there is the possibility,, to put it
in a legal term, of a novus actus, i.e. something which
intervened after the crushing and before the deaths, which caused
or contributed to the deaths of at least some Sf 'tfte people,* and
the response of the Chief Constable to that submission, if I put
it correctly, is ..that we                      something which
people would                                             of how it
came about. I only makethatcomment in     an endeavour to be""
helpful, but the position oftheChief Constable is that      he has
no submissions one way or the other.

     May I just say while I am on my feet with regard to what Mr.
Hale has just said, as a matter of fact it is not correct that
the Police have admitted negligence.   It is well known and has
been well publicised that what has happened is that the Police
have agreed to make payments to those people who were injured and
to the dependents of those who died, and that such payments are
in the process of being made.   Also there has been a civil action
in respect of apportionment of liability in respect of those
matters.

     THE CORONER:   Thank you very much, indeed.  I accept
entirely what you say and in a sense I accept what Mr. Manning
says as well.  It is not really relevant to my proceedings
whether or not negligence has been admitted or not admitted.   It
is neither here nor there. So I did not comment on it, but I
appreciate what you have said.

     MR. ISAACS:   I think, sir, in fact, that is Mr. Hale.      Mr.
Manning sits to my left.

     THE CORONER:     I beg your pardon.   Forgive me, please, both
of you.

     MR. ISAACS:   Sir, I have no submissions.  It is entirely a
matter for you having regard to the breadth or depth which you
consider appropriate for this particular Inquest.

     MR. MANNING:   Sir, I have exactly similar comments as far
as my client is concerned.

     MISS SINCLAIR:      I have no submissions on this matter, sir.

     MR. CATCHPOLE:   I add to that.  The matter is entirely for
you. You are the best person, having read all the evidence, to
make that judgment, and no doubt that was the reason we had, as
you have already pointed out, sir, a fairly detailed
investigation into the earlier Inquests.

     MR. CALLAGHAN:   Sir, this is not an application of which I
have had previous notice, and which in the circumstances of the
application is some surprise to me. All I think I should, sir,
is this is not the time and place tor some sort of Public Inquiry
into the activities of the Ambulance Service and the Emergency
Services, and it is not appropriate to bring such a matter into
                                                            15




the arena as a sort of   side   wind. Beyond that, sir, it is
obviously a matter for   you.

     MISS ADDELMANN:    Sir,   I    have no observations or submiss
about the point, and I can do no better than echo those remarks
made by my learned friend, Mr. Catchpole.

     MR. RUSSELL:   I too endorse those remarks. None of us,
other than my learned friend, Mr. King, has seen the original
statements, and so are being invited to comment upon a course in
the dark because we have not seen the nature of an example of the
material he now seeks to rely upon.  I recognise it is a matter
for you, and if you decide I donât take a stance one way or the
other.

     THE CORONER:   Shall I then deal with this point? Is there
anybody else wants to say anything on this issue? Mr. King?

     MR. KING:   Sir, only to emphasise that it is not a sijte
wind which I am embarking on. I am seeking to address causqfe,
contributory causes to the deaths, and I am concentrating on
that, and it is in t|jat context I     invited the Court to look
beyond 3.15, and certainly we are dealing with it from the point
of view of possibilities of novus actus, yes, I accept that.

     THE CORONER:   I have listened hopefully with attention, and
perhaps I ought to say this to you, Mr. Russell, before I go on.
I know you have not had the advantage of seeing the letter, but
it is only fair to say Mr. King in his summary of the points as
far as I can see summarised the points which his clients were
making entirely fairly. There is nothing extra in the letter, so
to speak, except connecting words, basically.  That is for your
reassurance, if I can put it like that.

     Throughout, and in fact almost from the word "go" on the
15th April, 1989, when I first learned about this incident, one
of the underlying criteria which I tried to apply in thinking
how to set about dealing with the Inquests was to as far as
possible treat the Inquests as if they were completely
standard, if I can put it like that - it is a horrible word -
but completely normal Inquests. The fact that it was national
news, that it was 95 young people, that it created a terrible
amount of anxiety, pain and so on, in some ways is unique
because of the numbers, but each individual death I dealt with
families are in exactly the same situation, and I tried to
think and I still try to think, what and how would I set about
if I had had a road traffic incident or a works accident as
opposed to an incident in a football stadium.  I have thought
back on many occasions to say a road traffic incident where
somebody might have suffered a serious head injury. That
person may well have been at the road side for X number of
minutes while one was waiting for the ambulance services to
attend. They may then have been taken by an ambulance to a
hospital. They may have gone into the resuscitation room.
They may have been worked on by the doctors. They may have gone
into hospital and they may have then died two, three days, may
be longer after the incident. Or alternatively, you could have
                                                         16




a situation where by chance the road traffic incident occurs on
the road and a doctor happens to be. He walks up to the
patient, looks and says, "I am sorry, the injury is so severe
that this person is dead". Or you could have a situation where
the person has this road traffic incident and is taken into
hospital and is certified dead on arrival.

      In none of those instances would I as a matter of routine
call evidence of what happened after the incident ;itself was
concerned, and indeed, the pathologists in the example which i
have used would have given as cause of death serious head injury,
for instance, or multiple injuries with fracture of the skull, or
something of that nature.   It seems to me that the fact that the
person may survive an injury for a number of minutes or hours or
even days, is not the question which I as Coroner have to
consider. My task is to establish who the person was - I am
sorry to repeat this - where he died, when he died and how he
died.   It is from my understanding of the pathological evidence,
the overwhelming pathological evidence is and was that the people
died as a result of crushing or traumatic asphyxia.   Different
words were used, but the sense was always the same. The
underlying problem which these poor men and women were subjected
to was an inability to breathe.

     That does not mean to say that some of them did not in fact
respire for a period of time or even have a heart beat
thereafter, but the damage was done, and indeed, both Dr.
Gumpert, Dr. Slater, Prof. Usher, who dealt with this question in
an overall point of view, all in fact said, as I understand their
evidence, exactly the same.

     One of the points, Mr. King, which you have made is that
because ;a person has not been certified dead until a particular
point in time, one must therefore assume that he is alive. With
the greatest respect I donât accept that as a reasonable -
"reasonable" is a very unkind word - as a proposition which I
would take.  Indeed, if you think about it for a moment I am sure
you would agree with me, if a body were to be found in a
macerated state one would call a doctor who would
certify death, but it would be a little bit illogical to
assume that that particular body was actually alive
until that point.

     The issue of death certification and the timing of it is
important, because one wants to have if possible certainty. That
is the first thing. Secondly, the conventional way of
establishing a person is definite dead is that a medical man says
so, but to draw the conclusion that until a medical man has said
so a person is alive is in my view an impossible proposition to
maintain.




                    /I do understand the anxiety....
                                                              17

         I do understand the anxiety which a lot of the families
    have about this issue, but as I have already said the
    overwhelming medical evidence, the pathological evidence,
B   and that is the crucial one I am interested in, is the^
    damage that caused the death was done due to the crushing.

         Now I picked the arrival of the first ambulance not
    because there is anything magical about that but because^
    when we look at the videos we can actually see that and it
    is a convenient marker, that is all.   If the first
    ambulance had arrived at 3.30 I would have picked that time.
    It is simply intended as a marker, but, and this is an
    important point, I considered the medical evidence.  The
    medical evidence was that once - I am not quoting verbatim -
    but the sense of what Professor Usher said, and, indeed, the
    others as well, was that once the chest was fixed so that
    respiration could no longer take place, then irrecoverable
    brain damage would occur between four and six minutes.
    That is the point.

_         Now I felt that the evidence which I had heard and in
D    the light of what I had read that the latest time, the
    latest, when this permanent fixation could have arisen would
    have been approximately six minutes past, which is when the
    match stopped.    It almost certainly was before, but let us
    assume six minutes past, add another six minutes to that,
    that is twelve minutes past and then as I say I went on to
    find a convenient marker beyond that point in time.     In^
    other words, what I am trying to say is I did not just pick
    the arrival of the first ambulance entirely out of the blue,
    I did try and consider in the light of the evidence which we
    had heard what could have been the latest time when the real
    damage was done.

         I have already indicated that at the - I will call them
    the interim inquests if I may just for the sake of a name -
    we did endeavour to give a great deal more information or
    svidence than we would ever do in a normal inquest and in
    that sense I broke my own rule straight away because I said
    I wanted to treat this matter as if it were a completely
    standard normal road traffic incident, if you like.    I
    didn't, I gave a great deal of information for various
    reasons which I don't need to go into now.

         As an aside I can assure you that within the limits of
    our ability the summaries and the evidence which was given
    was an accurate reflection of what people said and if there
    was a gap, for instance, as has been suggested in some cases
    which is unexplained, the reason wasn't because there is
    some hidden evidence which we have put under the curtain,
    but because we didn't know of it or couldn't find it or it
    doesn't exist.  The truth of the matter, of course, is that
    people weren't being watched individually continuously by




H
                                                             18




someb'ody else   recording what was happening.   It is entirely
fortuitous as    to whether or not there is a witness or
witnesses who    happens (a) to have been with a person, (b)
who remembers    who he is and (c) has some idea of the timing.

     Some of you who were there will remember that in some
cases we had a great deal of evidence with regard to what
had happened post-crush, shall I say, and in others we had
next to nothing because it is very sad particularly for
those families where we have got so little to share with
them, but we are living in the real world and in some cases
there was overwhelming - for instance, there were dozens of
photographs as you know - some of the people were all over
the newspapers and in others we could not find any.     It
can't be helped, it is just one of those things.

     Bearing in mind that I intend at this stage to deal
with the question of how, and I do intend to deal with it
reasonably comprehensively, I have to remember two things:
that my powers are limited.   I don't have an open ended
authority to carry out an investigation.   The Rules and the
Act, indeed, are quite clear as to the limits of what the
coronal inquiry should be.   I admit that the word "how" is
a little bit flexible and assuming we call all those
witnesses on that preliminary list which I have circulated I
hope you will agree that I have been reasonably flexible
with that word, but nevertheless I do have to draw a line.
Indeed, this was done in other inquests.   If you think back
to the Zeebrugge inquest, for instance.  The learned Coroner
there drew a line.   He was judicially reviewed on where he
drew it and in that particular case the Divisional Court or
the Court of Appeal, I can't remember now, clearly said that
a line has to be drawn and in the Zeebrugge case they agreed
it was right.   I am doing my best.   I am trying to draw a
line as well.

      If you think of the other major disasters where
inquests have already taken place, you will find that lines
were drawn there as well and I think you will find that the
line with regard to the question which we are now thinking
about was very, very much tighter than what we have already
done.

     In answer to your submission, I still consider that as
a general proposition we are going to accept - I am going to
take these inquests and deal with the question of how on the
basis of what happened to about 3.15 or thereabouts.   I
have explained it to you so I am not going to repeat it and
I base it mainly upon the pathological medical evidence.

     Having said that, I think it is probably right to say
because we will be calling witnesses it may be that some of
the things which worry you may be dealt with to a minor




                                                                  4 b

degree but it is certainly not my intention to allow us to
stray down that path.

     I have also got to say, it is only r âght, that what I
think you are really inviting me to do, Mr. King, is to hold
a further judicial inquiry into matters into which, as I
understand it, are outside my authority and scope.    I also
seem to recollect, although Lord Justice Taylor s Inquiry
isn't - as I have already said to you at the business
meeting, I don't really want to spend too much time on it -
but I do recollect that the emergency services were very
well represented at that Inquiry and, indeed, a lot of
discussion, from my reading of the transcripts, did deal
with the issues of the medical response.

     Whether or not that was satisfactory, whether Lord
Justice Taylor should have done more, whether somebody else
should look into that when we have finished that is nothing
to do with me.   However, as far as I am concerned, my
intention is to stick with what I gave you as my initial
preliminary intention.

     I have, of course, already looked through the documents
which you sent me and insofar as in one or two instances
witnesses are mentioned, if I think, and, indeed, I have
thought that one or two of these in fact I think three at
the moment, you have got a point.   It would perhaps be
advantageous to call those persons and we are making
appropriate arrangements.   Please don't think that I have
said, "Good grief, fifty pages, I am not dealing with that,"
I have already spent quite a bit of time thinking about it
and I will hopefully have another look.   If I were - which
is highly unlikely - in any particular instance to feel we
ought to go a little bit further down that line because
there is a specific point to be made in any particular
instance, then I will if I think it necessary, tell you.
However, I think it is unlikely from what I have seen and
what I have read and for the reasons which I have given you.




           MR. KING:   Sir, thank you for that...

                                     a short course in pathology. What I am going to do is to ask
                                     Prof. Usher to explain some of the words which are used,
                                     because you will hear them over and over again, and it may
                                     easier if you have had them explained at the beginning. just
                                     as words:

                           D|      very often is "petechiaâ and "haemorrhage". Could you just
                                   explain what the word "petechia" means and what the word
                                   "haemorrhage" for that matter means in that context? - A. Yes.
                                   I could do it perhaps better if I said that petechial
                                   haemorrhages are signs of asphyxia and then define asphyxia.

                                      So that the general picture of a person who has died from
                           B     asphyxia is of bluish cyanosis, as it is called, bluish
                                 appearance about the face and elsewhere, and the presence o
                                 petechiae somewhere in the body, frequently in the eyes,
                                 frequently in the lax skin of both the eyelids, frequently
                                 internally on the surfaces of the lung and on the heart
                                 itself, and sometimes elsewhere. The picture that we saw in
                                 general in the people who died at Hillsborough was an
                                 asphyxial picture, and it was due to the fact that at some
                                 time they must have been packed so close that they were unable
                                 to move their chests and thus asphyxiated.
                                       If the asphyxia is prolonged it begins to affect other
                                  organs and in particular the brain. The brain is very
                                  sensitive to oxygen lack, and so,after four or five minutes of
                                  asphyxia -then' "damage' occurs "to' the' brain:, the more prolonged
                           D      the asphyxia is the more damage there is to the brain, and
                                  eventually the vital centres in the brain are damaged and then
                                  the person is technically dead.

                               C). How long does it take for a person who is asphyxiated to (a)
                                   lose consciousness, and (b ) get to the stage where irreparable
                                   damage has been done? - A . Well, once the chest becomes
                                   absolutely and finally fixed in the situation I imagin#,as #e
                                   had it at Hillsborough - there were moments of intermittent
                                   fixation of the chest in many of the cases - but once the
                                   chest becomes finally fixed then it is a matter of minutes,
                                   between four and six minutes usually, before the person dies,
                                   but it is a very short time mercifully before they lÂ®Sfe
                                   consciousness. They may lose consciousness in 10 to 15
                                   seconds.

                               Q. So in other words, once asphyxia actually takes hold properly,
                                  shall we say, then the loss of consciousness is very quick? -
                                  A . Yes.

                               Q. And death between four and six minutes, of that order? - A .
                                  Yes, that is the usual.
                            ;q . if a person is active and struggling, does it make any
                                 difference? - A. They use ox^fÂ©n-:;,;yIhey :use what oxygen they .

                                                then of course they will stand asphyxia Jwfery
                                            they may die in a much shorter t ime than that.

                                  right.

                              o. And inhalation is a very serious matter, is not i t, because it
                                 irritates the linings? - A. Y e s , that is right.

                              o. I think you prepared a report for Lord Justice Taylor, and one
                                 of the questions which are dealt with in that, I think, was
                                 the question of eye haemorrhages and the effects of people
                                 lying or standing? - A. Yes

                                      think it was put forward that you could differentiate between
                                      people who died standing up and p<eap,lÂ§. who died lying down
                                    â''because the people who died standing i*p

           DR. ERNEST JOHN WALLACE GUHPERT Sworn

                      By THE CORONER:

Q. Dr. Gumpert, could you first of all give us your full
   names, qualifications and appointment? - A. Ernest John
   Wallace Gumpert.   l a m a Bachelor of Medicine of the
   University at Cambridge, Bachelor of Surgery of the
   University of Cambridge.    A Member of the Royal
   College of Surgeons and a Fellow of the Royal^ College
   of Physicians of London.    I am consulting^clinical
   neuro physiologist and consulting neurologist to the
   Sheffield Area Health Authority, Teaching."

Q. Dr. Gumpert, although you are a Sheffield m a n _
   professionally, I dragged you back from Cambridge
   today? - A. Y e s , sir.

0. Where I tracked you d o w n ! I very much appreciate the
   fact you dropped all your other arrangements in order
   to be here.    Thank you very much.     Dr. Guinpert, you,
   of course,had nothing whatever to     do with this case.
   i think you dealt with quite a lot of the injured
   following Hillsborough and indeed you may well know one
   or two people I will be referring to later, but this
   particular case was not one you came across.       You have
   heard the evidence which has been put regarding this ^
   young m a n .   What I would like you to do now is to give
   us a short    explanation, as you see death, in the first
   instance and then we will try and relate it to this
   young man and particularly Mr. Bruder's evidence
   relating to him. - A. In about 1979 or 1980 when it
   became possible to carry out renal transplantations or
   kidney transplantations, it became very important that
   the supply of kidneys of people who had died acutely,
   usually in accidents, could be increased because the
   life of a patient who has had a kidney transplant is
   completely different to the life of a patient who has
   to have dialysis three times a week.       They can go back
    to normal life.

   4 hypothesis of brain death was then discussed, agref>|
   Irid published.    This consisted of certain examination s
  fpf the back part of the brain, the part we call the
  llrain stem.     If you imagine the brain as beingJjgÂ§jie a
   walnut,          is, i t is like having -a--carrot slsSek
   underneath the walnut, and it is the carrot thrft
   matters.    This is where blood pressure, pulse,


   jfhis death occurs, as you heard from Dr. Slater, in
   ^between four .and six minutes after depifIvsi'M|p.of
   "oxygen, then the person is going to die.             be

                          - 15 -
                                                                 3 i)
                                 kept alive by artificial means and some of you may
                                 remember the case in America which was kept alive for
                                 thirteen and a half y e a i s .

                                 Some of us were concerned that the guidelines that were
                                 drawn up were not strict enough and that there was no
                                 call for them to be repeated after a passage of time.
                                 Perhaps unwisely we said this and this resulted in a
                          B      BBC "Panorama" programme one night at ten o 'clock _when
                                 the medical profession for once actually debated it,
                                 eight of us.   As a result of that debate the
                                 regulations were hardened.   They had to be carried out
                                 by senior people who were used to doing it and they had
                                 to be repeated.   A satisfactory outcome from my
                                 personal point of view, although I don *t know whether
                                 the anguish was worth it really.

                                  As a consequence of that I suppose in the next three
                                  years I had to go through this rather unpleasant
                                  procedure many times.   It was part of my professional
                                  duty but still to this day I cannot certify someone
                                  dead without being disturbed by it still.

                          J)      From this I suppose I have gained a great deal of
                                  experience of brain death and brain damage.   It seems
                                  clear to me, sir, in this case that poor Kevin was
                                  probably dead before he was got out of the area in
                                  which he was standing.   I would agree with Dr.^ Slater.
                                  I would think consciousness was lost probably within
                                  ten seconds.   I would say loss of pain would be almost
                                  instantaneous - not quite, but almost.

                                  I cannot explain the Liverpool Police Cons table's term
                                  "convulsion because to me a convulsion is a majjDr
                                  epileptic a t t a c k and he has q u i t e c l e a r l y s a i d he 3-0es

                                  means. - 1 think we c o u l d a c c e p t t h a t he                  "Bleats

                                  Unfortunately, after people are brain stem dead, they

                                  pulse when he approached this young man on the pitch,
                                  would that fit in with your understanding...                  Is that
                                  a possibility? - A. It,, is a..g.o,s,si;bl:i,,i,-|;:y^,,,sir.  I would
                                  like just to observe
                                  |aite                                                a low blood
                                  pressure, as would have been here.              In fact it can be
                                  so difficult it is impossible and you have to put an
                                  electrocardiogram on to know whether the heart has
                           1      Stopped or n<ft.

                                  I would also like to say something about resuscitatiorf.
                                  I was very fortunate when I qualified that I became
                                  house surgeon of a famous heart surgeon called Lord
                                  Brock at Guy's Hospital.      That was in the days when we
                                  did open cardiac mas sage.     In other words, if somebody
                           c      died you opened their chest and you massaged their
                                  heart between your hands.      A terrifying experience.
                                  It was while I was working for-him. that .one day three
                                  of us.-were doing it one mo.rp.i^..|:;;:that he stopped;it,
                                  and that was the start of Â©i'I#.fÂ«al cardiac massage.
                                  Even to somebody like me who has -been                   -for
                                  twenty-five years, it is still vfeifjr d i n i c u l t .    The
                                  las t time I tried to do it I failed completely.              Even
                           D      to a trained person it is difficult.          Indeed, i^hen
                                  junior doctors are examined for this n o w , as they a r e ,
                                  a significant number fail rather than pass.              It is
                                  quite difficult and for the lay person it must be
                                  incredibly difficult.

                               0. You heard D r . Slater *s account of death, shall we say.
                                  Would you go a long with tha t ? - A . I thought it was
                           E      eloquent.     I felt quite nervous!

                               0. You mentioned this point about unconsciousness and the
                                  loss of pain and I think you dis tinguish slightly
                                  there.   Can you give me any idea that if a person
                                  becomes unconscious, can he feel pain, and for how long
                                  can he feel pain, in your judgment? - A . Aga i n , Dr.
                                  Sla ter put it very clearly.      You all read in the
                           F      newspapers about patients - particularly when they have
                                  had caesarean sections, the ladies as usual - being
                                  able to tell what the doctors were talking about during
                                  the operation.    Again I have experienced this at first
                                  hand when I was doing heart surgery because then it was
                                  often very important not to depress the state of
                                  consciousness too far because things were pretty tricky
                                  anyhow.    When we used to resuscitate the patients we
                           G      used to give them an electric shock.       Lord Brock used
                                  to always shout, "Give it two fast ones."       The patient
                                  would then ask you the following morning two fast ones
                                  were.    Then you would ask, "Did you hear anything
                                  else?" and they d i d n ât, so it is all very much a
                                  ques tion of degree.

                                I think slipping from slight unconsciousness to deep
                                unconsciousness in this circumstance, one, because of
                                the compression and two because of the asphyxia and
                                three because as Dr. Slater again explained evepprt't
                                is shoved up into the head and so there -â'Â§31 nottilng
                                moving around, it would have-'^been very           almost as
                                quick as a rabbit punch I would have thought.
                          1          THE CORONER:     Mr. Fraser?

                                     MR. FRASER:     No questions,      sir.

                                              Cross-Examined by M R . LIMB :

                            0 . D r . Guinpert you have spoken in terms of passing in a
                                very quick space of time from slight unconsciousness to
                                deep unconsciousness.      Following deep unconsciousness,
                                do the eyelids remain open or are they closed? - A.
                                Either may occur. There is no particular rule.       The
                                thing we all see on the cinema of the person going to
                                close the dead person *s eyes.     I don't think I have
                                had to do that more than two or three times in my life.
                                Most of the people I have seen die have died with their
                          D     eyes shut.

                              0. Deep unconsciousness is associated with no longer
                                 feeling any pain or discomfort.    Is then the face of
                                 the person who is profoundly unconscious capable of
                                 grimaces or expressions which might be taken as showing
                                 pain or discomfort? - A . Not in my vie w , sir.

                              0. Is it in fact capable of any facial expression? - A.
                                 Hot in my view.

                              0. Following profound unconsciousness, is it right that
                                 the face will become discoloured towards the next stage
                                 of the sequence of events, namely, brain damage and
                                 thereafter brain death?

                                      THE CORONER:    Could you repeat that ques tion?

                                      MR. LIMB:   I am referring back to the process, or
                                 the sequences of events as out lined by Dr. Slater, sir.
                                 Firstly, unconsciousness, thereafter brain damage and
                                 thereafter again brain death.    The nature of my
                                 inquiry was as to whether following profound
                                 unconsciousness, although there may be no outward
                                 expressions there is this change that the face becomes
                                 discoloured?

                                      THE CORONER:    The greyness you are driving at?

                                      MR. LIMB:S i r , that is right.

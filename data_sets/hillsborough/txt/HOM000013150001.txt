HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY
On Tuesday 3 July 1990, Siv Richard Wells, the Chief Constable,
South Yorkshire, contacted me whilst I was in Scotland to inform
me that a Constable had now submitted a report concerning the
Hillsborough Inquiry. It appears that the             concerned
was a driver at the commencement of the Hillsborough Inquiry and
was present in the car when Lord Justice Taylor spoke to Mr
Geoffrey Dear, at that time the Chief Constable of West Midlands.
It appeared that Lord Justice Taylor said to Geoffrey Dear that
"the police must take the majority of the blame for the
Hillsborough disaster". It has been pointed out by the
that this was long before any inquiries were done into the
incident and therefore it illustrates that Lord Justice Taylor
was intent on blaming the police for the incident.
It should be borne in mind that the eventual interim report by
Lord Justice Taylor did very seriously criticise the police and
tended to exonerate the Liverpool supporters. There is no
question that the South Yorkshire Police feel aggrieved about
this matter and it would seem more than feasible that this
information which has now come forward from a
will, in due time, reach the public arena and cause mucn
publicity. It could also affect the situation for any criminal
charges that may be pending against officers of the South
Yorkshire Police Force.
On Wednesday evening, the 4 July 1990, I briefed John Chilcot
about the contents of this note.
I advised Richard Wells that he should see Allan Green, the
Director of Public Prosecutions, without delay in order to
discuss the matter about what\ steps should now be taken. The
matter will clearly have to h|e investigated. This matter is not
an issue that need be reported to thePolice Complaints Authority
because the           is not/a member of the public within the
definition nor is Geoffrey Dear any longer a police officer.

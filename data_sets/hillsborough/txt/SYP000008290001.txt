             It was a sea of fans,                    there was         a police         horse    to the       right     of    the

I noti ce d one y o u t h            being       passed out           from by the          turn st il es        to the

very a n xi ou s        to get       out    of    the       crush and        into     the ground.            We    couldn't

go f or wa rd and we            couldn't          go b ackwards            for     other     fans were          still

pushing        to get     in.        The    police          horse was        to our       right     hand side a n d so

were    some      barriers,          some     people were             crushed flat agai ns t               the walls           by

the    turnstiles.             I attempted            to make way towards a particular

t ur ns ti l e    but    it was a lm os t             impossible.            I was       being m o ve d about

i n vo lu nt a ry      taking       small    steps          in the d i r e c t i o n the         crowd w a n t e d       to

take    you.

1 n o ti ce d     people were             climb in g        onto    the walls         to the       left hand side              of

the t u r ns t il e s     to the          ground       in atte mp t        to get out           of the     crush,        they

were    helping         each other          up onto          the dividing           wall,       there was         one    lad

who was        on the flat           roof    to the turns ti le s                 telling       people     to move        back

to ease        the     crush.        He    st a te d a gate wa>r' op en ed                to his        left,     1 had

heard a roar            from    the       fans and t h a t j 4 ith the              fact     it was       ten to three

I p re sumed         it was     close       to the k i/ck-off and that                     the     players must           have

come onto         the    pitch.                         /

an d that        there was B l e n / y           of   room      inside".           In my opin io n this             did not

help the situation.                   We    had been s ta nding              there        for    some     twenty

mi n ut e s    and we w e re n 't          moving.           At this       stage my brother and                   I got

split    up because            he    lifted a small                lad up and         took      him out to the

river Do n side           of the          turnstiles.              The    next     thing was        I e ve nt u al l y

we were        de sp er at e    to be told what was                      going     on,    because       of the      lack of

ticket.         I moved     into an area behind the turnstiles and turned and

w a i t e d for my brother          to    come through.         I did not witness any gates

being        opened or any surges through open gates.

I went to each turnstiles and                    looked through for my brother,

it was still           packed outside and the,fans w e r e n ’t coming                   through

a ny quicker.

I d i d n ’t find my brother and went to the toilets.                           I returned to the

turnst i1e area.            I looked through the turnst i 1es and still

c o u l d n ’t see my b r o t h e r .      I not iced agai n the fans were still

not    coming     through any quicker and                it was   still     very t ightly

packed outside.             I w o u ld say it was         now two minutes        past

three        (1302),    and the f ans were          now comi ng through more

0 rde r l y .

H av i n g    realised    I was     not going to find my Jsrother and that

1 could meet           him at a p re -a rranged          plaoe at the       end of a game,

I went        to make my way to my m atch j e w i n g              point.     I wa lk ed down

the t u n n e 1 towards       the     penfe in J / n e   West S ta nd ter r a c e s .    As     I

went     down    I could see        the 1 p b & y e r s playing    the^game     had started,

a couple        of fans w a l k ed       past me on thei r J*ay out of the t u n n e 1 and

t hey told me          not to b o t h e r , it was       ta*r c rowded to s e e .

I turned back           round to find a betJ/Tr viewing                point.     I turned

left     out of the       tunnel and w e nt ^ up the steps             into the West

S ta nd s e a t s , as    I m ov ed      int©rthe    seated area,       by this time

after        trying a couple        of e n t r a n c e s , the seats were quite           full.

I found an entrance and as                  I moved      into the West S tand           I saw

a policeman talking             to the      referee.        I thought     this was       strange

and even mo re st range             to see the       players      leaving the     pitch.            I

m o ve d forward to the front of the seated area and                          looked down

into the        pens below and the           pitch area       in front      of me.       It still

d i d n ’t dawn what was          happening.         I looked d o w n , I saw fans
trying    to get out of the sections                  below by climbing the dividing

perimeter       fence.     I saw fans         had turned        round a nd faced the

West S t a n d , i ndi cat i ng to people to move                back.       The re was    fear    in

their    faces.        I realised    people were            sandw ic he d    next to the

dividing       fence   between     pens two and threje.               Some     people had fallen

on the floor,          people we re being         pasa^d over          this fence and we re

being    taken out of the gate            to pgm two.            Some    fans were     being

pulled up and pushed up from p/n thr^e be 1ow, people were being
---------------------------------------- y ---------------------------------
crushed in some          incident    below           '

I could see fans on the             pitch £ r \ front          of the    pens    three and f o u r .

I realised then that          the    casualties            on the     pitch were dying.           I saw

poli cemen,      St.   Johns Amfauaance members and f a ns alike were g i v i n g

mouth to mouth to          casualties.          I cannot        say how many people were

being    carried out,       they were         like    rag dolls        being    passed over

fences.        I just stood shocked not being able                      to app r e h e n d what

was happening          in front    of m e .

I could see fans          crying    for he 1p , other           casualties being          passed

from    pens three to two,          other      people giving m outh to mouth,                the

who 1e pitch was         in disarray.

The    first    person receiving m outh to mouth was a man who was

adjacent       to gate    two outside       the      penalty area,          lying diagonally

away    from the West S tand towards                 the South S t a n d , it was         two fans

who were giving m o u t h to mouth to him,                     they    couldn't    revive him so a

St.    Johns ambulance man tried,               but he f a i 1e d .         The St. Johns

A mb ulance man        covered him,      another         fan   carne later and uncovered

him but he was,          to me,    too   late,       the    person     in my opinion       looked

dead.

The    casualty looked about 55 yrs old with white                           to grey hair.         He

had a large       stomach and was slightly balding.                         I would say he was

quite tall,       he wore a chequered shirt,                   he was    covered over wi t h a
                                                                                                           PAGE
                                                                                                           S733

blue      sweatshirt      top.

The St.         Johns a mbulance        man    looked a healthy man, who                 was about          50

yrs      old,    he was w e ar in g     their    normal    uniform.

I a gain noticed more             people       being    brought    out and       laid on the           pitch.

There was a boy w ith a Liverpool                      shirt on and girl who                looked about

sixteen.          I c a n ’t remember         if they were a tt en d ed to or not.                   These

casualties were all              in the same area.              1 saw people          lying       tlhere

who w e r e n ’t being a t t e n d e d to,        they w e r e n ’t covered up and h a d n ’t

been a t t e n de d to      in my op in io n were         dead.

It was a mass            of people      in front of the          pens.         I remember vaguely

an a m b ul a n c e   coming     onto    the    pitch to where          the    people were.            I

also      remember a fan on the               pitch    in front    of pen two          indicating

to someone         in pen two that         fifty people had died.                    I saw a man

shouting         to his wife and         child in the stand next to me telling

her      he was alright.

I remember         seeing a      line of       policemen across          the    pitch.        I

thought         to myself    that     they could be better              deployed ass is ti ng

w it h    casualties.        I did not witness any charging.                         I remember

vagu e l y hearing an a nn ou nc e me n t             of "please keep off the                pitch".

It was obvious what was going                    on so    I c a n ’t u nderstand them making

such an announcement,               it was about         this time the a m bu la nc e              came     onto

the      pitch.

I then remember            seeing     the fire        brigade    coming       onto    the    pitch.

The next         thing    I can recall         is the fences       being       pulled down.           The

back      of section three was            reasonably       clear at this             time.

I rememeber w at ching            individuals          giving heart mass ag e           but

realising         they were      doing    it incorrectly,          i as a                              do not

profess         to be a professional            f irst-aider      but    I am aware of how to

carry out this me th od of               revival       correctly,

s eated area of my own                  acc o r d          to go and find          my brother.                              I met my

brother        eventually         in    the stand where              I had earlier                          been w at ch in g

the disaster             before me,          the         location of w h ic h was                     further                  into the

s tand behind the goal a r e a .                          I w ould estimate               it to about                          four

t hirty      (1630).

My brother and I m oved                  out of the ground via the gate to the                                                           river

Don side of the turnstiles.                               We wal ke d off up L ep pings Ln and as we

crossed the River Don                   Bridge            we looked back           and saw a number                                      in

excess       of twenty       people          laid out by a p&jHTmeter wal 1 to the

ground.          I presumed them to be d<i

We   collected the           car and          returned to                                                   where we met

an d I                We w a t c h e d the           remainder      of the disaster                            on the

t el e v i s i o n   .

On the day of the m atch                     I wo re j e a n s , a grey                c a s u a 1 shirt,                         grey jumper

w it h pink horizontal                 bands.             I would describe myself as a white male

of a me d i u m build,            a p pr o xi m a t e l y 5 ’11 tall with short                                    black             hair.

My account           of the days         events at H i ll s b o r o u g h on the                                15th April

(150489)        may seem v a g u e .                I can say on that              day I was                       in an extreme

state of shock and                cannot            offer any further              des c r i pt i ons or details

other than that of whi ch I have provided.

their seats.              I c onsidered this to be totally                                inadequate,                          there were

no stewards           to guide         people away from the tunnel                                 considering                          the      crush

that was        happening and the                    pens being so full jas they were.

In my opinion             if a gate          had not been openka outside                                    far more

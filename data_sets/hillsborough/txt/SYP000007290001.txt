down towards            the ground.            The        coach park was a bout              15 minu te s

walk     from the g roun d and was                    the one the             police were         putting all      the

L iv e rp o ol       coaches     in.      We saw people             lying a r ou n d on the grass

e mb a nk m e n t s    or sitting          on the walls.                T he y were drin ki ng and enjo yi ng

the day,         but not       causing any trouble.                      We s t op p ed off at the

’G a t e w a y ’ store a n d brought                 two four       packs       of beer.          We had two      cans

each     prior        to reaching the g round                  I thought         that      the    people sitting

a r o u n d were       leaving        it a bit         late?      to get good         places at the match.

As     I t urned       into L e p p in gs Lane             I could       look up the Hill            furt he r    up

At this          point our group of four split up.                                    and              went     towards

the stands            t urns tile as they were sitting,                                     and    1 had to make

The     police on h orseback were                      shouting         but    pe^^l^were          shou ti ng    back

On ente rin g        the a rea     t hroug h the t u rn st il e      I saw quite a lot of

p ol i ce m en standing a r o u nd.             I couldn't     believe     how m uc h room there was

on that        side a n d how       packed and      chaotic      it was outside.

I have        been to H i l l s b o r o u g h   before and knew w h^re           to go                 and    I

went    to the tunnel.             We w a l k e d f r ee ly down Vne tunnel.             Our       tickets

were    for      compound      ’S ’ (Pen 4)       but we wer^t into        comp ou nd        A     (Pen o )

b ec au se     compound      *B * (Pen 4) was        q u i t / full and       compound A         (Pen 3) was

not.

We made        our way down the           centre     divide a nd     then over to our              right

(towards Pen E).               We w o r k e d our way down to the front near                     the   pitch

fence and stood              in front     of a barrier.          We took this         posit io n up about
                                                                              '2-

a nd   people were even             lying down sunbathing.              Our     s ec ti on   (Pen 3) was

getting more and more                 crowded and        I knew not m a n y more         could get         in.

We stood         chatting      to an old man for a while                but then a lad behi nd the

barr ie r       relieved himself and we de ci de d to move.                        We m ov ed six or

seven feet          to the      individual       fence     b et w ee n us a nd the wide e n cl os ur e

s w ee pi ng     round to the F or es t          stands     (Pen 3 / 2 B ar r ie r    fence).

People         started to try a nd          climb    into the e nc lo s ur e        on my right         (Pen E)

to get out of the squash                   in our    pen    (Pen 3).      I put my foot            on a bar

of the fence and              had my thigh        like a stool.          P e op le were      using me as a

step pi ng       stool and       I was     helping    them over.         O th er    people       s ta r te d to

 try and        climb over       the fence onto          the   pitch.       One     lad got onto           the

fence and was telling                 people     to push backwards.                He was    pulled

 off the fence by his                hair and      led away.

The     police       still    didn't     seem to g rasp what was            going     on a l t h o u g h

 people were           shouting at them to help,               a nd to open the gate.                One

 po li c em a n said,         "Keep pushing them o v e r ” .

 Just        on 3 pm our se ct io n       (Pen 3) was       getting     so bad you could hard ly

 move.                    m a n a g e d to get over.        It b ecame     so   packed I was           pushed

the Lep pi ng s Lane           stand.      As the m&Xch s t ar t ed there was a sway                      in the

crowd a nd      I managed        to turn b y z k       a r ou n d to face     the    pitch.

I was     pushed tight iigain a rm my arms were                     pinned to my sides,              one was

being    pushed through the              railings       of the s e ct io n     (Pen 3) and was

hurting.        My     chest was      hurting as well a nd            I had trouble            breathing.

It was     then      I n oticed a boy of bet ween               16/2ffi^years al^out three people

in front       of    me.    His    face was       going    pf.-Ie , t hen s t ar te d     to turn        blue

and    I realised he was suf f o cat i ng ,,4nd dying.                     I w ou ld d es cr ib e        him

white,     male,       16'20    years,     cleanshaven,           w i t h s h o r t is h dark s pi ke d

hair.      I could only w a tc h Mjn.                  I didn't    see him fall          the    crowd kept

him up.        I can't     remembaf what              he was w earing      I could only see              him

from his       shoulders        up/

The    s econd s q u e e z e ( / t a r ted a n d      I thought    I was     going       to die,    then

e veryone      startWto          fall     forward,        w ith my a rm    caught        in the    railings         I

s t ay ed were       I was,     people were going           past me     trying      to    hold on        to me.

P eo pl e were       on top of one a no th er           in front of me.          The      people s hown

 in the       papers    pushed up ag ai ns t           the fence were a c t u a ll y s t an di ng             on

top of        people who had fallen.

By this        time the     police had b roken the fence                  by the tunnel           entrance

and had opened the gate                  so there was more           room.      I s ta rt ed to          pick

 people       up off the floor w i th others and                  pushed them over the fence

 into the s ection on my                right     (Pen 2).

 The    boy    I had seen earlier               turn blue was       now on the floor,             a nd    I

 passed him over.              He was     c le ar ly^ dead.       I still     can't       remember what he

 was wearing.

t h r o u g h the gate w h i c h had been o pen ed onto the                   pitch.

I went    to pick up a fat man from the front                           of my s e ct i on       (Pen 3 ) .      It

was a m an who       I had st ep pe d on e ar l i e r ^ / w h o          I knew was dead to get to

other    people.       He was a w h i t e ^ m a l e , / f a t     build,      I didn't         see his face.

He was we ar in g      a white       *T*    shWt     and black trousers,                a nd     that's all      I

can remember.

I h elped    lots of other           people over         the fence         from my s e ct i on       (Pen 3)

to the other s ec t i o n on my             right    (Pen 2)       but the only ones               I can fouUb

on are the girl and the                  boy and the      fat man.

The   terrace after          the    crush was       littered w i t h scarves,              watches,       shoes,

handbags a nd       coats.         The    lads   light    blue     jacket        had    come off his         face

so I picked        it up and other           things      shoes a nd handbags and                  passed them

t h ro u g h the gate onto the             pitch were the          police were           piling     them up.

I left the ground at about 4 . 4 5 p m and j oi ne d the                          rest of my        coach

party.      All    of them were           back no one had died.

I was a s s i s t e d for     a time       on the terrace getting                people        over the      fence

into the     right     hand s e c t i o n    (Pen 2)      by a      lad called                                 of

lost     sight    of each other,           until after        it was all          over.

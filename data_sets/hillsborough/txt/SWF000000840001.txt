                             PATHOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF THE DISASTER



My medical qualifications are MB, BS, FRC Path, DMJ (Clin et Path).                       I have been

in active practice in Forensic Pathology for almost thirty years and have been

Consultant Pathologist to the Horae Office for South Yorkshire and the East

Midlands for twenty-five of those years.                      During that time I have performed more

than twenty-six thousand post mortem examinations for Her Majesty's coroners and

have taken part in some seven hundred and sixty murder investigations.



I have been asked by Mr Mervyn JONES, Assistant Chief Constable of the West

Midlands Police in charge of the Hillsborough Enquiry Team, to provide a general

overview of the pathological aspects of the Hillsborough disaster in which some

ninety-five persons were killed on the afternoon of Saturday, 15 April, 1989,

during a cup semi-final match.

                                                                                      <




I took part in the investigation of the deaths myself, being present at the

request of Her Majesty's coroner at Hillsborough Stadium on the evening of 15

April, 1989. and at the Medico-Legal Centre on Sunday, 16 April and Monday, 17

April.     I personally carried out nineteen of the ninety-five post mortems.                       The

other examinations were carried out by teams of pathologists working five or six

at a time in the mortuary of the Sheffield Medico-Legal Centre at Watery Street

- following the transfer of the bodies from the temporary mortuary in the

some thirteen bodies were taken to the mortuary of the Northern General Hospital

in Sheffield, but later they were removed from there and brought to the

Medico-Legal Centre.        As far as I know, the only body autopsied at the Northern

General Hospital was that of a Lee NICHOL (body No 95), aged 14 years, who

survived, under treatment,       until about 2 am on Tuesday, 18 April, and whose body

was examined that same day       by Dr Shirley HOLT, Consultant Pathologist at the

Northern General Hospital,       Berries Road,Sheffield, S5 7AU     (Tel: 0742 -

434343).     The work at the Medico-Legal Centre was performed by five forensic

pathologists and four clinical pathologists - all of consultant status.            They

I can only speak in a detailed way of the nineteen examinations which I

personally carried out.    However, having read all ninety-five post mortem

reports and seen certain statements made by witnesses, I believe I can speak in

a general way about the pathological conditions which proved fatal in the total

of ninety-five cases which were examined.       The details of individual cases will

need to be obtained from the pathologists who examined them, which is why their

names and professional addresses, together with the body numbers, have been

provided above.

                                                                                   16
Of the ninety-five dead, eighty-eight were males and seiven were females, which,

in my view, merely reflects the nature of the occasion.



AGE

Of the ninety-five who died, the youngest was a 10 year old boy arid the eldest a

67 year old man.

  Thirty-eight persons (approximately 40%) were under ‘20 years of age

  Thirty-nine persons (41%) were between 20 and 29 years of age

  Twelve persons (13%) were between 30 and '39 years of age

  Three persons (3%) were between 40 and 49 years of age

  One person (1%) was between 50 and 59 years

  Two persons (2%) were between 60 and 69 years old.•

  Seventy-seven of the ninety-five (81%) dead were below 30 years of age.

Again, I imagine these figures probably reflect the conipbsitibri of the average

soccer crowd.



CAUSE OF DEATH

In virtually every case, the cause of death was basically compression of' the

chest wall - against the bodies of the persons immediately around the deceased

or against fixed structures such as the walls of the stadium and the cfash
                                                                   i


barriers.   In the vast majority of the cases, this pressure caused the condition

of traumatic or crush asphyxia - the two terms are synonymous.



Asphyxia pathologically means some mechanical obstruction to normal breathing.

That obstruction may be caused in a variety of ways - by a hand across the nose

and south (suffocation), by a ligature tightened around the neck

(strangulation), by a bolus of food which sticks in the airways (choking), or by
 a strong pressure upon the chest wall so that it becomes fixed and cannot move

 in and out to enable the person to draw breath.     Whatever the impedance to

 respiration, the result is similar,     the oxygen in the air cannot be drawn into;

 the lungs and passed into the blood to be transported to the body tissues which

 require it for their normal function.     The deoxygenated blood in the tissues

 turns a dark colour, giving the victim's complexion a bluish or cyanotic hue.

 The heart begins to fail and the walls of the smallest vessels (capillaries)

 which are under pressure and themselves starved of oxygen, give way and allow

 spurts of red cells to pass into the surrounding tissues where they show as tiny

 pin-point haemorrhages (petechiae) in the loose skin around the eyes, on the

 forehead and behind the ears as well as on many of the internal organs.      Thus, a

 somewhat bloatd cyanotic appearance with external and internal petechiae arises.

 If the impediment to breathing is not removed in some four to six minutes -

 perhaps less if the victim is struggling and thus using up oxygen at a higher

 rate - then the brain cells cease to function, unconsciousness supervenes and

 ultimately the vital centres in the hind brain are damaged and die and then life

 is no longer possible.



Appearances such as these were seen in almost every person who died at

Hillsborough, and in all but nine cases death was attributed solely to traumatic

 (or crush) asphyxia.     In one case (No 76) the force compressing the chest was

(perhaps momentarily) so great that the rear surface of the breast bone almost

touched the anterior surface of the spine, nipping and splitting the aorta

between them so that the man bled to death internally before he could be

asphyxiated.   In only eight other cases (Nos 3, 27, 29, 48, 69, 91, 93 and 95)

were factors other than traumatic asphyxia thought to have even contributed to

the death, and in six of these eight, the contributory factor arose out of

trauma to the chest, neck or head.     Ir. the remaining two cases (3 and 69) only,
nor more than 10 mg% in their blood, which is negligible, but fifteen had more

than 80 mg% in their blood, which means they could not legally have driven a

car, and six had upwards of 120 rag% in their blood.   Six youths below the age of

18, who were not legally allowed to drink, had taken drink, of which group one

boy, aged 17 years, had a blood alcohol of 141 mg%, whilst a 15 year old had a

blood alcohol of 56 mg%.



EYE HAEMORRHAGES

I have been asked to comment on the proposition that a distinction can be made

in this case between those persons who died from traumatic asphyxia standing up

in the crowd and those dying froa the same cause lying down.   The latter, it is

said, will have petechial haemorrhages in their eyes whilst the former will not.

I have seen a very large number of cases of traumatic asphyxia and I am certain

that no such distinction can be made - both groups will in all probability have

petechial haemorrhages in their eyes.



GENERAL COMMENT

The Hillsborough disaster occurred between 3 pm and 3.30 pm on Saturday, 15

April, 1989.   By 2 pm on Monday, 17 April, ie less than forty-eight hours later,

all ninety-four of the victims who were then dead had been examined post mortem

and had a blood sample taken for analysis, so that their bodies were ready for
                                                                     <
release to relatives. I believe that several factors were responsible for this

feat:-



 1.   The excellence of Her Majesty's Coroner's arrangements and organisation.

 2.   The immediate availability of the Football Club's gymnasium, sited just a

      few yards from the pitch.   This huge room was easily compartmentalised

      into three large chanters, each invisible from the others.   One was used



                                        -   8   -
         as a mortuary for temporary body storage, one as a makeshift canteen and

         the third as a reception area for relatives where they were greeted and

         assisted by padres of various denominations, social workers and

         ancillaries.

    3.   The fact that the victims* bodies were not fragmented nor greatly

         disfigured as might have happened in an explosion or an aircraft crash.

         This meant that the initial identification was possible from polaroid

         photographs taken by the police, which made the identification process

         rapid and meant that relatives were generally required to view only one

         body and were spared the harrowing task of entering the main mortuary and

         searching for their dead.

    k.   The use of the facilities available at the Sheffield Mecico-Legal Centre -

         the only building of its kind in the United Kingdom.   This meant that in

         one day it was possible for up to six teams of pathologists and their

         assistants to work simultaneously in excellent conditions with modern

         equipment so that they were able to perform seventy autopsies on Sunday

         alone.   This building was designed with an emergency facility to deal with

         disaster involving up to one hundred bodies, and when the disaster

         arrived, the building worked well.   Sheffield City Council are to be

         congratulated on their provision of such a building.

truly natural disease was believed to be a significant contributory factor in

the death.



INHALATION OF VOMIT

In any form of asphyxia vomiting may occur before death and because of

unconsciousness and the lack of the protective reflex mechanism, vomitus may be

aspirated into the lungs, greatly increasing the likelihood of death.     Most

pathologists regard this vomiting as merely a facet of death from asphyxia and

though recording it in their post aortem reports, do not dignify it with a

separate heading in the cause of death.     This is my view and the one I have

adopted in compiling the simple statistics for this report.     It has, however, to

be said that for purely mechanical and obvious reasons, vomiting is more likely

to occur if the stomach is distended with food and/or drink and is subjected to

hard external mechanical compression.     Vomiting is also more likely to occur in

those persons intoxicated with alcohol.



OTHER INJURIES

In eighteen cases bones were broken - mostly ribs (thirteen cases), but in

addition the bones and/or cartilages of the larynx (voice box) were fractured in

three cases (47, 51 and 81) - perhaps suggesting that the throat of these

persons had been trodden on accidentally ie that they were on the ground when
                                                                    t

they sustained that injury.



In only two cases were long bones fractured.     In one of these cases (18), both

bones in a woman's forearm were broken and in one (11) a young boy's femur was

broken.   Both injuries could have occurred as the result of accidental

trampling.

 In two cases impacts to the chest wall were so severe as to cause extensive

 bruising to the underlying lungs, affecting the victim’s ability to breathe and

 in one of these the ribs were actually fractured and their ends tore the

underlying lung allowing air to escape from the lung into the chest

 (pneumothorax) and seriously adversely affect the victim’s breathing.

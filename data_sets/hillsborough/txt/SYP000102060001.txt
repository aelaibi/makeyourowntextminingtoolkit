REPORT ON LIVERPOOL V NOTTINGHAM FOREST FOOTBALL SEMI FINAL ON SATURDAY
15TH APRIL 1989



O fficer:   Pc.2225 Keith Purvis          Service: 12^ years

Station:    A1 Doncaster



I am a Police Constable in the South Yorkshire Police with 12^ years service and
stationed at Doncaster, now serving as Community Constable at Intake, Doncaster.

On Saturday 15th April 1989, I commenced duty at Doncaster Police Station at 8.30am;
I was detached to work on Serial 25 along with other Officers and the Serial Sergeant
was Ps.2640 Perry.  We awaited transportation to Hillsborough Football Ground.

On arrival at   Hillsborough Football Ground a briefing took place in the North Stand
after which a   meal was taken at the ground.

Approximately 11.15am, I, along with other Officers on Serial 25 and Ps Perry, made
our way along Middlewood Road to the Hillsborough shopping precinct where I commenced
patrol in company with Pc.2800 Simms.   Our main area of patrol was around the shop
known as Woolworths on Middlewood Road.

During the course of the duty and prior to 3.00pm, numerous groups of both
Liverpool and Nottingham Forest supporters were seen on Middlewood Road, most
were quiet but quite a few were noisy and shouting.

In Middlewood Road there is an Off Licence, I was standing in company with
Pc Simms outside this shop.  About 1.00pm a large number of Liverpool supporters
started going into the shop.  These supporters were quiet at this time, but were
buying 4 and 6 packs of beer and also large bottles of Asti Spumante wine.

These fans were immediately opening these bottles and commencing to drink the
contents and then make their way along Middlewood Road in the direction of
Hillsborough Football Ground.  These persons were not drunk at this time, but were
talking with slurred speech.

I continued patrol on Middlewood Road area, patroling inside and outside shops
and supermarkets because of the number of fans trying to purchase alcohol.

Approximately 3.10pm I could hear on the Police personal radio an Officer
requesting permission for a gate in Leppings Lane to be opened.     Another Officer
was also on the radJ *         >       s k ej_ng crushed1 and requesting bolt
croppers.  A sound                      voice of this Officer.    These radio
messages were broken and intermittent.   I, along with Officers on Serial 25 and
Ps Perry then made our way on foot towards the Hillsborough Football Ground.

On arrival at the Leppings Lane entrance to the ground I was told by a Senior
Officer to assist in keeping the crowd back from the gates/entrance.

I could see a large group of people standing near the entrance and with other
Officers these were moved away from the entrance.  At this time I had become
detached from Serial 25 and Ps Perry.

Fans were now starting to leave the ground by the Leppings Lane entrance.  I then
went inside the gates along with other Officers and formed a line allowing a
sterile area to be kept along the fence which runs parallel to the River Don.
Emergency vehicles were now arriving and injured persons were being treated in
this sterile area.

As fans were leaving the ground, some were abusive towards all Officers and
shouting, "YOU BASTARDS ARE TO BLAME."

Some fans who were leaving were becoming violent towards Senior Officers who
were standing nearby.  These fans were escorted out of the ground by other Officers
in an orderly manner.

Some fans who had already left the ground were trying to re-enter the ground which
caused minor problems to emergency vehicles which were arriving continually.

I remained on duty near the main gates until the crowds outside the ground had
dispersed.  I then made my way to the North Stand of the ground for debriefing
with other Officers.

I was joined by the rest of Serial 25 at the debriefing.  After debriefing we
made our way to Claywheels Lane where we got transport back to Doncaster.

I terminated my tour of duty at 7.45pm that date.

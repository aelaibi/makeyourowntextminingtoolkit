Re: GARY PHILIP JONES (deceased) HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER


Thank you for your letter of 2nd August 1990.

The photographs numbered PR3/29A and MJN/55 are held by
the West Midlands Police. We are not prepared to release
these at the present time as they were not used in evidence
at the hearings.

If you would like to write to the West Midlands. Police they
can note your interest for the time when they are released.


Yours faithfully,




S. L..POPPER
H. M. CORONER

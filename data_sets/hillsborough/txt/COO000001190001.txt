      THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER

      Thank you for copying me your letter of 5 June to the Attorney General setting out
      your proposals for an independent examination into the alleged new evidence
      concerning the Hillsborough disaster.

      Such an examination would seem to be a sensible way of addressing continuing
      public concern. I have no objections either to your proposed terms of reference or
      to your preference for a judge to lead the examination.

      Copies of this letter go to the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, the Lord
      Chancellor, the President of the Council, the Minister Without Portfolio, the
      Attorney General, the Director of Public Prosecutions and Sir Robin Butler.




                                                                      THE RT HON CHRIS SMITH MP

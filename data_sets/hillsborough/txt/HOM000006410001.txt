   HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM TRAGEDY: TRIBUNAL OF INQUIRY
   The Home Secretary has asked me to thank you for your letter of 24
   April and to reply to it on his behalf.
   The immediate costs of the Public Inquiry undertaken by Lord
   Justice Taylor will be met in full by the Government. The costs of
   the inquiries being undertaken by the West Midlands police are,
   however, a different matter since those inquiries were started at
   the initiative of the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire and are
   being undertaken for reasons connected with policing in South
   Yorkshire, although it was agreed at the time they were launched
   that their results would be made available to Lord Justice Taylor.
   The best way forward would seem to be an early meeting between us
   to discuss these issues further. We need I think to focus on the
   purposes being served by the inquiries being undertaken by the West
   Midlands Police in South Yorkshire; whether and to what extent
   these inquiries could be said to be serving a purpose other than
   those connected with policing in South Yorkshire; and the scale and
   cost of those inquiries in relation to South Yorkshire Police
   Authority's available financial resources.
   I hope that you will agree to this course and am asking my
   Secretary to get in touch with a view to arranging a meeting here
   at the earliest convenient date.               *.

                                                                         «

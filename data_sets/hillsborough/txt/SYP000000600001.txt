anyone        as    it was          such a       crush.          People           had       their      hands         in      the           air          and

were     unable          to    put    them       down      by    their        sides          there        was     so      little          room.

1 c an     remember            people       shouting            for     the       gates       to     be     op e n e d ,     and      after

a   tew m i n u t e s         a Police          Officer         came         across and             told        us    t hat      they had

been     opened,              I did      not     see      the    gates        onto           the    pitch         opened,         and I

c a n ’t s a y      at w h a t       stags       they      were.             Also        a Police           Officer          walked

passed        and       people       were       shoutimnq          at        him        to get      the      child who               had been

alongside           me,       out,    there       was      a St       Johns        Ambulance              person wi th               him,               H

not    due     to       the    crush,       and      he    told       us     t ha t     the       gates      ha d      been      opened

and    there        was       nothing       else       they      could        do.

A bit e w a r d a p p e a r e d a t t h i s t i nie a n d                  told        the    people         to      p ush      back         and

make     som e      room.           Everyone         tried       to     do    this          but    c o uld      not       move       back.

B y a b o u t 13 „ g O p m .         I had ma na ged             to     climb          up    onto     the w all            at    the

base     of    the       fencings,          and      from       trie re      climbed          over        the     fence         and      o nto

the    pitch.              The      fence      was     still       intact          and       there        was     still         a bad

c r u s h , inside            the    pe n s .

I could        see       that       both    gates         were    o p e n e d , and           that,       people          coming

pulled        out       by P o l i c e     and    Stewards,                They        were       falling         through            the

gate,     and       others          were    falling         on top           of    them       as     fast       as     they were
                                                                                                                                                 S60

           pulled         away       from       the       gate.

           There         seemed       to       be    no     o r g a n i s a t i o n at        t his    point         and     not       enough

           Police         or    Stewards             to     assist        peo p l e ,        h o w e v e r , there          was    not     alot

           they      could          do as       the       gates        had    been       opened        and      other        than       cutting

           down      the       fenc e,         nothing           else     could         be    done.        There        were       no

           annoucements               being          made        as    to w h a t       was     happening            over       and     tannoy        or

           loud      speaker          system.               When       I was       on    the     pitch         I helped           t ake    a

           some      other          supporters.                  1 donot       know          what     their         injuries           were,     1

           cannot         remembe r much                  about        them.

           I did         not    witness             anything           which       I would          consider           to    be    a Criminal

           Offence .

           Even      at    this       late          stage        there       did    not       appear       to       be m a n y S t e w a r d s

           about,         and       steadily           there          were    more       Police        coming          o ve r     to    help.

           Eventually               the    f o u r of        us       that    had       been     in the         Leppings           Lane        Stand

           met     on     the       pitch,          and     we    managed          to    find       our    friend           in the        North

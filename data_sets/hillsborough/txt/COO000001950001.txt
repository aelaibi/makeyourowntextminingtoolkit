Mr '


HILLSBOROUGH: CASUALTY BUREAUX

I copied to you yesterday a note by South Yorkshire Police on
their casualty bureau, including liaison with Liverpool.


This is just to add that I understand the Merseyside Police
casualty bureau was set up at 4 pm Saturday 15 April, opened to
the public at 5.30, and closed at 4 pm Sunday 16 April.    30 staff
were provided throughout.   The bureau had 10 incoming telephone
lines.

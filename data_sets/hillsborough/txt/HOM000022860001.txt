       HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY:
       TECHNICAL WORKING PARTY ON THE GREEN GUIDE


       Thank you for your note of 22 November, which I will show to
       Professor Maunder, the Chairman of the working party. Lord
       Justice Taylor and Professor Maunder have not yet agreed on the
       form which the conclusions of the working party will take, but
       they are likely to be in the form of recommendations. As with
       all the other recommendations in the Report, it will then be for
       the Government to decide what to do about them, so you will be
       able to include any points of your own thereafter:  indeed, I
       would imagine that once our recommendations are made you will
       want to take them over for action. Certainly, however, we are
       not embarking upon a redrafting of the Green Guide ourselves.
       This we regard as a matter for the Home Office in due course.
       Our intention is to clarify areas of difficulty in the Guide
       where further guidance may be needed.



                                                    RlW
                                               R M WHALLEY

HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY:
TECHNICAL WORKING PARTY ON THE GREEN GUIDE

I am replying to your note (? 2 6 September) to Mr Turney about
the technical working party.  I know that the working party is
already making progress. My only observation is that I hope that
its recommendations will be presented in a way which leaves us
scope to consider various presentational improvements which we
ourselves have in mind.  As it is a technical, working party we
are not briefing Mr Stickley on these matters.

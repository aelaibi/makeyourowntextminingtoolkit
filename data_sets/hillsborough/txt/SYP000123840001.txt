Q53

DO    YOU HAVE: ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS

HANDLED , AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

THE INITIAL REACTION OF THE POLICE SEEMED TO BE CONFUSION, A LOT OF POLICEMEN

W E R E N 'T   AWARE OF WHAT TO D O .      THE CROWD WERE SHOUTING AT THEM I N FRUSTRATION

ONCE THEY REALISED THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE SITUATION THE OFFICERS SOON GOT

INVOLVED, HELPING THE INJURED GIVING FIRST AID ALSO WHEN A LINE OF POLICE

OFFICERS WERE MARCHED IN AND LINED ALONG THE HALF WAY LINE, MY REACTION WAS

THAT THEY NEEDED TO BE THERE TO SEGREGATE THE                FANS, HOWEVER, A FAN NEXT TO

ME    POINTED OUT THAT THEY WERE ALL TRAINED FIRST AIDERS AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN

INVOLVED I N HELPING THE INJURED.              FANS WERE BEING AGITATED BY PRESS

fl^ T O G R A P H E R S   WHO WERE TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS.    SAW FANS RIPPING HOARDINGS DOWN

AS MAKESHIFT STRETCHERS.               THE WHOLE SCENE WAS ABSOLUTE CHAOS AND I WA S N ’T

AWARE IF THE ENORMITY OF THE SITUATION.               I THOUGHT AT FIRST IT WAS A PITCH

INVASION BY " N U T T E R S " .



IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH 70 ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

THE POLICE OFFICERS, ALTHOUGH $OST DID A GOOD JOB SADLY LACKED LEADERSHIP TO

DIRECT THEM.              MOST OF THEM SEJEMED TO ACT ON THEIR OWN INITIATIVE.

THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN D I R E C T I O N FROM STEWARDS AND POLICE OFFICERS INSIDE AND

Th T-F
THERE  WAS NO DIRECTIONS DURING THE CHAOTIC SITUATION OVER THE T ANNOY I FEEL

PEOPLE AT THE BACK OF PEN 3 & 4 WERE NOT AWARE OF THE SERIOUS NATURE OF WHAT

WAS HAPPENING AT THE FRONT.

THE DIRECTIONS TO THE ENTRANCES TO THE GROUND WERE MISLEADING.                ONCE IN THE

GROUND AREA THERE WERE NO DIRECTIONS W HATSOEVER, WE HEADED FOR THE TUNNEL AS

IT WAS THE ONLY WAY TO THE TERRACING WE COULD SEE.                THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN

DIRECTION FROM STEWARDS, A POLICE OFFICER INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE GROUND

ESPECIALLY AT THE. MOUTH OF THE: TUNNEL LEADING TO THE TERRACfc..            THERE WAS A

COMPLETE BREAKDOWN OF COMMUNICATION INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE GROUND BY POLICE

 OFFICERS.     I COULDN’T UNDERSTAND WHY THE POLICE OBSERVATION POST WEREN’T AWARE

 THAT PENS 3 & 4 WERE PACKED, SURELY THEY WOULD HAVE s r f l N        IT ON THEIR C . C . T . V .

 SCREENS AND SHOULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING ABOUT I T .

 THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A LACK OF MEDICAL FACILITIES AT THE GROUND.

 I WAS AMAZED AT THE TICKET ALLOCATION AND ALLOCATION OF TERRACING I THINK

 LIVERPOOL SHOULD HAVE HAD THE SPION HOP E N D .

 I HAVE BEEN TO HILLSBOROUGH BEFORE BUT NOT TO LAST YEAR’S GAME.                 I ATTENDED

 THE ARSENAL V LIVERPOOL MATCH IN ABOUT 1979 AND LIVERPOOL WERE ALLOCATED THE

 SPION KOP END THAT YEAR.             I WAS APPAULED AND DISGUSTED AT THE COMMENTS MADE IN

 THE AFTERMATH OF THE DISASTER BY A CONSERVATIVE MP FROM SHEFFIELD AND POLICE

 FEDERATION FROM S/YORKSHIRE MR MIDSHIP,             IN RESPECT OF FANS ATTACKING AND

 U ^ N A T I N G OVER OFFICERS HELPING INJURED AND LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS LOOTING

 BODIES.     I HOPE THE OFFICER ON THE BEAT SEES FIT THAT THIS MAN SHOULD NEVER

 REPRfc.Sfc.NT 1 HEM AGAIN.

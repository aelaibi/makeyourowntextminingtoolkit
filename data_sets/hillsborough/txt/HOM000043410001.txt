Dear Lord MacKay/

M r .          &        M r s .                C h u         r c h



I wrote to you on 30 July requesting your assistance
in gaining the names on then list of people who
formed the Hillsborough Disaster Steering Group.

One of your officers did phone my office several
weeks ago stating that the details I request were not
held by your department but that he would try his
best to locate the list.

Time is getting on and myself and                                                 my      constituents
desperately need the list of names.

I am surprised that your department doesn't hold
information  relating to  the  Steering  Group  in
question who have receive a large amount of public
funds.

However/ I await anxiously your reply with the list
of names of the Steering Group members.

Yours sincerely/


Joe Benton/ J.P./                       M.P./
Bootle.

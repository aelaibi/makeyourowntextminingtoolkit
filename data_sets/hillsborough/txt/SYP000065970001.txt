            1.      I was born on                              I live at

           Sheffield



           S.       I hold the position of Leading Ambulanceman.              I am based at

           Batemoor Station in Sheffield.               I joined the Ambulance Service        in

            December,        1958 as a Drive Attendant, and was based at Corporation

           Street, Sheffield.



           3.       Batemoor Station was the first Station to be built and owned away

            from the main Depot        in Corporation Street.          I was based at Batemoor

            from the opening of the Station,             which I believe was approximately ^

            or 18 years ago.        I became a Leading Ambulanceman whilse based at
                                                                          PAGE     2
                                                                          SI 023
Batemoor, approximately 10 years ago.       Following my appointment as

Leading Ambulanceman,    I attended at the Regional Training School at

Ratfay Lane in Leicester,   and also at Fairfield Training School at

Rotherham.    These were both supervisory courses for Leading

Ambulanceman.    I have no paramedic training.



4.   On Saturday 15th April    1989, my shift for the day was      1400 hours

to 2200 hours.    I travelled from home to Batemoor Station,        leaving

home at approximately 1.15 pm.       On arrival at Batemoor Station,       I

established what vehicles would be available for the afternoon shift.

My call sign for that day was Sierra 306.         I would prepare for the

afternoon shift by completing all      paperwork necessary prior to

commencement of duties, and would also establish what vehicles would

be used on the nightshift.       I was driver   for this particular day and

was also responsible for all booking out times.



5.   Sometime after 2 pm I put my own first aid kit into the ambulance,

which included some protective      clothing.    I also checked all    equipment

inside the ambulance vehicle, which was all working        properly.      I then

carried on with my normal Leading Ambulanceman duties in the office.



6.   Sometime after 2 pm, we received a call from Control         to take an

admission patient   into Netheridge Hospital      in Sheffield.    With

transferring the patient on to the Cavendish Ward at Netheridge

Hospital, at approximately 3.10 pm one of the patients was watching

television at the side of his bed.       Upon glancing at the television

screen,   I noticed a football   stadium with a large number of supporters

spilling onto the pitch.      I asked the gentleman who was watching

television what was happening.      The gentleman did not know where the

trouble was occurring,   but asked me if I was aware of any football
                                                                            PAGE        3
                                                                            SI 023

match being played in Sheffield.          I said that a semi-final was taking

place at Hillsborough,       although at this point     in time I was still       not

cetain that the incident of crowds spilling onto the pitch was taking
                                                   si fyl 2_q>
place at Hillsborough.        My attendant;                             and I

returned to our ambulance vehicle,         together with cot which was      loaded

into the vehicle.       At this moment, we heard on the vehicle radio that

ambulances were being directed to Hillsborough and that there was a

Major    Incident taking    place.    We established contact with Control as

quickly as possible,       there being some    initial difficulties     presumably

because of the number of crews transmitting at the same time.               Upon

making contact with Control,         we informed them of our location and were

immediately despatched to Penistone Road,           where    I drove directly to.

I recall    proceeding along Infirmary Road with a police car behind me

with    its emergency lights flashing.        I carried on along Middlewood

Road with the intention of turning         into Park View Road in order to

link up with Penistone Road.         However, at the junction of Park View

Road and Leppings Lane,       I noticed a large volume of police officers at

that    point, who directed me on to Leppings Lane.



7.     At this point   in time,   neither myself or              were aware of

what had happened.       On travelling down Leppings Lane,         I came across a

large mass of people,       including   police,   directing us into the grounds

through the entrance at point A marked on the plan.              After driving

through a mass of people,         I immediately saw numerous      casualties on

both sides of perimeter       road which is within the boundary of the

football    stadium.    I drove slowly through two lines of casualties and

then stopped the ambulance at a point marked B on the attached plan.

Both            and I got out of the vehicle        immediately.    As I walked to

the rear of the vehicle       I immediately started to assess an unconscious

casualty on the ground.       The police were      present   in numbers.   My
                                                                            PAGE    4
                                                                            S1023

attendant began treating another        casualty at the same time,    and it was

quite apparent that both casualties         required immediately hospital

treatment.     I also specifically recall one hysterical        supporter

shouting that "they are all dead in there."           I pulled out the nearside

cot from its securing brackets and placed it in a position to allow

the casualty being treated by my attendant to be put onto the cot.

The casualty was placed immediately onto the vehicle.            I recall asking
*— —                                    ----------------
an uninjured person,    I believe a supporter,      to keep an eye on the

patient    in the ambulance.     My attendant and I then took out the other

cot over to the casualty I had initially treated.           Assisted by police,

          land I placed the casualty,     who was unconscious but breathing,

on to the cot.     As he turned preparing to place this casualty on to

the ambulance,    another    casualty had been put into the ambulance by a

group of supporters.        I believe that this person was sem i- c on ci ou s.

told the group who had placed the casualty on to the ambulance to

place him on the floor between the two cot positions.            They did so,

and I slipped a blanket under this patient's head.           The other patient

on the second cot was lifted over my head by                  and the police,

and secured in position.



8.     The ambulance was virtually full.       We immediately operated a

resuscitator    in order to inflate the lungs of a casualty,        and

began to alternate between one of the patients on the cot and the

casualty on the floor.       The third casualty was placed on a freeflow

oxygen unit.     As I got out of the ambulance to close the rear doors,

someone began pulling at my clothes, asking me look at a casualty on

the apposite side of a nearby wall.         I went over to this injured

person, whose face was      pressed into the ground.      I quickly put him in

to the "coma position," and established that he was breathing,              and

told his friend or relative to keep him in the coma position,             and
                                                                                   PAGE      5
                                                                                   S '1023

informed him that help would be coming shortly.                     It was a dreadful

feeling to leave this fourth casualty,              but there was already three

severely      injured casualties on board my ambulance.



9.     When I got back to the ambulance,           I noticed another       group of

supporters around an injured               person who was holding his shoulder,         or

possibly covering up chest injuries.               They were obviously trying to

get him onto my ambulance.               A lot of shouting was taking place, and

the group were appealing for               help for this casualty.        I spoke to the

injured person and asked him               if he would be able to sit in the

a t t e n d a n t ’s seat   in the   cab of the ambulance    (as            was   in the

back of the ambulance),              and he assured me that he would be able to sit

in the ambulance.            Although I realise that this          casualty was   in deep

shock,     he was helped into the cab and I attached a seat belt around

him.



•10.   At this point          in time   I still had no idea how the injuries had

been caused to the Liverpool              supporters.     I also recall that the same

supporter who had been shouting hysterically when we had arrived at

the ground was still            in hysterics,   shouting things like "does the

world know what happening."



11.     I then got into the drivers seat and started to move off along

the perimeter         road in the direction arrowed in red.             At the same time

I tried to contact Control              on probably four or five occasions on the

vehicle radio,         but was unsure whether      I had got through to Control as

I received no acknowledgment.               I was able to gain access       inside the

ground behind the South Stand relatively easily despite the presence

of large numbers of supporters.               I am sure at this point in time

that   I saw another ambulance vehicle at               point C.     I turned left on

                                                                                      S '1023

to Penistone Road at point D and was then ushered by lines of police

officers up to point E, where          I saw two ambulances turning left on to

Merries Road South with a police escort                in front.     I turned right and

become the third vehicle in the line of ambulances.                     I took the

ambulance     immediately to the Casualty Department at Northern General

Hospital.      As I arrived at      casualty I noticed a number of

ambulances     leaving casualty area,         presumably going straight back to

Hillsborough.      As soon as we had come to a stop outside casualty,                     and

got out of the ambulance to open the rear doors,                   there were already

present teams of medical          staff waiting to receive the casualties.                 I

helped to lift all       three patients       in the back of the ambulance onto

hospital     trolleys,   and            md        I took   in one of the casualties and

handed them over to medical          staff



•12.   We then returned to the ambulance and we placed on board both

cots and I got back       into the drivers seat.            I believe                radioed

Qontrol,     and we w e re requested to proceed immediately back to

Hillsborough.      Whilst      travelling back towards Hillsborough,               a message

carne over the vehicle         radio requesting all vehicles to report back to

Gate 0 on Penistone Road, which is marked F on the attached Plan.                          I

proceeded back directly along Herris Road South turning right onto

Penistone Road.      At this      point we were directed on to the side of

Penistone Road and I was guided through into the ground just passed

gate 0.      Once inside the ground,         I stopped the ambulance and

and I got out,     opened up the rear doors and took out one cot and

placed it next to an injured person.                Another ambulanceman then came

over to our vehicle and asked if the other cot on board could be taken

over to gymnasium.        I said yes and                   helped take the second over

to the gymnasium as requested.  I continued to assist with the first

to put an oxygen mask on to the patient.         Ambulanceman                                      then

returned to his own vehicle whilst       I continued to stay with rny

casualty until the return of               with another             casualty on the

second cot.      This casualty had obviously been treated by the medical

staff    inside the gymnasium because he was on a drip.



•13.    Both cots were then loaded on to the ambulance.                      I reversed out

of the ground at point F with the assistance of police officers and

ambulancemen.      I proceeded directly back to the Casualty Department at

Northern General Hospital       via Penistone Road and Herries Road South.

On arrival at the hospital Casualty Department again there were

medical    teams waiting to receive the casualties on board, and I

considered their assistance to by very professional                     indeed.               Both

        and I assisted with the loading of the two casualties on to

hospital    trolleys, and they were then taken immediately into Casualty.



14.     I proceeded to drive straight back to the Hillsborough Stadium

along the same route as before.        On arrival at the junction of Herries

Road South and Penistone Road I noted that a large number of emergency

vehicles waiting to gain access to the ground at point F.                                I joined a

line of ambulance vehicles.       When I drive   in the ambulance at point F,

I reversed the vehicle and stopped the vehicle at point G, with its

front facing the gate.       Other ambulances which were entering the

ground at point F were being directed       in to the area near the

gymnas iu m .



15.     Upon parking my ambulance    I remained with the vehicle.                              Shortly

afterwards,     a message   came over the vehicle radio from Control,

requesting all vehicles to move to Herries Road Bus Station.                                    No other

patients were on board the vehicle at this point                 in time.                I proceeded
                                                                              PAGE        8
                                                                              S1023

straight to the Bus Depot,      and when I arrived I noticed that Station

Officer Eason was    in charge of directing all ambulances           into a

position at the side of the Depot.          I was    likewise directed and parked

the vehicle,    awaiting further instructions.



16.   At some time later,     I was instructed to move off back to

Hillsborough to Gate 0.       I did so and upon arrival       I entered the

ground at point F and parked the vehicle near to point G.               At point F,

I had been met by Assistant Chief Ambulance Officer David Jones,                who

was directing all vehicles      into the football stadium.          Superintendent

Trevor Dale asked              and I to leave the vehicle and walk up to an

area just outside the gymnasium.       After    chatting for a short while

with fellow ambulancemen,      I then became aware for the first of the

enormity of the incident,     and the large number of fatalities. Shortly

afterwards,    Mr Jones   came over to the area just outside the gymnasium,

gathered together all     crews and then began to establlish who were on

afternoon shifts and the like.       Both              and I were    informed by Mr

Jones that we were being stood down off the incident and were told to

return to normal duties.      Both             and    I proceeded back to our

vehicle,   radioed Control who directed us back to Batemoor Station.                  I

drove directly to Batemoor Station where            I continued with my normal

duties.    I have no idea of my time of arrival at Batemoor Station.

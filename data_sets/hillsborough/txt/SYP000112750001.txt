     We then made             our way' to another             gate     inside         th« ground.          ’Whe n we      '

      I believe we made                our way      in front        of the       turnstiles and stopped

      people     running        towards        them.       A t t empts     were made        to stop        people               :

At    this     point    the     pressure       seemed to have             eased -and I saw that

through, was          now open and officers               including an               Inspector were        pulling

people       from the        v i c inity o f .the       turnstile .pulling them under                     the

to assist        in this.

To the best of my knowledge                     the flow of fans through the gate was,

quite    light,         only    being those who^-tf^ued to. go through                          the

ground this way and                  continued     to    push ana         shove       to get    through the

L e p ping s    Lane       terrace.         I believe     this was            on the Police        radio.,       I

ran back        into the        ground and met           up with other               officers.        Because        of

congestion,           instead of        going    direc t l y     on to the terrace,                I led

officers around,              past     the Police        control.             When    passing    thro u g h the

was    because        the 'steward manning              the gate         had m i B p ^ a x e d his     key or

                 kiss      of    life.       i saw        people    standing        on      people's    heads who were                lying

                 on the ground.                This       brought    no / f e s p o n s e   froni the      body,,

                 out.         She was      d re s s e d    in black and was              almost     certainly        dead,,       Many

                 w hen     no more       bdies were          being     passed out. I realised that                    the       pressure
        /        had eased            in the    central        pen and officers were able-to                        get    into that

                 area to help.              I also         noticed t h a t o f                 the wire      fencing           had been

                 ripped open.              1 then went and                imbed out          of the terracing.                  I can

S t ^ n d so there was more              room to treat        those     seriously       injured.

Some     time      later •I became a w a r ^ o ^ ^ C T v e r p o o l    -Pans running         towards        the

point      had to go i nto          the stand to       pull       odt two fans who had been*

g e s ti cu l a t i n g at' the Liverpool, fans.              The y were s t r ongly a d v i s e d and                 .

m oved away -            in differen t      c i r c umstances      they would have           been arrested.

Confusion          c o n tinued to       reign until       soj&e— ctrrrsTcfir.able time        later an

and going          off    duty at 2000.

As m e n t i o ne d before         the   fans were     quiet       to start with,         livening       up

nearer       the kick       off.     Many hadji ^ e n       drinking     en route       to the ground ;

and     once at the         ground or Vne- v i c inity            continued to. drink.

Once     the disas t e r         had occurred many          fans    not near     enough       to .help were

a bus i v e and angry,,           others    however    who were        nearby helped a d m i r a b l y

            unmanned.              If these     had opened the              pressure    in the        central        pens would

            have     eased earlier,             hence       perhaps     saving more           lives.

            Many     of. the        people who were            crushed had their              chests against           the wail

            ar o u n d the ground          not .against the- fencing,                  this     effect was w o r s e n e d

            by the sloping              terraces.          The gates         in the    perimeter          fence were at

            terrace.           No    ramps' were        in up to the          gates.

            First aid e q u ipment was                  nowhere      to be found,         putting         undue      pressure

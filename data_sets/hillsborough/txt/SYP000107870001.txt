PETER JAMES ROTCHELL




POLICE CONSTABLE 2417




HAMMERTON ROAD POLICE STATION

SHEFFIELD.




I am a Police Constable                   in the South Yorkshire              Police,    currently stationed

at    Hammerton       Road       Police    Station,     Hillsborough,          Sheffield.          Since    1979,   I

have     worked       at    the   Hillsborough        Football        Ground    and   at different          times I

have worked in all areas of that ground.

At     10.00     a.m.       on    Saturday      the    15     April     1989,     I   was     on     duty    at   the

Hillsborough football ground for duties in connection with the F.A. Cup Semi

Final     between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest Football Clubs,                                   together with

other officers for the match briefing.

At     this    time       I was    designated       part     of    serial   number Two        under    the   direct

supervision of Police Sergeants 2358 Cox and 2425 Hemingway.

After the briefing and together with other officers from Serial number Two,

I made a search of the lower deck of the South Stand which was to be used by

the No ttingham Forest supporters.                      I then went to the turnstiles situated in

 the South West corner                 of the South Stand next to the Leppings Lane Terraces

 in order to monitor supporters coming into the South Stand.                                        At this time I

was     in    the    company      of   Police    Constables         157 West,     3235 Roberts         and Police

Constable           448     Turner.        There      were    also     a    number      of   stewards       at    that

 location.

From     sometime          around mid-day       to about          1.30 p.m.     there was a steady flow of

 supporters         entering        the    ground     and     these    were     all   in     good    and    friendly

 spirits.

 After       1.30 p.m.       I was     approached by a number of supporters who had tickets

 for the South Stand who stated that they were Liverpool supporters and
wanted to be let through into the terraced area of the Leppings Lane Stand.

These    requests       were       refused         by    myself        on the grounds        that all       the   tickets

for    the    match     had      been     sold     and     that      if all    such    requests       were met,          then

problems would occur with overcrowding.

Also at       this    time       I noticed         a number of supporters               in the South stand were

gathering        near       to     the       dividing          fence    between      the     South    Stand       and     the

Leppings       Lane     terracing            and   that I saw at           least one person           climb over          the

fence into the Leppings Lane terrace.

This occurred some distance away from me and in the lower deck seating area

of the South Stand.                I then went into the seating area to the fence dividing

the    South     Stand      from       the    Leppings          Lane    terrace      where Police       Constable         157

West and myself stayed to prevent any further occurence of fence climbing.

The    area     of    the    Leppings         Lane       terrace       immediately next           to the    South Stand

was not full and there was plenty of room at this time for further people to

go into that area.

Police       Constable           157     West      and    myself        were   in     this       location    from       about

1.50     p.m.    and        from       that     position         I     could   see    the    whole     length       of    the

Leppings Lane          terracing.             I could see that the central area of the Leppings

Lane    terrace was           crowded and that people were packed together and also that

the areas       to either side of that central area, were capable of taking a lot

more people than that which they contained.

I continued          to watch          the    central area of the terracing and saw a number of

people       start    to     try    and       climb      the    perimeter      fence       and    a number    of people

were brought out via the fence gates onto the perimeter track.

I then went down onto the perimeter track just as all the supporters in the

South Stand were sititng down for the beginning of the match.

Once on the track I guided some supporters who were walking into the wing of

the terracing next to the South Stand as there was still plenty of room in
that area.

I    then       started       to    make       my     way       towards       the    central        area     to   see    what     the

situation was.                I quickly          realised          that there were too many people                            in that

one       area    and    started          assisting            people     out       via    one    of   the    perimeter         fence

gates.

The first half dozen or so of these people were feeling faint and were taken

over       to    the    South        Stand      area        where       there       were     some      St.   Johns       Ambulance

personnel.             I then helped one youth out and awy from the area, again to the

South Stand area, this youth had an injury to one of his ankles.

As    I    returned          again    to    the          central    area,       some supporters              started shouting

that       people       were       dying       in     there,       and    what       was     I    doing      about      it.      Some

supporters          were      appearing             to    be    getting       very angry           and    frustrated          despite

that       they    were       on    the    field          and     only    started          to    hinder      attempts         to help

people.

I     continued         to    assist       people          out     of    central          area    some     were    faint       others

obviously dead and had been for some time.

I then assisted Inspector White to carry one youth about 14 years of age out

of    the       area.        He    was    unconscious             and    no    one    was apparently              with him.        We

carried the youth onto the field, he was not breathing but did have a pulse.

Once he was on the ground it was only a matter of a quick smack on his back

that started him to breathe.

Both       Inspector         White       and    myself           remained       with       the     youth     until      assistance

came and he was taken to an a m b u l a n c e .

Once       the    terracing          and       then       the    Ground       had    been        cleared,     I   re-joined       the

rest of my             serial on         the    field          and we all       then went           to the North Stand to

stand-by for deployment to other duties.

We    were       not    re-deployed            and        about    6.00       p.m.        that    same     day    we    were    stood

down.

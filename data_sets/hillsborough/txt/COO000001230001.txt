Hillsborough Announcement on Monday


In response to an earlier note, you indicated a certain scepticism about the need
to look anew at this.


The reason Jack Straw feels it is necessary is because he and others had given
assurances before the election that the new evidence would be examined. He felt
that the most appropriate way of doing this would be to have an independent
authority look at the new evidence and report back on whether any further
investigations/inquiries are warranted.


On Monday he will be announcing a limited review of the new evidence.

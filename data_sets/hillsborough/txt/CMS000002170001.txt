PAY RUNNING COSTS

The fourth quarter figure has been reduced to
reflect:-

i.     the recent replacement of the AO by an
       A A ; and

ii.    the possibility that the Inquiry will be
       completed before the end of the
       financial year.  Lord Justice Taylor has
       indicated that he hopes to complete his
       Final Report sometime in January,
       following which there will be a certain
       amount of 'clear-up' work to be done by
       the Secretariat.  It is hoped that will
       be completed early in February.

the    car    in a side      street about           half an hour's walk to the ground.

There were       crowds of       people wa lk i ng            towards    the ground,        the a t m o sp h er e

there were       no queues,          just a m a s s i f        people.      I saw Police         pulling

people up over the turnstiles,                      it was      chaotic.      We joined the           crowd

realised,       I think we were             the first         few through the gate.              We were all

still    together and we             ran towards a tunnel               w hich was a head of us.



I have been to H i l l s b o r o ug h before                 but on that occasion           I was     in the

N orth Stand.          I had never been             into the Leppings Lane area before and

I thought that the tunnel                   was the only way onto the terrace.                        As   I

went    through the gate             by the turnstile            I had my ticket           in my hand but

no-one a s ke d to see          it or check us at all.



As    I got    to the ttwcmel I saw the                  players     on the    pitch,     the game had

started.        Going    down tne tunnel             it was OK at first but as we got

nearer       the terrace       I was being          pushed from behind.              The terrace was

very    crowded and         I was       pushed around,          you just went w here you were'/'

pushed,      and most       of the time           I was    f aced a r o u n d w it h my back > 6          the

pitch and my feet were off the ground.                               I was no       longer.^rnterested          in

the game.         I realis ed that s om e th i ng was wrong,                      i^-was    not the normal

crush.       I was having          great       di/Pficulty to breathe a nd was s t r u gg l in g                 to

stay on my feet.                I remember       seeing a^frtan a nd wife aged about                  late

fifties,       they were only abjiut 5*3,                  I c o u l d n ’t see them gett in g out,

they were getting more an/l more                       under    pressure and both were              crying,          I

then    lost    sight     of them./          At this      stage      I had been split          up from my

frie nd s and was on my o^n,                   I was w o r r i e d    for myself and my friends.



I was     pushed f or w ar d t/owards the               pitch and ended up a ga i ns t a crash

barrier.        I saw a you/ig girl               in front      of the      crash barrier        lying on

top of other         b o di e s , /s h e was     s c re am in g and shouting.              1 t ried to grab

her    but at     this    timqf I was          pushed from b eh in d and went down on the

terrace.        I grabbed/ hold of some on e a nd s tr ug g le d up again.                          As    I got

up two     lads    behind/ me dived f or w ar d a nd g ra bb ed the girl who                        had been

screaming.         The    1/ads pulled the girl                up a nd we all         passed her over the

heads of fans          towards         the    pitch.



I saw that        the game was           sti                                               id t h e P ol ic e

were at the        perimeter           fence                              ^ irioye back      on the terrace.



The    p erimeter      fence was about             ten feet at the front of me a nd                   I could

see a pile of bodies               in front of me,             with    people       standing    on them.

T he re was     nothing         they    could do they were being                  pushed from behind.                I

was still       side on to the               pitch and was        b e i n g - b r u s h e d very badly,    but       I

were    times     in the        crowd w he n I thought            I would         pass out because of the

heat and       crush,     it was the w orse             I've been       in.        I remember G r ob be la r

looking b ehind him,                a nd the fans were         shouting      to h i m , the P ol ic e

climb over          the    perimeter       fence but      they were being           pushed back by the

Police,      but     some fans had got over a n d they were                      climbing      back up onto

the    perimeter          fence and shouting           for us to move back but              there was no

way we     could move            back.     Most of the       time my feet were off the grou nd

a nd there was            no w ay    I could move a nywhere.               I was getting w o r r i e d

a bout my friends            because       they are all       smaller       than me,     and    I thought            I

was going       to get killed.



I was     crushed up a gainst              the fence a ga i n s t       pen two.      I was     in a daze

or day dr ea m w h en a mate who was the other                         side of the fence grab be d

hold of my shoulder a nd told me to get over                              because   there was        loads of

room.      I remember            someone    putting     their     hands     t h ro ug h the fence a nd           I

t ried to put my foot                on the hands and         climb over but the            crush        came

a g a i n and   I was       pushed f orward and           I n early fell         down again.         I

st am pe d myself          from falling and at the t hird a tt em pt                  I got my foot             in

my m a t e s h a n d s     and    I got    to^l>fcie^top of the fence w he re            I just      lay for

a while.        I was       exhausted.        The    lads    the o t her side of the fence

dr ag ge d me o v e r and           I stayed w ith them for a short while,                     I was      in a

daze.      After a w hile            I thought      t h e \c r us h was    going to h a pp e n a g a in         in

pen two so          I then made my way further sjT.ong the                                   iwards the

Police     control         box where       there was      loads       of room.      I sat down on the

t errace     in a state           of shock and g et ti ng my b re at h back.



O n reaching         this    point       I looked towards         the     pitch and saw that the

players      had all        gone and fans were            on the       pitch,    a nd a lot of them

were    being       given m o u t h to mouth.           I saw fans tearing            down a d v e r t i s i n g

boards a nd using            them as stretchers.               I remember        fans a rg u in g w it h the

Police,      a nd    I saw a photographer              s ta nd in g    on the steps      of the Poli ce
                                                                                                   PAGE
                                                                                                   S3576

box taking       p hotographs       of the bodies        in the       pen.     His mate was        on the

terr ac e    pointing      out bodies    to be     photographed,             the    crowd s ta rted

throw ing     coins at the      photogra ph er a nd his mate.



I was too far a wa y from the            pitch to        iden ti fy any of the            injured or

dead but      I could see fans getting a t t e n d e d to a nd others were                        covered

over as      if they were      dead.



I s tayed on the terrace             trying   to see my friends               but    I could not see

them.       I a s k e d some friends who         live    near by      if they had s ee n them but

they had not.



I later saw K e nn y D a l g l i s h go up to the P o li c e Box and                    I h ea rd him

speak     over   the T a n n o y system.      S o o n a fter        this   I left the grou nd by

w al k in g a ro u n d the side of the West S t a n d and out                  into L ep p in g s Lane.

As   I w a l k e d along    I met                       and                         stan di ng   outside s

funeral      parlour.       I thought    the worse,           but    they had been using           the

phone.



We went      to a telephone         box and             rang,       later we found a no t he r        bo;

and we all       rang our homes.



We w ere all      sh oc ke d and           was    too upset          to drive so we went to a

pub for about an hour           or so.



L ater we     came horns ar ri vi ng -a Nyabout quarter                to ten.



All my      ribs were      b ruised and for       days I t was         sore    to breathe,       after a

day or two       I r ealised my       legs were also           bruised.        I did not go to my

D octor     for any treatment,         a nd did not stop off work.

              were    not o r g a n is e d    properly,   there was   just a mass of   people   trying       to

              not see that        people were         being   crusheKand   open the gate to     let them

              out.     If they had o pened the gates             earlier >vJo   not think    so many

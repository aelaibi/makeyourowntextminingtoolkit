6)    There       was     no      one    at    the      station when               I arived,             so     on m y      own

initiative,             I t oo k        the    vehicle          with       the     most       se at s.          I did       not    know

what    sort       of     injuries            I would          be d e a l i n g        w ith,      but     expected          t h e re

would       be a    large          number        of     casualties.

automatically                o nt o     ERC    c ha n n e l ,     because          I regarded              it as         a major

busy.        I t oo k        a    conscious            decision           not     to    block        the      channel        further

by a t t e m p t i n g       to    obtain        instructions                but       to    listen        to      other     messages

8)    I approached                Hillsborough                along       Herries        Rd a n d          from    this       direction

it    is   difficult              to    get    into       the       ground       on P e n i s t o n e       Rd     because          of    the

dual       carriageway.                 Because          of    this       I drove        straight            on at          the

roundabout            at    the        end    of H e r r i e s       Rd    and then          turned          left into            Leppings

I had      heard       on the           r a dio     that       ambulances             were      to     proceed          to    the

The    Police         assisted           me    to    get       through        the      f a ns    and       1 drove           up t o G a t e

C.     I am      not       sure        what    t i me      it was,          but the         journey          took o n l y 5

these      bodies          and       could     see       ahead       of me       three         front-line              vehicles

I was      already          thoroughly              busy.



10) I got        out        of    the R e n a u l t        and      tried       to    t ak e    stock        of    the

if    I needed assistance.                          He    was       not    in u n i f o r m      and       said        he    was w i t h

past      the     emergency ambulances                           and    b r i ng     b ac k      any walking               wounded           to

the      Renault.




          ust     as     he w e n t         off    two w o m e n        came       up     to me          and       said    they were

                       wanted          to    help.          .1 h a ve     no    idea w h o            t h e y were.              I simply

                            Stay       with me."             I then          sent       them        to    look       for     walking

                i n f ront            of G a t e     C,     which       they       di d .



         I remained              to    deal       with      casualties             beside           the       van.        Th e    first

    rsort I s p o k e            to w a s        a teenage         bo y w i t h a s h o u l d e r                  injury who          was

ii tting        amongst           the       b od i e s .     I said,           " Come       on      let me          get    you      out      of

h e r e , ” not        realising             he w a s       with anyone.                  He     re f u s e d ,      sa y i n g ,    ’ I ’m       not

leaving         my     f a t h e r . 11      Apparently            his       father         was       one      of    the     dead      beside

him.        1 could          not       persuade            him    to    leav e       and       so     I asked         a    pol i c e

officer         to     stay       by h i m a n d           comfort        him.          He was           not       seriously         injur ed .




14)      I turned           to    help       others.             I lifted a number                       of    people        into      the

vehicle         and     settled             them     down.         1 did        not       administer                any    treatment,

but      simply        assisted             them     into        the    vehicle.               The       nurses       then        returned

with      mors       casualties              and     i asked           tnem     to      get      on      board.




15)      Meanwhile,              I heard          on the         radi o      that       the      No r t h e r n / G e n e r a 1 H o s p i taI

was      full .        Therefore,                I decided         to     take       my     casualt/fes              to    the      ne;->t

nearest         alternative                 hospital         w h i c h was         the ^ o y a / Ha 1 1 arns h i r ex                  * told

 i£s i                           then       came     back        with more           walking             wounded          and     I asked
him    to a c c o m p a n y         me    to     t h e . H a l l a m s h i re t o m a k e               a    record          of    names       and

addresses            of     the     casualties            we    had        picked               up on the way.                    By     this time

the    vehicle            was     full.        I had      13    casualties                      on board,, t o g e t h e r              with

m y s eIf,       the      two     nu rses        and




17)    I drove            down      the       service      road        to       get       out.          The       three       ambulances

had    gone       fay now,          but       in a n y    case        I would             h av e    ha d         room    to       get    past.          1

left       by the         S Stand         exit.          The Police              guided             me out o nto P e n i s t o n e              Rd.

I do       not    know what              t ime    thi s w a s .




18)    After         1e a v i n g      t he    g round     the        traffic             was      heavy and             t he R & n a u 1 1        ha d

no    flashing            lig ht s       or    siren.          I saw a Police                      transit             van    b e h i n d me       and

beckoned          to      him     to     pull     in f r o nt         so    that          he    could            escort       me.        This

Police       vehicle            di d     have     li gh t s     and        he was          able         to       pull    in front.

After       t h is     we m a d e        better        progress,            although               the       journey          was       still

very       slow.          I cannot            remember         ho w    long          it    t ook        to       get    to    the       hospital.




19)    On arr ivi ng              at     the     Hospital         I did          not       drive            up    to    casualty          because

I assumed            stretcher            ca ses       would      be a r r i v i n g            there.                Instead       I decided

to    go    to    the       orthopaedic             side,       which           is    next         to       casualty          but       has    a

separate          entrance.               I told         everyone           to       stay       in the            van    u n ti l       I found,

out    what       was       happening.              There       w e re      a    lot       of      other          vehicles          around         but

1    was    able       to get          near      the     door.         1 went             in a n d          spoke       to a S i s t e r ,

explaining             that       I had        13 w a l k i n g       casualties                and         two       nurses      with        me   who

would       s t ay     to a s s i s t .          While     I was           speaking              to her           j.   spotted          a tfee

bench       next       to    the       X-ray Department                    and       said,         “S h a l l         I put       them    all      on

there?"           S he      agreed.            I did      not     detain             her       longer            as    she    was       already

very       busy



20)    I went          b ac k     to     the     vehicle        and        instructed               the          two /nurses a n d
                                                                                                                                        P A(jE        6
                                                                                                                                        S3301

              where       to    take      the     casualties                a n d all        three      of       us    then helped

them       into     the     building         and      settled             them       on    this       bench,           c;-

had    to     be    carr ie d,       but     it     di d         not     t ak e     lonq.




21)    I then        d r ove     b ac k     to    the      Leppings               Ln/end        with                                 1 h IS

time       we w e r e     approaching             from           the     opposite          direction             and    the        crowds

were       terrible.            Progress          was      extremely                slow and          the     crowd          seemed

unprepared           to     part     to     let     the          v an    through.           The       Police          simply        t o l d me

to    keep      going       forward         sl ow ly ,       which          I did.           I leaned            out    and        folded        in

the    wing        mirrors       on b o t h       sides.                It t oo k       several        minutes          to        get    down

Leppings           Ln,    but    I eventually                    pulled        up    in the       s ame       p o s i t i o n at         Gate

C.     A Senior           Police       Officer          w as       there          and     I asked, it            he    had any

reports         of w a l k i n g     wounded.              I also           asked                                to    look        around.

However,           there       did   not     seem       to        be a n y        casualties           to     c o lle ct ,         so a f t e r

a few minutes               I decided            to m o v e         into       the      S S t a n d a r ea .           At     this       point

                    asked       if   I would          mind          if he         left     to    get    in t o u c h w i t h             m s

wife       and. ch i l d r e n ,     and     I agreed.




22)    I drove           down    the      service          road a l o n e            and    pulled          up    by    the        S Stand

for    about        2 minutes.              No    one a p p r o a c h e d            me a n d     there          were        no

casualties           waiting         to     be    collected               so      I moved        to    the       end    of        the

service         road      (marked         p o s i t i o n 3 on the                  plan).        Again          no    one        approached

me.        While     1 wa s      there       I heard              on     the      rad io    a    request          for       all     vehicles

to    go    to H e r r i e s     R d Bus         St^^i^on a n d             stand         by.     I decided             I would           go     to

the    bus      station and            after       a fe w jmif^n^/xes I m o v e d                     otf .       I diu           not    make

23)    I drove           up H e r r i e s    Rd S an d/ fr om                  there       to H e r r i e s       Rd Bus           Station

stay       with my        vehicle         and     I waited               with a group             of    o t h er       drivers.
                                                                                                                                                    page:
                                                                                                                                                    S3301

            Later          I was       paired           up w i t h a n o t h e r         c o i ie a g u e      G ua 1 i f i e d A rnb u 3.a n c e ma n

            the       bus       station.



            24)       A    group       of a b o u t        8 or 9 v e h i c l e s           were       instructed             to    go    back       to    the

            gymnasium                yard.         I do       not       remember         what     route        we    t oo k    but       we    had    no

            problem             in g e t t i n g        there.              We    drove      into      the m a i n      police           access        point

            and       Darked          in the        yard.           Mr E A S O N        ha d a l s o     travelled            to    the       gym a n d
                                                                                           O i o s u a .
            was       there          when     1 arrived             w i t h Mr      JONES and            ocher       officers.




            23)       A message              was    received            that       there      were       11    bodies         at    the N o r t h e r n

            General             Hospital           and     one      at H a l l a m s h i r e      Hospital,           and a de cision                 was

            taken          to    bring        them       b ac k     t-d the        g y m n as iu m.                  and      I were          instructed

            to       go    to N o r t h e r n G e n e r a l ,            1 think         by Mr      EASON       or    bv Mr         JONES.




            26)       Again          there     were        no      traffic         problems         in g e t t i n g       there,         but       I h a ve

            no       recollection              of w h a t          t im e    we a r r i v e d .        We     went    r o un d      to    the

            mortuary/and                 loaded          two       or   three^tfodies             a nd      brought        them      b a ck     to    the

            gymna^um.                  We     carried           them        tNsr'gether into           the     gym.                  and       I tnen

            congregated                round        the       parked         vehicles         outside         with      other        ambulancemen.

      0     27)       It    soon       became           clear       t h at       it wa s     pointless          having         fleets          of

            ambulances                standing           by     because           the    process         of    identifying               and    bagging

            the       bodies          wa s    likely          to    take         some    time.         I think        it was         Mr       E A S O N who

            came          and    explained              this.           T h e vs Mr J O N E S       gathered          us      r o un d    and       said

            they          would       keep     three          or    f ou r a m b u l a n c e s      to      deal     with      the       bodies       and

            the       rest       would        be    stood          down..                  and    1 were        one     of     the       teams       chosen

            to       stay       on    duty.

28)     After          a while          we     heard     that    relatives              were         on    their          way and         they

arrived           in a S Y o r k s h i r e            Transport           vehicle            and    went        into       the     gym     to

identify              the     b od i e s .      Once     form al      identification                      of    t h re e    bodies         had

been       completed and                  the    paperwork           d one      the     ambulance               c rews      were         called

to     keep       a    log,       as    Mr     EASON     was    u p d a t i n g 7 i n f o r m a t i o n as            bodies         were

29)     I think                        and     I carried about                 30    or 3 3        b od i e s ,      in a d d i t i o n     to

those        we       brought          back     from     the N o r t h e r n         General.




30)     At    0200          the    evening         shif t,      which          began         at    1800,        would       normally

32)     The       only      difficulty             I. h a d was         in d r i v i n g    through          the    crowd which

was     not      prepared           to m o v e      out    of      the    way.



33)      1     did    not     encounter            a n y St       J o h n ’s A m b u l a n c e       staff.        1 did        see    a

Red     Cross         officer        in the         g y m a r e a wh o         asked       me    for      paracetamol            for

someone          wh o      had a h e a d a c h e .         I was         amazed       at    t h is     request       and        s a i d we

did     not      carry        paracetamol.




34)     As      regards          communications,                  as    I have      explained,             1 took        a    conscious

decision             not    to   block        the    ERC      c han ne l       with     unnecessary             enquiries             and

gained           information             by l i s t e n i n g      to m e s s a g e s      being          passed    to o t h e r

on     the      vehicle          radio       and    did    not         encounter         problems          with     interference

even         after      I moved         to     the g y m n a s i u m       end.         It m a y     be    that    the rad i o             had

been          switched        back      to     the o r d i n a r y       e m e r g e n c y c ha n n e l    by     this       time.          I

di d    not      personally             attend       to    this,         but    it m a y        be    that               ha d    changed

it     over.          1 did       not    h ave      a handset            w i t h me.




35)     The      passenger           vehicle         I was         driving        was      unequipped,             but       I had

Drought          w i t h me a r irst               Aid    box a n d        surgical         collars          from    the        station.

In fact          I did        not    use a n y       of    thi s        equipment          and was         not a s k e d        for    it.

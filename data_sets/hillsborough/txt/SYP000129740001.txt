For the Attention of Mr. p. Downes


Dear Mr. Bownes,

                     Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic
                       Safety at Sports Grounds Act 1385
                        New Entrance on Penistone Road

        Some months ago we applied for Planning Approval oahheiialf of
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, for a new entrance on Penistone
Road.     Appewaal was granted last September.
        One purpose of the entrance is to proJride access €or tne public
using the Sports Hall so t&at they will no longer have to use
Gate *0’, which also leads to other parts of the ground.        Another
purpose is to provide a separate access for police vehicles, ambulances
and vehicles for the dlaabled which park at the back of the gymnasium
on match days.     This effectively reduces any possible dangers which
may result fran vehicles having to pass through queuing spectators
whilst trying to gain entry through Gat® 'O'.y
        Enclosed are six prints of our drawings 7593/1 and 7593/2
showing the layout and details of the proposal.
        The comments of the Officer Working Party would be welcomed.
Tenders have been Invited for the work and it Is hoped that demolition
of the two terraced houses can start towards the end of
January 1987.
                             Yours sincerely,
                                                                                                                          7(ol 1

Dear Sir,

South Stand Roof

I refer to the meeting which took place in the boardroom at the Club on                                                  Tuesday,
25th November in connection   with theSouth Stand Roof.

I am now writing to confirm   that theGeneral Purposes Panel of the City Council
will consider a report from   Officers in connection with the roof, at its meeting
on Monday 5th January, 1987. The Panel will, of course, be interested to hear
the Club's views on this matter and it would be helpful if you could let me have
a letter setting out your views by 19th December.

Yours faithfully,

 Chairman,
 Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC,
 c/o Presto Tools,
 Penistone Road,
 Sheffield 6.


 Dear Chairman,
                       South Stand Roof
         Early this afternoon Dick's secretary telephoned to
 say there had just been a requefet from the Fire Service to be
 allowed to visit the South stand at short notice and that
 they would like to come immediately.     I therefore went down
 to the ground to await their arrival.    One of the two visitors
 was, as I understand it, the assistant chief fire officer, but
 Iddid not get his name.   The other was; a M * .Seaman who I have
 dealt with before at Rotherham United*s ground and who is
 generally helpful and sensible in his approach.
         Tte^y inspected the steel covering to the timber deck
 and expressed their satisfaction that it will prevent the deck
 from catching fire.   They had clearly not realised before my
 letter to the City Council that there is louvre ventilation at
 the top of the roof and they obviously regarded that as very
 valuable.    They expressed a tentative view that they would like
  bo see some further ventilation near the back of the stand because
 the translucent sheets are at quite wide spacing.     However, the
 general impression I gained was that they will be recommending
 that the Club be given a maximum of five years in which tc       carry out
■ the re-roofing. ■

           However, on   our way into thestand we had
to pass the players      recreation room, which as   you will know
consists of timber partitions and has a considerable fire
load inside it.      Very close by there is an area which was
a bar before the prohibition of drink and which still has
furniture in it and some boxes and other rubbish.         The assistant
chief fire officer had apparently been at a match fairly recently
and had noticed that this particular room was        unlocked and that
people were sitting      smoking in it.   It also apparently had a lot
of food on trays awaiting to be taken to some other part of
the stand.
           They were much more concerned about these two rooms
than about the timber in the roof of the stand.         However
I assured them that we had painted the walls with a fire
resistant pal&baand that this is minuted in the papers of the
Working Party and that we had also fixed extract fans from the
two rooms into the main corridor at the request of the Fire
Service.      They seemed to regard the fans as undesirable but
in the circumstances, I suspect they will not request that they
be removed.      However they did appear anxious to have smoke
detectors in these rooms because of their very combustible
nature so that the Police would be immediately alerted should
a fire start.
           In general discussion, they said that the Building
Control Department will clearly have a role at the meeting
which is to be held because of the structural Inadequacies
of the stand roof but that so far as the Fire Service are
concerned, we may well find that there is a sympathetic response
to the request for a delay of up to five years.
           I was also told that the proposed meeting was almost
certain to be this coming Tuesday,18 November, but that David
Bownes in the Town Hall had been awaiting confirmation from one
of the people whose presence is required, that the date is suitable
We may well therefore have confirmation on Monday morning that
the meeting is to take place on Tuesday.
                                           Yours sincerely,


c.c.

Dear Chairman,
                       South Stand Roof
        Following our telephone conversation on Thursday, 30
October, I was unsuccessful in trying to talk to Dick Chester.
Unfortunately I was moving house on Friday and so was not able
to discuss the matter with him before he left office.   However
I have had a talk with David Bownes who is secretary of the
Working Party which has cleared the air a good deal.
        Apparently the Chairman of the Committee to which he
is responsible has been making general enquiries regarding the
position with safety work and has requested a report from the
Working Party in the fairly near future.
        You mentioned to me that it may be the foundations which
were causing concern rather than fire, but David Bownes tells
me that in fact it is the possible fire hazard which is uppermost
in their minds, coupled with the fact that the trusses are leahing
very badly over one half of the stand.
        Because David Bownes is new to the job, I talked to him
at some length about the background and made sure he fully understood
why the Club had to give priority to the Kop.,   I also explained
that in some respects the North stand roof is much more a matter
of concern than the South stand roof because of the leak problem.
I said that given a free hand, the Club may well give
greater priority to re-sheeting the North stand rather
than building the new South stand roof.
        In discussing the tactics to be adopted, David Bownes
was very helpful.        He felt that unless the Club comes
forward with a positive report, the Committee may well take
the initiative and try to impose a timescale, and the time-
scale may be quite   m    short one.   It was thus thought to be
better tactics if the Club could respond even if they asked
for a year or two of grace.        However, he felt It would be
necessary to give a proposed timescale, even if it were
a few years, rather than ask for an indefinite stay of
execution.
        David Bownes said that his Chairman had been hoping
for a response from the Club in time for it to be considered
by his Committee during the first week in December.           This
means that David Bownes would like a response by about 20
November so that he could obtain the views of his Working
Party prior to the Committee meeting.       I said that this would
be too tight a timescale for the Club. There would probably have
to be a Board discussion and I did not know the dates of Board
meetings.    I therefore said that I would ask you to let the
Town Hall have a response by the end of November.        This will
then give plenty of time for the Working Party to consider it
in December and for the Committee of the City Council to
consider it during the first week in January.
        I also asked for an indication of the feelings of the
Fire Service and the Building Surveyors Department in so far as
these can be obtained informally.        I think it likely that I
can persuade the Building Surveyors Department to be accommodating
in their attitude but the Fire Service are much less malleable.
        When you have had time to consider the matter, I would
appreciate a discussion so that we can finalise tactics.             If
possible, I would like a few days notice of any report I have
to write and It will obviously also have to be written a
few days before the end of the month so that you have time
to approve the contents before it is seen.


                            Yours sincerely,
                                                                        FILE

Dear Sir,

Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC -
Spion Kop Development__________________

Thank you for your letter of 15th October in reply to mine of 9th October
addressed to Sheffield Wednesday.

I am very grateful for the plans which you have supplied which I am sure will
help the Council as Certificating Authority in the exercise of its
responsibilities under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.

I feel that it is important to carefully distinguish between plans, etc., which
are forwarded to the Council in its role as Building Authority and those which
are submitted to it as Certificating Authority.  It is my understanding that the
County Council, when it received plans, ensured that copies were submitted to
the interested Officers for comment; indeed the situation then was somewhat
clearer as the County Council had, as Certificating Authority, no connection
with the Building Authority.

I think that this arrangement should continue - that is plans relating to the
1975 Act should be forwarded to my Licensing Office for distribution.




                                                                                                           Continued...... /




                                                                                              734005 - Mr. Bownes
                                For telephone enquiries on this matter please ring......................................... (STD Code 0742)
                                                               Telex 54243 (Administration & Legal)
                                       -2 -



It may be appropriate where identical plans have already been submitted to the
Building Authority for you to point this out    in a letter accompanying the plans;
there would then be no need to forward additional copies of plans tothem.

I would add that the Council as Certificating Authority wish to see the most
efficient system possible in operation as regards Safety of Sports Grounds, and
obviously this requires a good working relationship with the representatives of

For the attention of Mr. H.E. McGee, Chairman

Dear Sirs,

South Stand roof

I refer to my letter of 25th September in which I asked for details of the
Club's intentions with regard to the South Stand roof.

Frow the copy correspondence enclosed with my letter it is evident that the
Certificating Authority whilst expressing concern about the roof agreed to
refrain from taking action to secure a remedy to the problem.  The basis of the
Agreement was that the Club would act on the matter by the start of the 1986/87
season.

As no proposals have been submitted to the Council as Certificating Authority
under the Safety of Sports Ground Act 1975, I am anxious to find out just what
the Club's intentions in this respect are.

I look forward to hearing from you shortly.  Please bear in mind that I have
sent a copy of this letter as usual to Messrs. Eastwood & Partners.

Yours faithfully.______

          "It was seen that the work to the return barriers along the radial

          The continuation of the top crush barrier adjacent to grid line 14
          had not yet been done.

          The perimeter guarding to the inside of the vertical cladding was
          almost completed to the East and South faces, but had not yet
          commenced to the North face.

          The handrail to the concrete wall at the base of the radial gangway
          on grid line 6 had not yet been done.

          The meeting also produced the following agreements

          1.     The outer balustrading to the new south stairway is to be mesh
                 infilled over its full height.

          2.     The top rail of the south stairway balustrading is to remain as
                 existing at 1.050 metres above landing level.

          3.     A bottom rail is to be provided to the crush barriers adjacent to
                 the lateral gangway between grid lines 3 and 7.

    I set out below a report of the meeting which was held on 12th September 1986 at
    the above development which was attended by Mr. Swann and Mr. Butler of the
    Building Surveyors Department and Mr. Strange of Messrs. Eastwood and Partners.

              5.   Investigation to be done by Eastwood and Partners into the
                   provision of fixings for the required additional length of crush
                   barrier at the base of the new terracing directly to the north of
                   grid line 8.

              6.   The return barrier to the existing terrace side of the lateral
                   gangway adjacent to grid line 7. is not to be installed until
                   further investigation has taken place of crowd movement in this
                   area.  It is anticipated that alterations to this area of
                   terracing may be undertaken shortly to increase crowd flow.

              7.   A length of crush barrier in the existing terracing adjacent to
                   grid line 8, found to be nearly rusted through at its support, is
                   to be replaced."




        Would you please advise me as to the up-to-date position on the items referred
        to in the report.  I have, as usual, passed a copy of this letter on to Messrs.
        Eastwood and Partners for their attention.

Dear Dick,
                      Proposed Fridge -• South Stand

    Although it is some time ago since you asked, I looked
last Wednesday with Peter Raynor at the likely position of the
large fridge which is proposed to be installed at ground level
in the south stand.
    I see just two requirements that may affect safety.         The
first is that the fire escape from the double doors at the end
of the corridor from the reception suite and offices must be
maintained over its full width.     The second is that the clear
width between the doncrete column at the bottom of the flight
of stairs and the front of the fridge must be not less than the
total combined width of the two stair flights or not less than
the combined width of the two exit doors leading from those
stair flights.   The clear distance will therefore need to be
about 3.7m


                                     Yours sincerely,

Dear Dick,
         Safety of Sports Ground Act - Roof of South Stand
    Thank you for sending me a copy of the letter from Sheffield
City Council dated 25 September which had enclosed with it the
exchange of correspondence between Mr. David Vaughan and myself
dated 25 and 26 June 1985.
    The background to the letters of 25 and 26 June is that
during May 1985, in the immediate aftermath of the Bradford fire
the Licensing Authority (SYCC) made it clear that something would
have to be done about the south stand.    You will recall that
we prepared the scheme for covering the wooden deck with steel
sheet and gave consideration to the possibility of replacing
the existing asbestos and timber roof by steel sheets placed
on the existing   steel frame.
    SYCC convened a meeting at the stadium on 5 June 1985 which
I was not able to attend.    At that meeting they accepted the
proposal for covering the wooden decking with steel sheet
subject to certain conditions.    The Fire Service considered it
was necessary to take action on the timber of the roof and the
building authority accepted the principle of steel sheeting instead
of the present wood and asbestos roof covering, but raised the
possibla difficulty of reverse loading in wind conditions
due to the lighter weight o£ the steel sheet compared with the
existing.
    You will no doubt have a copy of the minutes of that meeting
on your file but to save you looking it out, a copy is enclosed.
You will see that the discussion on the two matters is recorded
in minutes 2 and 3 and that the timescales of the operations is
discussed in minute 4.       With regard to the timescale they
wanted the decking to be completely encased with steel by
mid-August but they are prepared to tolerate the completion of
re-sheeting of the roof after the start of the season.       John
Strange was standing in for me and you will see from his hand­
written note below minute4 that he had tried to get them         to
accept the roof as it is      for a longer period but had   not been
very successful.
    I was away from Sheffield at the time of the meeting on
Friday, 5 June, but you will recall that I       had adiscussion with
you in the following two or three days and it was decided to
play for time with a view      to carrying out the work on the roof
in 1986.    At that stage,     of course, I was not aware   thatyou
had had a promise of a grant for the Kop roof and you were
obviously not in a position to tell me that.       However, it was
agreed that I should play for time and I therefore wrote to
SYCC on 12 June 1985 asking them to delay the replacement of
the roof for a year.     A copy of my letter is enclosed.    It was
as a result of that that the extra year of grace     was given.
    AS part of the exercise, I had a meeting with Harry Wright,
Chief Fire Officer for South Yorkshire, who generally approved
the proposals for the steel sheeting and who also said that
he would not object to the timber in the roof being left for
another year.
    My feeling is that the risk involved in leaving the timber
in the roof is very small and I would be prepared to try to
negotiate an extension of time before action is taken.        I see
genuine difficulty in trying to apply a new steel covering
to the existing structure.       Thin steel sheet is quite a bit
lighter than the combination of timber board and asbestos sheet.
We know from calculations which we have done that because
of the low dead weight, the stresses in the steel roof
trusses are considerably reversed vhen wind uplift occurs
(wind blowing from a northerly direction).      The compressive
stresses are such that it would be difficult to satisfy the
Building Regulations.     The situation will not be made any
easier by the hard attitude being displayed in the Town Hall.
The present steel structure also has many other defects
such as leaning trusses and some rusting.
    The Club may feel that to place new sheeting on the
existing roof, which would also involve providing steel purlins
to replace the timber joists would be largely a waste of money
in view of its long term plans.     The tactics should therefore
be to try to persuade the local authority to accept the
existing situation until the Club can afford the completely
new roof at higher level and covering the open seats.      The
case will clearly need to be made in writing followed by a
meeting.   I should add that South Yorkshire County Council
had clearly accepted the situation when they were informed in
the autumn of 1985 that because of the grant situation, the
Club was having to proceed with re-roofing of the Kop in
advance of the south stand.     No objection was raised by South
Yorkshire County Council before handing over.      We may be able
to use this as a lever in requesting Sheffield City Council to
delay action for another year or two.
    The Club will need to consider whether there should be a
contingency plan in case re-roofing is demanded during the
summer of 1987.     The weight of the enlarged roof will add load
to the existing south stand concrete structure and we shall have
to satisfy the Building Surveyors Department of the City Council
that this will not overstress the concrete columns and the
foundations.      If the columns had to be strengthened to give
enlarged foundations it would add significantly to the cost.
It will be recalled that when the modifications were made to create
the new offices and the River Suite two years ago, it was discovered
that manyof the reinforced concrete columns contained
heavily rusted reinforcement and concrete has spalled off.
In certain cases we had to construct enlarged foundations
around the columns because they were incapable of taking
significant extra load from the new construction.
    We have given a lot of thought to this problem and have
devised ways in which the steel frame for the new roof
will only apply a minimum amount of load to the new
structure.   I am fairly confident that we will not run into
insurmountable difficulties but I think it would be wise
for us to be producing some outline designs and calculations
so that we can try to reach an agreement on what is possible
without large expense with the Town Council.
    Obviously we should not be trying to reach an agreement
with the Town Council about the structure at too early a
date because this would undermine the negotiations for an
extension of time,but I think that we in this office ought
to be ready with our proposals in case the extension is not
granted.
    The timescale of constructing a new roof would not be
quite so difficult as the re-roofing of the Kop.    We would
nevertheless need to be placing a contract by early February
which means going out to tender before Christmas.     A planning
application would have to be made by not later than the
beginning of December so as to be reasonably sure of having
planning consent by the time a contract needs to be placed.

 Dear Sir,

 Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 - The Roof of the South Stand

 It has been brought to my attention that correspondence passed between the
 County Council and Eastwood and Partners in June, 1985 concerning the South
 Stand Roof-

 I enclose for ease of reference a copy of the County Council's letter of
 25th June and Doctor Eastwoods letter of 26th June.

 Would you please let me know what the Club's intention is with regard to the
 roof as soon as possible.

 Yours faithfully,




 Head of Department

    Dear Sir,

    Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
    Sheffield Wednesday Football Club L t d .

    I thank you for your letter dated.12th June.

    Taking into account all the factors which you mention (particularly the
    steel sheeting o f ,the wooden decking of the upper seated area by the
    start of the forthcoming season), the existing roof of the South Stand
    will be regarded as acceptable on a temporary basis until the end of
    the 1985/86 season.    At that time, either a new roof must be constructed
    or the under-roof timber cladding of the existing roof replaced by the
    start of the 1986/87 season.

    Details and plans of the work will, of course, be required in the usual
    way.

    Yours faithfully,




    Chief Executive

    For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan


    Dear Sirs,
                             Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
                           Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.
             Thank you for your letter of 25 June regarding the roof
    of the South stand.                                    I am sure the Club will be very appreciative
    of the co-operative attitude of the County Council.                                                                    The
    breathing space which has .been provided will be adequate for
    the Club to take action by the start of the 1986/87 season.


                                                                                      Yours faithfully.

                                         Thank you for your letter of 18 July and for the copy
                  of the letter which you have written to the Club regarding
    i             the fire protection of the wooden decking in the South stand.
                                         With regard to the possibility of roofing over the Kop,
                  there is no question of that being proceeded with prior to
                  re-roofing the South stand.                                                      The Club is unlikely to have
                  sufficient money to do both so it is reasonable to assume
                  that roofing over the Kop is unlikely to proceed for some
                  time.
                                         However you will need to know what may be involved and
                  I enclose three sets of prints for each of the two schemes.
                  These may be shown to members Q t your Working Party.                                                                                                        It
                  will be seen that neither scheme involves any change to the
                  arrangement of the accommodation on the Kop.                                                                                                  Even the roof
                  for the enlarged Kop will not involve any changes until some
                  date considerably into the future.
                                                                                     2.

                 The Club had special reasons for submitting these

           prints of two drawings showing a possible roof both in
           plan and in cross section.    We are presantly preparing
           a cost estimate for this scheme but it has not been considered
           in detail by the Board of Directors.      I would expect that
           the scheme for roofing the South stand will be approved

c          by the Board not later than the autumn.     At that time
           we will be formally writing for your comments as well as
                                                                           ;


           submitting the scheme for planning approval.      I hope that
           it will be possible to get planning consent and also the
           approval of the Officer Working Party by December so that
           the scheme can then be sent out for tenders and orders
           placed ready to start work immediately after the close of
           the football season in May 1986.
                 Becauae I have not had any kind of approval of the
           scheme shown on the drawings of the South stand, I am only
           sending one set of prints and suggest that for the time
           being it would not be appropriate for the drawings to be
           placed before your Working Party.

Dear Sirs,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic

As requested by your letter dated 16th July, I have written a confirmatory
letter to the Club regarding the steel sheeting and non-slip surface of
the timber deck to the South Stand upper seated area (copy attached for .
your information).

I understand that applications for building regulation/planning approval
have been made by the Club in respect of (i) re-organisation of fences
and turnstiles and alterations to toilet facilities at the rear of the
West Stand, Leppings Lane, and (ii) erection of roof and enclosure to the
Spion Kop Terrace.

The Officer Working Party considered and gave approval in principle to the
rear of the West Stand re-organisation proposals in May but, other than
brief mentions by the Club or yourselves at routine meetings of the
possibility of the Spion Kop being enclosed, no outline plans or details
of such proposals have been considered to date.

As on previous occasions, I am assuming that you will submit the necessary
detailed plans, specifications and calculations for Safety of Sports Grounds
Act approval (bearing in mind the General Safety Certificate requirement
to give the County Council at least 21 days notice of any proposed
alterations or extensions at the Ground) should the Club decide to implement
the proposals after building regulation/planning permission consideration.

                                               Yours faithfully,




                                                   Chief Executive

We have now completed a survey of the new covered kop and our
quotation for this work is enclosed.  It will provide you with
high quality coverage, and audible clear sound "to all areas even with
a full capacity.

At the same time we have taken the opportunity to update the
quotations for the work on the relevant concourse areas which we
believe you required completing at the same time.

Our current workload would not enable us to consider installation
prior to mid October, but with the price we have quoted we would want
to complete the kop area before the end of October and the loss of
over an hour of daylight.  Should you want to install after that date
then we would have to look at our quotation again, as it could add
considerably to our costs.

Once you have had chance to assess the quotations perhaps you would
care to phone me and we can discuss things in greater detail.

Yours sincerely,

Dear Sirs,

     Thank you for your Invoice    N o .    3572/4815 dated 29 August, 198fi.
Unfortunately, it has been made out to us instead of Sheffield

The description needs to refer to Eastwood & Partners'          l e t t e r

and not 'your letter'.
     Would you please alter the invoice and re-submit         i t   t o   us
so that we can certify payment by the Club.


                         Yours faithfully.

Dear Dick,
                    General Safety Certificate
     As promised I looked through your existing safety certificate
to see whether there are any matters which we might raise before
the next     certificate is issued.
     My only suggestion is that the position of the disabled should
be regularised by including them in Schedule 3 of Part 1.      The
entry might read "disabled and helpers in front of the North
stand".      If the number is 74, this would bring the ground capacity,
including the extra 4150 so far agreed for Spion Kop, to 54,398.
We will of course be applying for an increase after the completion
of the north corner and would hope that we will at least reach the
magic figure of 55,000.      The 74 disabled and helpers may be
useful in attaining that number.
     We discussed the other day the requirement for policing.
This is dealt with in clause 7 which refers to "adequate
number of police officers".      It goes on to say that the number
shall be agreed between the Chief Constable and the Holder at
least 21 days before a specific activity takess place.     This is
certainly a more civilised wording than that which appears to be
in use by North Yorkshire County Council but in the end, it does
give the Police a very considerable authority to decide
how many men they wish to have on duty.


                               Yours sincerely.

          Dear Bill,
          You will have seen direct in your office a letter dated the 27th August
          1986 from the City of Sheffield, Administration and Legal Department, which
          in their last paragraph they refer to items of work deemed necessary to
          be completed prior to the Chelsea fixture.
          I appreciate that this letter comes to you following such game but during
          telephone conversations with your office I was assured that all matters
          were in order and, in fact, that certain items raised by them were not
          in effect a complaint at all. I refer particularly to the statement of
          the non-working of the P.A. system.
          I was assured that your office would be dealing with the relative reply
          and I would be obliged if you could forward me a copy and outline any
          observations which this particular Department has had to make on this subject.
          Yours sincerely,

For the attention of Mr. D. Bownea


Dear Mr. Bownes,
               Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic
                   Safety at Sports Grounds Act 1975
                         Spion Kop Development

    Further to the meeting held at the Town Hall on Thursday
21 August 1986, we have pleasure in enclosing six prints of our
drawings 6648/45E, 47C, 48F, 49C, 51C, 72D, and 56G showing
details of the barriers and handrails which we propose to have
installed along the sides of the radial gangways and round the
outer perimeter of the south east staircase.
    The barriers and posts have been designed to resist a
design load of 3.4 kN/m and the handrails a load of 2.2 kN/m,
in accordance with the 'Green Guide'.    The height of the handrail
has been set to satisfy the requirements of BS5396 'Stairs'
and not the 'Green Guide'.    There is a slight difference in
the way in which the two documents set out the handrail heights.
    As you know, time is short and we have already sent the
same copies of these drawings to the Contractor for him to
order the materials.   We would therefore welcome the comments
of the Working Party as soon as possible.
                                  Yours sincerley,

 Dear Sir,

 Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 - The Spion Kop -
 Application for Increase in Crowd Capacity__________

 I refer to the meeting held at the stadium on 10th July about the above
 development and to Messrs. Eastwoods' letter of 26th June.

 Officers met          on 15th July to discuss the application in the light of new plans
 submitted by          Doctor Eastwood (which were received on 14th Ju l y ) . The following
 points arose          from the discussion:-

         (a)     No plan has been supplied showing the remainder of theexit  route
                 between the new construction at the north corner of the Kop and the
                 final gate on Penistone Road - this omission means that the capacity
                 of the escape route cannot be assessed;

         (b)     the plan 6648/54 does not show whether or not there will be any
                 handrails or other narrowing of the new escape route;



         (c)     reservations were expressed about the 8 minute rule (relating to the
                 evacuation time of the new terrace) and Officers are making
                 further enquiries into that issue with the benefit of
                 Doctor Eastwood's comments on 10th July.

 Please arrange to supply plans showing the details mentioned in items (a) and
 (b) above.                                               -----------------------

                        For telephone enquiries on this matter please ring    ..............   (STD Code 0742)
                                                  Telex 64243 (Administration & Legal)
  It seems to me that the Council will not be in a position to decide on the
  capacity issue much before the completion of works; I therefore propose to place
  the application before the appropriate Committee when the Kop is complete.  This
  arrangement will also give Officers a chance to assess the structure when it is
  fully operational.

1.    Welcome and Introduction

Mr. Vaughan pointed out that the Local Government Act, 1985, would abolish
the South Yorkshire County Council (and the other Metropolitan County Councils)
on 31st March, 1986.  From 1st April, 1986$ the Certificating Authority under
the Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975, would be the appropriate District
Council.  In the case of the Hillsborough Stadium this would naturally be
the Sheffield City Council.  For this reason, it had been suggested to the
City Council that appropriate representatives in addition to the Building
Surveyors' Division might find it useful to be present at the meeting, and
Mrs. L. Bashforth and Mr. J. Derricott were welcomed and introduced to the
remainder of the representatives present.

Mr. Vaughan took the opportunity of expressing appreciation and thanks to
the representatives for the help and assistance which they had given to him
in his role as Co-ordinator of the Officer Working Parties since 1978.   There
had obviously been occasions when differences of opinion and interpretation •
had occurred but, in the main, these had been resolved both amicably and
constructively.

For the Club, Dr. Eastwood thanked Mr. Vaughan for his services and wished
h i m well for th.e future. Other representatives endorsed Dr. Eastwoodrs
remarks.                       :

2.   Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was two-fold; firstly to discuss the further
details of development proposals at the stadium forwarded with the letter
dated 23rd December, 1985, from Messrs. Eastwood and Partners and, secondly,
to carry out the "winter" inspection of the Stadium.

A.   Development Proposals for the Spion Kop

The further details were in-addition to the comments set out in the letter
dated 29.th November, 1985, on the observations made following the Officer
Working Party meeting held on 13th November.
      (i)    Sheeting of Outer Face

      Dr. Eastwood reported that the sheeting of the enlarged Spion Kop at
      the rear and sides would result in the structure being virtually
      sealed.  In reply to queries from the County Fire Service, he confirmed
      that no storage would be allowed under the structure and that checks
      for any accumulations .of rubbish would be undertaken on a regular basis.

      (ii)   Climbing of t h e J n n e r Steel Frame

     ■ As regards the possiblity of unruly spectators climbing the inner steel
       frame of the new- structure, Dr. Eastwood reported that the bottom boom       jp
       member was n o w to be omitted. The resultant height of ove^.10 feet
       would make it very difficult far spectators to climb the structure.

      (iii) N e w Step and Barrier Layout

      Drawing No. 6648/56 was -circulated and considered.   This related to the
      new step and barrier layout on the Spion Kop, and Dr. Eastwood reported
      in particular on the discussions which he' had had with the Planning
      Authority as to the height of an intermediate or a low second rail to
      the barriers.where the drop to the gangway below could be over one metre
      in places.  He sought the Officer Working Party’s v i e w s K and the merits
      of the options were considered.                         -         -

      IT WAS AGREED that, in the view of the Officer Working Party, the best
      option for a second rail in the areas described was a low toe rail at
l     a height of some 200 mm.

B.   -Facilities for the Disabled

To illustrate that the figures originally quoted to provide facilities for the
disabled at the foot of the Spion Kop (nearest to the North Stand) were not
unrealistic, Dr. Eastwood reported on the breakdown of the tender figures
(opened on Monday) for the enlarged, roofed Spion Kop. He still considered
that any such proposals would involve the loss of up to'1,000 of the extra
5,000 spectator places which would be provided by the enlarged Spion Kop.
Other areas of the Stadium had also been considered and investigated, but
none could provide as large a flat, easily accessible area as that in front of
the North Stand, which had been successfully used for so long without any major
problems.  Up to 80 disabled persons, plus attendants, used the area.  The only
major drawback he saw was that when there was a strong southerly wind, rain
could be blown onto the disabled, despite the cantilever roof of the North
Stand extending virtually to the pitch.  For this reason, the Club were willing
to roof an area from approximately the letter "0" on the results board to the
end of the Stand (nearest to the Spion Kop) with a substantial roof, including
armoured glass where there might be a visibility problem, provided that this
was supported by the Officer Working Party.

Whilst accepting much of what Dr. Eastwood said, the Officer Working Party
(and the Police representatives in particular) still expressed some concern as
to whether making semi-permanent facilities for the disabled in front of the
North Stand was the appropriate and correct thing to do.

The Building Authority confirmed that, after further investigations, it was
considered that the disabled facilities requirements of the Building
Regulations 1985 did not appear to strictly apply to the roofing of the
enlarged Spion Kop.
              IT WAS AGREED that, in the first instance, Dr. Eastwood would prepare sketch
              plans of the suggested roofed disabled facilities in front of the North Stand
              for consideration by the Officer Working Party.


    ‘AA       C.    Ground Inspection
                    (i)   West Terrace and Stand

              The Police representatives confirmed that the revised segregation arrangements
              to the rear of the Stand worked well on by far the majority of occasions.

              Dr. Eastwood pointed out that the segregation rail in the upper seated area''
              of the stand could be moved within certain limits if the Police considered
              that this would achieve a useful purpose.

              IT WAS AGREED.—

              (a)   that the additional advertisement hoardings at the front of the upper
           J l (a
/             seated stand area (nearest to the North-West Terrace) should also be securely
            I se
     v»-      fixed to concrete wall;                        -

     Jt'    I (b)   that further areas-of spalled concrete at the front of the upper         ,
              seated stand area should received'attention as matters of maintenance.

                    (ii)   North-West Terrace

              IT WAS AGREED that the advertisement hoardings erected on the upper North-
              West Terrace should be securely fixed.

                    (iii) North Stand

              The area for the suggested covered disabled facilities was inspected.

              As previously-mentioned by Dr. Eastwood, the possibility of providing an
              increased width access to the pitch area (between the North Stand and the
              Spion Kop) for possible use by emergency vehicles, as well as for maintenance
              by the Club was discussed.  The facility could be incorporated into the
              enlarged Spion Kop proposals relatively easily.

              It WAS AGREED that, whilst the County Fire Service felt that such a facility
              was not essential for their purposes, it could be useful for use by emergency
              vehicles in certain situations and generally should be supported.

                    (iv)   Spion Kop

              Dr. Eastwood indicated the extent of the work to construct the enlarged,
              roofed, Spion Kop, and .confirmed that steps would be taken to prevent
              unauthorised access to areas where work might be in progress during the
              courselof fl&Tseason.
                                            ••          ■


              It w as noted that the additional gate in the pitch perimeter fence in the
              front corner .nearest to the South Stand, with a stepped arrangement cu
              assist access and egress, had been provided.

                    (v)    South Stand

              It was noted "that the metal sheeting of the wooden floor of the upper
              portion of tlie Stand (with sprayed non-slip surface) had proved to be of an
              acceptable appearance in use, and generally appeared to provide a compromise
              solution to the flammability problems inherent in such wooden structures.

              IT WAS AGREED that its condition would continue to be monitored.

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 - Inspections

As you requested the inspection of your Stadium which was to take place on
Tuesday 5th August has been rearranged for Thursday 7th August commencing at
9.30 a.m..

I would like to reassure you that I will make every effort to ensure that
inspections take place at times convenient for both Officers and the Club; you
will, however, be aware that the arranging of inspections involves a lot of
people and short-notice rearrangements may not always be possible.

I have sent a copy of this letter to Messrs. Eastwoods for th£®r information.

Yours faithfully

Dear Dick,
               Home Office Document on Fire Safety and
                       Safety at Sports Venues
         I have read through the part of the document which deals
with Sports Grounds.    I do not see any grounds for objecting to
any of the recommendations.    There will be little if any change in
the procedure already established at Hillsborough.      The document
envisages that far more grounds for various sports will be designated,
but in appropriate circumstances the procedures will not be so
onerous as those relating to Hillsborough.       However, as it is a
'top' ground we cannot expect that there will be much relaxation
compared with the present arrangements.
         There is a welcome statement on page 11 that due account
whould be taken of the need to keep the costs to clubs and local
authorities to reasonable proportions.     There are also various
references to Safety Certificates reflecting the circumstances of
each particular ground and the number of spectators who are likely
to attend (see page 14).    These words may be useful to us in the
future, although we can expect to have more stringent requirements
compared with some of the smaller clubs.
         It is comforting to know that the new Green Guide will not
become a statutory code, and will continue to be subject to
interpretation.
         The reference to prohibition notices by either the fire
authority or the local authority on page 19 may cause concern to
some clubs.   But in paragraph 2.38 on page 20 there is a clear
implication that it is only necessary to reduce the risk to
an acceptable level, rather than trying to remove all risk.   This
wording will help curb excessive demands, and may be Useful to
us sometimes in negotiations.
         I am returning the document herewith*


                          Yours sincerely,

FIRE SAFETY AND
   SAFETY AT
 SPORTS VENUES
~ C H A P T E R TWO

  FINAL REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF INQUIRY INTO CROWD SAFETY AND CONTROL AT SPORTS
  GROUNDS - RECOMMENDATIONS ON SAFETY

  2.1      A number of measures have already been taken under existing powers to
  secure greater safety at sports venues.      All remaining Association football
  grounds in the third and fourth divisions of the Football League with a
  spectator capacity of more than 10,000 were designated under the Safety of
  Sports Grounds Act 1975 (SSGA) in August 1985 as were the qualifying grounds of
  the first and second divisions of the Rugby League.      In addition, fire
  authorities and local safety teams have inspected a wide range of sports venues
  and, where necessary, have taken appropriate action to secure spectator safety.
  The Interim R ep o r t of the Inquiry into Crowd Safety and Control at Sports
  Grounds (Cmnd 9585) and the Final Report (Cmnd 9710) were drawn to the attention
  of local authorities, police and fire services and sports clubs and sporting
  authorities.     Specifically, fire authorities were requested to provide further
  information on sports stadia and grounds with at least one unit of covered
  a ccommodation for more than 500 .spectators and also on .indoor sports premises
  w i th total spectator accommodation for more than 500.    Local authorities are
  fully aware of the powers available to them under existing legislation to deal
  w i t h unreasonable risks to spectators at sports grounds.   The attention of
  certificating authorities, chief fire officers/firemasters and chief officers of
^0^>lice was drawn to the need for the training and instruction of stewards and
  for evacuation procedures.

  2.2   The Final Report made ten recommendations on safety at sports venues (see
  Annex E).  Of these recommendations 3, 5, 6 and 7 relate specifically to the
  Fire Precautions Act 1971 (FPA) while recommendations 1, 2, 4, 8 and 9 relate to
  specific provisions of the SSGA or possible amendments to it.  Recommendation 10
  is a matter for Building Regulations which are outside the scope of either Act.

   2.3    The following paragraphs deal with each of the Inquiry's safety
  recommendations in turn to outline a package of proposed changes.which interlock
   to provide an integrated system of safety controls at sports grounds wh i c h will
   be consistent with the changes to the FPA proposed in Chapter One of this
   consultative document.   So far as is compatible with the Government commitment
   to improve safety at sports venues due account is taken of the need to keep the
   c~05t3 Upon sports clubs, ground owners and~Iocal authorities to reasonable
  •proportions":                                                                           “ ~~
          — -------

  Recommendation 1
  "The distinction between sports grounds and sports stadia should be ab ol i s h ed ” .

  2.4   Section 17 of the SSGA defines a sports ground as "any place where sports
  or other competitive activities take place in the open air and where
  accommodation has been provided for spectators consisting of artificial
  structures or of natural structures artificially modified for the purpose".  The
  same section defines a sports stadium as "a sports ground where the
  accommodation provided for spectators wholly or substantially surrounds the area
  used for activities taking place on the ground".

  2.5   The principal mechanism of   control under the SSGA is the system of safety
  certification.  A safety certificate is issued by the appropriate local
  authority in respect of a sports stadium which has been designated by the
  Secretary of State under section   1(1) of the Act.

  2.6   Section 1(1) of the SSGA restricts the power todesignate  (andthereby  the
  main control mechanism) in two ways: first, it applies only to a stadium (as

                                            11
defined in tne a c g j ana aeyuuu mj             — _
opinion of the Secretary of State has accommodation for more than 10,000
spectators.

2.7   The SSGA also empowers the Secretary of State, under section 15 to
designate as requiring a safety certificate classes of sports ground which are
not also stadia.  Only classes of sports ground may be subject to such an order
individual sports grounds can be designated only after the provisions of the
SSGA are applied by order to the class of ground to which they belong.   The
limit of 10,000 spectators does not apply to this power but stadia under that
size may not receive the protection afforded by designation under the Act.

2.8   The Government accepts the Inquiry's conclusion that it is no longer
appropriate to draw such distinctions between stadia and sports grounds.
Although the original scheme of the SSGA had been influenced by the crowd
disaster at Ibrox Park in 1971 the Bradford fire demonstrated that hazards to
life existed in principle for spectator numbers much less than 10,000.   Indeed,
the Inquiry considered the minimum spectator numbers for special provision
should be as low as 500 in stands.  To implement the Inquiry's recommendation,
therefore, it is proposed to amend the SSGA so that the power to require a
safety certificate can apply to all outdoor sports venues with accommodation for
more than 10,000 spectators.  It is however proposed to include a provision to
enable the Secretary of State to vary the figure of 10,000 should circumstances
warrant it.  Provision would also be made to enable the statutory requirements
resulting from designation to be modified or adapted as might be considered
necessary.

2.9    Outdoor sports venues with overall spectator accommodation for 10,000 or
less but which have a stand capable of holding over 500 spectators would be
subject to a modified certification procedure applicable only to a stand (or
stands) capable of holding over 500.   For this purpose a stand would be defined
as a unit of accommodation for spectators, either sitting or standing or a
combination of both, which is covered in whole or in part by a roof.   This
modified procedure (which is explained in more detail in paragraphs 2.17 and
2.19 below) would also apply to any sports venue with overall spectator
a ccommodation for more than 10,000 which is not already subject to a safety
certificate for the whole ground if it included a stand capable of holding over
500 spectators.   Provision could also be made to enable the Secretary of State
to vary the figure of 500 spectators in a stand should the circumstances warrant
it.

Recommendation 2
There should be "Further designation under the SSGA 1975 of sports grounds and
sports stadia with accommodation for over 10,000 spectators where Association
Football, Rugby League, Rugby Union and cricket is played in England and Wales
and Scotland".

2.10  The Home Secretary announced on 16 January 1986 that designation of these
grounds and stadia would be brought about in England and Wales and that the
Secretary of State for Scotland would bring in similar designations for Scotian
in respect of Association Football grounds of clubs in the Scottish Football
League 1stand 2nd Divisions.  Consultations    have taken place with the
interested   parties with the aim of obtaining designation orders by the end of
the summer   1986.  (It is necessary to obtain an order under section 15 of the
SSGA before any individual grounds which are not also stadia can be designated,
see paragraph 2.7 above.)  The number of venues currently identified as being
affected by the Government's response to Recommendation 2 are as follows:
'England and Wales

Association Football                                28
Rugby Union Football                               17
Rugby League Football                               3
Cricket                                            _7
                              Total                55

Scotland

Association Football                                14

Recommendation 3
"All sports grounds and sports stadia not already designated under the SSGA and
hav i n g a capacity in a stand of over 500 spectators should be designated under
the FPA as requiring a fire certificate".

 2.11        Recommendation 2 of the Final Report envisaged that all sports grounds and
 stadia in England, Wales and Scotland where association football, rugby union,
 rugby league or cricket is played and where there is accommodation for more than
 10,000 spectators would be required to have safety certificates under the Act.
R ecommendation 3 is therefore concerned with spectator safety at those
B K d e s i g n a t e d stadia and grounds where sports other than association football,
 rugby union, rugby league and cricket take place and where there is spectator
 accommodation of more than 10,000 and also at undesignated stadia/grounds for
 any sports where there is spectator accommodation for less than 10,000 but with
 covered accommodation in a stand for more than 5 0 0 . It is based on the
 a ssumption that at these types of sporting venues the main risk to spectators is
 from fire in covered accommodation rather than structural failure as a result of
 crowd pressure or movement.            Consequently the Inquiry recommended that stands
 with covered accommodation for more than 500 spectators at these venues should
 be designated under the FPA as requiring a fire certificate.            Even so the
 Inquiry was concerned with the need to ensure structural safety.

 2.12  The provisions of the FPA apply only to "premises” , which are currently
 defined as "buildings or parts of bu i ldings” . They could therefore be applied
 to stands.  Designation under the FPA would, however, permit fire authorities to
 certificate the stands only in matters relating to fire safety; they would not
 be able to seek improvements to the structural safety of the stand.    Only a
 limited degree of safety would thus be provided and there are no reasons to
|^ssume that, in future, risks in stands will not arise from structural failure
or deficiency as well as from fire.

2.13  The Inquiry's Final Report (paragraphs 3.40 and 3.43 to 3*45) acknowledged
that, if it were possible under the SSGA to introduce some form of certification
for undesignated grounds and stadia, it would be logical to bring them under
that Act.  It pointed out that section 15 of the SSGA would permit this for
grounds but not for stadia.

2.14  The returns from local authorities and chief fire officers in response to
the Home Office request in January 1986 have indicated that in England and Wales
about 267 venues would be affected by Recommendation 3*  Of these, some 72
stadia and 100 grounds (approximately 64%) were assessed as being generally
satisfactory.  Although these figures may not be exhaustive, they are thought to
provide a reasonable assessment of the overall position.  The total figure
includes 16 stadia and 23 grounds (almost 15?) which were identified as having
spectator accommodation for over 10,000.  For Scotland the figures are 104
venues of which 31 stadia and 10 grounds (approximately 40%) were assessed as
being satisfactory.  The figures include 18 stadia and 6 grounds identified as
having spectator accommodation for over 10,000 and used for either rugby union


                                           13
or association football but which would not be designated as a result of the
G o v e r n m e n t ’s response set out in paragraph 2.10 above.

2.15  As indicated in paragraph 2.8 above it is proposed to amend the SSGA in
such a way as to make it possible to extend the scope of designation so that,
should the need arise, it would be possible for a more diverse range of premis
to be made subject to full safety certification.  But this is an exacting syst
designed to secure reasonable safety by reducing or eliminating risks associat
with potentially large numbers of spectators with restricted mobility in a
confined area such as a stadium.  It may not therefore always be appropriate t
apply a detailed system of this kind in all cases irrespective of the size and
configuration of a particular venue and the nature of the sports pursued there
This was acknowledged by the Inquiry (paragraph 3*21 of the Final Report).   It
is therefore right to consider the possibilities of establishing a different
safety control regime for sports venues which appear to pose a lesser degree o:
risk just as the modified proposals on fire precautions have sought to
distinguish between low, normal and high fire risks in premises.

Option 1

2.16  One approach would be to utilize the new powers of designation contained
in section 1 of the SSGA by extending designation as requiring a safety
certificate to all those venues with which Recommendation 3 is concerned.        This
would secure reasonable safety against the risks o f fire and non-fire hazards i        j
the same way as other designated venues which are already the   subject of safet
certificates.  Such an approach, however, goes well beyond what was specificall         I
recommended in the Final Report of the Inquiry, even though it might ensure             j
equal treatment of all outdoor venues where safety controls are considered
necessary.  On the other hand although safety certification may be an exacting
system it is also a flexible one glared to meeting the individual needs       of each
ground.  Safety certificates are s^lf-adjusting in that their terms and
conditions should reflect in each c|ase the circumstances of the particular
ground in question.  Where, for example, a large venue such as a motor racing
circuit or horse racing track (which might attract large crowds) consists
primarily of open ground except for the stand(s) and other accommodation around
the winning post, certification would concentrate on these stands and other
accommodation.  Open, natural spaces would probably require minimal attention.          |
The terms and conditions of safety certificates should also reflect work
required in relation to spectator ceilings, and a certificate should take
account of the number of spectators who w ill attend events at a v e n u e . The
complexity and associated cost of preparation of the certificate and of
compliance with it should accordingly decrease for smaller, sparsely attended
venues - more so since over 60% of venues in England and Wales (40%
for Scotland) were assessed by local authorities as generally satisfactory.

Option 2

2.17  An approach closer to Recommendation 3 of the Final Report, however, and
the one which in the Government's provisional view is better, would be to
provide in respect of those venues with which Recommendation 3 is concerned that
a safety certificate should be required only with respect to the stand or other
building with covered accommodation for over 500 spectators.  That is to say
that at such venues only the stand or stands or other building or buildings
which individually provide covered accommodation (either fully or in part) for
over 500 spectators would require safety certification.  Other parts of the
sports venue would not be subject to the certification process except in so far
as it was necessary to do so in order to secure reasonable safety within the
covered accommodation.  This approach would concentrate attention on that part
of sports venues (ie covered accommodation for over 500 spectators) identified
by the Inquiry as being most vulnerable.  At the same time certification and
compliance costs would be kept to a minimum.

                                          14
2.18 Unlike the full designation sys t em whereby individual venues are
designated by name, there would be an automatic requirement on owners/occupiers
of sports venues with an individual unit of covered accommodation for more than
500 spectators to apply to the certificating authority for a safety certificate
for stands able to accommodate over 500 spectators.    Those stand(s) would
thereafter be inspected and a safety certificate containing terms and conditions
in respect of them would be issued.

2.19  It is recognised that in operating such a system care would be needed
where exit routes from a stand are part of a larger exit system from a venue.
Despite this difficulty Option 2 would, if adopted, fulfil the Inquiry's
objectives of achieving by means of a certification system not only fire safety
but also structural safety within units of covered or partly covered
accommodation capable of holding over 500 spectators.  In addition, as a
consequence of the requirement for owners/occupiers of venues with which
Recommendation 3 is concerned to apply for a safety-certificate, authorities
would build upon their existing knowledge of and about outdoor sports venues
within their areas in line with Recommendation 17 of the Interim Report
(Registration of Sports Venues).

 2.20  Consideration has been given to the idea that the local authority could
^exempt from safety certification those stands falling within certain criteria;
 for example, where the stand capacity was below a certain level and the
 building, on inspection, was considered structurally safe and not of timber
 construction built in accordance with or to the standard of national building
 regulations.  Owners of premises containing a stand which was then exempted
 could be made subject to a minimum statutory duty along similar lines to that
 proposed in paragraph 1.13 for the FPA.  But, unlike the premises affected by
 the FPA, the total number of sports venues with which Recommendation 3 is
 concerned is relatively small (see paragraph 2.14 above), exemptions would be
 still fewer and any consequential resource savings, given the likely input
 necessary in all cases, seem unlikely to be substantial or significant.

2.21    For convenience the effects of proposals outlined in paragraphs 2.4 to
2.19   are summarised in the following table:

1.     All sports venues with                  To be designatable as
accommodation for more than 10,000             requiring a full safety

                                                 (the Green Guide).

The Green Guide

2.22 The Final Report included in its Appendix E a report of a working group
which under the chairmanship of the Inquiry's Fire Assessor had reviewed the
current-Home Office Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds ("the Green Guide").   A
new edition of the Green Guide is being prepared in accordance with the
principles recommended by the working group.   It will be drawn up in
consultation with Government Departments, local authorities, sporting
authorities and other interested organisations.   In line with the Inquiry's view
that the Guide should not form a statutory code,- it is not intended to change
the present status of the Guide.

Temporary Stands and Marquees

2.23  The Final Report (paragraphs 3.94 to 3.96) referred to the fact that the
Home Office is preparing a Guide to Fire Precautions in Places of Public
Entertainment which will include a chapter on fire precautions in temporary
structures including tents and marquees.  The draft guidance will shortly be the
subject of consultation with Government Departments and other interested bodies
including the British Standards Institution prior to publication.

Recommendation 4
"One authority should be given responsibility for securing structural safety at
sport3 grounds and stadia not designated under the 1975 Act".

2.24  This recommendation follows from the I n q u i r y ’s recommended course of
action on Recommendation 3 in that the Inquiry recognised that designation under
the FPA would be limited in its scope to fire matters only.         Either of the
options put forward in paragraphs 2 . 1 6 to 2.21 above would deal with both fire
and non-fire risks.  The appropriate "enforcing" authority for sports grounds
safety under each would be the local authority which is also responsible for the
issue of safety certificates.  There should be no conflict with enforcement of
the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 (HSWA).         It is recognised that proper
liaison between enforcing authorities under the HSWA and local authorities or
fire authorities is essential (Recommendation 9 of the I n q u i r y ’s Interim Report]
because officers acting under the HSWA might have cause to visit a sports
ground.  HSE completed an internal review of the liaison arrangements towards
the end of 1985 and have discussed with the Home Office issuing revised internal
guidance on liaison with both fire and local authorities.         Liaison on fire
safety matters has been finalised; the other issues are still to be the subject
of further consultation.

Recommendation 5
"In England a n d Wa l e s indoor sports facilities with accommodation for over 500
spectators shou l d require a fire certificate under the FPA".

2.25  The Government have accepted the principle that safety controls should be
extended to indoor sports facilities providing accommodation for spectators.   A
the Inquiry noted, the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982"
already provides for the licensing by district councils of public entertainment
in indoor premises, including any public contest, exhibition or display of
boxing, wrestling, judo, karate or any similar sport.  Similar provisions appi\
in London under the London Government Act 1963, although these do not extend tc
judo, karate and similar sports.  The 1982 Act requires the licensing authority
  iXi considering applications for licences to have regard to any observations
  submitted to them by the chief officer of police and by the fire authority.
  Under both Acts the licensing authority can impose conditions for a number of
  purposes, including safety.

  2.26  The Inquiry noted that in England and Wales over 80$ of indoor sports
  premises with spectator capacity of more than 1,000 are licensed under the 1982
  Act or the equivalent London legislation, because one or more of the activities
  which take place in them requires licensing.  The Inquiry also noted that of the
  remaining premises with capacity of over 1,000 more than half were subject to
  liquor licensing or other legislation which required fire safety to be taken
  into account in considering whether to issue a licence.  However, the I n q u i r y ’s
  concern was that these and other premises in which sports activities outside the
  scope of licensing legislation were held, are not subject to any controls over
  fire safety while these events are taking place.  The Inquiry pointed out that
  in 1983 there were around 200 fires in indoor sports premises with or without
  any spectator capacity , and concluded that such premises presented a fire risk
  and should be controlled for fire safety purposes at all times when spectator
  sports activities are being held.  However, the Inquiry found no evidence of
  problems relating to crowd control or structural safety at such premises.      They
  noted that if the entertainment licensing legislation were to be amended this
  would enable the necessary control to be exercised over fire safety, but
  recommended that unless and until that happened, the premises should be required
  to be certificated under the FPA.
  ►

  2.27 The Government has carefully considered whether the deficiency highlighted
  by the Inquiry can best be dealt with under fire precautions legislation (taking
  account of the proposals in Chapter One of this document) or in some other way.
  It is not at present persuaded that certification under the FPA, as recommended
  by the Inquiry, would be the best way forward.  The extensive work involved in
  preparing a fire certificate for each indoor sports venue used for spectator
  sporting events, describing in detail the means of escape and other fire safety
  requirements, would not seem to be justified bearing in mind that many of the
  premises are only used on an occasional basis for such events.  The modified
  fire precautions proposals set out in Chapter One envisage fire authorities
  being given power to exempt certain low risk premises from the requirement to
  have a certificate, but this does not seem to be an appropriate arrangement for
  controlling fire safety at spectator sporting events which could not generally
  be regarded as low risk, and where it would be necessary to be able to exercise
  some degree of control over fire safety matters other than just means of escape
  and fire fighting equipment.  Moreover, by using fire precautions legislation it
  would not be possible to regulate any other safety matters.

^2.28    As indicated by the Inquiry, the other possibility is to extend the Local
  Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982 and the London Government Act
  1963 so that the entertainments licensing provisions of those Acts apply to all
  indoor public contests, exhibitions or displays of sporting activities where
  accommodation for more than 500 spectators is provided.   Recent enquiries have
  identified 422 such premises in England and Wales, of which 360 (8555) are
  already licensed under the 1963 or 1982 Acts for one or more activities.
  Although these figures may not be exhaustive, particularly in the Greater London
  area, they are thought to represent a reasonably comprehensive picture.    329 of
  the premises are owned by local authorities; and in 148 of them the only
  spectator sporting events are those already licensed, such as boxing and
  wrestling which would not be affected by any changes.   Extending the legislation
  to other sporting activities would mean that 62 premises would become subject to
  a licensing requirement for the first time, and the licences of another 212
  premises would need to be extended to cover other sporting events taking place
  there.   In the latter case the owner or manager of the premises would be able to
  make a single application under the licensing legislation covering all such

                                            17
events, so the change in the law would not involve him in any new procedural
requirements (unlike the effect of the proposal to certificate under the FPA).
Nevertheless, extending the legislation to other sporting events would be bound
to add to the functions of the licensing authorities and, in certain cases, to
the costs of indoor sporting premises.

2.29 The main argument against extending the Local Government (Miscellaneous
Provisions) Act 1982 and the corresponding London legislation to indoor sports
premises is that the Acts are aimed at regulating more than just fire safety.
Thus, notice of an application has to be given to the local police as well as
the fir*e authority and the licensing authority.                      The licensing authority is alsc
free to impose any condition it thinks fit when granting an application.                       So
although it would be procedurally simpler to extend the scope of the licensing
legislation owners of sport premises could find that, as a result, they became
subject to a wider range of conditions than the Popplewell Inquiry specifically
recommended or than the Government thinks is needed.                       For instance, conditions
could be imposed relating to the times when events can be held, and the control
of spectators, noise limits and heating arrangements.                       Premises which stage
sporting events which need to be licensed under the existing provisions are
already subject to these wider requirements, but there is no-evidence that othei
sports events need similar controls.               There may nevertheless be some merit in
bringing all public sports events under the same regulatory regime.                       In this
context it is for consideration whether any new licensing requirement should
depend on a m i nimum number of spectators since there is no such threshold for
activities currently licensed.             The G o v e r n m e n t ’s provisional view however, is
that in practice this will not be a critical factor because there are unlikely
to be many additional premises where accommodation is provided for 500
spectators or less for a public contest, exhibition or display.                       In addition th
best way of avoiding anomalies between, on the one hand, those events already
controlled and brought into the new scheme and, on the other hand, those alread
controlled but left outside, would be to continue to observe the present
l e g i s l a t i o n ’s silence on spectator numbers.

2.30  The Government's provisional conclusion is that despite the drawbacks the
best course is probably to extend the licensing legislation.   It does not have
any proposals for extending the 1963 or 1982 Acts to recreational activities
which are not public sporting events.  It should be noted that these proposals
envisage that a licence would be mandatory: in view of the Inquiry's
recommendation it is not considered that it would be satisfactory to give loca]
authorities discretion as to whether or not to require a licence.   The
Government would particularly welcome comments from local authorities and owner
of sports premises on the practical implications of these proposals.

R ecommendation 6
"An urgent revi e w of the existing legislation on indoor sports facilities in
Scotland should be undertaken and if they are not currently covered by fire
regulations such facilties should be designated under the FPA"

2.31  It is clear that there is no comprehensive cover of indoor sports
facilities in Scotland by legislation designed to ensure fire safety.   Such
facilities have not hitherto been designated under the FPA.  Moreover, while i-
is true that Building Regulations and licensing of public entertainment under
the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 either separately or together provide
some protection of spectators, that cover is patchy.  This is because the
Building Regulations bear on newer and altered premises only, and the licensin
arrangements bite only where the local authority has resolved to require the
obtaining of a licence.




                                                 18
    2.32  The Government takes the view that, to be consistent with its other
    provisional proposals to meet the recommendations of the Inquiry, it would
    appear to be appropriate to deal with safety in general, rather them with fire
    safety alone.  This could be done by bringing forward legislation which would
    secure comprehensive safety cover for spectators through the introduction of
    licensing arrangements in respect of public exhibitions of sporting activities
    in indoor facilities.  Such arrangements would be able to cover fire and
    structural safety as well as crowd control and other matters.  Licensing of this
    nature would produce a degree of flexibility which would allow local authorities
    to deal with applications in a way that best met local needs.

    2.33  These new arrangements could be achieved by amending the Civic Government
    (Scotland) Act 1982 so as to.create a system of mandatory licensing to cover the
    use of indoor premises for public exhibitions of sporting activities.  Anyone
    promoting such public exhibitions would be required to apply for a licence to
    the islands or district council.  The licensing authority would deal with that
    application in much the same way as do those authorities who currently exercise
    licensing functions under section 41 of the 1982 Act.  That is to say the
    provisions set out in Schedule 1 of the 1982 Act would be attracted, including
    those involving consultations with the chief constable and fire authority.
    Steps would, of course, be taken to eliminate any potential overlap between
    section 41 and the new legislation (for example, licensing this activity would
    no longer be optional for the authorities).  The powers given to licensing
    authorities would include powers to restrict use, to limit the number of
    spectators and to fix times.

    2.34  These new licensing arrangements could apply to the use of all such
    premises or, in order not to penalise smaller operators, could be restricted to
    premises with spectator accommodation above a certain limit.        The figure of 500
    was mentioned by the Inquiry in connection with Recommendation 5.        Another
    possible figure is that of 60 occupants, one of the criteria in the Building
    Regulations for requiring additional mean's of e g r e s s . The Secretary of State
    could be given a power to vary the number, so that if circumstances altered or
    if the operation of the legislation demonstrated that a different threshold was
    appropriate, this could be achieved without recourse to primary legislation.
    Any use of premises for public entertainment not covered by the proposed
    legislation but involving spectators would, of course, continue to be licensable
    at the will of the local authority in terms of section 41.

    2.35  The Government would welcome views on these provisional proposals.  In
    particular it would be glad to have comments from local authorities and other

•   interested parties as to whether there should be a threshold for application of
    mandatory licensing, and if so what that figure should be.

    Recommendation 7
|   "Provision should be made in the FPA 1971 for authorised officers of a fire
|   au t hority to have power to issue a prohibition n o t i c e " .

    Recommendation 8
|   "Provision should be made for authorised officers of the local authority to have
I   power to issue a prohibition notice under the SSGA 1975".

    2.36  The two recommendations run together.  The Home Departments accept the
    desirability of removing any barriers which impede the swift introduction of
    urgent safety measures needed to combat acute risks to spectators.  It is
    therefore proposed to change the procedure under the current section 10of the
    SSGA along similar lines to the proposals for the current section 10 of the FPA
    (see paragraph 1.25(b)).




                                             19
2.37  For grounds designated under the SSGA the general safety certificate can
be amended to take account of changed circumstances; terms and conditions can be
framed so as to cover more than one activity and special conditions can be
incorporated to deal with especially large crowds.  A special safety certificate
is issued for "one off"   events not covered by the  terms of a general safety
certificate.  Thus, the  safety certificate is seen as the main mechanism to
govern safety at designated grounds.

2.38  Even so, where a serious risk to spectators    is identified there should be
additional machinery to  reduce it.  A prohibition   notice would achieve this as
necessary eg by requiring certain works or by closing down part of a ground with
effect from a date stipulated by the local authority.   The nature of the risk
and the work needed to reduce it to an acceptable level in order to allow the
affected area to be used to accommodate a specified number of spectators would
be stated in the notice.

2.39  There would need to be a right of appeal against such a notice either to
the courts (in line with the parallel procedures proposed for the FPA) or
alternatively to the Secretary of State as is the case at present under the SSGA
in respect of appeals against terms, or conditions contained within a safety
certificate.   There seems in fact no reason why appeals should be along
different avenues in respect of virtually identical procedures.   It would
therefore seem sensible to align appeals according to a single model.    On the
basis that in principle any disputes related to fact and expert opinion are best
adjudicated by the courts, the Government considers that the FPA model should be
preferred.   Appeals under the present SSGA procedures have been few and the fact
that there has now accumulated a good deal of experience in operating the SSGA
suggests the special administrative procedure devised for what was originally a
wholly novel system of control is no longer appropriate.   It will be essential
to ensure that grounds for appeal either against prohibition notices or against
terms or conditions within a safety certificate are justiciable by the courts.

Recommendation 9
"There should be (1) annual renewal of safety certificates under the SSGA 1975;
(2) a duty on the local authority to inspect the premises prior to reissuing the
certificate and (3) power for the local authority to revoke the certificate".

.2.40  Under the present certification system the local authority can be flexible
 in that it can permit remedial work to be carried out in stages or within set
 time limits by regulating the number of spectators permitted into the stadium,
 or parts of it, to match the conditions which exist within the stadium.
 Certificates also provide for periodic checks, tests or inspections to be
 carried out by suitably qualified personnel and for records of these to be kept.
 The frequency of these inspections is at the discretion of the local authority
 who can call on the reports of those inspections to consider whether or not a
 safety certificate requires amendment as a result of a deterioration of the
 venue or any part of it.  Annual renewal of certificates is not therefore
 necessary to ensure that standards of safety are maintained.  Annual renewal of
 certificates as recommended would, however, force local authorities into issuing
 certificates quickly, because on expiry of a certificate the conditions it
 imposed would expire with it.  Amended legislation would therefore be necessary
 to implement the recommendation to provide either:

      (a)   that it became an offence to admit spectators to designated venues
            not possessing a current certificate, or_

      (b)   that previous certificate conditions continue to apply after expiry
            and until a replacement certificate is issued.



                                        20
In the latter case, (b), no improvement would be achieved over the present
safety system under which a local authority has power to amend a safety
certificate at any time by imposing new conditions or vary existing ones should
changed circumstances in a stadium warrant it.  In the former case, (a),
legislation would also need to specify a period of time in which local
authorities would have to reissue certificates.  This would, again, add to the
pressure on local authorities to issue a certificate quickly since the effect of
closing down a stadium completely could impose intolerable and unjustifiable
financial burdens on its management.

2.41  Annually issued certificates could also give rise to repeated appeals
against terms or conditions which stadium management found difficult to accept,
thereby reducing the effectiveness of the certificate (pending appeal the
condition which is appealed against is not operative) as well as leading to
substantial additional resource implications on both local and central
government.  A yearly certificate might lead to stadium management becoming less
cooperative in that they might perceive the prime .responsibility to secure
reasonable safety as having passed from them to the local authority.

2.42  A full inspection of a stadium for the purpose of drawing up a safety
certificate involves local authority, fire authority and police resources.  Such
detailed multi-discplinary inspections and surveys may not warrant repetition
each year.  "In use" inspections, though probably less detailed, are likely to
represent a more efficient use of resources commensurate with the nature of the
risks involved, and are in most cases probably equally effective.  Fire
certificates issued under the FPA are not renewed annually and the system
appears to have worked well.  There are no proposals to make fire certification
an annual process.

2.43  In the circumstances described above it would seem that powers to revoke
certificates would be superfluous; if the situation in a certificated stadium
were to deteriorate to the extent that there was a risk to safety, the local
authority would amend the conditions in the certificate to meet the risk, which
could include prohibitions or restrictions on use.  Alternatively, if the risks
were sufficiently acute, the local authority would be able to use the power
proposed above to issue a prohibition notice in respect of those part(s) of the
ground which were deemed to be unsafe for spectators.  Powers to revoke the
certificate would be less than helpful since, in the absence of provisions to
prevent it, a stadium whose certificate was revoked would simply apply for
another certificate and, in the intervening period until the stadium had been
inspected and new conditions imposed, would be entitled to continue business
without regard even to safety conditions imposed by the original certificate.

2.44  While, therefore, for the reasons stated in paragraphs 2.40 to 2.43 above
the implementation of Recommendation 9 as it stands would have some serious and
unwelcome consequences, the basic objective of having sports stadia regularly
inspected and conditions in certificates kept up to date is fully accepted.   It
is clearly right that local authorities should regularly inspect designated
grounds following the issue of the certificate.  Any variations or amendments to
certificates required as a result of inspections should be communicated to
management without delay and the certificate amended accordingly.  This would
achieve the desired objectives without excessive resource costs and avoid
placing unreasonable financial burdens on management by unnecessary over­
elaboration.

2.45  It is therefore proposed to amend the SSGA to impose a duty on local
authorities to draw up and carry out inspections and reinspections of grounds
and stadia.  As in paragraph 1.23 in relation to inspections by fire
authorities, the frequency and nature of inspections of particular venues under
the SSGA would be for local authorities to determine having regard to the local
Jcircumstances, but provision would be made for the minimum frequency for
'different types, of inspection. This provision would be drawn up in consultation
 with the local authority associations.  Supplementary guidance would also, if
 necessary, be issued on inspections of venues which would not be subject to
 safety certification under the SSGA.

Recommendation 10

"The Department of the Environment should urgently amend the building
regulations guideline codes in relation to structural fire precautions in new
stands"

2.46  The new building regulations which came into force on 11 November 1985
require buidings (which include covered sports stands) to be built so that the
structure adequately resists the spread of fire and maintains its stability in
fire for a reasonable period.  The purpose behind the requirements is that, if
there is a fire, the building should remain safe for long enough for anyone in
it to be able to escape, and that escape routes should be adequately protected
from fire.  The Building Regulations 1985 therefore, in paragraphs B2 and B3 of
Schedule 1 to the regulations, provide adequate powers to control the
construction of new stands.

2.47 The new regulations are supported by approved documents which give           i
guidance on how to meet the requirements.  If the recommendations for structural ;
fire precautions are followed, they will ensure that the great majority of new
stands will be built to high standards of safety.   The Final Report, however,
points to one area where the guidance is lacking.   Most new stands will be two
storey buildings, because the area under the rake of the seats is normally used
for offices, changing rooms etc.  In these cases the guidance for buildings of
more than one storey recommends measures which would protect the seating area
from the danger of fire spread below the floor.   For single storey buildings the
standards are less demanding because the risk of fire spreading from beneath the
floor is normally remote.  The Bradford stand however was a single storey
building because it was built over a sloping bank.   The Government agree that
the guidance on the interpretation of the regulations should be extended to
cover this kind of building.

2.48 The technical requirement of the regulations as a whole including those
for fire safety are being reviewed as part of the Government's comprehensive
overhaul of the building regulations.  The issues raised by the Bradford Fire
will be included in this review.

2.49  Action cannot wait on the review however.  In the intervening period, so
as to ensure that adequate structural fire precautions are taken in the event of
a new single storey stand being constructed, the Department o f the Environment
will issue interim guidance on the need for concealed space in the floor of
stands to be sealed and sub-divided where this is necessary to inhibit the
spread of fire within the stand.
SUMMARY OF MAIN CONCLUSIONS

Fire precautions

1.    Certification should be retained for normal and high risk premises.

2.   Provision should be made for designation orders to confer a power on fire
authorities to exempt premises in specified categories from the requirement to
have a fire certificate.

3.    National guidance will be drawn up, in consultation with fire service
interests, on the factors which might be taken into account in determining
whether particular premises constituted a low risk and could be exempted from
certification.

4.   Provision should be made for fire authorities to be notified of material
changes in premises which they have exempted from certification, and for the
exemption to be cancelled when this was appropriate.

5.    Provision should be made for owners/occupiers of premises exempted from
certification, either by the designation order or by the fire authority, to be
required to provide and maintain reasonable means of escape and fire fighting
equipment.

6.    Failure to comply with this statutory duty would be an offence.

7.    A code of practice should be drawn up in consultation with relevant
interests setting out how the statutory duty could be met in particular
circumstances.   Compliance with the code, in appropriate circumstances, would be
deemed to satisfy the duty but it would be open to owners/occupiers to meet the
duty in other ways provided the standard achieved was at least equivalent.

8.    The primary formal means of remedying deficiencies in meeting the
statutory duty would be the serving of improvement notices, which.would be
subject to appeal to the magistrates' court (or the sheriff in Scotland).

9.     Premises liable to certification should be required to provide for
existing exits to be kept unlocked, existing means of escape to be available for
use and staff to be aware of the routine to be followed in the case of fire,
until the premises are either certificated or granted an exemption.

10.   A statutory duty should be placed on fire authorities to carry out
inspections and reinspections of premises put to a designated use.

11.   When a redeployment of resources has been achieved as a result of the
modified proposals, further consideration      should      be given to the extent to   whi
designations of any new occupancies      could be contemplated within existing
resources.

12.   Section 10 of the FPA should be replaced by a system of prohibition and
restriction notices issued by the fire authority and subject to appeal to the
magistrates' court or the sheriff.

13*   The exemption preventing fire certificates being required for places   of
worship should be removed, altho u gh there are no plans to designate such
premises at present.
14.   Provision should be made for fire authorities to be able, where
appropriate, to require sprinklers or other automatic extinguishing systems as a
condition of issuing a fire certificate, but this power would not be brought
into effect unless and until such systems have reached the stage where they are
acceptable in a life safety context, and could be regarded as an alternative to ;
traditional structural fire precautions.

15.   No change should be made in the arrangements for regulating fire safety in
multi-use buildings.

16.   The definition of premises should be revised to include open spaces
adjacent to buildings which could affect the means of escape.  Further
consideration will be given to the provision of a power to enable adequate
standards of fire safety to be secured, as appropriate, in open spaces which
constitute places of work.                                                 j

17.   Fire authorities should be given the specific right, where appropriate, t o ’
disclose information to other health and safety at work enforcing authorities,
but fire inspectors will not be required to pass information to employees or
safety representatives.

18.   Provision should be made for fire authorities to charge for the issue and
amendment of fire certificates.

S a fe ty a t Sport3 Venues

19.   The Secretary of State should have power to designate all outdoor venues
which have spectator accommodation for over 10,000.  There should be power to
vary this figure.

20.   The Secretary of State should have power to vary the statutory
requirements of certification following designation.

21.    All sports stadia and sports grounds in England and Wales with spectator
a ccommodation for over 10,000 used for association football, rugby league
football, rugby union football and cricket are to be designated as requiring a
safety certificate under the existing provisions of the SSGA.   All such grounds
of association football clubs in the Scottish Football League are also to be
designated.

22.   Provision should be made to require all outdoor sports venues not
designated as requiring a -safety certificate to have a safety certificate for
any unit of covered accommodation which is capable of holding over 500
spectators and the Secretary of State should have power to vary the figure of
500.

23.   The appropriate legislation on licensing of indoor premises should be
amended so as to require indoor premises used for public displays of sporting
events to obtain a licence for those events.

24.   Section 10 of the SSGA should be replaced by a system of prohibition and
restriction notices issued by the local authority and for appeals against such
notices to lie with the courts.

25.   Appeals against terms and conditions contained within safety certificates •
should lie w i th the courts.

26.   A statutory duty should be placed on local authorities to draw up and         j
carry out inspections of sports venues subject to certification.                    j
27.   A revised 'Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds* which will remain a
voluntary guide should be published as soon as possible.

28.   Guidance on fire safety in temporary stands and marquees should be
published as soon as possible.

29.   Interim guidance is to be issued on structural fire precautions for new
single storey stands.

For the attention of Mr, R. Chester


Dear Dick,

                              Public Address System


          Dr. E a s tw ood pa sse dm e your letter dated 4 June, which
arrived whilst I was on holiday, about the emergency power
supply to the public address system.
          It was intended to include the work in the tender for the
main electrical work but we did not receive the information we
required from D.P. Sounds Ltd., until 23 May.           I did not want to
delay the main electrical tender just for the sake of one small
part, which does not really have a bearing on the Spion Kop work.
          However, I believe that we now have all the information
and I will ask Bownes & Go. Ltd., who will be doing the main
electrical work, as well as say a couple of other firms to price
the work with a view to having it complete before the start of

Dear Dick,
                         Ground Safety
       Thank you for your letter of 21 April enclosing a copy
of the communication from Peter J. Kirby.      You will probably
know that there are several of these quick acting bolt devices
on the market.     We have inspected some of them and have not
yet been convinced that any of them are foolproof and good
value for money.      The South Yorkshire Fire Service have
also been keeping their ears to the ground and share our view.
       The one which is proposed by Mr. Kirby sounds to me
to be possibly dangerous.     Firstly, the gate is hinged about
its bottom edge and falls forward on to the pitch surround
when the explosive bolt is released.      It has to be kept in mind
that police walk past the gates and clearly there could be a
risk of injury.      It is also undesirable that the crowd should
have to walk out over the top of the gate which would be lying
on the ground.
       The arrangement is also likely to be very expensive as
it would be necessary to buy completely new gates and fit them
in the safety fence.     There will also be the cost of wiring
all the gates back to the central control point.
       It seems the device is unlikely to be attractive but if
you are sent further details in due course, we can look into
it further.


                             Yours sincerely,
                                 Sheffield

Dear Sir,

      I write to draw your attention to a recen t innovation in the field of
crowd/ground safety.

      This entirely new item of equipment will shortly becom e com m ercially available
and available for demonstration at chosen venues around the country.

       The item is described below but o f course it must be seen to fully appreciate its
potential.

       THE IDEA; to allow instant eg re ss/a c cess from a fenced incrowd area        of a
stadium in case of fire or disturbance-onto the playing area for safety.

       THIS MEANS; a set of fence posts which are hinged at ground level and held in
the upright position by an explosive bolt rated at 5 - 10 tons.

       These posts fit into existing fence structures or may be erected as part o f a new
fencing system . The existing fencing is used when the new posts are installed. The posts
are installed in two's (or more) thereby making a gate in the fence operated selectively,
by crowd/ground section.

        Although the posts are operated by 'explosive bolts' the bolts are absolutely safe
i.e. they do not shatter and are contained within the hollow m etal fence posts.

       They are operated by selected ground/safety personnel when circum stances
warranting their need prevail. A low voltage visual control box is used for this purpose,
with numerous sa fety devices built in.

       I am sure you will agree that this idea will revolutionize crow d/safety and to that
end I ask that you consider the idea seriously and correspond showing your interest or
otherwise with a view to attending a demonstration in your part of the country.

      The cost of this/th ese item(s) is not y e t available, but if sufficient interest is
shown a price would also be available shortly.

       This invention is covered by patent pending number /8602209.


                                        Yours faithfully,

Dear Dick,
                       Chloride Systems Ltd.
     Thank you for your letter of 20 March enclosing a copy
of Chloride’s proposed inspection and maintenance agreement.
I do not recommend that you enter into this agreement, at least
for the time being.     We shall be connecting a slightly greater
load to the emergency lighting system as part of the roofing
scheme over the Kop.      I think it likely the Fire Service
will wish to carry out an inspection.     There is a good possibility
that the batteries will continue to function adequately, but
there is also a possibility that the lighting level will not be
maintained for the one hour which the licensing authority
agreed to as a concession (British Standard clause for 3 hours).
Should this happen then a generator will have to be installed.
     An emergency generator will be cheaper and less worrying
in the logg term than a battery system.
     We were not impressed by Chloride's attitude when they
carryied out their inspection a few months ago.      You will
recall that we carried out a test on the effectiveness of the
lighting and it was still satisfactory even though they had made
it appear to their report that certain cells were now at the end
of their useful life.
                                               Yours sincerely,

            INSPECTION AND MAINTENANCE AGREEMENTS     •



            Over the years changes in legislation and licensing requirements
            has increased the emphasis on the need for inspection and maintenance.
            Our Service Agreements have kept abreast of the changing requirements
            and we now have a more extensive work schedule incorporated.
            We have also taken the opportunity of updating our standard Terms and
            Conditions.

            Of far greater significance, we have introduced a completely new
            Comprehensive Service which has all the benefits of the Maintenance
            Agreement plus a parts and labour warranty to cover breakdowns and
            battery replacements at a price reflecting life obtained.

            The cost of our enhanced Inspection and Maintenance Agreements for the
            financial year 1986/7 has increased at a rate marginally less than
            the current inflation rate demonstrating once again that we have been
            able to absorb some increased costs.

            To take advantage of the Comprehensive Service just sign and return
            the Agreement documents alternatively your signature on the ordinary
            Agreement document will confirm the current details correct.

             Dear Sir .

             SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975: LOCAL GOVERNMENT                         REORGANISATION

              1.   The purpose of this letter is to inform you of the effects on
              of Sports Grounds Act 1975 (SSGA) of Local Government reorganisation
     5       Metropolitan counties and Greater London brought about by the Local
             Act 1985.

 ■           2.    With effect.yfrom 1 April 1986 responsibility for administering
              1975 will, in the Metropolitan counties and Greater Lo nd o n , transfe~
              appropriate Metropolitan District Council (MDC) or London Borough
              authorities). They will be responsible for, among other things, the issue of
■/       A    and amendments to safety certificates. A consequential effect of Local
             reorganisation is that the current ■'certificating .authorities in. the '*
              counties and ..Greater London are not in the meantime empowered to issue....or
              safety certificates for any period commencing on or after 1 April 1‘
     '        certificates or amendments will fall to be issued by the successor
              It is therefore in the interests of applicants in these areas to ensure that
              applications for special safety certificates, or amendments to existing certificates,
             which are to come into effect on or after 1 April 1986 are copied to the appropriate
              successor authority who should be kept informed of developments and
              so as to be in a position to assume responsibility for the case in question
              with the minimum of delay and inconvenience.

                                                                             Yours faithfully

        Note of a Meeting held at the Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield

                             (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)'

1.    Welcome and Introduction

Mr. Vaughan pointed out that the Local Government Act, 1985, would abolish
the South Yorkshire County Council (and the other Metropolitan County Councils)
on 31st March, 1986.  From 1st April, 1986, the Certificating Authority under —
the Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975, would be the appropriate District
Council.  In the case of the Hillsborough Stadium this would naturally be
the Sheffield City Council.  For this reason, it had been suggested to the
City Council that appropriate representatives in addition to the Building
Surveyors' Division might find it useful to be present at the meeting, and
Mrs. L. Bashforth and Mr. J. Derricott were welcomed and introduced to the
remainder of the representatives present.

Mr. Vaughan took the opportunity of expressing appreciation and thanks to
the representatives for the help and assistance which they had given to him
in his role as Co-ordinator of the Officer Working Parties since 1978.   There
had obviously been occasions when differences of opinion and interpretation
had occurred but, in the main, these had been resolved both amicably and
constructively.

For the Club, Dr. Eastwood thanked Mr. Vaughan for his services and wished
hi m well for the future. Other representatives endorsed Dr. Eastwood's
remarks.

2.    Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was two-fold; firstly to discuss the further
details of development proposals at the stadium forwarded with the letter
dated 23rd December, 1985, from Messrs. Eastwood and Partners and, secondly,
to carry out the "winter" inspection of the Stadium.

      Development Proposals for the Spion Kop

The further details were in addition to the comments set out in the letter
dated 29.th November, 1985, on the observations made following the Officer
Working Party meeting held on 13th November.
      (i)    Sheeting of Outer Face

      Dr. Eastwood reported that the sheeting of the enlarged Spion Kop at
      the rear and sides would result in the structure being virtually
      sealed.  In reply to queries from the County Fire Service, he confirmed
      that no storage would be allowed under the structure and that checks
      for any accumulations of rubbish would be undertaken on a regular basis.

      (ii)   Climbing of the-Inner Steel Frame

    ' As regards the possiblity of unruly spectators climbing the inner steel
      frame of thfe n ew structure, Dr. Eastwood reported that the bottom boom
      member was n o w to be omitted.  The resultant height of ove^.lO feet
      would make it very difficult far spectators toclimb     the structure.

      (iii) New Step and Barrier Layout

      Drawing No. 6648/56 was circulated and considered.       This related to the
      new step and barrier layout on the Spion Kop, and Dr. Eastwood reported
      i a particular on the discussions which he'had had with the Planning
      Authority as to the height of an intermediate or a low second rail to
       :he barriers, where the drop to the gangway below could be over one metre
       In places.  He sought the Officer Working Pa r t y ’sviews* and the merits
      of the options were considered.

      IT WAS AGREED that, in the view of the Officer Working Party, the best
      option for a second rail in the areas described was a low toe rail at
      a height of some 200 mm.

      Facilities for the Disabled

To illustrate that the figures originally quoted to provide facilities for the
disabled at the foot of the Spion Kop (nearest to the North Stand) were not
unrealistic, Dr. Eastwood reported on the breakdown of the tender figures
(opened on Monday) for the enlarged, roofed Spion Kop. He still considered
that any such proposals would involve the loss of up to’1,000 of the extra
5,000 spectator places which would be provided by the enlarged Spion Kop.
Other areas of the Stadium had also been considered and investigated, but
none could provide as large a flat, easily accessible area as that in front of
the North Stand, which had been successfully used for so long without any major
problems.  Up to 80 disabled persons, plus attendants, used the area.  The only
major drawback he saw was that when there was a strong southerly wind, rain
could be blown onto the disabled, despite the cantilever roof of the North
Stand extending virtually to the pitch.  For this reason, the Club were willing
to roof an area from approximately the letter "0" on the results board to the
end of the Stand (nearest to the Spion Kop) with a substantial roof, including
armoured glass where there might be a visibility problem, provided that this
was supported by the Officer Working Party.

Whilst accepting much of what Dr. Eastwood said, the Officer Working Party
(and the Police representatives in particular) still expressed some concern as
to whether making semi-permanent facilities for the disabled in front of the
North Stand was the appropriate and correct thing to do.

The Building Authority confirmed that, after further investigations, it was
considered that the disabled facilities requirements of the Building
Regulations 1985 did not appear to strictly apply to the roofing of the
enlarged Spion Kop.
                IT WAS AGREED t h a t , in the first instance, Dr. Eastwood would prepare sketch
                plans of the suggested roofed disabled facilities in front of the North Stand
                for consideration by the Officer Working Party.


    ~\v         C.       Ground Inspection
                         ( i ) . West Terrace and Stand

                The Police representatives confirmed that the revised segregation arrangements
                to the rear of the Stand worked well on by far the majority of occasions.

                Dr. Eastwood pointed out that the segregation rail in the upper seated area'"'
                of the stand ^-could .be'moved'within .-certain -limits if the Police considered
               - that ■-'this would achieve a'useful purpose. ' ' -'.-     •;

                IT WAS A G R E E D :-

                (a)   that the additional advertisement hoardings at the front of the upper
                seated stand area (nearest to the North-West Terrace) should also be securely
                fixed to concrete wall;

                (b)   that further areas -of spalled concrete at the front of the upper               „
                seated stand area should received ‘•attention as matters of maint e n an c e .
                                                                                     -■*   '

                IT WAS AGREED that the advertisement hoardings erected on the upper North-
                West Terrace should be securely fixed.

                         (iii) North Stand

                The area for the suggested covered disabled facilities was inspected.

                As previously mentioned by Dr. Eastwood', the possibility of providing an
                increased width access to the pitch area (between the North Stand and the
                Spion Kop) for possible use by emergency v e hi c l es , as well as for maintenance
                by the Club was discussed.  The facility could be incorporated into the
                enlarged Spion Kop proposals relatively easily.

                It WAS AGREED that, whilst the County Fire Service felt that such a facility
                was not essential for their p u r p o s e s , it could be useful for use by emergency
                vehicles in certain situations and generally should be supported.

                         (iv)   Spion Kop   ■

              - D r . 'Eas        indicated the extent of the w or k to construct the enlarged,
          ‘     Y'i                 op, and ..confirmed that steps would be taken to prevent
                                    cess to areas where work might be in progress during the

Dear Mr. Hill,
        Dick Chester sent us a copy of your letter   6f    23 May
and has now forwarded a copy of your letter of 28 November*
The question of access to the press box was looked at during
the early summer.    No action has been taken because the Club
was looking at the future development of the South stand.
If the South stand were remodelled, part of the scheme would be
a much improved facility for the press and television.
        In the last three months, roofing of the Kop has
become the first priority and it is therefore appropriate to
have another look at the press box.    W* will write a brief
report for the Club in the near future.


                               Yours sincerely,
                                                               * ^                            1JJ 1           ^

         Dear Sirs,

         SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB PLC

         Confirming the 'phone conversations between our respective offices,
         arrangements have been made for a meeting of the Officer Working Party
         (Sheffield District) to be held on Wednesday, 22nd January, 1986, at
         the Hillsborough Stadium at 2 p.m.

         The purpose of the meeting will be two-fold; firstly to discuss the further
         details of development proposals forwarded with your letter dated
         23rd December, 1985, and, secondly, to carry out the "winter" inspection
         of the Stadium.

         As agreed, no doubt you will arrange to be present or represented at
         the meeting.

                                                  Yours faithfully,

        Dear Mr Whalley,                                                                                  a/
        At the opening of the Inquiry Lord Justice Taylor confirmed that the cost of
        representation of the injured and bereaved by the Hillsborough Solicitors Group
        would be met from public funds.

        Sadly the figures involved have not as yet been capable of agreement- ami. it will
        be necessary for us to proceed to a taxation of costs.

        The remarks of Lord Justice Taylor do not technically amount to an order for
        taxation and payment of those costs and to enable an appointment for taxation
        to be obtained we would be grateful if he (dould consider making a formal
        direction that the costs should be taxed in default of agreement.

        The Treasury Solicitor has no objection in principle to taxation but wc are both
        faced with the technical difficulty of producing the actual authority to tax.

        I Look forward to hearing from you.

        All good wishes.                                                                            __

        Yours sincerely,




        MISS E M STEEL

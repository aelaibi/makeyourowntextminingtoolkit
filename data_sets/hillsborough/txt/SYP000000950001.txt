o'clock          (JSOO>„            It w a s         shortly         after         the    kick       off        that      I heard
           ~7*—
peopj/? s h o u t           from        the    front        of      the     pen     ’The res         people         on       the     ground

here, c     get       back."            We       couldnt         move back           as w e r e     jammed          in.       It was

about       this       time        that          I sa w      p e o p 1 ec 1 i m b i n g u p o v e ^ ' f h e f e n c e at                     the

front       of    the       pen a n d         going        o nt o    the      pitch^^Suddenly                     everything                 became

bedlum          and    people           were     climbing            over        the     fences,             Im not          sure      at      this

stage       if    the       gate        at       the       front         of the    pen w a s       open.          I think            1 must

have      gone        into      s o me       sort     of    a trance             then     and      I have         very        vague

recollections                 of    exact        happenings.                  1 do       remember            somehow          getting           to

the    fence          between           pen    three        a n ^ e n        two.         I still            felt       crushed           at    this

stage.           I remember              a man        gjr the o t h e r           side       of    the       f ence,         put     hands

through and                join     them       in o r d e r         to    give     me    a              up      over      the      fence.

With       the    help        of    the       man,        I got      up     on     top of the              fe n c e .        At    this        poi n t

1 could see several                          people        lying at t<ne front                     of      pen with other

people who             had o b v i o u s l y          fallen on top of them.                               These        people were

trying          to get        up,       but    such was             the     force        from the            back       of    the      pen that

people were                just     t r a mpling           on them,               I do not         know^A f the               gate at           the

front was             open at           that     stage.             I Jumped           down       yffi,o     pen two a nd then

went       down to the              front        of the          pen and           thrpugh          the open^xfalTe at                    the

pitch and things we/e                          very        chaotic.              One     of the         first       things           I saw was

a man       lying          on the        pitch,           towards         the      corner flag.                  There        were        other

people          standing           by    hi m,       obviously            rendering           first          aid.         I went          to    him

From    the      time       that        the      game       was     stopped,             I think          that       the      P o 1 i ce and

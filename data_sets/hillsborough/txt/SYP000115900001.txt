                 On Saturday,              9th April,             1988       (090488)              I pa/formed             d u t y at

                 Hillsborough              in    connection            with        the        FA        u p Semi      Final       Match       being

                 played        between          Liverpool            and N o t t i n g h a m Forest.

                 My     duties       were       in    relation          to    the        West       Stand,       Leppings           Lane      and    the

                 serials        that       I was       in       charge       of w e r e        detailed           for d u t y       in t h e    seating

                 area     of    that       stand.           Prior       to    the        match          I remember          being       in the a r e a

                 between        the       turnstiles            at    Leppings            Lane          and    the    rear     of     the     stand.         I

                 had a        conversation             there         with Chief               Inspector          Creaser.             Well     prior        to

                 th e    kick       off    I was       called         into        th e    seating             area    of    the     West      Stand        due

                 to     problems          in t h a t       area.        I have           no    recollection                of a n y     events        in

                   elation          to    the    wooden         gates        at    the        rear       of    the W e s t     S t a n d w h i c h are

                 at     the    entrance          to    the      tunnel        leading              to    the C e n t r a l     pen,      standing

                 area.         Prior       to m y      being         c alled away,                 as    far    as    I can       remember          those

                 gates        were       open and          people      were        passing              through       them     normally.

                 I went        into       the    seating          area       of    the        West       Stand and          saw     that      the

                 people        at    the    front          of   that       seating            area were assisting                     people        from

                 the     standing          area       in    climbing          into        th e      seating          area.        Together          with a

                 number        of    the    officers             in m y      serials           we       went    to    the    front       of    the

                 seating        area       of    the       stand      to     prevent           this.

             For    some      time      prior             to    the       kick     off    and        certainly          during        the      whole       of

             th e   match        I remained                in the          seating        area        of    the W e s t       Stand.           I wa s

             seats.               ;                   ’

             b)     Attempting              to       sort       out       the    problems            regarding          seating          as    a    large

             number      of      people          who       should          have     been       in the           standing area             had       taken

             seats     thereby          taking             up s e a t s         fo r w h i c h       other       people       had     tickets.

             There     was also             a    problem             due    to     tickets           having          been    passed       by       people

             from    the      seating            area          to    people        in th e       standing             area.

             c)     Liaising           with          the       stewards          regarding            the       problems          caused       by    <b>.

             d)     In the        refreshment                   a r e a at       the     rear        of    the       seating      area,

             particularly              at       half       time w h e n          large        numbers           of    people      were        urinating

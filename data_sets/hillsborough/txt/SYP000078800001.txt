               I am a Police C o n s t a b l e         in the S o ut h Y o r k s hi r e Police,           currently

               serving at Hamrnerton Road Po li ce Station,                          Sheffield,



               At 9.4 5 am on S a t u r d a y         15th April       1989     (150489),        I    paraded for duty

               at H i l l s b o r o u g h   football     ground,     S heffield,         for duties       in connection

              wit h an FA C up s e m i           final    football      m a t ch to be played betwee n

               N o t t i n g h a m Forest FC and L iv erpool             FC.



              My a l l o t e d duty was          to drive a m ar ke d          police Transit         van and to be

              a v a i l a bl e    to   collect    persons a r r e s t e d outside           the ground an d transport

               them and          the a rr e st i ng   officer(s)       to either H a m m e r to n Road

               or E c cl e s f i e l d P ol i ce Station,          w here     the   prisoners w ou ld be dealt

              with.
                                                                                                         PAGE        2
                                                                                                         S2306



My   i ns tr uctions were                to stand by until          r eq uired with the van         in the

v i c i n i t y of the      j un ct io n     of Leppi ngs Lane w i t h P e ni st on e Road North,

In the        event     I parked          the van on the f or ecourt            of Law Bros.,       Garage,

which       is in L ep pi ng s Lane              close    to the a f o r e m e n t i o n e d junction,    and

a p p r o k imately      1/4 mile          from the football          ground.



Wh il s t     I was on the for ec ou rt              I received a         complaint      from a    resident

of                             w h i ch     is close by,         that Liverpool       fans were      openly

using       his      rear ga rd en as a toilet a n d that                they had been a g g r e s iv e and

ab u si v e    to both him and his wife w he n asked                       to stop.



D ur in g     the     course of my duty w ith the van I was                      called upon perhaps

three       or four times            to a t te n d at      incidents w here       transport may          be

requi re d for          prisoners          but    I was    needed on only one o cc as i on to

provide        t ransport       for an officer an d              prisoner      from L ep pi n gs Lane         to

the Po l i c e Room w i t h i n the ground.



As the day passed the number                        of f a n s , m a i n ly wearing L iv erpool

favours,          making     their way           in the d ir e ct i on of the ground along

L e p p i n g s Lane     increased.              M any were    openly    carrying and drin king               from

cans of alcohol             as they         passed and most were              in poss es si on of

a dd i t i o n a l   u no pe ne d    cans.        I noticed that m an y of these -fans were

open i n g     new     cans and          drinking    from them as soon as one              can became

empty.         My opin i on was            that they w ere d ri nk in g         the alcohol       in order

that     they w ou ld n 't          be    caught wit h      it in their        poss es si on w he n they

a r r i v e d at the ground.



In a d d i t i o n     to the above,             groups    of fans wer e       sitting   on the boundary

wall     of the f or ecourt and a ga in were                     d ri nking   from cans of alcohol
                                                                                                    PAGE
                                                                                                    S2306

w i t h extra        cans    in reserve.



1 would       describe        the   b ehaviour       of the fans at this            stage as boistrous

but    in the m ai n good humoured.



I recall           looking at my w a t ch shor tl y a fter 2. 3 0 pm a n d thinking                    to

myself as           I saw the number         of fans         still   making    their way towards            the

ground,       m an y at a       leisurely,       aimless,       sort of     pace,    "There's     no way

that all           these are g oi ng      to get       in by the kick off.            Why don't     they

come     in plenty          of time?"                                                                  __



In what a p p e a r e d a short           time       later    I h eard S u pe r i n t e n d e n t Marshall

via my       personal        radio ask      in the      region of four or five            times    for a

gate     to be opened.              I didn't     know the        l oc ation of the gate he was

r eferring          to at this      time,    and      I don't     recall what answer          he was    given



At about           the same time       I heard Po li ce C o n s t a bl e Mick B ux t on ask            if    it

was    possible        to have      the   kick off       delayed.        I don't     recall what       the

r e p 1y wa s .



When     it became          evident    that events were              taking a turn for        the worse at

the ground,           I decided       to make my w ay          in the d i re ct io n to a ff o rd what

assistance           I could give.          W he n    I reached       the L ep pi ng s Lane    entrance       to

the gr ou n d the           c a rr ia ge wa y was    bloc ke d by the       crowds an d     it was with

great      d i f fi c ul t y that     I was able        to make a n y headway wit h the van.



At    this    location        I remember a fan s ho uting at a m ou n te d officer

s o m et h i n g    like    "It's you busies.            It's your       fault what's       h appening       in

there.”
                                                                                                      PAGE          4
                                                                                                      S2306

I couldn't          park the      van     in L ep pings Lane       so I drove       round     into

C a t c h b a r Lane w h i c h    runs     paralell w i t h the south side of the ground,

an d   parked up near            to the     police sect io n       station.



I saw groups          of fans       on various       vantage      points    such as walls,           fences

a n d a workmens*        hut,       looking ac ro ss        towards      the ground.        At    this    stage

they didn't app ea r             to be a w ar e of what was           happening         inside.



I got       out of the van and went                round the various          groups      telling      them

that      there had been a ser i ou s              incident      inside    the ground a nd as ki ng

them to       leave the a re a          in order that        the e m er ge nc y services          could work

unhindered.



Nobody       seemed    c o nc er ne d a bout what          had a c t u a l l y happened - T hey only

wanted       to know     if the m a t ch had been a bandoned.



E v e n t u a l l y C at ch b ar Lane      filled w it h fans who          had obv io us ly been          in

the    v ic i ni ty of the L e p p i n g s Lane          end of the ground,             m any of w ho m were

very hostile          towards       me.



I then took          the van      into P en i st o ne Road N o r t h and parked out side                  the

gr ou n d    near    to the      j u n c t i o n of that    road w it h Merries Road South.                    It

was at this          location       that a number          of a m bu l a n c e s were    g ather ing whilst

awaiting       duties,     and e v en t u a l l y the sy st em evolved w he r eb y               I w o ul d

direct a m b ul a nc e s      to w he re     they were        required on receipt           of that

i nf o rm a t i on via   personal          radio     from Po li ce S er geant G od d ar d who was

on duty       in the P ol i ce       Control       Box   inside    the    ground.



L at er     in the evening          I was    employed       on s ec ur it y duties        outside     the

gates       in P e ni st on e Roa d N o rt h where memb er s             of the   press were
                                                                                                     PAGE
                                                                                                     S2306

              cong regat i n g , and then outside        the m o r t u a r y w h ic h had been set up in

              the g y m n a s iu m   receiving    parents/relatives/friends      of the dead fans.



              I f i ni shed duty at 4 . 1 5 am on S u n d a y   16th April    1989   (160489).

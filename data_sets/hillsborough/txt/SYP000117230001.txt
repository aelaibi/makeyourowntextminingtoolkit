            o fficers          present,       were well         aware      of what was           required.

             I arrived, with my               serial      at    the L e p p i n g s Lane         end of the        ground at

             some      time     shortly after            11.00am.          We were met           by Inspector Sykes who

            briefed us on our                 particular          duties,.        We      then went     out     into Leppings

            Lane and           took    up    positions         in the      *mouth*         of the entry         to the ground

            a n d the L e p p i n g s       Lane     turnstiles,           alongside          Leppings      Lane      road    itself

            On     reaching          Leppings      Lane     I immediately                noticed that       there were

            a l r e a d y a large           number     of Liverpool            suppo r t e r s    in the area,             some
                                                                                                               PAGE
                                                                                                               R84

w a l k i n g around,         some     stood ar o u n d       in small        groups.          The turns t i l e s

were     not o pen at           this    point.          F r o m the    outset,       1 had      cause to     convers

w i t h many      supporters,           all      of who m at      this       time were         very amicable.           1

was    continually approached                     by supp o r t e r s who       had a r r i v e d early and wh

were asking             one of a limited              number     of question,           namely - Where was

the    nearest          pub or      beer-off?           Where    could they get s o m ething                to eat?

W here a p a rticular               ent rance       to the      ground was? Did            I know where         any

t i c k e t s c:ou 1 cl be faought ?

All    the s u p p o r t e r s      were    in good humour,             and were dealt w ith

acc o r d i n g l y .     T hey     c o n t i n u e d to walk a r o u n d or gather              in groups,       the

numbers       building          s t e a d i l y all     the   time.      More    and more          fans a r r i v e d

and    it soon became               noticeable          that many       had been drinking,               many were

in fact w a l k i n g a r o u n d          near to my         location        carrying         several    cans or

fao111es of beer,               a n d o p e n 1y dr i nk ing from % h e m -             0 n ’no r m a 1 * mat ch

serial,       but       the   point was          reached where          there were         simply too man y of

them acting             in this manner.               There was        the    occasional          loud m o u t h who

I   cannot      recall        the    exact       time    that    the turnstiles were                opened,     but     I

can recall          that w h e n       they were,          there was         no apparent         rush    by the

s u p p o r te r s in t h e a re a t o g e t in t o t h e g r a u n d «                T h ey w e r& s t o o d a b o u t

in groups         of     i n creasing       sii'S, a nd       then they began             taking     up positions

on nearby walls,                sitting         and drinking          beer    etc.      T here were m any

people who          had o b v i o u s l y a r r i v e d without          tickets,         they were       openly

approach!ng             other     people and asking              to buy tickets.                These    people

were     in fact a continual                    nuisance,       and were       being      r e p e a t e d l y ask id to

ino ve away f r a m th e ent rance                  to t he t ur ns t i 1 es .

As time went             on   it became          i n c r e a s i n g l y difficult      for all      officers,

even     the M o u n t e d officers,              to m a i n t a i n good order           in the L e p pings

Lane -area.            The      crowds were         too    plentiful        and as the           day went       on they

se e m e d    less w i l l i n g      to respond          to any Pol i c e advice.                  Ver y    large

groups        con t i n u e d    to stand a r o u n d          outside and refused to enter                     the

g r o und as advised,                 Beca u s e    of the       numbers       involved,         and the

re latively          small       number     of officers           present       to deal w i t h         them,        this

task     soon became             impossible.             It was    not     possible       to     control       the

crowds        on the       road or         at    the e n t r a n c e s    to the ground.               E v e n the

horses were            unable       to    control        the m a j o r i t y of the       crowd.

I think         that      the    time would         be about 2 . 0 0 p m when L e p p i n g s               Lane was

closed to v e h icles               in the       interests        of     safety.        By this        time,    the

crowds,         man y who w ere          now     clearly worse            -For d r i n k , were        filling        the

w h o l e w i d t h of       the    road,        It remained an            impossible          task     to    control

them.         As    the k i c k off time            got    closer more and more                  fans       attempted

to gain entry              t h r o u g h the L e p p i n g s     Lane     turnstiles.            It soon be came

obvious         that      they were        getting        f rust rated by the slow m o v e m e n t                   into

the ground.               As the crowd a r o u n d the turns t i l e s i n creased they

star t e d to        push and         shove,       tempers w ere          fraying,       myself        a n d other

officers           were    being      v e r b a l l y abused.          There    seemed      little we          could

do. At one           s t a g e , as      requested by PS Proctor,                   I f o l l o w e d him      into       the

crowd and           tried to a p p r o a c h the           turnstiles,          hoping      to       advise     the

crowd to stop              pushing       before        injuries        occur red.        1 was       in fact

s e p a r a t e d from PS Proc t o r             by a Po l i c e       horse,     and    X lost sight of

to stop         pushing.           This was        useless,       nobody took any notice, and most

seemed        to laugh off            the advice          or    continue       to v e r b a l l y    abuse me and

my way nearer              to the edge           of the        crowd,    somewhere        next       to the     road.             5

could see           that     the    crowd       near     the    t u rnstiles      was    very tightly           packed,

many were           climbing        up onto        the    perimeter wall           of the gr o u n d seemingly

to escape           the crush         rather       than gain easier access.                      The    pushing

    1 can recall          a Police            officer       shouting      out       over a vehicle            loudspeaker

    t o the      crowd,      a d v i s I n g t o s t o p p u s h i n g , b u t the advice              wa s i g n o r e d «

    I recall        thi nk i ng t hat          there was        soon goi ng to be                injur i es    i f t,he

    pushing       d i d n ’t stop,         a l t h o u g h from my p o s ition             I couldn't         see    if

    there were any               persons       being        injured    nearer        to the turnstiles.

    1 can recall          that       there was a point whe n                  there was a sudden surge

    forw a r d    by the         crowd,       obviously        by m o v e m e n t    near the turnstiles.                      1

    could not see what                  had    caused       this    but    1 a s s u m e d that a gate              had been

    op e n e d to    relieve         the      pressure.         Had this        not    been d o n e , I do believe

    that    serious        injuries           or damage w o u l d have              occurred outside               the

    entrances.           Also at         this     point       1 can    recall        large       numbers      of

    su pporters        rushing          to the       entrances        from Leppings Lane.                  1 saw them

    run across         the       road from a wall              where m a n y were           sitting       or stood          near

    by.     My own belief               is that       these     people      did      not have       tickets,         and

    that     on seeing           the su d d e n      rush     into the      ground,,        realising         that a gate

    had been opened,               they too          joined the        rush.         This    o b v i o u s l y added

    c o n s i d e r a b l y to    the numbsrs           entering       the entrance at              the    same      time.

    Supporters         continued           to enter         the ground,         but    shortly after 3,, OUpm,                         on

    I first       of all         thought       that a pitch           invasion        had taken         place,       but       it

    was    soon a p p arent          that      the    incident was m uch mo re serious.                            As soon

    as    it was a p p a r e n t        that     people were          getting        seriously        injured        in the

    crush on the          terracing,            with other          o f f icers and         supporters,            i. first

    of all       recall      trying        to break         down a strip            of the       perimeter         fencing

    to the       right    of      the    g o a lm o u t h   :i.n order    to get       to a person who,                  if not

    already       dead,      was     very s e r i o u s l y     injured.            Thi s was      e v e n t u a l l y clone,

             From    this        point      I assisted           in helping all           present     in lifting       obviously

             dead    people         from the         terracing,          and also a s s i s t i n g       injured    people

             onto    the    pitch.           I cannot           say how man y       dead bodies           I helped    remove

             from the terracing,                   but     I believe        it must- have        been      in double

             a nd a ma n of about 2 5 - 3 0 years.                        I can     recall      thinking      that    they were

             a l r e a d y dead       but    efforts,           nevertheless,          continued u n s u c c e s s f u l l y    to

             supporters,            in carrying            three a p p a r e n t l y    dead young men         from    the

             I remained            inside      the    ground,        on the     pitch,       until    most    of the

             s upp o r t e r s    had    left      the ground.            I was     c o mpletely      stun n e d by all         that

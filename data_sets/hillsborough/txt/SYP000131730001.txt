Introduction

    At the request of the Chief Constable an investigation has been conducted
    into 'The Cook Report' shown on national television on Thursday 2 June 1994
    relating to the Hillsborough disaster on 15 April 1989 and in particular
    one victim, Kevin Williams.

    The investigation focused specifically on the alleged 'bullying' of
    ex-Special Constable Debbie Martin; the suggestion that an ambulance which
    was featured in the programme was not included in the evidence given at
    the inquest; and, finally at the suggestion that some of the 95 people who
    died were still alive after the 3.15 p.a.    'cut off* time decided by the
    coroner at the inquests.

    Outlined below are the results of the research which not only addresses
    the above but also many other aspects included in 'The Cook Report'.

   lying' of Ex-Special Constable Debbie Martin

    No official complaint has ever been made by Debbie Martin or anyone on her
    behalf in relation to the allegations of pressure being put on her to change
    her statement.

    Brief reference was made on this point at the notice of application for
    leave to apply for judicial review held on 5 November 1993. A copy of the
    relevant part of that document is shown at Appendix 1, in particular
    Page 29 Item 21.

    A further reference is made in the judgement of the judicial review, in
    particular Page 24 Item D and E and a copy of this document is also shown
    at Appendix 1.

    At Page 252D, the Coroner said:

    'We have already mentioned the evidence of Special Constable Martin who
    said about the lad speaking.     In no way do I want to run poor Special

•   Constable Martin down because she had a very hard day but it is right she
    was obviously from her statement very distressed.

    A.   I also wouldn't want to criticise WPC Martin in any way but I have
    interviewed her twice, sir, and she was particularly upset as indeed many
    people were but it affected her particularly badly the events of the day'.

    The statement in question, the final one made by Debbie Martin, does not
    change anything factual to what had been said previously but merely includes
    her feelings and confused state of mind.

    This statement shows a truer reflection of her condition whilst she was
    present in the gymnasium and this can be corroborated by the video reference
    VRM/2.

    In 'The Cook Report' Debbie accused the police officers who visited her,
    to take her fourth and final statement, and saying that they did not believe
    she had in fact been at Hillsborough. This beggars belief. In a previous
    statement made by Debbie Martin on 12 July 1989, Debbie makes reference
    to a video shown to her by West Midlands Police officers in which she
    identifies herself. West Midlands officers would hardly accuse Debbie of
    not being at Hillsborough when they had clearly seen her on a video
    recording.
     Copies of all statements made by Special Constable. Debbie Martin are also
     shown at Appendix 1.

The Inquest

     It is said in the programme that the inquest was never shown the arrival
     of an ambulance at 3.37 p.m. when Police Constable Bruder was assisting
     in giving mouth to mouth resuscitation to Kevin Williams.

     This aspect is one of the inaccuracies of the programme as the arrival of
     the ambulance was shown to the inquest in the form of the compilation video
     prepared by the West Midlands Police.

     The ambulance is also featured     in two other videos reference MAP3 and MAP7
     which is footage obtained from     the BBC and showed different camera angles.
     The latter is incorporated in     the compilation video prepared for the Lord
     Justice Taylor enquiry and also   used at the inquests.

     Transcripts of the inquest dated 7 December 1990 and 14 December 1990 make

•    reference to the compilation video being shown at the inquest.

     The relevant parts of the transcripts are shown at Appendix 2.

     The ambulance appeared to be the one referred to by Police Constable Bruder
     at about 3.37 p.m. which did not stop despite people banging on the side
     of it. The ambulance driver, Tony Edwards, said in his statement he saw
     people trying to save friends but his instructions from the senior ambulance
     officer on scene, Mr Hopkins '..... there were casualties at the far end
     of the ground and he needed us on the pitch and that we were not to stop
     for anyone until we got to the far end of the ground. He told us to put
     our two tones on and go through. He did as we were told

     Edwards is unable to identify any individual who banged on his ambulance.

     The statement of Tony Edwards is shown at Appendix 3.

Life After 3.15 p.m.

^    This was the subject of much controversy and debate from the outset of the
     inquests. The 3.15 p.m. cut off point was decided by the coroner. Dr Popper.
     This was for inquest purposes only. A full investigation covering events
     before and after 3.15 p.m. was conducted by the West Midlands Police for
     the Lord Justice Taylor enquiry.

     In the case of all 95 inquests the person carrying out the post mortem gave
     evidence as to the injuries sustained by thevictims, the cause of death
     and the time scale of their deaths, which would have been fairly quick.

     In the case of Kevin Williams, Dr Slater who carried out the post mortem
     on him said Kevin had sustained four fractures to his larynx which would
     have made speech virtually impossible.
    The coroner called an expert witness. Dr Gumpert, a Consultant neurologist,
    who said it was clear to hi* that in Kevin's case he was probably dead before
    he was extracted fro® the area where he had been standing. He went on to
    say that after people are brain stem dead '......they can twitch and very
    unnerving it is too..... '. This is due to a spinal reflex which is thought
    to occur in anoxia - lack of oxygen — in that the brain stem died first.

    A transcript of evidence of Dr Slater and Dr Gumpert are shown at Appendix 4.

    Police Constable Bruder in his statement shown at Appendix 5 said he assisted
    a St Johns Ambulance officer to give mouth to mouth resuscitation to
    Kevin Williams. He continued to do this until advised by one of the St Johns
    Ambulance officers that he, Kevin, was 'gone*.       Police Constable Bruder
    th«»n left the stadium.   Summaries of both statements supplied by Police
    Constable Bruder were read out at the inquest of Kevin Williams on
    Friday 4 May 1990. See Appendix 4.

    Ex-Special Constable Martin said that she carried Kevin Williams into the
    gym where she noticed apparent signs of life and went on to say she gave
    Kevin mouth to mouth resuscitation and that Kevin uttered the word 'mom'.

    There are four witnesses, three of whom gave statements, who actually dealt
    with Kevin Williams and who were satisfied that when they had finished their
    dealings with him he was in fact dead. This was prior to Debbie Martin's
    involvement with Kevin. There are also two medical witnesses who suggest
    that Kevin was dead prior to his extraction fro* the pen.        It begs the
    question when all these people had given up on Kevin, how could Debbie Martin
    say she saw signs of life in him? This presumably is borne more out of
    optimism than reality.

    The Cook Report placed a lot of emphasis on time being a critical factor
    in the rescue of Kevin Williams.He stated that Debbie was    giving mouth
    to mouth resuscitation on Kevin at 3.55 p.m.   However, from the evidence
    outlined above, they are either lying or attesting to mislead or at least
    are badly mistaken.

    From the video, reference VRM2,    she is seen fro* 3.50 p.m. to 4.00 p.m.
    in the gymnasium and at no time seen to         be performing any form of
    resuscitation on anyone.   This, together with the transcripts of evidence
    by Dr Slater and Dr Gumpert, the statements of Police Constable Bruder,
    Mr O'Keefe and Mr Hart and the information fro*             totally negate
    her claims to the condition of Kevin.

     The information from               was received in a telephone call         to
     Headquarters Operations Room on 3 June 1994 and also shown at Appendix 4.

Additional Information

    The Cook Report highlighted other inaccuracies contained in the programme
    as below.

     In his introduction Cook said evidence was disregarded, ignored and witnesses
     were not traced. These allegations can be refuted.
Sir Malcolm Thornton MP, alleged in the programme that events after 3.15 p.m.
were not fully inquired into. This is incorrect as the West Midlands Police
enquiry covered all aspects including events before and after 3.15 p.m.

ANACAPA charts were produced for all 95 victims showing their movements
frog the moment they set off that morning to the post mortem. To give an
example of this a copy of the ANACAPA chart for Kevin Williams is shown
at Appendix 6.

Allegations were made that police officers were leaned on by their colleagues
to change their statements. Mrs Williams said that Police Constable Bruder
told her that the West Midlands Police had approached him with a brief to
change his statement. However, this is refuted by Police Constable Bruder
himself in a telephone conversation with Chief Superintendent Greene of
the West Midlands Police when he says that he made his statement entirely
voluntarily and without any pressure, duress or other persuasion.

A report from Chief Superintendent Greene pointed out that a solicitor,
on behalf of the relatives, had interviewed Police Constable Bruder and
suggested the possibility that his further statement could have been
furnished as a result of cajolery or other improper actions by the West
Midlands Police. Police Constable Bruder maintained that he made it clear
to the solicitor that this was not the case.

A copy of the report from Chief Superintendent Greene and a copy of the
relevant part of the notice of application for leave to apply for judicial
review held on 5 November 1993 are shown at Appendix 7.

The programme pointed out that the ambulance service did not allow their
personnel to be interviewed by the West Midlands Police. The inference
was that there may have been some skull duggery if they had done so.

Don Page, the former head of the South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance
Service (SYMAS) did say in the programme that their own solicitors took
statements from their personnel and furnished the West Midlands Police with
copies of those statements.

This is quite understandable as SYMAS, as one of the emergency services,
could be held culpable for their actions on the day.

Chief Superintendent Mike Foster, who was one of the senior investigating
officers from the West Midlands Police was interviewed by Cook and only
a short excerpt of that interview was shown on the programme. Chief
Superintendent Foster has possession of a copy of the full interview and
he said that Cook put it to him that the reason why SYMAS personnel did
not make statements directly to the West Midlands Police may have been
because of the West Midlands Serious Crime Squad affair. Mr Foster pointed
out to Cook that the Serious Crime Squad affair did not become public until
August 1989, some four months after the Hillsborough disaster.

There was then a difference of opinion amongst the medical profession as
to the possible survival of Kevin Williams and the alleged uttering of the
word 'mom'.
Dr lain West, a Forensic Pathologist at Guys Hospital said that if certain
procedures had been carried out to Kevin after he had been extracted fro*
the pen then it is possible that he may not have suffered fro* the fatal
asphyxia which led to his death.

The procedures he referred to are emergency tracheotomy, which is a
relatively major procedure and crico—thyriodotomy; is a simpler procedure
which involved the passage of a tube through the membrane between the thyroid
and cricoid cartlidges.

The question is therefore who at the pertinent time had the knowledge and
expertise to carry out such procedures and in any case if an emergency
tracheotomy was carried out on Kevin it would have been to no avail as he
was already brain stem dead.

A copy of the report of Dr West is shown at Appendix 8.

Two   men appeared on the programme who identified themselves as carrying
the   advertising board upon which the body of Kevin Williams was placed.

The inference given was that these two men had not been traced when in fact
they had been and statements obtained from them.

One of the men, Stephen Hart, said that he knew that Kevin was alive but
unconscious at the time. This is in contradiction to the statement he gave
to the West Midlands Police as he said in that statement that when Kevin
was lifted onto the advertising board a policeman came forward and pulled
Kevin's jumper over his face and he realised that he was dead.

An action was raised by the West Midlands Police for visual evidence to
be shown to Hart for identification and continuity. Hart declined to assist
in that action.

A copy of the statement given by Stephen Hart and the action are shown at
Appendix 9.

The second man, Anthony O'Keefe,     an off duty fire fighter, said in the
programme that he thought that Kevin was alive, however, in original notes
prepared by O'Keefe on 29 April 1989, he stated that it appeared to him
that all the casualties were in fact dead and had been for some time. He
was t>»pn asked by a Doctor to point out anyone he knew that had signs of
life but in his opinion there were none.

A copy of his original notes and statement are shown at Appendix 10.

Both Hart and O'Keefe say in their original statements that for all intents
and purposes, Kevin Williams was dead prior to him being carried across
the football pitch and prior to the involvement of Police Constable Bruder.

A number of other people were featured in the programme, namely Mrs Stringer,
Ms Routledge, Mr Spearitt and Mr Glover.     It is felt their contribution
in the programme was merely for effect.
     file judgement of the judicial hearing held on 5 Hovember 1993 shows at
     pages 29 and 30 in relation to new evidence of Kevin possibly being alive
     after 3.15 p.a., '..... 1 find it of far too tenuous a nature to justify
     a new inquest.....'.     The relevant part of that judgeaent is shown at
     Appendix 1.

     Allegations that there was not a complete enquiry or that lessons were not
     learned is incorrect.     The Taylor report apportioned blaae and his
     reoaaendations with regard to all seater stadiums, ground improvements
     including safety aspects have all been jjnplemented shows that lessons have
     been learned.

Conclusion

    After a considerable amount of research it appears that the 'Cook Report'
    is seriously flawed in many aspects. Contained within are a great number
    of inaccuracies and contradictions of what was said in the programme by
    some people and statements originally given to the West Midlands Police
    for the Lord Justice Taylor enquiry and the subsequent inquest.

^   The results of the research show that, no new evidence has come to light
    to warrant any further investigation and a thorough inquiry was carried
    out into the Hillsborough tragedy by the West Midlands Police.

           I an Debra Jane MARTIN and I live at the above address.   I am

           single.   Jfy occupation is a dental nurse, I an also a Special Police

        Constable number 221 based at WOODSEATS (E2 Sub-division) of South

        Yorkshire Police.

        On Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489) I paraded for duty at 9.00am

           (0900) at HILLSBOROUGH Football stadium where there was a briefing for

        all officers involved in the semi-final betwsen LIVERPOOL and

        NOiriNCUAM FOREST.      The briefing was at 9.45am (0945).

        At 10.20am (1020) I returned to the gym at the football ground for a
                                                              »



        separate briefing for special constables.

        At 10.35am (1035) I left HILISBOROUGH stadium to patrol HERRIES ROAD

        SCUIH to stop the parking of cars by fans on the hard shoulders.         I

        did this with S.C.               We continued to patrol HERRIES ROAD

        SOUIH, which is a very long road, until about 1.10pm (1310) that

        aftamoon.      At this time we had orders to go to PENISTCNE RD to cover

        traffic outside the main entrance gates for the NOTTS FOREST fans.

        At this point I saw about 6 ticket touts.      I saw them selling tickets

        and money changing hands.      I also saw numerous fans both Liverpool
MAPriN                DEBRA JANE


fans and Notts Forest, who vere obviously drunk, although at this

stage they vrere behaving reasonably.

At about 2.45pm (1445) I started to make my way to the IEPPINGS LANE

entrance, as I passed what I think is the main entrance to the SPIGN

KOP, the turnstiles were shut down.

At about 2.50pm (1450) there was trouble at these turnstiles when the

Notts Forest fans, realising they were being locked out, were trying

any way they could to get in, this included paying money to the

turnstiles stewards and trying to buy tickets from the touts.     The

crorfd became very abusive and angry and I had to assist in the

removal of fans from the ground.   I was can the road side and the

police inside were passing fans back out over the turnstiles and

there was a very large number of fans trying to get in still, so much

that mounted officers and their horses were being pushed up against

the wall.   The next thing I knew is a large blue gate was opened and

a large majority of the crcwd pushed their way into the ground.      I

found myself being carried along with the crowd unable to resist.        A

mounted officer grabbed my collar but had to let go, because he would

have been pulled from his horse.   I got pushed to the floor, but I

managed to get back to my feet by pulling myself up a man's back.        I

then remember opening my eyes and finding myself inside the ground,

at the bottom of the Spion Kop and the gates had been shut behind

me.   I asked the steward on the gate to let me out, but at first he

refused, it was only when a mounted officer, the same one who had

tried to help me a few moments earlier, put his horse 15 ) against the

gate, he opened it a short way and let me out.

Once outside I found myself surrounded by drunken fans, screaming

abuse, and the area covered by police.   An officer used ray radio to

try and call for back up but to no avail because the   channel was
MARTIN                DEBRA JANE                                           3


full of static.   My radio vras handed back to me and I ran to the

Lepoings Lane end of the ground.     Ambulances and police cars were

rushing to that end of the ground.    When I got to the Leppings Lane

end of the ground I saw a vast cncwd outside the turnstiles trying

to get in, it must have been about four times larger than the crowd

I left at the other end, so that would mean the crowd at the Spion

Kop end numbered about 1000 plus and I would estimate about 4000

outside Leppings Lane end.

I can't really remember how, but somehow I got inside the ground,

through the large blue gate which was open, and I ended up on the

pitch.   I did not go through the tunnel.

Once on the pitch I saw a lot of people who were obviously injured

and I can remember a man caning up to me shouting, "THERE'S TWO DEAD

YOU BASTARD". I then saw people who appeared to be dead.     People

were screaming and shouting and ambulances were driving onto the pitch.

I assisted other police officers with dead and injured people and

helped to take them on stretchers to the gym, and I can remember

seeing officers frcm E2 (WOODSEATS) everywhere.

I took about 6 dead to the gym, as vrell as many injured and whilst I

was trying to revive a young boy I rementoer something hitting me on

the back of my head, but I didn't really notice until nuch later when

I found a large swelling.    I could see many bodies being put on the

pitch, seme of them appeared to be dying.    I lost count of the number

of bodies I helped carry into the gym.

I helped carry a young boy into the gym frcm the pitch nearby.    He

stopped breathing so I gave him the kiss of life, and heart massage

and a doctor also helped.    He started breathing and opened his eyes,

his only word was "MCM' and then he died.

At 4.06pm (1606) Dr CURPEN certified death and I stayed with him.      I
MAP FIN                  DEBRA JANE


vrould describe him as white male, 5'6-5'7, 14-15 yrs, slim build and

brcvn hair, with a cut under his chin.       He had slightly crooked

teeth, there were no other marks on the body.       He was wearing a white

shirt, green sweat shirt, beige trousers, white socks, white Reeboks

and green and white boxer shorts.      He had a gold metal chain with a

gold horn, a bus ticket, a train ticket and an entrance ticket.        He

had no identification or money.       I later found out the number given

to this boy was 51.

I stayed with the body and at 5.20am (0520) Sunday 16 April

(160489) an ambulance arrived and I went with the body together with

DC        and             to the Medico Legal Centre, WATER LANE,

Sheffield.      I stayed with the body until he was stripped and details

taken fran me.     I finally went off duty at 6.30 (0630) on Sunday

16 April 1989 (160489).

At about 6.30pm (1830) Monday 8 May 1989 (080589) I saw PC's

and|       |from West Midlands Police at my hone.    PC ? showed to me a

partially completed report of death form that I identified as being

the form I filled in whilst in charge of the body, details of name

and other personal details are missing because there had been no

identification made by the time I went home.      All I can say is this

fornn relates to body 51.    I now knew this is Kevin David WILLIAMS,

DATED: 170390                                             D J MARTIN (SIGNED)



        Further to my previous statements I would like to add the following,

        On Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489) I worked in the capacity of

        Special Constable at the F.A. Semi-Final football natch between

        Liverpool F.C. and Nottingham Forest F.C. which was being played at

        the Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield.

        My recollection of the events of that day are vague and confused.

        As a result of the disaster I was prescribed medication by my Doctor




                                                                   I felt like

        a 'Zatibie.'

        As a result of this I feel that my memory, my recollection of that day

        is possibly inaccurate.   I am unsure of what time I arrived at the

        Leppings Lane entrance to the ground or even hew I came to be on the

        pitch but I did.

        By time I got onto the pitch it seemed to be mass confusion, there

        wera police officers and supporters all over the place.   I could see

        people who appeared to be injured and possibly dead, lying cai the
MAPTIN                DEBRA JANE                                           2


pitch.   I was in a state of shock.    I didn't know what to do but my

natural instinct was to help these people in the best way that I could.

I can't describe to you in any detail my exact movements over the next

half an hour or so.   I know that I approached several people lying on

the pitch and assisted if possible.     I did not give any of these

people mouth-to-mouth or heart nassage.

I dacided that there were enough people dealing with the situation

at the Leppings Lane end of the ground and node my way to the Spion

Kop end of the ground.

I could see that bodies ware being carried fran the Leppings Lane end

to the Spion Kop end of the ground and then being placed on the pitch.

I assisted to carry a nunber of dead and injured people from the Spion

Kop end of the pitch, into the gymnasium where a temporary mortuary

had been set up.   I was talking to seme of these people, comforting

then and trying to reassure them.     I am unable to describe any of

these people in the detail.

By this time I really was in a state of shock, I couldn't believe what

I was seeing.   I seemed to be cm automatic pilot.    My memories are

very confused and distorted.

I can recall carrying a youth who I now know to be, Kevin Daniel

WILLIAMS frenv the pitch to the gymnasium.   He was the last person that

I assisted in carrying.   I first saw Kevin WILLIAMS lying on the pitch

near to the goal area at the Spion Kop end of the ground.    At that

stage he wasn't on a hoarding or a stretcher.

I ramember that there were several people around where he was lying.

I can't recall anyone giving him mouth to mouth.     With the help of

othar people, who I can't recall, Kevin WILLIAMS was placed onto a

hoarding and carried into the gymnasium.     Someone instructed me to

stay with the body.
MAPPIN                 DEBRA JANE                                          3


I didn't know what to do.    I didn't want to believe the bey was dead.

I didn't knew if he was dead or not but I decided that I had got to

attanpt to revive him.    I started to give him mouth-to-mouth but

someone, I don't know who, touched me on the shoulder and told me he

was dead.    By this time my head had gone, I wasn't aware of what I was

doing or what was really happening.

At 16.06 hours (1606) Doctor CURPEN examined Kevin WIIUAMS and

certified him dead.

I rsmember a detective officer, DC Paul MONFREDI helping me to

carrplete the GEN 18 form (sudden death form).

I stayed with the body until the early hours of Sunday 16th April

(160489) when I escorted Kevin WILLIAMS, who at this stage had not

been identified, to the Medico Legal Centre.

I identified the body by the number allocated, which in the case was

Number 51.   I had no further dealings with Kevin WILLIAMS.

This statement is made to the best of my recollection and I believe it

to be the truth.   However, under the circumstances I cannot be

positive that the details are accurate.




I have marked on a plan of the pitch (Reference D.J.M.l) the

approximate location where I first came into contact with the

deceased, Kevin Daniel WILLIAMS.

              finding was that of asphyxia.      This opinion was
              formed through the extensive blueness on the face
              and upper part of the chest.      In addition there
              were small haemorrhages in both the face and
              internal organs, including the brain, heart and
              lungs.....      This had also resulted in four
              fractures to the small bones in the actual voice
              b o x ...... the compression of the neck or chest has
              occurred here and unconsciousness occurs very
_            rapidly, certainly within a few seconds, and there
B            is one reported case of it occurring apparently
              instantaneously.     Following unconsciousness then
              there is no discomfort and no pain.      Death then
              occurs after approximately three to five
              minutes."


    At G:

             Q. Now the reason why I asked you was this, and I
             want to put this to you because I would like to
             get your view on it, one Officer will be dealing
             with the value of this evidence in a moment but
             she [a Woman Special Constable called Debra
             Martin] says that at a point when this lad was in
D            the gymnasium, in other words he had already been
             moved across the pitch, she says she helped him
             into the gym from the pitch, presumably she
             carried him. He had stopped breathing.   She gave
             him the kiss of life, did some heart massage, he
             opened his eyes, said a word and died. Now in the
             light of your pathological findings, is that in
             fact a possibility, do you think?"
E

    In answer the doctor made several comments, among them

    these:

             "     this was certainly the most severe case of
             traumatic asphyxia that I actually dealt with.



             This case was highly unusual in that in fact it
             had four fractures to the larynx.  It was by far
             the most severe case of voice box fractures. Not
             only does this indicate the severity of the
             traumatic asphyxia at the time but it also in fact
             makes it virtually impossible for the person to
             have spoken by virtue of the fact that there were
             fractures to the voice box, sir.  So all I can
             say, sir, that scientifically and medically I find

                            22
H
              that inconceivable that the person could have
              spoken."


    Then he referred to cortical coning and said:

              "The coning indicates the severity of the asphyxia
              and again that would have resulted in irreversible
              brain damage which again would totally prohibit
              any form of communication.
B             Q.  I have thought about this comment as well, of
              course, and there are several explanations (1 )
              that it didn't occur and that the observer is
              mistaken but another possibility that has occurred
              to me and I want to put it to you and please
              disagree if it is not either right or you don't
              accept it; it is possible, is it not, that if a
              person having died is moved air or stomach
              contents might be expelled and might make a sound
              as it escapes, so to speak.  Is that a
              possibility?

              A.  It is an interesting comment, sir, because it
              is a possibility that I considered also myself and
              that is certainly an explanation for the noise
D             which could have been made which may have mimicked
              the word 'mum' but it would not explain the
              opening of the eyes, sir."

    He added to the Coroner:

              "But it would explain the noise."

    Then Mr Fraser said:

              "No questions, sir, but thank you very much,
              Dr Slater, for that sympathetic and detailed
              explanation."

         Then a Police Sergeant Killoch was called by the

    Coroner to give the summary in this case.     Among other

    things he said this:

              "Derek William Bruder, an off-duty Police
              Constable from the Merseyside Police who was a
              spectator at the match, recalls seeing a person
              lying on the pitch near the Spion Kop/North Stand
              of the ground. The person was having
              convulsions. Mr Bruder went on the pitch and gave
              mouth to mouth resuscitation aided by a St John's
              Ambulanceman who carried out cardiac massage.

                               23

H                                                               f
          Mr Bruder recalls that a friend of the casualty
          was with hi m on the pitch. Resuscitation was
          continued and they were joined by a St John's
          Ambulancewoman who took over from Mr Bruder.
          After a short time the St John's Ambulancemen said
          that the casualty was dead. Mr Bruder then left
          the scene.

          Neither of the St John's Ambulance personnel or
          the friend of the casualty had been identified.
          The person M r Bruder tried to resuscitate is now
          known to be Kevin.

          Special Constable Debra Martin went on the pitch
          to assist and she helped to carry several deceased
          persons and many injured persons to the
          gymnasium.  She assisted to carry one youth who
          she now knows to be Kevin into the gymnasium where
          she remained with him.

         At 16.06 hours Dr Curpen examined Kevin in the
         gymnasium which had been established as a
         temporary mortuary.  Dr Curpen certified life
         extinct."


At page 252D, the Coroner said:

          "We have already mentioned the evidence of
          Special Constable Martin who said about the lad
          speaking.  In no way do I want to run poor Special
          Constable Martin down because she had a very hard
          day but it is right she was obviously from her
          statement very distressed.

         A.  I also wouldn't want to criticise WPC Martin
         in any way but I have interviewed her twice, sir,
         and she was particularly upset as indeed many
         people were but it affected her particularly badly
         the events of the day."


    At page 253, Dr Slater was recalled by the Coroner and

asked about Mr Bruder's account of the man lying on the

floor having convulsions.   He said:

         "Unfortunately when people have not got enough
         oxygen in the brain, as I said in my earlier
         evidence, which is really what the word 'asphyxia*
         means, individuals can in fact have fits."
Later he said:

             "For somebody to have convulsions, this would
             imply that the amount of asphyxia is such that
             there must be virtually irreversible brain damage
             present and again this would fully support the
             concept that the evidence of opening eyes and
             speaking is not really conceivable, sir.

             THE CORONER:   Does that help, Mr Fraser?

             MR FRASER:  I am sure it does, Dr Slater.  It is
             difficult to find the phrase to sum the situation
             up. Kevin at that stage was beyond help. He was
             as good as dead?

             A.   Yes, that is right, absolutely.

             Q.   And would feel nothing and know nothing?

             A.   Absolutely.   He would know nothing."

     A stage came, on 4th May 1990, when the Coroner

recalled Sergeant Killoch and the sergeant dealt with

Mr Bruder 1 s account of the person having convulsions, going

on to say:

             "I then took his pulse in his neck.    I could feel
             a slight pulse."


     Then Inspector Sawers was called to give an account,

beginning at page 264, about what contact he had since had

with Mr Bruder:

             "He goes on to say as a result of feeling
             depressed about the incident he applied of his own
             volition for further first-aid training within
             Merseyside Police."


At page 265B:

             "He has given very careful consideration, sir, to
             the expression he used of having convulsions and
             in the light of his further training and what he
             now knows and thinks about the incident was that
             •convulsions' was not the word that was
             applicable to these circumstances. He refers
               specifically to having seen epileptic fits and
               says that what he originally described as a
               convulsion was not anything like an epileptic
               fit. He goes on to say later, sir, that if there
               was a part of the body that he saw move it was his
               head and that the word that he best thinks
               describes this movement is that of a twitch."

    At D:

               "On reflection, sir, he feels he would be much
B              more skilful if he were required to perform this
               action again and he cannot discount the
               possibility that he did not feel immediately in
               the right place for the carotid artery."

    At G :

               "     he cannot be categoric it was a pulse.  He
               feels he may well be mistaken in that matter,
               sir."

    At 266B:

               "In his original statement he referred to vomiting
               and thinking that Kevin had been sick. He has
D              given this matter some further thought and he is
               absolutely satisfied that Kevin was not sick. He
               did not see Kevin vomiting and he did not see
               vomit on the ground or on his clothing."


    At C:

               "     he does have a clear impression in his mind,
               sir, of a fluid of some sort in the mouth, but he
               cannot discount that that could be spittle or
               phlegm of some sort."


    Then at page 267E:

               "It was at this point, sir, that after
               approximately two minutes of the involvement of
               the woman St John's Ambulance Officer that the
               male St John's Ambulance Officer stood up and said
               'He's gone'. He referred to the expression being
               completely grey and would seek to reaffirm that
               choice of words as his description of Kevin at
               that particular moment in time. He says, sir,
               and I quote:

               'There is absolutely no doubt in my mind, both now
               and with the benefit of further training, that

                             26
H
             then at the moment the youth I had tried to save
             was dead, certainly dead, and beyond any further
             help.  I and St John's Ambulance personnel would
             not have stopped if there had been any glimmer of
             hope at all.  There was none.'"

        Then Mr Fraser was given the opportunity of asking

questions but said he had none, but he added this, that

Mr and Mrs Williams "are appreciative both of the efforts

the officer has made and of his visit and they have no

questions.     They have decided not to come today, sir."

        Dr Slater was again recalled and stuck to his original

position.     I do not think it would assist to go through his

evidence.

        The Coroner was not content to leave it there.   He

called Dr Gumpert, a consulting clinical neuro physiologist

and consulting neurologist.     He spoke of the brain stem and

said:

             "Once this part of the brain is dead, and that
             death occurs, as you heard from Dr Slater, in
             between four and six minutes after deprivation of
             oxygen, then the person is going to die."


At page 279D he said:

             "It seems clear to me, sir, in this case that poor
             Kevin was probably dead before he got out of the
             area in which he was standing.  I would agree with
             Dr Slater.  I would think consciousness was lost
             probably within ten seconds."

At F:

             "     after people are brain stem dead, they can
             twitch."


Page 276A:

             "     feeling the carotid pulse is quite difficult
             in somebody who has got a low blood pressure, as
             would have been h e r e ."

     At page 313 in the bundle is to be found a statement by

Debra Martin made on 17th March 1990.      I should read a few

extracts from this.      She said, on the first page:

             "My recollection of the events of that day are
             vague and confused.  As a result of the disaster I
             was prescribed medication by my Doctor to assist
             me to sleep.  I was really upset by the whole
             incident and was on medication for about a week.
             The result being that I was in state of what I can
             only describe as a state of semi-consciousness.  I
             felt like a 'Zombie.'"


She went on say that she can recall carrying a youth who she

now knows to be Kevin Williams from the pitch to the

gymnasium.     At the top of page 315:

             "I didn't want to believe the boy was dead.  I
             didn't know if he was dead or not but I decided
             that I had got to attempt to revive him.  I
             started to give him mouth-to-mouth but someone, I
             don't know who, touched me on the shoulder and
             told me he was dead.  By this time my head had
             gone, I wasn't aware of what I was doing or what
             was really happening.



                  under the circumstances I cannot be positive
             that the details are accurate.  I have been quite
             badly affected by the whole incident and I am
             trying to erase it from my memory."

     It is to be noted that when a specific piece of

evidence, or pieces of evidence, arose which might suggest

that one of the deceased might have been alive after

3.15 pm, the Coroner showed flexibility by going into it.

     We were told that some while after, Mrs Williams, the

deceased's mother, made contact with Police Constable Bruder

and Woman Police Constable Martin, and they alleged that


                             28
they had been pressurised into changing their stories and

that they now stuck by their original versions.         Where does

the truth lie?     I see no fault in the Coroner in this

matter.   He made full inquiry.     He was not asked by the

applicant's representative to do more.      There was

overwhelming medical evidence that the deceased was in fact

dead by 3.15 pm.     In my judgment it would not be right to

quash the verdicts and order a new inquest on the strength

of these allegations made against the investigating police

officers.

     Before leaving this deceased, however,     it would be

convenient to deal with a further point made by Mr Jones

which concerns this deceased.      This Court agreed to look de

bene esse at a letter written to the relative's solicitors

by a pathologist, Dr West.      It is dated 29th October 1993.

At their request he had looked at the post mortem reports

and photographs.    This was. the first time he had seen them,

some four and a half years after the deaths.      He had not

been present at the post mortems or seen the bodies.        No

request had been made to the Coroner either at the mini or

main inquest to call him.      On the strength of a sight of the

reports and photographs, he doubts Dr Clark's diagnosis.         He

thinks there was substantial damage to the neck, possibly

caused by being crushed under people's feet.      This type of

injury, he says, is amenable to an emergency tracheotomy and

there was a realistic possibility that this young man was

still alive after 3.15 pm, though unlikely to have spoken


                          29
the word 'Mum' if he had suffered convulsions.

     As I have indicated, no question arises of the Coroner

having refused to hear this witness.    He is in no way at

fault in this respect.     If the Attorney General's fiat had

been given, the discovery of new facts or evidence could,

under section 13 (1) of the 1988 Act, have been held to make

it necessary or desirable in the interests of justice that a

new inquest be held.     I have grave doubts, however, whether

there is any power to look at fresh evidence of this nature

and in these circumstances in an application for judicial

review.   But, in any event, I find it of far too tenuous a

nature to justify ordering a new inquest.    I note that in R

v the Coroner for Inner North London, ex parte Linnane 155

JP 343, where the Coroner was held to have been wrong to

have refused the applicant's request to call a particular

doctor, the Divisional Court refused to order a new inquest,

or even to quash the verdict of the one that had occurred,

on the ground that it was 2 1 months since it had occurred

and the resolution of complex medical issues was not so

important as to overcome the other considerations against

holding a new inquest.

     As to Ian Glover, in the Coroner's documents volume 1

at page 249 is to be found the evidence of Professor Usher,

the pathologist in this case.    He said:

          "I give the cause of death as traumatic asphyxia.
          That means he died because his chest wall was
          compressed so it could not move in and out. When
          that happens you are not able to breathe properly
          and you die really in that way.  Mercifully,

objection at all to you consulting with my Officers, keeping
a watch on the lists, assessing the witnesses as to whether
or not you should be present. We will do whatever we can
by supplying the same information as we have supplied up to
now to you or to your instructing solicitors. I hope that
helps.

      MISS SINCLAIR: Sir, I am very grateful and I would
say again that it is not in the least our wish to delay the
Court by an adjournment and we are planning various means
of keeping an eye on what is going on. Thank you.

      THE CORONER: Is there anything you want to say in
the absence of the jury so that you don't have to wait until
we have finished with the video.  If there were I would send
them out and deal with it now?

      MR. MANNING:   Witnesses for Monday, sir?

      MR. JONES: It is intended P.C. Grunhill; Sergeant Smith
subject to his fitness to return to duty Inspector Hand-Davis;
Sergeant Thomas and Police Constable Wilson is also warned
as well sir.

      THE CORONER: These are all, I think, mounted Officers
of one sort or another.

                       (Short adjournment)


      THE CORONER: Right, we are going to watch the
compilation tape, as it is known. You will remember it
is split in two. We will watch to the end of the first
section.

             (Compilation video shown to the jury)

      THE CORONER:   Can you just pause there for a minute?
The Jury have asked whether a particular gate is opened.
They, have given me a little drawing. In fact it is the gap
in a wall within.the concourse area. It is not in this
picture. That was not actually a gate. There was a gate
there but it was a gap in the wall so you could get
through.

     Is there anything that you want to say to me
without the Jury being present, because we could do
this now to save you time?

     MR. PAYNE: I do not mind if the Jury are here.   I
would like to just mention the question of exhibits.
You did say earlier that the deadline for the
introduction of further photographs or exhibits would
be at the adjournment of the Court next Wednesday.

      THE CORONER: I think you misunderstood me, Mr.
Payne. What I meant was the deadline - and even then
I put a caveat in - was for nominations for further
witnesses whom you wished me to consider, not
exhibits, because exhibits we might well want to
introduce as we go along.   So there is no deadline on
that because we do not know what we might need.   What
I was trying to do was get you to compile, if you have
any additional names, those names so that I can
consider them.   I think I did say - I intended to say
- that even if we have past the deadline, if something
crops up and there is a witness who is considered by
any of you as really vital, then I will look at that,
but I do not want to get dozens of them in January
time.

    MR. PAYNE:   Thank you very much.

     THE CORONER:  We will go and have coffee then and
we will be back in quarter-of-an-hour. I think that
seems to be quite a good time.  I do not think we can
do it in much less time really.

I ANTHONY JAMES EDWARDS will say:         I was born on


I work as an ambulance man on day work.         I joined SYMAS In
September 1988.     I started part time and was promoted to day
work on 6th March 1989.           I had previously been In the
ambulance service In 1973 in Liverpool and had received
qualified status.       I had done further training which lead to
me being admitted as a Fellow of the Ambulance Service
Institute.       This    is   a qualification   above   the normal
standard but it is not a paramedics course although it is an
introduction to it.       I left the service in 1982 and went to
Sheffield Polytechnic to do social studies.             I worked in
adult education until I rejoined the service.


On Thursday and Friday I worked a shift of 0800 hours to
1630 hours.


On Saturday I was to work from 0900 hours to 1730 hours.         I
was with                  who is a qualified ambulance man and
was acting as driver.


The first I remember about the Hillsborough incident is when
we were taking a patient to the Northern General Hospital.
We heard control telling a crew from Rotherham to go to the
gym at Hillsborough where they would be met by a station
officer.     I thought that it would be some form of a fight
going on.     Our radio was on the day frequency which I think
is channel         We stayed on the channel all the way through
the   day.    We    did      change   to    ERC   a*— T "       0


It was about 1510 to 1515 hours when we were on our way to
the Northern General Hospital.         tfe arrived at Northern
General about 5 minutes later.     There were various messages
coming over the radio but I was concentrating on the patient
In the ambulance.     We took the patient Into the hospital and
It was sometime before 1530 hours when we got back to the
ambulance and started to clean up.     We then gave the call to
control that we were clear.      I made the call on channel         <t|
Control then told us to go to Hillsborough gym entrance
where we would be met by an ambulance officer.        We did not
know which side the gym entrance was on and I was going to
use the radio to try and find out where the entrance was.
We went down to the traffic Island on Herrles Road which Is
about one and a half miles away.            Control then gave a
message to all mobiles.      They repeated that It was for all
mobiles and said that they were to proceed to the gym
entrance at Hillsborough as they had notification of some
fatalities.   I think this was around 1530 hours.      We arrived
at the ground at about 1532 hours.         There were no problems
in approaching the ground until we reached the junction of
Herrles Road,      South and Penlstone Road.      There were two
ambulances In front of us and a police officer was directing
us to park behind them.       A short time later, probably no
more than a minute we were moved into the entrance while the
next ambulance was sent to the further gate.              I saw
       standing outside the first entrance and pointing for us
to go Into It.      The police officer shouted to us that If we
went to the second entrance then we would be able to get out
via the first entrance.              Bald no and that he wanted us

to go into the first entrance.           We did so.    We were met by
Mr.Hopkins       the     Assistant      Chief   Aabulance      Officer.
Mr.Hlgglns was also there.           Higgins told us to drive up
behind an ambulance which was already parked and almost at
the same time Hopkins told us to go on to the field.                  At
this    stage    there    were   rows    of   police   with   vans   and
stretchers coming out of the entrance on to the pitch.                It
was clear that there were dead bodies on at least two of the
stretchers.      I would say the time was about 1535 hours.


We were stopped by a police officer at the entrance to the
corridor to the pitch.           The officer at the front of the
ambulance said that we could not get through.                 Spectators
were shouting at us about a body on a stretcher.              We stopped
and Hopkins came up to the ambulance and opened the door.              I
said that the police officer said that we could not go
through and he replied that he wanted us on the pitch
Immediately.     He said that there were casualties at the far
end of the ground and he needed us on the pitch and that we
were not to stop for anyone until we got to the far end of
the ground.       He told us to put our two tones on and go
through.        We did    as we were told and went past the
policemen.     It was slow progress getting on to the pitch but
we certainly did not get stuck.        On the pitch we saw five to
six boards being used as stretchers with bodies thereon
being carried by fans.       We drove past them while they were
screaming at us        to stop.   The St.John's       ambulance was
leaving the pitch as we came through the entrance.                   It
waited until we were out of the way before going off the
pitch.    We were the only ambulance on the pitch by this
stage.    We drove up to the 18 yard box In front of the west
stand.    There were people everywhere.       My driver was looking
for an officer but we could not find one anywhere.                There
were fans bashing on the ambulance wanting us to stop and
help their friends.      We were approached by a woman and she
shouted      through   the   window    and    said   that   she    had
resuscitated a casualty.       I got out of the vehicle with a
bag, mask and airways, and went to a body which was lying In
front of the goal In the 18 yard area.           Someone was giving
mouth to mouth resuscitation.         1 noticed the colour of the
patient and was doubtful whether the patient had In fact
been revived.    All the time there were people shouting at me
for oxygen and all I could remember shouting was "one at a
time."     I knelt down over a male casualty and someone
deliberately kicked me In the back and said "what about my
daughter."     I continued to look after the boy on the floor.
I decided that we needed to move him.            I told the people
around me to pick him up and I shouted to someone to bring a
girl that I had also briefly seen.           I would say It was now
about 1540 hours.        I looked for my driver and he had driven
over to the other side of the goal towards the corner flag.
We carried the bodies over to the ambulance and I was being
followed by people carrying other bodies.             When I got to the
ambulance I saw that someone had already opened the back
doors.      I asked a police officer to stay with me to look
after me after I was kicked.           We put the young boy on the
left hand side and the girl on the right hand side and
someone else put another body on the floor down the middle.
Then someone tried to get another person into the ambulance.
I shouted to the policeman to take the person off and he did
so.


When I turned round again the ambulance was packed with
people and so I asked the police to clear the ambulance.
The doors were closed but I could hear people kicking the
back doors and wanting attention.              In the ambulance there
were     now   three    bodies,     a nurse,    two   policemen,    two
spectators, my driver and me.            One of the spectators was
trying    to revive       the   young boy.      The   nurse was    from
Nottingham.     She had been a spectator who had volunteered to
help during the chaos on the pitch.          She was using a bag and
mask correctly.        The other spectator was holding the head of
the girl.      I t o l d | t o          get going.          put on the
lights and horns and drove off the pitch.              I have no idea
what time it was by now.          I assume that the man on the floor
was dead.      I tended to the girl and showed how to do mouth
      to mouth resuscitation while       the   spectator did cardiac
      compressions.      I was very upset by this stage.     I cannot
      remember anything about getting out of the ground and I do
      not know what time it was.         I remember nothing of the
      journey up to the Northern General Hospital.


9.    We took the three bodies into casualty and I assisted the
      doctor for a few minutes.     We then loaded trolleys back on
      to the ambulance.     I asked the spectator nurse to come back
      with us and she agreed.     I cannot remember any instructions
      as to what we were to do next.      We drove back down to the
      ground and I could hear conversations on the radio to do
      with Hillsborough but I was not really taking them in.


10.   There were no problems in the approach to the ground, with
      police cars everywhere.      This time we went    through the
      second entrance.    There were a couple of ambulances ahead of
      us.    I also saw a West Yorkshire ambulance.   I said to
              that I would report to an officer to see what wanted
      to be done.     I went to an ambulance officer in the yard
      although I do not know his name.     He said that___________
      was to stay with his vehicle and that I was to help as much
      as I could.     I went back to the ambulance to tell        to
      stay with his vehicle but discovered that he had gone.       I
      went to the next ambulance and helped myself to a first aid
      box.   Just then a casualty on a trolley was brought up.    He
      appeared asthmatic and semi-conscious.       I put him on the
second     ambulance.    Then   the   attendant   on   the   second
ambulance,                arrived with another casualty.       Once
they were loaded, that ambulance set off to the hospital.


I then met another officer whom I did not know.        He told me
to help some of the casualties out and pointed towards the
gym.   I did not realise before this that the casualties were
in the gym.      I went into the gym and met Station Officer
Higgins.     He said that I was to assist priorities.        I then
helped with trolleys and directed arriving ambulance men to
priority casualties.    Each time I loaded a priority onto a
trolley I went back to the senior officer in the yard to
tell him what I had done and asked for more instructions.
He would then tell me to go looking for priorities again.


At one stage I offered to be a runner because there appeared
to be no communication system between the officers at the
ground as the radios were not working.     Within a short space
of time we did not need trolleys and were onto the walking
wounded.     By this time I felt exhausted and explained to
Station Officer Higgins that I had been kicked.        He told me
that I had to go to casualty.     I did not want to.     He said
that there was a vehicle going to Hallamshire Hospital and
said that I should go with it.


I was at the Hallamshire for about 20 minutes.
then arrived with some doctors who were needed at casualty.
      it was quite by accident that we net up at the Hallamshire.


14.   The control officer on the radio told us to have a drink at
      the Hallamshire.           We did so and we took two transfers to
      King Edward Hospital.            We finished at King Edwards at about
      1900 and then control told us that we were finished.              We
      went back to the station, cleaned the ambulance and went off
      shift.


15.   I was not aware that there was any Hillsborough plan or of
      the role that the gym was the play in it.          I did not realise
      that     the   gym   was    the casualty clearing centre or      the
      temporary mortuary until I was told by one of the officers.
      I was aware of the major incident plan priorto this.

               INQUEST INTO THE DEATH OF KEVIN DANIEL WILLIAMS
           MR. FRASER:   Sir, you will now hear evidence delating
      to Kevin Daniel Williams. Kevin's mum and dad are in Court
      with the social worker from Merseyside who has been
      assisting them. The solicitors for Kevin's mum and dad are
      members of my Group and I therefore appear in the usual
      guise as their agent to the Steering Committee.
        THE CORONER:   Good morning, Mr. and Mrs. Williams.
  .
  ‘Before we begin I am going to explain to you the general
   format of the Inquest because you weren't here a fortnight
   ago, were you, and even if you were you might have
   forgotten. We will start in a moment or two by me reading
   to you what was said.on 18th April 1989 which is when I
   opened the Inquest in this very room. Then if there are any
   amendments which need to be made, if we have got some of the
   facts wrong, we will sort that out. I will then tell you
   what the blood alcohol levels were, as measured by
   Dr. Forrest, and then we will turn to Dr. Slater, who is the
   Pathologist sitting up there behind you. He will give us
   the pathological evidence. I think I can safely say that
   if, after this Inquest over, you feel you would like to talk
   to Dr. Slater privately he is quite happy to do that if it
   would be-of any help to you. When Dr. Slater has finished
   the West Midlands Police Officers have prepared a summary
   for me and he will deal with that and tell rne about it.
       Then we will hear from Inspector Layton, another West
  Midlands Police Officer, who will deal with the visual
  evidence. He will first of all tell me all about the plans
  and so on and that is sometimes a bit confusing because
  there are a lot of references given- but when he has finished
  talking about it he comes over and shows us on these big
  plans so that all of us, that is me, you, the Jury and
  everybody else can follow it- Then when that is done we
  conclude and take no further evidence at this, stage. Is
  that reasonably clear? I like to tell you so that you know
  what to expect. Otherwise you don't know what is coming.
       This then is the resumed Inquest which was opened on
  18th April 1989 and on that occasion Neil Anthony Parkin,
  Acting Coroner's Officer, said:
               "The body which is the subject of this Inquest has been
               identifled.to PC 1269 Glave of the South Yorkshire
               Police as that of Kevin Daniel' Williams by James
               Stephen Williams, his father. He was 15 years of age
               having been born on 27th May 1973 at Southport.. He
               1ived at                                            He
               was a schoolboy by occupation. He died at Hi 1lst>orough
               Football Ground following an incident there on

                                      1

                                                                 1009
                                        DR- DAVID NEIL SLATER


     Saturday, 15th April 1989- PC Glave caused the body to
     be removed to the Medico Legal Centre and there he
     identified it to Detective Constable Simon Weigold who
     subsequently identified the same body to Dr. Slater-
     It is the family wish that the body should be
     cremated."
      I adjourned the Inquest at that point. I wrote to you
 shortly afterwards and you, Mr. Williams, very kindly signed
 it on 1st flay 1989 and I checked with you the details and
 you confirmed the name, that we had got it right, date of
 birth 27.5.73, that is right, isn't it, and the place of
,birth which was Southport wasn't it? We typed it into the
 wrong spot in your case but you spotted that.
     Dr. Forrest did the alcohol levels for many of the
people who died, including Kevin, and the level in respect
of Kevin was 56 milligrammes per 100 mils.
             DR. DAVID NEIL SLATER - Called
                      By THE CORONER:
Dr. Slater. - A. Sir, my name is Dr. David Neil Slater. I
am a Consultant Histopathologist and a Fellow of the Royal
College of Pathologists.
     THE CORONER:   Before I go on, Mr. Williams, you are
true dad of this lad.
     MR. WILLIAMS:    Stepfather.
     THE CORONER:   Thank you very much. You are mum, yes.
Mr- Fraser, so that we get the. record right. Is this an
informal or a proper adoption because obviously the lad
carries the same surname?
     MR. FRASER:   There is no formal adoption but it is a
twelve years plus.
     THE CORONER:    Pardon?
     MR- FRASER:   There has been no formal adoption by
Mr- Williams as such but the relationship is more than
twelve years old.
     THE CORONER:   I am very sorry, Dr. Slater, to have
interrupted you. Just remind us of your name because I have
forgotten where.we were up to? Just start again? - A. My
name is Dr. David Neil Slater, Consultant Histopathologist,
sir.
Dr. Slater, in the usual way you are satisfied that the
evidence you are going to give me in this case relates to

    Kevin Daniel Williams who was also identified as No. 51, is
    that right? - A. That is correct, sir.
 Q. Ident i-ficat ion was done by Inspector Timms so far as you are
    concerned? - A. That was the initial identification.
Q. Eut there is no doubt in your mind about the identity? -
A. No.
Q. There were various marks on the body itself to identify it?
A. Sir, Kevin was clearly labelled both by number- and by name.
Q. Dr- Slater, would you be kincj enough then to take me through
  ‘the post mortem? - A. My examination of Kevin showed that
   the main finding was that of asphyxia. This opinion was
   formed through the extensive blueness on the face and upper
   part of the chest. In addition there were small
   haemorrhages in both the face and internal organs including
   the brain, heart and lungs. This asphyxia had clearly
   resulted from compression of the neck and chest and this
   opinion was supported by the presence of three small
   scratches over the left side of the neck and also over the
   front of the voice box. This had also resulted in four
   fractures to the small bones in the actual voice box. In
   addition there was evidence of bruising to the lungs, again
   supporting compression of the chest.
        My autopsy showed that Kevin was a normally developed,
   fit, healthy, young male with no evidence of any natural
   disease which could have contributed towards death and it
   was my opinion that Kevin had a normal life expectancy. In
   terms of the mode of death the compression of the neck or
   chest has occurred here and unconsciousness occurs very
   rapidly, certainly within a few seconds, and there is one
   reported case of it occurring apparently instantaneously.
   Following unconsciousness then there is no discomfort and no
   pain. Death then occurs after approximately three to five
   minutes, sir.
Q. So because when we say asphyxia people think of agony for
   ages and ages. What you are saying is that the person
   himself would very rapidly not know anything at all about
   what was happening? - A. I should say the word "asphyxia" is
   unfortunate in that scientifically it partly includes simply
   that there is not enough oxygen in the blood. It doesn't
   imply actual suffocation and prolonged death.
Q. Did you say there were four fractures to the voice box? -
A. Yes, there are two bones in the voice box, as you know, sir,
   and both these showed two fractures each-.
Q. Now the reason why I asked you was this, and I want to put
   this to you because I would like to get your view on it, one
   Officer will be dealing with the value of this evidence in a
                             3

  moment but she says that at a point when this lad was in the
  gymnasium, in other words he had already been moved across
  the pitch, she says she helped him into the gym from the
 pitch, presumably she carried him. He stopped breathing.
 She gave him the kiss of life, did some heart massage, he
 opened his eyes said a word and died. Now in the light of
 your pathological findings, is that in fact a possibility,
 do you think:* - A. Well, sir, I was aware of this statement
 and therefore I have clearly given this matter considerable
 thought, sir. I think there are several comments to make
 but the moderately large number of autopsies I did from this
 incident, sir, this was certainly the most severe case of
 traumatic asphyxia that I actually dealt with- This was
•both in terms of blueness of the face and also the area of
 pallor of whiteness around the mouth. Sir, it was a very
 very severe form of asphyxia and I do not think that
 unconsciousness would have been quicker than three or five
 seconds. I have no reason to alter what I have already said
 on that aspect.
     The other very significant thing about this, and it also
supports the severity of this case, is that again of the
autopsies I did approximately 15 per cent had some sort of
fracture to the voice box, the larynx. This case was highly
unusual in that in fact it had four fractures to the larynx.
It was by far the most severe case of voice box fractures.
Not only does this indicate the severity of the traumatic
asphyxia at the time but it also in fact makes it virtually
impossible for the person to have spoken by virtue of the
fact that there were fractures to the voice box, sir. So
all I can say, sir, that scientifically and medically I find
that inconceivable that the person could have spoken.
The other thing I notice is that you show in this particular
case extensive congestion of the cerebral veins and
cereballum arid cortical coning and.if a person speaks his
neurons are working, aren't they? - A.    That is right.
That evidence would indicate there had been extensivebrain
damage and he couldn't really communicate. Would that be
right? I don't want to put words in your mouth but I want
to be sure about that? - A. The coning indicates the
severity of the asphyxia and again that would have resulted
in irreversible brain damage which again would totally
prohibit any form of communication.
I have thought about this comment as well, of course, and
there are several explanations (1) that it didn't occur and
that the observer is mistaken but another possibility that
has occurred to me and I want to put it -to you and please
disagree if it is not either right or you don't accept it;
it is possible, is it not, that if a person having died is
moved air or stomach contents might be expelled and might
make a sound as it escapes, so to speak? Is that a

possibility? - A. In is an interesting comment, sir, because
it is a possibility I considered also myself .and that is
certainly an explanation to the noise which could have been
made which may have mimicked the word "mum" but it would not
explain the opening of the eyes, sir.
No. - A. Eut it would explain the noise.
     HR. FRASER:   No questions, sir, but thank you very
much, Dr. Slater, for that sympathetic and detailed
explanat ion.
     THE CORONER:    Any otherxquestions for Dr. Slater?
Thank you very much. Dr. Slater. We spent a lot of time
thinking about this sentence because it was difficult. I
didn't think it was possible from what I knew of the
evidence but, on the other hand, we didn't want you to feel
that we weren't telling you what was in the statements. We
felt it was b°t.ter for you to hear it and have it explained
rather than for us to keep it under wraps, so to speak, and
you might possibly find out sorne other time. I hope T have
taken the right decision. I don't know. The only person
who knows that is you. We did spend a lot of time thinking
about it wondering what to do for the best.
          FOLICE SERGEANT JOHN fCILLOCll   •Cal led
                     Bv THE CORONER:
Yes. - A. Police Sergeant John Killoch\, sir, of the West
Midlands Police. 1 have previousYy' taken the Oath.
Could you then please, if you would, take me through the
statement? - A. At 0700 hours on Saturday, 15th April 1939,
Mr. James Stephen Williams saw his son, Kevin Daniel
Williams, leave the family home with- the intention of
travelling to Sheffield. He was to travel by train with a
number of friends to watch the Semi Final football match at
Hillsborough Stadium. Kevin had a ticket for the match.
     Andrew Duncan travelled to Sheffield with Kevin, Thomas
James Nickson and Gregory Fagen. They travelled by train,
arriving at Sheffield at 1040 hours. Gregory Fagen left the
others at the station. The other three youths caught a bus
from the station to Hillsborough Stadium where Thomas
Nickson left them.
     Andrew Duncan entered the stadium with Kevin at about
1330 hours via the Leppings Lane turnstiles. They initially
stood together in Enclosure 4 but shortly after they moved
to Enclosure 3. At about 1445 hours Andrew Duncan saw other
friends on the terraces, including Anthony Maxwell Grier and
Stuart Thompson. Stuart, of course, also lost his life at
Hillsborough.

     Ac about 1455 hours Andrew Duncan was still with Kevin
and although the crowd in the enclosure was tightly packed
he was not too concerned at that stage. As the match
started he was pushed forward down the terrace and did not
see Kevin again.
     Following the severe crushing in the West Stand
terracing Police Constable Michael John Craighill went into
Enclosure 3 and assisted a number of casualties. Police
Constable Craighill assisted to carry a youth, he now
believes to be Kevin, from the^gate in the perimeter fence
of Enclosure 3 and on to the pitch. The Officer attempted
resuscitation but without success.
     Derek William Bruder, an off-duty Police Constable from
the Merseyside Police who was a spectator at the match,
recalls seeing a person lying on the pitch near the Spion
Kop/North Stand of the ground. The person as having
convulsions. Hr. Bruder went on to the pitch and gave mouth
to mouth resuscitation aided by a St- Johns Ambulanceman who
carried out cardiac massage. Mr. Bruder recalls that a
friend of the casualty was with hirn on the pitch.
Resuscitation was continued and they were joined by a St.
Johns Ambu1ancewoman who took over from Mr. Bruder. After a
short time the St. Johns Ambulanceman said that the casualty
was dead. Mr. Bruder then left the scene.
     Neither- of the St. Johns Ambulance personnel or the
friend of the casualty have been identified. The person
Mr. Bruder tried to resuscitate is now known to be Kevin.
     Special Constable Debra Martin went on to the pitch to
assist and she helped to carry several deceased persons and
many injured persons to the gymnasium. She assisted to
carry one youth who she now knows to be Kevin into the
gymnasium where she remained with him.
     At 1606 hours Dr. Curpen examined Kevin in the
gymnasium which had been established as a temporary
mortuary. Dr. Curpen certified life extinct.
     Special Constable Martin later escorted Kevin's body to
the Medico Legal Centre and she confirmed the identification
by reference number to DC Weigold.
     On Sunday, 16th April 1989, Mr. James Stephen Williams
identified the body of his son to Police Constable Scott
Glave.
     On Sunday, loth April, following identification by
Detective Constable Weigold, Dr. David Slater carried out an
autopsy and submitted a report giving the cause of death.

     Evidence is included regarding the analysis of -a blood
sample taken from Kevin where th<2 presence of ethanol was
detected. The witnesses proving continuity of the blood,
sample are Detective Constable Green, Detective Sergeant
Turner and Detective Sergeant Fletcher. Dr. Alexander
Robert Forrest carried oat the analysis.
     Found in Kevin’s personal effects was a ticket
counterfoil which is consistent with his entry to the
stadium via a turnstile. That concludes my evidence, sir.
There is visual evidence-
I think I am right in saying, am 1 not, that Mr. Bruder (I
am looking at page 47) identifies Kevin from clothing, is
that right 7* - A. He has been shown phonographs which show
Kevin which Mr. Layton will deal with later and one of the
photographs I believe does show Hr. Bruder actually giving
first aid.
So there is no doubt about it that Mr. Bruder was involved?
No.
His personal recollection isn't as strong? - A. No, but what
he does recollect is corroborated by the visual evidence.
We have already mentioned the evidence of Special Constable
Martin who said about the lad speaking. In no way do I want
to run poor Special Constable Martin down because she had a
very hard day but it is right she was obviously from her
statements very distressed? - A. I also wouldn't want to
criticise UPC Martin in any way but I have interviewed her
twice, sir, and she was particularly upset as indeed many
people were but it affected her particularly badly the
events of that day-
     THE CORONER:  Well, I won't ask you to draw a
conclusion. Mr. Fraser.
     MR. FRASER:   There is a matter arising out of what the
Officer says which may perhaps leave a doubt in Kevin's
parents' minds. Can I ask you to ask Dr. Slater to deal
with the point that was made in paragraph six of the
summary, sir?
     THE CORONER:    About the convulsions?
     MR. FRASER:    Yes, sir-
     THE CORONER:   Yes, I will do that.      I will ask
Dr. Slater to come down in a moment.
    MR. FRASER:     Thank you, sir.
    THE CORONER:     Is there anything else you want to ask?

     MR. FRASER:    No, thank you, sir.
     THE CORONER:    I will recall Dr'. Slater.
            DR. DAVID NEIL SLATER - Recalled
                     Bv THE CORONER:
Dr. Slater, the point that is being made, of course, you
have got 1 : 0 remember that Mr.xEruder was at theSpion Kop
end, thebottom end and not the top, and he says, "Isaw
this man lying on the floor having convulsions". Can you
help us about that"? What does that add or not to your
pathological opinion? - A. It is obviously very distressing.
Unfortunately when people have not got enough oxygen in the
brain, as I said in my earlier evidence, which is really
what the word "asphyxia’1 means, individuals can in fact have
fits. This is one of the mechanisms that leads towards
death and makes the asphyxia worse. This does, however,
only occur when the individual is totally unconscious. It
does not mean there will be any pain or discomfort. The
person will not know they are fitting and actually I have to
accept that some individuals do have convulsions and it is
one of the mechanisms leading to death in traumatic
asphyxia, sir.
Does it make you feel the other evidence about the lad
breathing and speaking either more or less likely because
obviously this would be much closer in time to Special
Constable Martin's evidence than what had happened on the
terrace? - A. Yes. For somebody to have convulsions, this
would imply that the amount of ’asphyxia is such that there
must be virtually irreversible brain damage present and
again this would fully support the concept that the evidence
of opening eyes and speaking is not really conceivable, sir.
     THE CORONER:   Does that help, Nr. Fraser.
              Cross-Examined by NR. FRASER:
     MR. FRASER:   I am sure it does, Dr. Slater. It is
difficult to find the phrase to sum the situation up. Kevin
at that stage was beyond help. He was as good as dead? - A.
Yes, that is right, absolutely.
And would feel nothing and know nothing? - A. Absolutely.
He would know nothing.

       Sir, an examinition has been nia.de of video film and
photographic evidences and Kevin ha.s been identified in
Enclosure Mo- 3, also, sir, being carried dcross the pitch
■ana at. -the Spicn Kop end of  the ground.
     On a. photograph referenced DAC3/1 Kevin is shown
apparently unconscious near the perimeter fencing in
Enclosure No. 3. On a BBC video tape, referenced MAP 7,
timed at 1523:33:22 this shows him being removed from the
terraces via. Gate No- 3.
      PC Craighill has signeda plan of the pitch showing
wl^ere he first came into contac't with Kevin and where in
fact he laid him on the ground and that plan, sir, is
referenced MJC2. The Officer has identified himself on
video, again a BBC video tape, MAP 7, timed at 1528:43:24
carrying a youth who he knows to be Kevin - that is a typing
error there. It says Keith in the summary but it should be
Kevin - from Gate 3 and on to the pitch. The Officer did
not know the identity of the youth and at first in fact
believed it t.o be another of the deceased but that has been
clarified-
      Photograph referenced PR5/32 and PR5/33 which are both
timed at 1532 show Kevin being carried across the pitch on a
temporary stretcher by a number of spectators and two Police
Officers. PC Hayes has confirmed his identification on
those photographs. The Officer assisted to carry two people
on temporary stretchers, both of whom were deceased, but he
couldn't recall any other details and he didn't know the
identity of the persons he carried. He merely, as it were,
assisted in carrying. We have mentioned that before. It is
not an unusual feature that people's reco11ections weren't
exac t-
     A number of photographs, including a photograph
referenced TT1/30 show Kevin being given mouth to mouth
resuscitation on the pitch by PC Bruder who confirmed his
identification. Sir, you mentioned this Officer earlier.
In fact, it is true to say Mr- and Mrs. Williams have
previously seen visual evidence. They have in fact seen
some of that visual evidence again today and I think I arn
right in saying they have confirmed that Kevin is shown on
that photograph so, as it were, PC Bruder is confirmed as
having given mouth to mouth resuscitation to Kevin.
The reason I asked is because it refers to a friend and
there doesn't seem to be any other evidence of that? -
No, that is right: It is true to say the initial
identification was from clothing but it has subsequently
been confirmed.
     Sir, can I refer you to a plan which has been given the
reference MWJL40 which is a plan of the terraces'?

Yes, C2G1 . - And KWJL41 which is a plan of the pitch.
HJC2 are they the same markings? - A. I would say, sir, that
in fact although there are two markings the re ference^.to MAP
7 on the previous plan actually would deal with PC Craighill
on that occasion.
So MUJL41 we make C202. Let us include that one as well
MJC2 will be C203. - A. Which is PC Craighill's plan.
(moved to plan) Sir, if we can deal with the plan HWJL40,
which is the plan of the terraces, the first photograph
DAC3/1 inferred Co in this summary indicates the position
her« (indicat ing? and this indicates Enclosure No. 3 and it
is at this point here (indicat ing) that- Kevin is shown quite
close to the perimeter fence.
     The second identification, MAP 7, the BBC tape', refers
to the identification by PC Craighill and the point a.t which
we see Kevin is approximately here (indicat ing) and it is
prior to his removal via Gate 3.
     Then, sir, in respect of PC Craighill's plan, MJC2, it
is a terrace plan he refers to but he actually indicates a.
position here (ind icat ing) in front of Gate 3 arid a further
position which is shown just off the plan but it is lure.
It is just on to the pitch.
It is diagrammatic? - A'. Yes.
Certainly the second location can't be taken as giving us
any sense of distance? - A. No, but factually the next plan
will do that. I think, sir, just to correct myself I should
have been pointing there.
Yes. - A- Sir, in respect of MWJL41, the video reference on
BBC tape, MAP 7, indicates a position here (ind icat-ing)
which accords with PC Craighill's recollection. There is
also photographic identification on PR5/32 which is where
Kevin is being carried across the pitch and the location
referred to is there (indi cat ing).
Remind me, do we know the time for that one? - A. Yes, I
think it is 1532, sir. Yes, 1532. A further photograph,
sir, TT1/30, which I think refers to PC Bruder, the location
of that is approximately this position here (indi cat ing)
which is towards the Spion Kop end of the pitch.
     THE CORONER:'    Mr. Fraser.
    MR. FRASER:      No questions.

                         Q. Was the phonograph with the reference DAC3/1 a timed
                            photograph? - A. No, sir.                               ■
                                       Cross-Examined by MR- CATCHPOLE:
                         Q. Andrew Duncan, did he show any visual evidence or did he
                            give a plan showing where he last saw Kevin, when they
                     B      parted company? - A. 1 don't believe so. Can you just give
                            me a moment? The answer is we don't have a plan from
                            Mr. Duncan.
                                 THE CORONER:    If I can help you a little bit on that
                           one, what Andrew Duncan says is, "We stood up and were
                           standing about two to two and a quarter yards from the
                           perimeter fence around the pitch. We were waiting for the
                           game to start. At about 1445 or so a group of friends were
                           standing behind me, Stuart Thompson and Tony Grier. I was
                           standing with Kevin Williams". Then he describes the people
                           corning out and he says, "When the game kicked off I was
                           pushed forward down the terrace about two yards. After this
                           push I lost Kevin and did not see him again". His final
                           remark is that he saw Kevin for the last time on the terrace
                     D     just before the crush started. “The last time I saw Kevin
                           was on the terrace just before the crush started. After
                           this I did not see him again".    That is his statement, just
                               chat we know what it is which one we are talking about,
                           dated 17.5.89. Anything else, Mr. Fraser, you want to ask?
                                MR. FRASER          sir ■

                                 THE CORONER:   Mr. and Mrs. Williams, that is the
                           evidence we are going to take. - As I said to you in the
                           middle of the hearing we spent quite a lot of tirne wondering
                           what we should do for the best- Obviously we knew Kevin
                           lost his life and we were worried about upsetting you in
                           Court but I think on balance we have done the right thing
                           because you have heard within the limits of what we are
                           doing and summarising the evidence what happened and what
                           went on- Fortunately, Dr. Slater has been able to be here
                           and he has been able to give you his opinion as to what
                           happened in his view and what in his view is possible and I
                           think I am sure that will help> you - not to come to terms
                           with the loss of your son but it is very difficult to come
                           to terms with that loss at all but just to appreciate in the
                           stress situation in which people found themselves
                           recollections, tend sometimes to be mistaken and indeed there
                     G     are lots of mistaken recollections not only in relation to
                           Kevin but also in relation to many of the other people of
                           which we have heard. That is not at all uncommon and occurs
                           in normal fatal incidents as well. It is exceedingly
                           difficult when you are suddenly confronted with a situation
                           to then recount exactly what happened.

                    KEVIN DANIEL WILLIAMS

         THE CORONER:    Now you may> remember on Wednesday I
  ke{> t you la te. ; I said I ■had to go ou t and do a little
  bit of thinking, and that is what we are going to deal
  with this afternoon.

       What we were thinking about was that one of the
  inquests which we had done related to Kevin Daniel
  Williams.    I will remind you of this inquest.   This
  was the case of another young man, in fact he was only
  15.    The problem in that case was that the evidence
  was difficult to unravel as to when he died and what
  had happened when he was being taken across the pitch
  and had he said something in the temporary mortuary and
  so on.

       After the inquest was concluded my attention was
 drawn by some of rny legal colleagues, and very
 rightlybecause they were realised it was a sensitive
 problem and did not want to upset the family, so they
 brought it to my attention privately first.     The point
 which they were bringing to my attention was that one
 of the witnesses appeared to say.that when he came to
 this young man at the Spion Kop end, more or less,, of
 the ground, he had convulsions and h e ’also said he
 could feel a pulse.     We knew from the visual evidence
 - we are going to repeat all the relevant evidence in a
 moment - we knew that he was being taken across the
 pitch and we had a timing at 1532.    Assuming that was
 right, this convulsion or whatever it was, was
 happening after that point of time.     The question was:
 what on earth was going on?

      I agreed that this was a valid point.    I think we
 were so concerned about the event which happened after
 that, namely, what happened in the gymnasium, did he
 speak or did he not speak - this was the lad with the
 fractured voice box - that we may not have.put quite
 enough concentration and thought into the earlier
 evidence, but we are going to do it now.   We are going
 to sort it out so that we know, as far as we are able,
 so that we understand, if we can, what h appened..

       I think if Sergeant Killoch could come back.

                   By THE CORONER

     THK WITNESS:   Sergeant John    Killoch   from the
West Midlands Police.

Sergeant Killoch,     you read - we are not going to
read the whole summary again because we don t need to—
but I think paragraph 5 which is where somebody starts
describing helping him from the terraces. - A.
Following the severe crushing in the West Stand
terracing Police Constable Michael John Craighill went
into enclosure 3 and assisted a number of casualties.
Police Constable Craighill assisted to carry a young
rnan he now believes to be Kevin Daniel Williams from
the gate in the perimeter fencing of enclosure 3 and on
to the pitch.

The officer attempted resuscitation but without
success.

Derek William Bruder is a Police Constable with    the
Merseyside Police who was off-duty at the match    that
day.   lie was a spectator in the North Stand.     He
recalls seeing a person lying on the pitch near    the
Spion Kop and North Standing and describes ,that   person
as having convulsions.

Mr. Bruder went on to the pitch and gave mouth to mouth
resuscitation, aided by a St. John's Ambulanceman who
carried out cardiac massage.    Mr. Bruder recalls that
a friend of the casualty was with him on the pitch.
Resuscitation was continued and they were joined by a
St. John's Ambulancewoman who took over from Mr. Bruder
and after a short time by a St. John's Ambulanceman.

The St. John's Ambulanceman said the casualty was dead
and Mr. Bruder then left the scene.

Neither of the St. John's Ambulance personnel or the
friend of the casualty have been identified.

The person Mr. Bruder tried to resuscitate is known to
be Kevin Daniel Williams and there is visual evidence
to show that, sir.

Then the next paragraph deals with the lady, police
officer.   Just read that next paragraph as well. - A.
Special Constable Debra Jane Martin went on to the
pitch to assist and helped to carry several deceased
and many injured to the gymnasium.   She assisted to
carry one young boy, now known to be Kevin, into the
gymnasium and she remained with him.

                 Ac         Mow what she said we are not going to deal with because
                            that was satisfactorily explained.  What we are
                            interested in is that bit which has been read.    If we
                            turn to page 41, I think I am right in saying that what,
                            Mr. Hruder says - he says he saw a person about a
                            quarter of the pitch length away from the Spion Kop? -
                            A. Yes.
                     B,     He was lying on the ground or thereabouts? - A. That is
                            correct, sir.                 -y.;'

                            He says he can remember this because he recollects an;
                            ambulance going past which locates it in his mind and
                            in fact he tried to flag it down? - A. Yes.

                            Then he says;

                                  "I saw this man lying on the floor having
                                  convulsions."

                            - A. That is his exact wording.

                            Then if we turn over the page and pick out the bits
                            that are relevant.   He says he went down and he went
                 D
                            up to this man:

                                  "...and then went to the man having convulsions."

                             - A. Yes, sir.

                            Then he says:
                     E
                                  "I was joined by a St. J o h n ’s Ambulanceman."

     J                       - A. Yes.
    J

                      0           "That chap said, 'You do mouth to mouth and I will
                                  do heart massage'".

                             - A. That is correct.

                         (I. He goes on to say:
                                   "I then took his pulse in his neck.                  I could feel
                                   a slight pulse."

                             - A. Yes, sir.
                     G
                             He then tried to resuscitate him, mouth to mouth, and
                             undressed him so he could do it more conveniently
                             probably. - A. Yes.

     "We continued to work on the man but after about
     five minutes he went grey and his face was
     withdrawn."      :>




Then eventually another St. John's Ambulance person
came and he left the man? - A. That is right.

This whole thing took quite a few minutes? - A. Yes,
obviously the officer had no conception of time.

Can you remind me about the visual evidence?     It is
just to make sure I have got it right that there is
visual evidence, both of Mr. Bruder... - A., One
photographic print was mentioned, sir, and was given
the reference number TT.1/30.    That is a photograph
which shows Kevin lying on the pitch.    The person has
been identified by Kevin's parents.    Shown about to
give mouth to inouth resuscitation of Kevin is a man who
has been identified as Police Constable Bruder.     PC
Bruder has identified himself on that.photograph.

Then there is another timed print, is it PR.5/32 or
PR.5/33, showing Kevin being carried across, paragraph
18? - A. There are two photographs, sir: PR.5/A/32,
which is timed at 1532 and PR.5/A/33.   That is -also
timed at 1532.

     THE CORONER:   Inspector Layton, just show us
where those photographs are.

     INSPECTOR LAYTON:   Yes, sir.    They are referred
to in the plan MWJL.42.   PR.5/32 is approximately at
this position here on the pitch.    That is the timed
photograph, sirT   TT.130 is not timed, but I believe
it is somewhere in this area here.    From recollection
I think I did that actually from what Mr. Bruder says
in his statement, about the positioning on the pitch.

                        Now can you summarise for me what he says? - A. Yes,
                        sir.   He starts off by referring and identifying his
                        two previous   statements to us, sir, the first or which
                        was approximately a fortnight after the disaster
                        itself, and a second statement in August of last year
                        was a very short statement in which he merely
                        identifies himself on the photographs that you have
                D       heard reference to, sir.

                        He goes on to say that I had shown him a number of
                        documents and plans, from which he was able to refresh
                        his memory.     He refers to the fact he had made some
                        notes on the  day after thedisaster but that they did
                        not refer specifically to his dealings with this
                        casualty.
                    E
                        He refers, sir, to joining Merseyside Constabulary in
                        1987 and receiving basic first-aid instruction during
                        his initial training.    That was both in theory and
                        practical application.    He refers, sir, following the
                        incident and his dealings with this youth, to feeling
                        he was inadequately trained in his own- confidence,
                        although it is also true to say that he is absolutely
                        satisfied that the first aid he rendered on the day was
                        the very best he could do and he felt he could do no
                        more.    He goes on to say as a result of feeling
                        depressed about the incident he applied of his own
                        volition for further first-aid training within
                        Merseyside Police.    Indeed, he attended a full week,
                        Monday to Friday course, leading to a further
                        qualification and.much greater confidence in his own
                        ability.    However, with the benefit of tha.t training,
                        sir, he is able to reflect on his actions of the day
                        and he is still absolutely satisfied that the first aid
                        he rendered in terms of mouth to mouth and heart
                        massage were correct and he could have done no more for
                        Kevin.

that>I referred him to in his original statementy.- - .
Specifically, sir, from the transcript and police file^
he deals with page 41 of the police file statements,
which is page 6 of his original statement-in April last
year.   He refers and confirms seeing Kevin a quarter

circumstances.        He refers specifically to having seen
epileptic fits and says that what he originally
described as a convulsion was not anything like an
epileptic fit.        He goes on to say later, sir, that it
there was a part of the body that he s a w move it was
his head and that the word that he best thinks
describes this movement is that of a twitch.

He refers to comments he made originally about ,
approaching the body, the body that was convulsing,
ilavinp specifically considered it again, sir, he does
say that the body was not convulsing as he approached
it.    He referred originally, sir, to feeling ^ o r ^ a
carotid pulse and originally he thought he had detected
a slight pulse.    On reflection, sir, he feels he would
be much more skilful if he were required to perform
this action again and he cannot discount the ^
possibility that he did not feel Immediately in the
right place for the carotid artery.    He certainly felt
in the neck region where he   thought he would find the
artery but he cannot say he would have gone to it
directly.
I put to him, sir, the specific point I believe Dr.
Slater made in his evidence  about this inquest a couple
of days ago and PC Bruder specifically discounts having
felt for the carotid artery with his thumb.    He refers
to the first two fingers of his left hand.

He says in dealing with the carotid pulse that   he may
have touched other areas around the neck region,
including the Adam's apple and that whatever he felt
there he cannot be categoric it was a pulse-.    He feels
he may well be mistaken in that matter, sir.

Later in his statement of April last.year, sir, he
referred to the face of Kevin Williams going grey and
being withdrawn.   He wanted you to know, sir, that he
cannot specifically say he saw the face change from a
  normal pallor, or colour, to grey.   He mentioned it in
  his statement, sir, in the sequence that it occurred to
  him that he was now noticing that he was grey.   He may,
  have been grey as he approached hip before he mentioned
  it, or it may have occurred as he noticed it.

 In his original statement he referred to vomiting and
 thinking ’that Kevin had been sick.   He has given this
 matter some further thought and he is absolutely
 satisfied that Kevin was:not sick. ; He did not see
 Kevin vomiting and he did not scfe vomit on the ground
 or *on his clothing.             ’         -

. Does he still confirm that there was a distinctive .
  smell? - A. Yes, he does, sir.

 To finish with the vomiting aspect of his original
 statement, he does have a clear impression in his mind,
 sir, of a fluid of some sort in the mouth, but he
 cannot discount that that could be spittle or phlegm of
 some sort.

 He referred in his original statement to the original
 resuscitation attempts whereby he gave mouth to mouth
 resuscitation and the St. John's Ambulanceman commenced
 heart compressions.   His original thought,- sir, was
 that that was for approximately seven minutes and, give
 or take, he is happy with that time and thinks it is
 reasonably accurate.    He then later referred to
 swopping over with the St. John's Ambulanceman and PC
 Derek Bruder was then involved in external heart
 compressions and this was when he^noticed the unusual
 rib cage and he had earlier referred, sir, to
 unbuttoning his shirt, I believe.    He referred to
 unzipping his trousers and noticing some striped boxer
 shorts that you will see in the photographs that have
 been referred to, TT.1/31 and 32 respectively.

 I have put to him the apparent difficulties in the time
 sequence of the action that he describes near the Spion
 Kop end of the ground and his specific reference to an
 ambulance and asking the St. John's Ambulance colleague
 who was assisting him and who has not been identified,
 to stop the ambulance because he was considering
 utilising it, sir.

 I have drawn his -attention to the problems in relation
 to the known timing of ambulances arriving on the
 pitch, both of St. John's and of the South Yorkshire
 Metropolitan Ambulance Service and I have drawn his
 attention to the apparent discrepancy in relation to
 the time shown on photographs PR.5/A.32 and 3, sir.

                                 1532, sir, and that point has been put specifically to
                                 Mr. Bruder and try as he may he is simply unable to^
                                 reconcile those differences.              I have put to him, sir,
                                 was it f o r instance a question of one of those
                                 ambulances actually exiting the stadium across the
                                 pitch rather than entering the stadium.                    He has
                                 considered that point and try as he may his
                                 recollection is still of it being an ambulance that
                     D           entered the stadium.

                                 lie refers then to being joined by the womap St. John s
                                 Ambulance Officer, who he refers to pu s h i n g him out of
                                 the way to becocne involved as a trained first aider and
                                 recollects this was approximately six minutes after he
                                 changed places with the male ambulance officer.        for
                                 that reason, with the original seven minutes mouth to
                     E           mouth resuscitation, PC Bruder feels that that total of
                                 thirteen minutes he could amend to a period of time of
                                 between ten and fifteen minutes of sustained attempts
                                 to resuscitate Kevin.

                                 It was at this point, sir, that after approximately two
                                 minutes of the involvement of the woman St. John s
                                 Ambulance Officer, that the male St. John's Ambulance
                                 Officer stood up and said, “He's gone.”    He referred
                                 to the expression being completely grey and would seek
                                 to reaffirm that choice of words as his description of
                                 Kevin at that particular moment in time.   He says,
                                 sir, and I quote:

                                                 "There is absolutely no doubt in my mind, both now
                                                 and with the. benefit of further training, that
                                                 then at the moment the youth I had tried to save
                                                 was dead, certainly dead, and beyond any further
                                                 help.   I and St. John's Ambulance personnel would
                                                 not have stopped if there had been any glimmer of
                                                 hope at all.    There was none."

                                      Mr. Fraser, any questions of this officer on this
                                part?    I had better tell you who else I am going to be
                                calling.    Dr. Slater and Dr. Gurnpert, whom I will tell
                                you about when he comes.    He is a neuro physiologist,
                                a clinician, and an expert on this sort of thing.

                                      MR. FRASER:    No, sir, I have no specific
                                questions', save to say that I understand, Officer, you
                            D   have spoken to Mr. and Mrs. Williams, having spoken to
                                the officer?     I rise because I appear for Mr. and Mrs.
                                Williams and obviously have their interests at heart.

                                     THE WITNESS:   I did go and visit Mr. and Mrs.
                                Williams, sir, yesterday evening, having seen PC Bruder
                                and I have outlined briefly to them the contents of PC
                                Bruder's further thoughts and recollections for Kevin
                                on the day.

                                     MR. FRASER:   Sir, I understand they are
                                appreciative, both of the efforts the officer has made
                                and of his visit and they have noquesti ons.   They
                                have decided not to come today, sir, for reasons*which
                                I am sure you will understand but they are fully aware
                                of exactly what is going on on their behalf.

                                     THE CORONER:        Thank you.       Have you got any
                                quest ions?

                                      MR. LIMB:       No, thank you.

                                      HR. CATCHPObE;        No, thank you, sir.        ,
                            &        THE CORONER:   When we have heard the rest of the
                                evidence I am quite prepared to recall any of these
                                officers, or, indeed, any of these witnesses because I
                                want us to understand it.

                                       Dr. Slater.

recollection? - A. That is absolutely- correct ,\*sir.' Of
ali the cases I dealt;with-Kevin :showed: r e a U y | t h e ^
Woirst: injuries to t h e n e c k i n th-at there were four
fractures to the voice box.             In additIon there .were
t h r e e v e r y large scratches to-the neck.           In addition
to the normal signs of asphyxia, the blueness and the
hemorrhages which were very marked, there is no doubt
this was a very, very severe case of asphyxia and
probably the worst one I dealt with, sir.

We established to everybody's satisfaction what had
happened in the gymnasium and the account, we dealt
with that as to whether this lad could have spoken and
so on, so we don't need to be concerned about that.
What we are interested in this afternoon is the    ^
evidence relating to Mr. Bruder.   I will also remind
you that in general that what has been said is that a
person becomes unconscious in an asphyxial situation
within anything from zero to twenty to thirty seconds.
There is a slight variation amongst pathologists, but
quickly.   Then that death usual .supervenes within four
to six minutes or thereabouts.   The problem is, as you
have already heard, that whichever way you look at it,
Mr* Bruder was dealing with this young (nan quite a few
minutes after he had been taken out from the Leppings
Lane terraces.

In the light of the evidence can you help us as to what
you think was going on on? - A. Yes, sir.   I will deal
with this in three general areas and then Dr. Gumpert
certainly will come and enlarge on these and help us
out further.
 Firstly, and I apologise if this is an emotive area, I
 think I need just to spend thirty seconds m explaining
 what death i s . D e a t h is a sequence of eve.nts.  It is
 not one set event and the sequence I will put to you is
 an individual becoming unconscious;      whilst they are
 unconscious they quickly lose all sensation of pain and
 discomfort;   then there is a period of various tissues
 in the body which are susceptible to a lack of oxygen,
 dying.   The most important one of these is, of course,
 the brain, and after about three to six minutes the
brain undergoes irreversible brain damage.    There is
then a point which we call brain death.    This is a
difficult concept, but by this I am implying, that the"
brain is irreversibly damaged.   The brain is no longer'
able to control respiration and in fact that person,
for effective purposes, is dead, irreversibly.      That
is a medico legal definition, at least one med i c o :legal
definition, of death.

The problem now comes that I have not;mentioned- other
tissues in the body.   For example, ’ thev heart," a very
emdtive organ.   When somebody is brairirdead it<is
quite possible that the heart is sti1T •a1ive and still
beating and this can go on for a few minutes o r 4longer,
perhaps even half an hour.

Then we come to the point where the brain is dead, not
controlling respiration, and finally the heart stops
and that is really the point of whole body death and
that is really what the lay person understands by
death.  A. doctor going up, putting the stethoscope on
the chest, no heart beat, no respiration, then that
person is unequivocally dead.

I hasten to add there that although the person is truly
medico legally dead, in fact even then there are
tissues in the body that are still alive.   The skin is
still living.   The kidneys are still living.    This is
how we can then transplant them.   In fact it is an
emotive area and although that person is dead, there
are still tissues living.   It then takes another six
to twelve hours for all the tissues in the body to die.

Really, when we use the word "death" we have to be
very, very careful we are not talking about one set
event at one point in time.   We are talking about a
whole continuum of events that go on.

I mentioned that some tissues do not die as rapidly as
the brain and this includes both nerves and muscle.
In fact one can have a situation of somebody being
brain dead but the muscles and the nerves in what we
call the peripheral nervous system - not the brain -
are still living and in fact these can occasionally
function in some way.

Sir, that is a -general comment on death.

In relation to the Hillsborough incident, the sequence
that myself has given, and although I have not heard
the other pathologists I understand they have given a
very similar sequence of events, has been a rapid loss
of consciousness, perhaps five to ten seconds.   I
understand I have been the nearest by quoting a paper
where unconsciousness can be instantaneous.    That is
the rapid loss of consciousness.                      -

As soon as that person becomes unconscious I have said
several times that pain modalities, discomfort, again
disappear very, very quickly, perhaps within a second
or five seconds.

iriTVery general terms, certainly myself - and I have
tried to keep it general - I then said that death     and
I :have used the word very b»roadiy, as you wi 1 1 '
appreciate in my previous evidence - that death occurs
f iveV ten perhaps fifteen minutes after.>: I purpose1y
kept that very open because human beings are very
variable.    You cannot say that somebody is going to
die in fifteen minutes, and-not in fifteen rinutes.

I am trying to put the concept that although I have
talked about averages, very occasionally you are going
to have additional extremes.   I think Kevin was one of
these extremes that did not fall into this five, ten or
fifteen minute sequence of somatic death, whole body
death, but in fact this was extended.

Having said that, Kevin had extremely severe asphyxia.
I have no doubt in my own mind that he had'suffered
irrecoverable brain damage and death within the three
to six minutes that I said.   Therefore, I am quite
confident at that time that Kevin was dead and there is
nothing that anybody on this earth could have done for
him after that time, including PC Bruder and any
ambulance people who arrived.

Again, you will appreciate from what I have said to you
that although Kevin was brain dead I have not said that
other tissues in the body may not have been living -
the heart, muscles, nerves.    In fact I know Dr.
Gurnpert will explain in a minute that in fact there are
mechanisms whereby when somebody is brain dead in fact
the muscles in the body can twitch.    This will come as
a surprise, and I apologise if it is emotive, this can
even happen to somebody who hasn't got a head.    That
person is clearly dead, they haven't got a head, but
those persons can actually have twitches in their
muscles.    This is what happened to Kevin.   He died
early - brain death - but unfortunately in this
particular instance we are talking about an extreme
case where perhaps the heart beating went on for a bit
longer and we noticed these twitches, at least PC.
Bruder noticed these twitches in the body.

I feel this is what happened in the case of Kevin.

From the description - in fact it is only fair to say
you also, had a word with PC Bruder because you were
c o n c e r n e d y o u wanted to be quite sure that you
understood his evidence personally, so to speak? - AV\
Y e s , sir.
                                       '    -          --


In the; light of what you heard and what we have heard .

confident of that.               When one speaks to lay people who ,
h^yefeWperienced people dying, a wor^ whic^f
recurrent in these descriptions .of; death is -the way r                           '
that individuals turn grey.                      In fact I was very            •
impressed by the content in'PC Bruder1s statement of
the word "grey", recurring several times.                               To me as a
doctor that implied that that was the point of whole
body death.          In fact I feel that it was probably
around that time that Kevin’s whole body died.                               His-
brain had died twenty/twenty five minutes before that
at the time of the crushing, but his whole body died a t r.
the time PC Bruder was with him.                                                    r

We have mentioned these twitches and I think sometimes
they are referred to as spinal reflexes? - A. that is
correct, sir.

     THE CORONER:                                 Now, Mr. Fraser, is that reasonably
clear?

     MR. FRASER:   Even to me, sir, thank you, and I am
sure it will be clear to the family.

                  THE CORONER:                    Any questions?

                                           Cross-Examined by MR. LIMB:

Doctor, it is an emotive subject.   I remember*, in your
evidence about Kevin you described death in terms of a
process rather than as a moment? - A. Yes.

I would like to ask you a few questions about the
process following unconsciousness.   As I understand
it, in the cases of these victims, unconsciousness has
come ten to twenty seconds after compression of the
chest? - A. Yes*-.. ,

That is as a result of oxygen to blood mix leading to
unconsciousness? - A. Yes.   There are various...    We
are now not talking about the actual cause of death,
but mechanisms.   One very profound view that has been
put forward of crush asphyxia, traumatic asphyxia, it
is not simply only the reduction of oxygen going to the
     brain, but the fact that in fact there cannot be
     circulation through the brain.   The pressure from the
     chest is reflected up into the brain so in fact
     effectively the cerebral circulation stops, so it comes
     up against a dead end and it cannot circulate round.
     But, yes, your concept then is right.

5.   Following unconsciousness, that is to say, twenty
     seconds, say, after the start of the crush becoming
     fatal, is the body capable of facial expressions or
     does it have a neutral expression? - A. First of all
     the word "unconscious" itself is a very vague term, as
     you probably appreciate.    There are varying degrees of
     unconsciousness - superficial unconsciousness, perhaps
     a sort of sleeping...    You are unconscious, really,
     when you are sleeping, and then, of course,
     unconsciousness becomes deeper and deeper and deeper.
     The deeper bit is when one truly loses pain sensations
     and in fact in this particular instance having spoken
     both to Dr. Gumpert and, indeed, a consultant
     anaesthetist, everybody I have spoken to is confident
     that pain modalities have disappeared very quickly,
     perhaps within one or two seconds, five seconds is the
     longest I have heard somebody express.

Q. As I understand your evidence, following that short
   period of five, ten, twenty seconds at the most, there
   is profound unconsciousness rather than, say, the
   unconsciousness of sleep.   Is the face then of the
   unconscious person, the profoundly unconscious person,
   capable of expression of any sort, or is there a
   neutral expression? - A. I think I prefer to leave that
   to Dr. Gumpert because you are into a clinical area
   there of what we call reflexes.   I am not trying to
   avoid the question.   I think he will be able to give
   you a very expert professional witness reply to that.
   Would that be reasonable to you?

          HR. LIMB:   Certainly.   Sir, may I pursue that
     matter with Mr. Gumpert?

        THE CORONER:   Certainly.   I want to be as
 . helpful as I can.   It is a difficult subject and in a
   sense we are slotting it into the inquest of this poor
   boy, but it is a more general topic and it will, of
   course, apply in a sense to everybody, but I don't see
   how we can avoid.doing it.   Please do pursue it with
   Dr. Gumpert.

          Thank you, Dr. Slater.

               DR. ERNEST JOHN WALLACE GUMPERT Sworn
                          By THE C O R O N E R :
    Q. Dr. Gumpert, could you first of all give us your full
       names, qualifications and .appointment? - A. Ernest John
       Wallace Gumpert.   I am a Bachelor of Medicine of the
B      University at Cambridge, Bachelor of Surgery of the
       University of Cambridge.   A Member of the Royal
       College of Surgeons and a Fellow of the Royal College
       of Physicians of London.    I am consulting clinical
       neuro physiologist and consulting neurologist to the
       Sheffield Area Health Authority, Teaching.

    Q. Dr. Gumpert, although you are a Sheffield man
       professionally, I dragged you back from Cambridge
       today? - A. Yes, sir.

    0. Where I tracked you down!    I very much appreciate the
       fact you dropped all your other arrangements in order
       to be here.    Thank you very much.   Dr. Gumpert, you,
       of course, had nothing whatever to do with this case.
D      I think you dealt with quite a lot of the injured
       following Hillsborough and indeed you may well know one
       or two people I will be referring to later, but this
       particular case was not one you came across.    You have
       heard the evidence which has been put regarding this
       young man.   What I would like you to do now is to give
       us a short explanation, as you see death, in the first
       instance and then we will try and relate it to this
       young man and particularly Mr. Bruder's evidence
       relating to him. - A. In about 1979 or 1980 when it
       became possible to carry out renal transplantations or
       kidney transplantations, it became very important that
       the supply of kidneys of people who had died acutely,
       usually in accidents, could be increased because the
       life of a patient who has had a kidney transplant is
       completely different to the life of a patient who has
       to have dialysis three times a week.    They can go back
       to normal life.

      A hypothesis of brain death was then discussed, agreed
      and published.     This consisted of certain examinations
      of the back part of the brain, the part we call     the
      brain stem.      If you imagine the brain as being  likea
      walnut, and it is., it is like having a carrot stuck
      underneath the walnut, and it is the carrot that
      matters.    This is where blood pressure, pulse,
      respiration and a whole variety of other functions are
      controlled.    Once this part of the brain is dead, and
      this death occurs, as you heard from Dr. Slater, in
      between four   and six minutes after deprivation of
      oxygen, then    the person is going to die.   They  can be
H                           - 15 -
                                                                   1037
                          kept alive by artificial means and some of you may
                          remember the case in America which was kept alive for
                          thirteen and a half years.

                          Some of us were concerned that the guidelines that were
                          drawn up were not strict enough and that there was no
                          call for them to be repeated after a passage of time,
                    n |   Perhaps unwisely we said this and this resulted in a
                    "I    BBC "Panorama" programme one night at ten o'clock when
                          the medical profession for once actually debated it,
                          eight of us.    As a result of that debate the
                          regulations were hardened.    They had to be carried out
                          by senior people who were used to doing it and they had
                          to be repeated.    A satisfactory outcome from my
                          personal point of view, although I don't know whether
                          the anguish was worth it really.

                          As a consequence of that I suppose in the next three
                          years I had to go through this rather unpleasant
                          procedure many times.   It was part of my professional
                          duty but still to this day I cannot certify someone
                          dead without being disturbed by it still.

                    D|    From this I suppose I have gained a great deal of
                          experience of brain death and brain damage.   It seems
                          clear to me, sir, in this case that poor Kevin was
                          probably dead before he was got out of the area in
                          which he was standing.   I would agree with Dr. Slater.
                          I would think consciousness was lost probably within
                          ten seconds.   I would say loss of pain would be almost
                          instantaneous - not quite, but almost.

                          I cannot explain the Liverpool Police Constable's term
                          "convulsion because to me a convulsion is a major
                          epileptic attack and he has quite clearly said he does
                          not mean that, so I don't know what he does mean.   I
                          think it would be wrong for me to try and guess what he
                          means.   I think we could accept that he does not mean
                          any significant movement.

                          Unfortunately, after people are brain stem dead, they
                          can twitch and very unnerving it is too.   This is
                          really due to a spinal reflex.  What we think happens
                          in anoxia - lack of oxygen - is that the brain stem
                          dies first.   The cortex, that is the thinking part of
                          the brain, your walnut, probably goes on quite a bit
                          longer and the-peripheral nervous system probably quite
                          a bit long still and I think that is the explanation of
                          what has been described by the Liverpool officer.

                          I know the Liverpool officer in his supplemental
                          statement when he was discussing the question of a
                          pulse says he may have been mistaken, but let us
                          hypothesise that in fact he wasn't and he had felt a

pulse when he approached this young man on the pitch,
would that fit in with your understanding...   Is that
a possibility? - A. It is a possibility, sir.   I would
like just to observe that feeling the carotid pulse is
quite difficult in somebody who has got a low blood
pressure, as would have been here.   In fact it can be
so difficult it is impossible and you have to put an
electrocardiogram on to know whether the heart has
stopped or not.

I would also like to say something about resuscitation.
I was very fortunate when I qualified that I became
house surgeon of a famous heart surgeon called Lord
Brock at Guy's Hospital.   That was in the days when we
did open cardiac massage.   In other words, if somebody
died you opened their chest and you massaged their
heart between your hands.   A terrifying experience.
It was while I was working for him that one day three
of us were doing it one morning, that he stopped it,
and that was the start of external cardiac massage.
Even to somebody like me who has been doing it for
twenty-five years, it is still very difficult.    The
last time I tried to do it I failed completely.    Even
to a trained person it is difficult.   Indeed, when
junior doctors are examined for this now, as they are,
a significant number fail rather than pass.    It is
quite difficult and for the lay person it must be
incredibly difficult.

You heard Dr. Slater's account of death, shall we say.
l.'ould you go along with that? - A. I thought it was
eloquent.     I felt quite nervous!

You mentioned this point about unconsciousness and the
loss of pain and I think you distinguish slightly
there. Can you give me any idea that if aperson
becomes unconscious, can he feel pain, and for how long
can he feel pain, in your judgment? - A. Again, Dr.
Slater put it very clearly.    You all read in the
newspapers about patients - particularly when they have
had caesarean sections, the ladies as usual - being
able to tell what the doctors were talking about during
the operation.    Again I have experienced this at first
hand when I was doing heart surgery because then it was
often very important not to depress the state of
consciousness too far because things were pretty tricky
anyhow.   When- we used to resuscitate the patients we
used to give them an electric shock.    Lord Brock used
to always shout, "Give it two fast ones."    The patient
would then ask you the following morning two fast ones
were.   Then you would ask, "Did you hear anything
else?" and they didn't, so it is all very much a
question of degree.

                           I think slipping from slight unconsciousness to deep
                           unconsciousness in this circumstance, one, because of
                           the compression and two because of the asphyxia and
                           three because as Dr. Slater again explained everything
                           is shoved up into the head and so there is nothing
                           moving around, it would have been very quick, almost as
                           quick as a rabbit punch I would have thought.
                    B           THE CORONER:      Mr. Fraser?

                                MR. FRASER:      No questions, sir.

                                        Cross-Examined by MR. LIMB:

                        Q. Dr. Guinpert you have spoken in terms of passing in a
                           very quick space of time from slight unconsciousness to
                           deep unconsciousness.    Following deep unconsciousness,
                           do the eyelids remain open or are they closed? - A.
                           Either may occur.   There is no particular rule.   The
                           thing we all see on the cinema of the person going to
                           close the dead person's eyes.    I don't think I have
                           had to do that more than two or three times in my life.
                           Most of the people I have seen die have died with their
                    D      eyes shut.

                        0. Deep unconsciousness is associated with no longer
                           feeling any pain or discomfort.   Is then the face of
                           the person who is profoundly unconscious capable of
                           grimaces or expressions which might be taken as showing-
                           pain or discomfort? - A. Not in my view, sir.

                        0. Is it in fact capable of any facial expression? - A.
                           Not in my view.

                        0. Following profound unconsciousness, is it right that
                           the face will become discoloured towards the next stage
                           of the sequence of events, namely, brain damage and
                           thereafter brain death?

                                THE CORONER:      Could you repeat that question?

                                MR. LIMB:   I am referring back to the process, or
                           the sequences of events as outlined by Dr. Slater, sir.
                           Firstly, unconsciousness, thereafter brain damage and
                           thereafter again brain death.   The nature of my
                           inquiry was as to whether following profound
                           unconsciousness^ although there may be no outward
                           expressions there is this change that the face becomes
                           discoloured?

                                THE CORONER:      The greyness you are driving at?

                                MR. LIMB:      Sir, that is right.

                    H                              - 18 -
                                                                                      1040
J. L. Harpham Ltd
     THE WITNESS:   Are you asking me to say when I
think the greyness came on or just the way it changed?I
cannot tell you when it came on.   I think probably it
came on during the unconscious stage and I don't think
the face would change when the moment of death came,
total somatic death, I don't think there would be any
change.

     MR. LIMB:   Doctor, I am asking whether it happens
following the entry into unconsciousness towards the
next stage in the sequence, namely, brain damage? - A.
I don't think there is a change of facial expression at
the time of brain damage necessarily.   This change of
expression will be a gradually evolving process from
the minute the crush started.

        HR. LIMB:      Thank you, sir.

     THE WITNESS:   Sir, you cannot tell by looking at
a person that they are dead or unconscious, at least I
can't.   You can by feeling them but you can't by
looking at them.

                    further by THE CORONER:

If a person has been, shall we say, somatically dead
for long enough, would you accept or would you agree
that sometimes the face goes paler? - A. Oh, it goes
paler, and becomes rigid and takes on a stare.   Yes,
that is quite different.

        THE CORONER:      Anything else you wanted to ask on
that?

        MR. LIMB:      No, thank you, sir.

        MR. CATCHPOLE:      No questions, sir.

     THE CORONER:         Is there anything else we want to
ask Dr. Slater?         (No)

     Ladies and gentlemen, I will give you a chance.
It is emotive but it is also very interesting.   Is
there anything else while we have two experts here?
You have understood it as far as one is able to
understand it?

        THE FOREMAN:’    Yes.

     THE CORONER:   Dr. Gumpert and Dr. Slater, may I
say to both of you, you have done remarkably well in
explaining what is clearly a very (a) emotive and (b)
difficult subject, succinctly and clearly to all of us
and I very much appreciate your help.   Dr. Slater has
had to come as well, but not quite so far, and I am
very grateful to you for taking the trouble and the
tinie to come and I am sure it will be of benefit not   -
just to Kevin's family, but to other people who of
course are involved in this tragedy as well.    Thank
you very much indeed.

     MR. FRASER:    Sir, I will certainly make sure that
Kevin1s .family have the opportunity to see the
transcript of what the doctors have said and I am sure
they will feel some benefit from that when they feel
able to look at it.    Thank you,' sir.

DA3ED: 270489                                                DW   BRUDER (SIGNED)

m          I    a serving Police Officer with Merseyside Police, on Saturday 15th

        April 1989 (150489) I was off duty and went to support Liverpool in

           the natch against Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough Football Ground.

           I went to the game in my own car with my friend

                                    He had bought our tickets for seats in the

        North Stand for #14.00, fran Liverpool football club supporters club I

        think.

        We drove to the ground via Huddersfield where I dropped                  off

        at Polytechnic and then carried on to Hillsborough.       On the way to the

        ground there was a short delay at the Manchester Interchange on the

        M62 with roadworks.

        After we arrived at Sheffield I went with                   jo   the Gateway

        store on the continuation of Halifax Road.     This being were we parked

        the car at about 1.10pm (1310).     At the Gateway store there were

        between 200-300 Liverpool fans.     We stayed with them and were allowed

           into the store in small numbers to buy drinks.          md I bought

           four cans of lager between us and then went outside and sat chi a

        grass verge together with the other 200-300 fans and we drank tvro cans
BRUDER                DEREK WILLIAM                                        2

each.    Hie group of fans was veil behaved and I didn't see any

drunkeness.    We were supervised by a Merseyside and South Yorkshire

Police Officer who were sat on two horses outside the Comet

Superstore.

Whilst I was sat on this verge everyone was happy and amenable and at

one point I saw a uniform Superintendent and Chief Inspector WALK past

us.   Between 1.45pm and 2pm (1345) (1400) the two mounted police

officers came over and told us it was getting on and time to make our

way to the ground.   Hne whole crowi moved on without any problems at

all. I remember it was the Merseyside Officer who actually spoke to

the crowd.

We Malted to the ground and when ve got into Leppings Lane itself it

was packed with people even half a mile from the ground itself.

Because of the crcwd my friend asked a policeman for directions to

the ground, he was manning a junction either two or three roads

from the ground off Leppings Lane.    He then directed us to go back the

way ve had ccme and round to the Spion Kop end.   I didn't think that

was right but followed his directions and walked back the way we had

cane and to the Spion Kop.   This was about 2.20pm (1420).

We then went to the Spion Kop but three quarters of the way round on

Penistone Road I realised ve were going totally the wrong way and we

walked back.

The time was getting on new and the walk round was long because a lot

of the connecting roads between Leppings Lane and Penistone Road were

blocked by Police.   Because of the time I approached a police officer

on one of the barriers and he allowed us to take this short cut when I

explained what had happened and showad him my police warrant card.    We

arrived back at Leppings Lane at 2.30pm (1430).   When        tnd I

arrived back at the turnstiles there were no queues whatsoever and a

 lar^e mass of people all trying to get through the turnstiles and into

the ground.    It had reached the point of every man for themselves in

ordar to get to the turnstiles.

I wade for and entered the far left hand side turnstile of turnstiles

1-16.    There was no police officer by my turnstile.   Over to my far

right I saw a number of police officers on horses.      I could not see

any police officers on foot but could not say whether this was

because there were none or they ware blocked fran my view by the

crowd.

Outside the ground my friend had both our tickets and to try and stay

together I had hold of his jeans.    However, the pushing of the

people was that much that ve were pushed apart and separated.

Onca vie were apart I decided to make for the turnstile on my own.

______had got in before me and once I reached the turnstile he handed

my ticket out to me and I was allowed inside.     I handed my ticket into

the turnstile operator and retained the stub of the ticket.

I had difficulty in finding the entry point only by the misdirection

of the police officer, but once I got back into Leppings Lane, I found

the turnstile but had difficulties getting in because of the sheer

number of people.    At the time of my entry I saw no gates open other

than the turnstiles.    I did not see any of the gates open.

As I was trying to get to the turnstiles I saw about five or six

teenagers climb over a concertina gate intnediately to the left of the

turnstiles.    After the first five or six went over I saw a number of

othars climb to the top of this gate but then drop back into the crowd

outside as if there was someone in authority on the inside telling

then to get back.

Onca          tnd I had got into the ground I saw a police sergeant and

four constables iirmediately behind the concertina gate where I had
BRUDER                  DEREK WIIIjIAM                                        4


seen the teenagers climb over.     I approached   the sergeant and said

sarrathing along the lines of "I am a Police Officer fran Merseyside,

theres a huge crowd outside and they're pushing to get in, can you do

something about it or get something done?".       At this time, I was with

         but I did not produce my warrant card or formally identify

mysalf. He made no reply to me and by this time it was close to

kick off time so I left it at that.

Onca inside the ground I saw no direction signs to my seat in the

North stand and had difficulty in finding it because the sections of

seating were given letters of the alphabet, however, the letters did

not follow alphabetical order ie ABFDGCM, though I can't remember the

exact order.

I entered the North Stand through a tunnel, there was no crowd within

this tunnel and no problems at all.      I saw no Police within the

tunnel and only a few stewards right at the beginning.

Onca inside the ground I saw no alcohol being drunk at all.

I took my seat along with          just as the two teams came out onto

the pitch.     This was about 2.57 pm (1457).   Once through the

tunnel and up the stairs, I went to the section of my seats where two

stewards directed us to our particular seats.      These were right by the

entrance to this section of seating.      People continued to enter after

me and after about ten minutes between ten and twenty people arrived

at this entrance and didn't appear to have tickets for this stand.        I

actually saw two people holding tickets which were for the West

Stand.    This was after the incident in pens 3 and 4 and people had

started to ccme out onto the pitch.      Everyone started to discuss what

was going on and these two men said that they should be in those pens

and showad the tickets which were complete without the counterfoil

being removed.

I experienced no personal crowd crush within the ground only that

outside which was about 2.45 pn (1445).     I did not see any crowd

surge within the ground and was not injured.

At about the time these men had appeared at the entrance to my section

of seating which was three quarters of the way along the North Stand

nearest to the Spion Kop about ten rows frcxn the front, I saw people

clinbing over the fences from pens three and four of the Leppings Lane

stand frcm kick off but initially they were directed behind hoardings

and sat near to the pitch.     I could not see whether they were directed

by stewards or Police.

Aftar about five minutes a Police officer ran cm to the pitch and

stopped the game.     People then began to climb over the front fencing

onto the pitch at will and I could also see people pulled up into the

seating area above.    At no point did I see any gates opened to allow

escape from the pens.

Onca play had been stopped the Nottingham Forest fans in the Spion Kbp

began to taunt the Liverpool Supporters.

A fan then ran onto the pitch and then ran up to the Spion Kop and

began shouting and making 'V' signs with two fingers at the Forest

supporters. Myself and other fans in the North stand began to shout

telling him to go away because we could see there was something wrong

in the Leppings Lane end.    This man who was in his early twenties with

long hair and a black capped sleeve T shirt was then turned back by

either stewards or Police and ran back towards Leppings Lane but was

detained by Police before he got back.

Another older man then ran up to the Spion Kop and then began to wave

his hands at the Forest fans.    He wasn't taunting, he was signalling

for than to calm down and trying to tell them there was something

wrong. Shortly after this the Police formed a cordon across the
BKUDER                 DEREK WILLIAM


halfway line.   I'm not sure if this was after the first or second man.

People in the Leppings Lane end then ripped down advertising hoardings

and began to carry people on them up towards the comer formed by the

Spion Kop and the North Stand.     I could see that seme of them were

presumed dead as they had coats over their faces and one man in

particular had a jumper pulled back to cover his face.     These people

were then rolled onto the pitch and the carriers went back for more

people or bodies.

The police then formed a further cordon in front of the North stand.

Around the sane time a number of people wearing tracksuit trousers and

sweatshirts came frcrn the direction of the players tunnel and went to

the Spion Kop end.    They then pulled down more hoardings hare and went

to help carry more people up frcnt Leppings Lane.

A number of people were also carried up to the comer in front of me

bodily.   There vrere a large number of people in this comer either

laid out behind the police cm the pitch or sitting with their heads in

their hands.

I did not see any of the Police in the cordon in front of the North

Stand break ranks to assist these people.

I saw one person on the pitch about a quarter of the pitch length away

from the Spion Kop about twenty feet frcm the hoardings in front of

the North stand.     I distinctly remember this because later on as I

will describe an ambulance drove directly past us and a St John's

Ambulance man who was with me tried to flag it down but it carried on.

I an not sure if this man had been carried on a hoarding or by his

friend who was with him.     I saw this nan lying on the floor having

convulsions.

The Police cordon in front of the North Stand appeared unconcerned and

'smarmy', this agitated the supporters in the stand who w are shouting
BRUDER                  DEREK WIIUAM                                             7

for them to go and help the people on the pitch.     None of the Police

officers left the cordon.

I \nas very close to the pitch so I went down the aisle, over a small

five foot wall with hoardings on, I walked through the cordon without

being challenged at all and then went to the man having convulsions.

Alirost immediately I was joined by a St John's Ambulance man.      I

identified myself to the St Johns roan as an off duty Police Officer.

He then said to me " You do mouth to mouth and I'll do heart massage".

I then took his pulse in his neck.     I could feel a slight pulse.     I

then ccrtmenced mouth to mouth resuscitation and the St John's man

started heart massage.     I undid tv*o buttons cm the top of the man's

shirt.     If I remember rightly the bottom of the shirt appeared

ripped.

We continued to work on the man but after about five minutes he went

grey and his face was withdrawn.    As I had approached the man his head

had moved as if he was being sick.     When I got to him I cleared his

mouth and the back of his throat of vomit before commencing mouth to

mouth resuscitation.     There was no blood in the vcmit. After about

five minutes when the man went grey, a very distinctive smell cane

from his mouth.     I can still remember it new but could not describe

it.

Aftsr about seven minutes I swapped places with the St John's

Ambulance man and he canmenced mouth to mouth and I heart massage.          As

I did heart massage his ribs were unnaturally prominent in the whole

of his rib cage even though he was only thinly built.     His stanach

was depressed and abnormally lovrer than his ribcage.

After a short time I undid the button can his trousers and ripped open

the zip.     I than continued heart massage.

Shortly afterwards an ambulance entered the ground.     It appeared to be
BRUDER                 DEREK W n U A M                                      8

a Haalth Authority ambulance as opposed to St Johns.       It began to

drive down towards Leppings Lane.        I then told the St John's nan to

try and stop it. He tried to flag it dcwn but it continued on as if

it had been ordered not to stop in the top comer but to go to the

Leppings Lane end.

The St John's man then rejoined me and continued to give mouth to

mouth resuscitation.

Shortly after this we were joined by one of the men I described

earlier in the tracksuit trousers and I think green sweatshirt.       He

askad me if I was all right and knew what I vras doing.

I said "I'm an off duty bobby, I'm all right", with that he left as if

to go somewhere where he could be of more use with other injured

persons.

Shortly after this man, which must have been about six minutes since I

had changed places with the St Johns man, a female St Johns Ambulance

officer came over and pushed me out of the way and took over fran me.

I then stood up and watched as she was obviously better trained in

First Aid than me.

I then stood by the injured man together with his friend who had been

there all along, telling us to keep going and not to let his mate die.

Within two minutes of this, the St Johns Ambulance man told the St

Johns Ambulance woman, "He's gone”, and stood up.       I looked at the

man's friend who was standing by his head, he was completely grey.

By this time, I felt ill myself and just turned away as there was

nothing else I could do.

I would describe the nan who died ass- between 17 and 20 years of age,

approx 5'8 - 5'9 tall, short sandy or reddish coloured hair, slim

build, no facial hair, white european, I could see no cuts or

abrasions on him.    I seem to remember freckles on his cheeks, but I'm
BRUDER                DEREK WTIJJAM                                         9

not sure if it could have been vomit, I'm almost positive it was

freckles.   As I said previously he had an unusually prominent rib cage

and depressed stomach.

He was wearing a light, possibly white button up shirt, light grey or

beige cotton trousers, light coloured boxer shorts.      I noticed no

jewellery or footvrear.

His friend I would describe as 21 or 22 years of age, dark brown hair,

shortish hair, about 5'9 tall.     I cannot remember much of his clothing

but he appeared quite plump with a slight beer belly.     He had no

facial hair nor glasses.

Hie St John's man was in uniform, the only thing I can remember was

that he had dark hair and was thirty plus years of age.

Hie St John's wcman was in uniform again very sliraly built and no

oldar than 18 years of age.

After the St John's man had said the nan was dead I'd seen enough,

I felt ill and had to get out of the ground.    I knew         gould have

stayed where he was because he kncws no First Aid.     I went over to the

wall where I had climbed in.    As I got there I saw a photographer

kneeling down with an orange tabard he was talcing photographs of the

injured and dying.

A fan who was already cm the pitch wait over to him and said "Fuck

off, you're taking pictures of my injured mates".

Hie photographer carried cm taking pictures so the fan started pushing

him.   Hie photographer stood up and the fan then pushed him back to

the wall and tried to take the camera fran him.     Hie camera then swung

and smashed into the wall.     I then climbed over the wall using the

photographers case as a step.     I then rejoined

He said to me "Come on we're going”, and we both then left.     I cannot

say what time this was.




                                                                                44
 BRUDER                DEREK WHLIAM


Whilst at Hillsborough the only criminal offences were of a minor

public order nature ie, the fans climbing over the gates etc.      After

the disaster within the stand, I sen/ a number of instances such as

the photographer's camera and sausage rolls thrown at the cordon in

front of the North Stand and cane old man who threw a cup of tea at an

officer in the cordon.

This was caused purely by agitation amongst the crowd by the apparent

callousness of the photographer and apparent inactivity of the police

with regard to the injured and dying.

I witnessed no serious offences.

There were a number of factors which I believe contributed to the

number of deaths and injuries.

(Xitside the ground there appeared to be a lack of co-ordination

between the mounted and foot police officers.    The approach roads to

the ground were veil manned with Police officers at junctions and

outside pubs and off licences.   However, I made a comment about being

misdirected by the police officer to another officer and he said it

was understandable because a lot of the officers were drafted in from

outside stations and had poor local knowledge of the area.      This may

hava contributed to the build up outside the ground which caused the

initial crush outside.

Inside the ground once the disaster had occurred there appeared a lack

of oo-ordination between senior police officers and lower ranks an the

pitch.    The actual scale of the incident wasn't appreciated

iimrediately which resulted in a delay in the response and personnel

being despatched to deal with it.

From my own personal experience I and most Police officers have only

basic First Aid knowledge.   When I administered first aid to the man I

felt totally inadequate on reflection.   However with that particular
        BRUDER               DEREK WILLIAM                                      II


        nan, I don't think more knowledge would have helped but it might have

        in others.

        I would also like to add that though the Police in the cordon did not

        assist the injured and tfying I saw a number of other officers who did.

        In particular two small policewomen who tried to help a very large man

       but couldn't carry him until helped by fans.

           Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield cm 15th April 1989 (150489) by WPC

           Further to my previous statements of 27 April 1989 (270489) and 17

        August 1989 (170889), I have been asked to think about a nunfcer of the

           points which are raised in the statement I made nearly a fortnight

           after the Hillsborough Stadium disaster on 15 April 1989 (150489).

           Before clarifying a number of these points I would point out that I

           have today been shewn a number of photographs, plans and documents by

           Inspector SAWERS of West Midlands Police which I have viewed to refresh

        my memory.      It's also fair to say that my first statement (27.4.89)

           (270489) was the first occasion that involvement with the disaster was

           set down in any detail, in writing, although I did make sane brief

           notes myself on Sunday 16 April 1989 (160489).   I retain these in my

           possession and would say that they do no relate to my dealings with any

           deceased casualty that day.

           I am a single man and joined Merseyside Police on 27 October 1987

           (271087).   During initial training at Bruce District Training Centre,

        Warrington, I received basic first aid instruction in both

           theoretical and practical application.   I obtained a pass and was

           issued with an identifying card qualifying me for, I think 2 or 3
BRUDER                  DEREK WILLIAM                                      2


years.     On 15 April 1989 (150489) I had received no further instruction

or refresher training in basic first aid.     However, as a direct result

of the situation I found myself in on the day of the disaster I

personally felt inadequately equipped in either theory or

practise of first aid. I am absolutely satisfied that the first aid

I rendered in terms of mouth to mouth resuscitation and heart massage

were correct and that I could have done no more, but nevertheless, I

felt I didn't knew enough and regretted not having taken that aspect

of initial training seriously enough.

For these reasons, I applied on my cwn iniative for further first aid

training in the form of a one week full time course leading to

qualification as a first aid public order trained officer.     I undertook

the course in June last year, which means I new have a special role

within public order deployments to treat casualties either of members

of the public or police officers as injuries occur.

As a result of that course, I feel confident and much better equipped

to deal with injured people whether those injuries be minor or life

threatening.     It also confirms that in fact, my actions were right on

the day and my attempts at resuscitation, although unsuccessful were

properly administered.

I will new deal with a number of specific points frcm my original

statement (27.4.89) (270489), using the page numbers of that statement.

I understand that the numbers I will use in brackets are those of the

file of statements contained in respect of Kevin Daniel WILLIAMS,

prepared by West Midlands Police under the deceased reference number

51.

On page 6 (File page 41) I first refer to the youth I now know to be

Kevin Daniel WILLIAMS lying a 1/4 length of the pitch frcm the Spion

Kop.     I refer to him been "cm the floor", meaning the pitch surface,
BRUDER                  DEREK WILLIAM                                      3


and "having convulsions".    I have thought about this carefully today

and with the added benefit of my training I can say that this was not a

process that lasted for any time.    It certainly wasn't anything similar

to an epileptic fit, for exanple.    It was an impression that I had

which I originally associated with the lad vanitting.    I will say that

I did not see the casualty vcmit nor did I see any sick on the body or

grassed area around him.    I will correct further references to vcmit as

they occur in my original statement.

On page 7 (42) I describe approaching the body.   He was not convulsing

as I did so (line 5).

I refer to feeling for a carotid pulse in the neck and said originally

that I thought I could detect a slight pulse however I new feel that I

am able to correct this.    I felt for the pulse with my first two

fingers of my left hand, I believe, to the carotid artery I cannot say

absolutely that I felt for the pulse before I started mouth to mouth or

after, nor indeed whether I did both simultaneously.    Whilst I would

now have much more skill, on the day I cannot say with absolute

certainty that I went, accurately, straight to the carotid artery.

For all these reasons, I can say that I felt for a pulse in the region

of the carotid artery, but I may have also touched the area of the

"Adams Apple" or felt sanething in the neck region which I originally

thought was a pulse but may have been mistaken.

I refer to the face going "grey" and his "face was withdrawn." I

cannot say specifically that this was a change frcm normal paller to

grey, or what I now knew to be cynosis or blueness.    I mentioned it in

the sequence of when I became aware of it.

I refer to approaching the lad and having the impression that his head

moved and associating this with his being sick.   I am now absolutely

satisfied that he was not sick, or certainly I did not see vanitting or
BRUDER                  DEREK WILLIAM                                       4


vcmit.   The movement of the head, if thats what it was, I would say its

best described as a 'twitch'.

I refer to clearing his mouth before resuscitation, by that I mean to

say I checked that his airway was clear before expressing air into his

mouth.   There was a fluid of some description but I accept readily that

this could have been spittle or phlegn.

I refer to the man going grey after about 5 minutes and a very

distinctive smell caning fran his mouth.     Ihis was again not vomit but

its true to say I can still remember it new as it caused me to heave

and feel sick myself.

I refer to performing mouth to mouth whilst the St John ambulanceman

did heart compression for about 7 minutes.    Whilst this is purely

recollection I believe it to reasonably accurate.

Having changed places with the St Johns Ambulance man I refer to

feeling what I thought was an unusual rib cage and abdonen.     A

photograph I have been shown at post mortem appears to suggest this.

I refer to unzipping the lads trousers at this point and in my second

statement recollect the striped boxer shorts which I have seen in

photographs (Ref No TT1/31 and TT1/32).

I have been shown documents which purport to give timings of the

arrival on the pitch of the 1st ambulance (St Johns Anfculance) and the

2nd ambulance (being the 1st   SYMAS ambulance). I have considered this
information (referred to as MAP 1 15.15-33 and RJH2 15.17-08) in

comparison with the photographs PR5/A/32 and PR5/A/33 which purport to

show the casualty being carried on a stretcher at 15.32 (1532) and

which I understand would be before I saw and assisted to resuscitate

hirr at the Spion Kop end of the ground. I cannot reconcile the time

sequences and I am still sure that I did see an ambulance, distinguish

in my own mind that it was not of St Johns but Health   Authority and
BRUDER               DEREK WILLIAM                                        5


that I told the St Johns non with me to stop the ambulance.     I have

considered that what I referred to may have been this ambulance

exiting from the stadium but I don't think it was. My recollection is

still that it was entering the stadium. I refer to being joined by a

varan St Johns ambulance officer who pushed me out of the way.     I

recollected this to have been about 6 minutes after I had changed

places with the male St Johns officer.   That makes a total, frcm

recollection of 13 minutes joint resuscitation with the St Johns male.

I would standby these estimates only in as much as I feel we attempted

resuscitation for between 10 and 15 minutes.

Within a further two minutes of both St Johns people working together,

the man declared "He's gone" and stood up.     I referred to and re-affirm

that he was "completely grey" and there is absolutely no doubt in my

mind, both now with the benefit of further training, and then at that

mcrrent that the youth I had tried to save was dead, certainly dead and

beyond any further help.   I and the St Johns personnel would not have

stopped if there had been any glimmer of hope at all - there was none.

I describe the body of the youth on P8 & 9 (43 & 44) and believe the

distinguishing features I referred to 12 months ago are plain to see on

photographs.

I have seen injuries shown chi photographs of the neck area, however I

did not see them or notice them on the day.

       KENNETH DANIEL WILLIAMS                                         04.02.93




       Further to the recent correspondence, I draw your attention to page 5 of the

>•
       transcript of proceedings of the inquest on the k May 1990, paragraph 'A1,
       It is clear that inspector SAWYERS was directed to see PC BRUDER as a
       result of an enquiry from the Coroner. I also draw your attention to the
       other transcript in respect of proceedings on the 2 May 1990 at page 8,
       paragraph       Dr SLATER, when recalled, makes it clear that the concept
       that the evidence of ‘opening eyes and speaking* is not really conceivable.

       It is evident from all these circumstances that the distressed condition of
       the Woman Special Constable was sufficient to produce an Inaccurate account
       of the facts as they were not possible in view of the medical opinion and
       clearly conflict with the evidence by PC BRUDER.

       At 11.45 am today J, had a telephone conversation with Derek William
       BRUDER, Police Constable 7808 of the Merseyside Police, who confirms that
       his second statement (unpaginated - but taken on the 3 May 1990 by
       Inspectors SAWYERS) was made entirely voluntarily and without any
       pressure, duress or other persuasion by Inspector SAWYERS.

       It was interesting during the conversation with PC BRUDER that he also
       indicated that a solicitor, on behalf of the relatives, had interviewed him

 •     and suggested the possibility that his second statement could have been
       furnished as a result of cajolery or other improper action by the West
       Midlands Police. Additionally, PC BRUDER was challenged by the solicitor
       as to whether his contact with the Coroner was construed by him as undue
       pressure. PC BRUDER maintains that he has made it clear to the solicitor
       that this was NOT the case.

       In all the circumstances it would seem clear that the conflict in the
       evidence was factual on the accounts given by the various witnesses, namely
       PC BRUDER and Woman Special Constable MARTIN, but all of the evidence
       supports the account given by PC BRUDER.

       CONCLUSION »

       There was no improper conduct by Inspector SAWYERS in re-taking the
       statement from Police Constable BRUDER; he was merely clarifying a request
       of. tha Coroner, hence the transcript at page 5 of the A May 1992.

Kevin Williams* Mini-lnouest



At Kevin Williams’ mini-inquest on 2nd May Dr. Slater, the pathologist, gave
         /


evidence that death was due to asphyxia and that his injuries were likely to

have resulted in unconsciousness within seconds and in death within three to

five minutes (page 3B-E). However, evidence was then read out, in the

course of the summary, from two police officers which suggested that he might

still have been alive for some considerable time after he sustained his original

injuries and capable of being saved. The evidence took the following form:



(i)     There was first a statement from a PC Bnider which was referred to

         in the summary in which he stated that he had come upon Kevin

         Williams lying on the ground of the pitch having convulsions (the

         rest of his statement in which he referred to Kevin Williams’

         vomiting and to him having a pulse was not read out at this hearing

         though this clearly provided further evidence that he was still alive).

        Clearly this evidence suggested that Kevin Williams was still alive

        and moving a considerable time after his original injuries and even

        after being moved onto the pitch. This raised the question of
whether he could have been resuscitated though PC Bruder stated

that his own attempts at resuscitation eventually failed and that

 Kevin Williams went grey.



However, a further statem ent was then referred to from a Special

Constable Deborah M artin who had made a statement to the effect

that Kevin Williams was alive and had been briefly resuscitated as

late as about 4pm. In the original, statement she made which was

not read out at the inquest but merely referred to, she said:



"He stopped breathing so I gave him the kiss of life, and heart

massage and a doctor also helped. He started breathing and opened

his eyes, his only word was "Mom" and then he died".



This statement was referred to with some scepticism (page 6F of

transcript and page 7D-E).    But clearly it once again raises the

possibility of survival long after 3.15pm (as late as 4pm) and the

question of whether death might have been prevented by more

timely medical intervention. H ie Coroner was sufficiently concerned

about this evidence to call further evidence on the matter on 4th

May at a resumed mini-inquest into the death of Kevin Williams.
 KevinWilliamsftheresumedmini-inquest^


 When the mini-inquest was resumed on 4th May the Coroner called further

 evidence which was undoubtedly intended to discredit the suggestion that

 Kevin Williams had survived for some considerable time after sustaining his

crush injuries and to reassure the family by qualifying and undermining the

testimony of PC Bruder and Special Constable Martin. The further evidence

took the following form:



(i)      An Inspector Robert Sawers was called who stated that he had re-

         interviewed PC Bruder on 3rd May and that, in the light of the

         further questions put to him, PC Bruder now accepted that his

         description of the deceased as ‘having convulsions' should be altered

         and the ‘movement’ was best described as a ‘twitch* (6C). He also

         reported that PC Bruder had now qualified his claim to have ‘"felt

         a slight pulse” and that he now accepted that "whatever he felt there

         he cannot be categoric it was a pulse" (page 6G). He further reports

         that PC Bruden now accepted that he had not witnessed Kevin

         Williams being sick (page 7b).



(ii)     Dr. David Slater, the pathologist, was then recalled. His evidence

        was that Kevin Williams’ death was caused by a "veiy very severe

        case of asphyxia" and that there "was four fractures to the voice box".

         In his view unconsciousness would have resulted from the crush
          injuries within seconds and irrecoverable brain damage death would

          have occurred within three to six minutes thereafter but whole body

         death may not have resulted until sometime thereafter (pagers JO-

          12). This might explain the apparent twitches some considerable

         time after he had been taken from the terraces. But he was sure

         that Kevin Williams had died before Special Constable Martin

         arrived on the scene.



(iii)    In addition, a Dr. Ernest Gumpert was called to explain further-the

         distinctions between brain death and whole body death and to record

         his view that Kevin Williams was brain dead before he got out of the

         area where he was standing, when he lost consciousness.



Subsequent Developments Regarding Williams' Inquest



Subsequent investigations have revealed that considerable pressure was put

on both Special Constable Martin and PC Bruder to retract or qualify their

evidence as to the signs of life they described in Kevin Williams. These are

set out more fully in the statement of Kevin Williams' mother, appended

herewith. But the manner in which the very significant evidence of these two

witnesses was presented to the mini-inquest was highly unsatisfactory. Qearly

the jury and the family should have had the benefit of hearing oral evidence

rather than somewhat misleading second-hand accounts of their original

statements and of the qualifications they had subsequently been persuaded to
make to their original evidence. And clearly the edited version of their

evidence actually presented was, at the very least, not a complete picture of

their eye-witness accounts.

   The photographs of Kevin Williams appear to show the correct body. They
   do not indicate the classic signs of traumatic asphyxia. There is no
   swelling of the face although there is some cyanosis. The most prominent
   findings that can be seen on the photographs are the injuries over the
   undersurface of the chin and left jawline just below the prominence^of
   the larynx (Adam's apple). The photographs indicate one long abrasion
   under the right side of the chin and an abrasion under the left jawline
   and two abrasions over the region of the larynx. An additional abrasion
    is visible just outside the left eye. There also appears to be deformity
^ o f the neck in the region of the larynx.
   In my opinion there has been substantial damage to the front of Mr.
   Williams neck as the result of compression of the neck possibly caused
   by his neck being crushed under the feet of individuals in the crowd or
   caused by his neck being crushed against some rigid object.           The
   deformity seen in the photographs and the fractures, found by Dr. Slater
   during his post mortem examination, strongly suggest that damage to the
   upper airway was an important contributory factor in the death of Kevin
   Williams. Damage to the airway at this level may lead to obstruction and
   swelling of the lining of the larynx which reduces the amount of air that
   can reach the deceased’s lungs. As I have stated in my previous report
   I do not believe that this type of injury would lead to unconsciousness
   within a few seconds. Whilst death may occur rapdily following such
   laryngeal injuries this is not inevitably the case and death »ay be
   delayed for a considerable period. This type of injury is amenable to
   treatment in    the form of an emergency tracheostomy or a crico-
   thyroidotoay.   Whilst an emergency tracheostomy is a relatively major
   procedure, crico-thyroidotomy is a simpler procedure which involves the
     ssage of a tube through the membrane between the thyroid and cricoid
 «   rtilages.   It is possible that if one of these procedures had been
     carried out at the scenethen hewould not have suffered from the fatal
   asphyxia which ledto his death.
   Both cricothyroidotomy and emergency tracheotomy can be performed in the
   field although, in the latter instance, with difficulties owing to an
   increased likelihood of haemorrahge at the operation site.
   I could find nothing, from the post mortem report or from the
   photographs, to refute the realistic possibility that this young man was
   still alive after 3.15 pm on the day.   I do accept, however, that he is
   unlikely to have spoken the word "Mum" if he had already suffered
   convulsions due to lacK of oxygen. In my opinion, the primary cause of
   death in this instance is damage to his neck which would not have been
   inevitably rapidly fatal.

 In relation to the individuals who have died of traumatic asphyxia; it
 is possible to say that, with sustained compression of the trunk, death
 could have occurred prior to 3.15 pm and that they were likely to have
 been quite rapidly rendered unconscious. There is no way, however, that
 one can state with any certainty that death occurred within that period.
 If the compression of the chest had been intermittent they could well
 have survived well beyond 3.15 pm.

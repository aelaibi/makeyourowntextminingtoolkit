 Thank you for your letter of 17 December about the way in which evidence was obtained from
 South Yorkshire police officers and giving an analysis of the samples of amended statements or
 ‘recollections’ which we sent to you.

 This is very helpful. I am writing briefly now to acknowledge your letter, but it may be that
 Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will wish to put further points to you after the New Year. Would I be
 right in thinking that your overall view would be that, in as far as South Yorkshire police did
 remove factual evidence from the ‘recollections’ of their officers, the very thorough
 investigation of the disaster rendered that immaterial?

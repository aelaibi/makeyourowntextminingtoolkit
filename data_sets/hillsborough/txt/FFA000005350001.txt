FA/HILLSBOROUGH

Attending Graham Kelly o/t his calling me back. He had read
through all the submissions and he agreed with me that he
thought it was outrageous of           to be asking the FA
to set up a fully operational inspectorate to inspect
grounds when they knew it was not the FA's practice. He had
not put it to Kelly. Kelly said that his rhetoric did not
match his logic. He did not have any substantive comments
to give to the barristers so there was not much point him
coming to the con this afternoon but he would see us in good
time tomorrow morning. He agreed with me that there was
nothing really important to deal with by way of submissions
put in by other parties on any recommendations either
interim of a long term nature. I looked forward to seeing
him tomorrow.

Engaged 15 minutes including dictation

Subsequently attending                his call. He may not be
able to make the conference this afternoon. He would give
us his views on the train up to Sheffield tomorrow. I
confirmed that H&£o£rta*z' had got the reference to pre-match
entertainment confused by saying Kelly had said something
that in fact Glen Kirton had. It was not a point of
substance. This was that he thought that the FA ought to
set up an inspectorate either in the future or indeed
because he said it was causative prior to Hillsborough in
order to check out each ground very carefully. I agreed to
see him later.

Engaged 10 minutes including dictation

Subsequently reiterating my conversation with Graham Kelly.
Glen would not be coming up tomorrow.

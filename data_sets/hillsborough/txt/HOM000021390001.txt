                            FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL



                            Thank you for your letter of 9 October about extending the
                            relevant offences for the purposes of the Bill so as to
                            include all offences of being drunk or disorderly committed
                            on the way to or from a designated match.

                            I agree that the extension you propose is justifiable and I
                            am happy for you to table the necessary amendments. I also
                            agree that limiting the offences to those in which the court
                            makes a declaration of relevance will meet the concern I
                            expressed in Committee about the need for such offences to be
                            relevant to the offender's attendance at football matches.

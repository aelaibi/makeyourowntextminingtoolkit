         Dear Mr Pearson,

        Further to our telephone conversation earlier today please find enclosed a copy of the
        news release issued by South Yorkshire Police. Families are anxious that I respond to the
        same.

        I would draw yuur attention to the following matters:

        1) The Missing Tape
        South Yorkshire Police state that "The tape In question. . . has never been missing and it
        was made available in full to both Lord Justice Taylor's inquiry and to the Coroners
        inquest."

        It is the families case that footage from camera 5 did indeed go missing and theitfure
        could not he shown to the inquest jury PC Bkhard in his evidence confirms that shots
        from camera 5 would have been recorded prior to 15,02. He could not explain why the
        relevant footage could not he found (P 318 Annex P2).

        Families are concerned at this stage to hear that South Yorkshire Police themselves were
        in a position to "select" evidence for admission to either the Taylor Inquiry or the
        inquest. It has always been their understanding that the responsibility for gathering
        evidence lay with the West Midlands Police who of course were also charged with the
        task of preparing a report for submission to the DPP in relation to the conduct of South
        Yorkshire Police on the day of the disaster.

       2) Camera 5
       It is now stated th a t" ihe camera whteh took the pictures was indeed in working order''.
       This is contrary to evidence given by Officers Bichard, Ryan and Goddard who all
       disparaged the capability of camera 5 (see in particular pages 316 and 318 Annex D2).
       Video evidence recently submitted to you shows clarity of image and demonstrates that
       the camera could pan, tilt and zoom and produce pictures of sufficient quality and detail
       to identify facial features (Trevor Micks statement refers).

     %) Quality of Transmission

     For the first time South Yorkshire Police appear to be alleging that there was no fault
     with the camera but rather the quality of the transmission via the monitors in the police
     control room. They now presume that this interference was due to the television
      ■qulpment being used at the location.
     ^ C r b e e r d L u s ^ d with the video technician, Roger Houldaworth, w hohasassured
     families that this claim is totally unfounded. One of the monitors m the Sheffield
     Wednesday control room was linked to the Police CCTV syst*m(P73 Annex                   r
     could not be interference on one system and not on the other. The monitor in the club
     control room showed clear and uninterrupted pictures without interference.

     Fu^her, in his statement Chief Inspector McRobbie describes how PC Bichard operated
     thWyom facility which he thought was "a super facility for spotting troublemakers m
     the eround" He also states that he was watching the screens and was aware that the
     area in Leppings Lane behind the goal was filling up (P446 Annex D2). He states that he
     looked on the left monitor and was aware of a build up of supporters. At no t i m e r s
     McRobbie mention interference on the monitors. However, unfortunately - >e
     Inspector McRobbie was not called at the Inquest.

      4) The Tapes Stolen From The Club Control Room
      Whilst it is accepted that the tapes stolen from the club control room showed nothing or
      a probative value, the fact remains that they were stolen from a locked cupboard in a
      locked room which was alarmed There was a massive police presence at the ground
      that night     effectively a murder investigation was mounted. It is inconceivable that
      such security could have been breached by a stranger. It is simply not satisfactory for
      South Yorkshire Police to dismiss this matter so lightly. Clearly the thief thought he/she
      was stealing something of value.

      I trust you will take the above comments into account before making your decision.
      Finally, 1 should be grateful if you would telephone me on 0151 225 2975 before making
      any announcement to the media.
      I am anxious to ensure that families are warned in advance of any public announcement.
      With the 8th anniversary just a few days away this is a particularly stressful time for
      families.

       In anticipation of your co-operation.
       Yours sincerely,



       Ann M arie Adlington (Solicitor)

   2   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        You have made a number of
   3        statements, I think, haven't you?
   4   A   Ye s .
   5   Q   There is that one.        Do you recognise that one?
   6   A   That is the one.
   7   Q   It is not dated, but I think you refer to         itsomewhere      as
   8        the 4th May?
   9   A   4th May.
10     Q   How did you come to make that statement?
11     A   I attended the survivors' group at the Hillsborough
12          Centre.       They asked us, like, to try and write down what
13          happened to you on the day.         You know, they said it'd help
fL 4       you if you, may be, wrote down on paper what happened to
15         you on the day.
16     Q   Did somebody help you?
17     A   No.
18     Q   You just wrote it out yourself?
19     A   Yes, just wrote it out and then a friendtyped             it out for
20         me, you know, the spelling and all that.
21     Q   So you said really in that everything that you wanted to
22          say?
23     A   Well, at the time.        I wrote down at the time what I could
24         remember.
25     Q   What you       could remember?
26     A   Yes, and       then obviously as time progressed,   I started
27         remembering other things.         When the West Midlands Police
28         came to do the first interview,         I gave them a copy of
29         this.      That's how you came to get a copy, I think.
30     Q   Yes, I think that is probably right.         Can we just look at
31         what you         say about Victoria Hicks, although I think you
32         did not know        it was Victoria Hicks at that time.      It is on
33         page 4.It is the          third paragraph down:
34                  "By     now there was quite a lot of room on the    front of
35                  the   terrace as people who were not helping had moved
36                  back.    I then spotted a girl with her legs trapped
37                  lying over backwards so I pulled her out and carried
38                  her to the side.     I put her down, and went to give

                                            2
  1               her the kiss of life and then smelt the odour coming
  2               from her mouth.    I realised she was dead, but I did
  3               it out of instinct.    I then pulled her arm out of her
  4               cardigan and pulled it over her face and left her and
  5               went to help anyone else I could."
  6        That was your recollection at the time?
  7    A   Yes.
  8    Q   Am I right in thinking that when you say you pulled her
  9        out and carried her to one side,     "I put her down" and so
10         on, at that stage she would not be in a pile of bodies?
11         You had moved her to one side, had you?
12     A   I had pulled her off.     Her legs were    trapped. At     this
13         time she seemed to be on top of the pile then.           Her legs
fc.4       were trapped with other people, and she was lying
15         backwards with her arms stretched out.
16     Q   So you pulled her free.
17     A   With another lad, we pulled her.
18     Q   With another lad.
19     A   And we carried her to the side by the railings, still on
20         the terraces.
21     Q   Would that be the railings between pens 2 and      3?     Would
22         you like to look at the plan.
23     A   Please.     (Witness shown plan)
24     Q   Here   is the plan.   Here is pen 2. That is     pen 3.
25     A   Yes,   that's the railings that was there.
26     Q   Close to that fence between 2 and     3.
27     A   Thatis where I was standing and that is where        they laid
28         her down.
29     Q   You say, "I realised she was dead".        Was that from your
30         own observation of her?
31     A   I had never really seen anyone     dead, but it was just I
32         assumed because the way her eyes were bulged out and her
33         lips had been pulled right back and her teeth were
34         protruding.     I just smelt her breath and I thought it was
35         death.    You know, they say your gases - it's only from
36         I've read;     I've never handled anyone dead before;        I just
37         assumed she was dead.


                                         3
  1   Q    You say you then pulled her arm out of her cardigan and so
  2        on and covered her face and you left her.     When you left
  3        her, she was definitely not in a pile of other bodies?
  4   A   No, she was just lying on her own on the side on the
  5        terrace with her head resting on one concrete slab. I
  6        didn't lie her sideways along the concrete;     I laid her
  7       downwards alongside the railings.
  8   Q   At what stage was it then that this police officer spoke
  9        to you?
10    A   After I had initially helped pick a few more people up, I
11        don't know how you'd say, like:      knocked out, winded,
12        things like that.     I picked up another young lad who I
13        carried next to Victoria and started working on him.           It
1-4       was then that the policeman bent down and felt the pulse.
 15       I can't remember which way round it was now, whether he
16        felt the pulse of the young boy by the lad's hand, or by
17        his neck, and then he felt vice versa on Victoria.        He
18        either felt the pulse of the young boy - you know, he was
19        feeling the pulse of his hand or he did it by his neck -
20        and then he did the opposite to Victoria, but I can't
21        remember which way round.     At the time I initially did the
22        first statement I had forgotten about it.      The interview
23        with the West Midlands Police was quite soon after
24        Hillsborough.     I didn't speak to the Hicks for another few
25        weeks after.
26    Q   This is the     statement that the West Midlands Police took,
27        and you say you have given them your original typed
28        statement, and they probably used it - did they - to
29        compile that?
30    A   No, that's the one I give to the two police officers who
31        come to our house.
32    Q   Was that again in your own words?
33    A   Yes, that was.     The police officer wrote down what I said
34        to her.
35    Q   And this is    broadly in the same language.   We will get
36        another copy so that it is easier for you to follow.           The
          sequence of    events is that on 8th May the two police


                                       4
    1       officers from the West Midlands came to see you, and you
    2       made that handwritten statements which we are just getting
    3       photocopied.      Then what happened.
    4   A   After I was speaking to them, I still hadn't mentioned
    5       about the police officer because I hadn't thought about it
    6       then.     As I say, like, I am still very confused at the
    7       time.
    8   Q   You were very upset, weren't you, by your experience?
    9   A   Ye s .
10      Q   When did you remember this business with the police
11          officer taking the pulse?
12      A   It   was in between giving the statements to the police
13          officers and speaking to the Hicks.         I can't recollect
M           when it was, to be honest, but may be two to three weeks
15          afterwards I spoke to the Hicks because the social worker
16          who was doing a one to me got in touch with me and
17          described Victoria's clothes to them, and they said,            "Yes,
18          that was our daughter" so they spoke to me on the phone
19          and through the conversation we were having, how I found
20          her and what I did, I mentioned about the police officer
21          feeling the pulse and saying,       "Leave them; they are dead".
22          Then I just covered the young lad's head up with his coat,
23          and just left them and carried on, like, trying to help
24          anyone else.      After I had spoken to the Hicks, I got a
25          phone call off a Detective McCrombie        or something.   I
26          don't know his first name.
27      Q   I will come to that in a moment, if I may. Can         we just see
28          what you said in this particular statement.         Will you turn
29          to page 4.      It is the last paragraph:
30                   "I then spotted a girl with her legs trapped and
31                   lying down at the front of the enclosure with the
32                   other bodies.   I pulled her out and tried    to give her
33                   the kiss of life.    An odour came from her mouth.        I
34                   realised she was dead.     I pulled her arm out of her
35                   cardigan and covered her face.     It was all Icould do
36                   at the time.    I would described the girl ... "



                                            5
 1       and then you described her.      I think you hadn't given
 2       that description in your earlier statement?
 3   A   No.
 4   Q   So they were asking you to describe her as much as you
 5       could.     Following your conversation with Mr. & Mrs.
 6       Hicks, you thought the girl you were referring to was
 7       there daughter?
 8   A   Yes.   The social worker phoned them up anddescribed,        you
 9       know, the clothes she was wearing to them.      They said    yes,
10       that was their daughter.     They then phoned me at my house
11       and spoke to m e .   I just said to them,   "Just before I
12       start talking to you", and I described the clothes again,
13       because I didn't want to describe the events to them if it
H4       wasn't their daughter because I didn't want to say the way
15       I found her and all then, then to find out it wasn't their
16       daughter, but they said it was.     I just went on to
17       describe how I found her, what I tried to do for her with
18       the police officer then bending over and feeling the
19       pulses of Victoria and the young lad, who I still to this
20       day don't know who he was, like.
21   Q   And you wanted to add that to your statement, did you?
22   A   After to speaking to them, this police officer come to our
23       house - a detective.
24   Q   How did it come about that the police came to your house?
25   A   They told him.    He was their one to one - what do you call
26       it - liaison officer.    He was their officer dealing with
27       their case.
28   Q   It was they who asked him to come and see you. You didn't
29       ask him?
30   A   No.    I just mentioned to them about the police officer,
31       because I didn't really think anything of it.      Then he
32       came to our house to talk to me, and he just started
33       talking in general about Hillsborough and that, and he was
34       quite nice at first because we had even given him his tea
35       because we were just settling down to our tea when he
36       called, and he said he had had a long day because it was
37       in the evening when he come.     We give him his tea, and he


                                      6
  1         was nice and that, and we were talking.         He round to
  2         talking about the police officer, why I hadn't mentioned
  3         it in the first statement, not the one I give the police
  4         officers, but the statement to the West Midlands Police.
  5         I said "At the time I hadn't thought about it" because
  6         even after speaking to the Hicks, I was still remember
  7        s things that happened to me on the day with different
  8        ; people.    It doesn't all come back in one day;         it just
  9         comes back in bits.    He said, "If you put this in your
10          statement" - he asked me could I describe the police
11          officer, and I said, like, I knew he was a young police
12          officer and not an old man.      He said,    "Well, did you
13          recognise his badge number or anything like that?"             I
fc.4        said,   "Well, I can't recollect because everything was so
15          hectic at the time."      It was just a case of trying to get
16         ‘ on with what you were trying to do.        He said then,    "Have
17          you ever heard of the word 'perjury'".         I said,    "Well, I
18          think so.    I don't really understand what it means."             He
19          explained if you say something and put it down in the
20          statements and then its found not to be true you can
21          actually go to prison for committing perjury.            He said,
22          "I'd have a think about this" and then he went, and I
23          spoke to my wife after he went because he said on the
24          lines that you're a young family.      Our Michael was only
25          about 12 weeks old at the time, and he was emphasising
26          about perjury and you could actually go to prison.
27     Q    I am sorry to interrupt you.      How could you possibly be
28          committing perjury.     I don't understand.
29     A   I He was saying if I put that in my statement and then they
30          could prove it to be untrue, I would be putting down in
31          the statement it wasn't true, and that's committing
32          perjury.    That is what he explained to me.
33     Q   Have you heard the word "perjury" before?
34     A   Only loosely before that, but I haven't really heard of
35          it, you know.
36     Q   It is deliberately giving untrue statements on oath.
37     A   That is what he was saying to m e .


                                         7
 1   Q    | But you wouldn't be deliberately giving an untrue
 2        I statement on oath, would you?
 3   A    ; No.   As I say, at the time, I was fairly confused after
 4         : Hillsborough; not only confused about what was in my
         £>
 5       : | mind, I was still upset and that, and he was emphasising,
 6          "You are only a young family" as if to say, like - you
 7       j.; just read between the lines, like, what you know has
 8         happened in other things.
 9   Q     He just didn't say to you,       "Are you sure about this?"
10   A     No, he meant it the other way - if they could prove it
11         wasn't true.    She just said,    "You've helped them enough;
12         just leave it."     So I didn't put it in the statement at
13         the time.
M    Q     I don't understand how anybody could prove that it wasn't
15         true.
16   A     I don't know.   What can you say, like, you know?      Strike
17         me down dead, like.     It happened.     He just sort of leaned
18         on me at the time without being forceful,       I think, playing
19         on the state of my mind.
20   Q     You didn't think that perhaps you might have been mistaken
21         about this?
22   A     No.    Initially, just before Victoria, and that, when I was
23         against the side railings, there was two police officers
24         on the other side who w e 'd been talking to when the
25         initial crushing had happened.       At the time, later when
26         you start thinking about it, I wonder whether it was them
27         two who had come around and were helping in this corner,
28         because this McCrombie who come, he said "We've got you
29         quite often on video and pictures of helping people."           I
30         said, "Haven't you got a picture of the two police
31         officers on the other side of the fence then?"        Because
32         if he has got me by the fence, he must have the picture of
33         the two police officers on the other side of the fence.             I
34         was wondering may be if it was then who had come around.
35   Q     There is a picture which seems to have your name against
36         it.    I don't quite understand why.     I do not know what
37         time that is.     Can you recognise yourself there?     It is a


                                        8
    1       very bad photograph.     Is that a better one there?       Is that
    2       what you were wearing?
    3   A   A green jumper, yes, because I actually showed the police
    4       officers.    It wasn't long after that that I actually burnt
    5       it because I couldn't bear it in the house any more.            I
    6       burnt me clothes that I had on that day afterwards.
    7   Q   At that stage there still seems to be a pile of bodies in
    8       front, doesn't there?
    9   A   Is this the fence here?
10      Q   No, this is the fence here?
11      A   Is that the pitch there?
12      Q   That is the top of the fence, I think.
13      A   This is a picture that could have    been at any   time.

        Q   It is obviously after ----
15      A   It is obviously after the crush.     What I am saying is
16          Victoria I took to the side railing.     Obviously, there
17          were bodies there in the front.     I was picking people off
18          the floor.   I was even dragging people by the hair off the
19          floor who wouldn't get out of the way of people who needed
20          more help.      You said before the bodies by Victoria when
21          you laid her down.     I laid Victoria down by the side of
22          the railings.     I took her out of the crowd of people.
23      Q   I am not saying that you    are mistaken in identifying her
24          but one of the police officers who undoubtedly,      I think,
25          did move Victoria from the pen on to the pitch ---
26      A   Yes, he moved her from the side railings.      I know where
27          Victoria Hicks was that day.
28      Q   He says that after moving numerous bodies "I helped an
29          officer lift a young    girl out of a pile of bodies.      We
30          walked to the fence with her, and I jumped on to the
31          perimeter carrying her in my arms towards an ambulance."
32          I don't think there is any doubt that this is Victoria
33          Hicks because he went in the ambulance with her and he was
34          with her all the time.
35      A   And what description    did he give of her?
36      Q   I don't know at that    stage, but he went in the ambulance
37          with her.


                                          9
 1    A   Yes, but I am saying to you I put her by the side
 2        railings.
 3    Q   I know.
 4    A   Well, he could have picked her up from there because       the
 5        young lad was lying next to her.     If the police have got
 6        all this video evidence, they will find that I actually
 7        picked up practically the last body in the pen which was
 8        the young lad who I tried to give mouth to mouth too as
 9        well, and carried him down to the front of the pen and
10        handed him over to a police officer because I could not
11        step out up because of the step up.     I couldn't lift him
12        up, and the police officer took him out of my arms.
13    Q   The only reason I am asking you about this is that this
|14       account of PC Marshall seems to be inconsistent with what
15        you did to Victoria laying her apart and not in a pile of
16        bodies.   Do you follow?
17    A   Ah, but I thought you were trying to say that I hadn't
18        even touched her.
19    Q   No, I am not say that.
20    A   Obviously, I am a bit confused in the sense the way you
21        are wording it, but I laid Victoria on the side.        I tried
22        to do whatever I tried to do with her, I covered her over,
23        and went back, tried to help other people, picked another
24        young lad up, put him next to Victoria - they were lying
25        next to each other on the side railings.        I tried working
26        on him and then the police officer felt the pulses and I
27        left them because he said,    "They're dead".      I went about
28        trying to help other people, and when I turned around
29        there was a line of policemen in the pen, and when I
30        looked around there was hardly anyone left, and the young
31        lad was still lying there, and I picked him up and I
32        walked from where I said I laid him down, across the pen,
33        there wasn't a person in front of me, and I handed him
34        over to the police officer on the pitch who was waiting
35        outside the gate and said,    "Here you are, pass me him"
36        which I did.    When I picked the lad up, Victoria had
37        already been moved from where I'd laid her.        He might have


                                       10
 1        picked her up from where I laid her.       He didn't pick her
 2        up out of the main crowd where she was before.        I actually-
 3         stood on a man's stomach to get to her because he was at
 4         the bottom of the pile.
 5    Q   There is a bit of a mystery about that.       I am not saying
 6         for a moment you are wrong.       I don't doubt for a moment
 7         that what you say happened.       I am just wondering whether
 8         it is possible there may have been misidentification and
 9         that the girl you were dealing with was not Victoria
10        Hicks?
11    A   Oh, no.     If you ask her mother, I was the only person that
12        had even described her down to her earrings - no-one else.
13         In the policeman's report no-one described the blue
(14        cardigan because when she went to the hospital she didn't
15        have a blue cardigan on.       They must have picked her up
16        and it fell off her other arm on to the floor.         If you
17        ask the Hicks, to this day they still have not received
18        the blue cardigan.      In every police station there is no
19        mention of a blue cardigan.
20    Q   The blue cardigan is something that you mentioned?
21    A   I took her arm out.     I looked around and there were people
22        leaning over the stands looking down, and I covered the
23        face over because I didn't want them to see her face.
24    Q   Can I just look at the description you gave.        "She was
25        wearing a dark blue, button-up-the-front cardigan, white
26         t-shirt, and I think jeans."       There we are.   You gave
27        evidence at the Inquest, didn't you?
28    A   Ye s .
29    Q   Would you like to follow your account with me:
30                 (Q) "What did you do with her?"    (A) "I went towards
31                 her and there was quite a large man lying on the
32                 bottom of the pile with just his t-shirt rolled up
33                 and his stomach showing, but he was bright blue.       I
34                 knew he was dead.   So I just stood on his stomach and
35                 leaned over and pulled her out.   Then this lad helped
36                 me carry her to the side by where I had been standing
37                 and I just laid her down and I didn't know what I was


                                        11
 1         doing.     I just tilted her head back and went to try
 2         and give her what I thought was the kiss of life, and
 3         there was all this terrible smell coming from her
 4         mouth."
 5    You were obviously a bit distressed at this stage.
 6         "I saw she had bits of rust in her mouth.          When I
 7         slightly opened her mouth, I realised then it was
 8         from the pole broke off the barrier when it had been
 9         thrown over.     I had seen all the stuff earlier and it
10         must have gone on her face, and it was around her
11         eyes and specs on her face.          I just took a few bits
12         off from her lips, and then just tried to blow into
13         her mouth, and then someone said 'Leave her, she's
,14        dead'".     (Q) "You thought she was dead?       She looked
15         dead to you, did she not, or did she?"            (A) "Her
16         lips were rolled back and her eyes were really wide
17         open."     (Q) "I don't want you to spend too much time
18         on that, so to speak"           (A) "No, as I say, originally
19         I carried her to the side of the railings and then
20         someone told me that she had died.          I just took her
21         arm out of her cardigan and covered her face and left
22         her.     I just left her there and then carried on."
23    So you are giving the full account there.          All you didn't
24    say was that the person who told you to leave her was a
25    policeman.     Is that right?
26    Yes, because the policeman had come to our house and said
27    if I couldn't describe him as a policeman, his badges and
28    that.
29    Did you feel in any way inhibited at the Inquest from
30    saying that it was a policeman?
31    When you were at the Inquest, I mean, it was all carefully
32    worded for you and all I did was just come out and say it.
33    It was still in my mind that he had said if you can't
34    prove it was a policeman, it wasn't worth saying it was a
35    policeman.




                                      12
 1   Q   You do say that someone said this.         Ican't quite
 2       understand why you didn't say if it was important to you
 3       that it was a policeman who said that?
 4   A   At the time, as I said to you before, when the policeman
 5       had come and seen me he had emphasised that if         I couldn't
 6       prove a policeman it wasn't worth changing         the statement.
 7   Q   I see.    You didn't think of saying    to the Coroner,    "I
 8       think it was a policeman".
 9   A   No, because I had already said.
10   Q   You see, the families were represented at         the Inquest by
11       Mr. Fraser and he doesn't seem to have asked you any
12       questions, although he does ask you this:          "Just for the
13       record, sir, I may not have heard or misheard, but I know
         that this witness knows the name of the young lady who he
15       took from the top of the railings, but I don't think it is
16       on the record."      Then he says again ---
17   A   He said Sarah, didn't he.
18   Q   Yes.     Then the Coroner asks you,   "You know    the lady you
19       took and you tried to save?"       (A) "Yes."     (Q) "Who was it?
20       Do you know?"      (A) "Victoria Hicks".     You were asked by
21       Mr. Fraser to identify the girl but he doesn't seem to
22       have asked you anything more about that, although
23       obviously Mr. & Mrs. Hicks knew at this stage that it was
24       a police officer.
25   A   Wasn't it Mr. King.
26   Q   I think Mr. King may not have been there that day.
27   A   Whoever was representing the families that day, when Mr.
28       Popper said "Thank you, we won't take it any further",
29       because I was upset, whoever was representing the families
30       at the time actually stood up and thanked me for what I
31       did on the day for helping Sarah, and there was actually a
32       gasp in the Coroner's thing because we had been talking
33       about Victoria all the way through, and I was a bit
34       annoyed.     I thought, there's a man who's getting God knows
35       how much money and he is not even reading the statements
36       because he was thanking me for saving the other daughter's
37       life who wasn't even dressed anything like Victoria on the


                                       13
 1         day.      I thought if he is supposed to be representing,
 2         like, 96 families, it's a poor show.            There was a gasp.
 3         Even the families couldn't believe          that he said it.
 4   MR.    BONE:     You hadn't dealt with Sarah     at all?
 5   A      No, I hadn't even        seen her.
 6   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH: This doesn't appear on the
 7         transcript, I don't think.
 8   A     It was just at the end when Mr. Popper had summed up
 9         thanking you.         He stood up to say "I'd just like to say
10         thank you."         If you ever speak to the Hicks again, I'm
11         sure they will remember it.           I thought, there's a man
12         whose representing them and he can't even remember which
13         daughter.
     Q     Can I just read you the transcript.           The Coroner said:
15                  "Mr. Taylor, I am most grateful to you for coming.         I
16                  am very sorry that w e 've brought it back but it is
17                  very good of you to have come and given your
18                  evidence.     Thank you very much indeed.    Oh yes,
19                  there's just one thing.       I want you to put a cross on
20                  the plan.     I want you to mark the position where you
21                  were.     You know where the barrier is that broke, but
22                  I want you to put the position where you were acting
23                  as a stile and helping people over."        (A) "Yes."
24         That     is a reference to what you were doing earlier on.
25         Then Mr. Beachey produces a plan and then Mr. Fraser, who
26         was representing the families - and I have read this bit
27         to you.          That is all that was said.    There is nothing
28         else     said.     Mr. King either wasn't that day or he
29         certainly wasn't asking the questions.           You didn't give
30         evidence on more than one day, did you?
31   A     No, I went for two but it was running behind so I had to
32         come back the second day.
33   Q     That is why the Coroner has apologised for bringing you
34         back again.
35   A     They were running that far behind.          They were actually
36         telling people that he didn't need the statements.



                                            14
 1   Q   I am afraid there is nothing in the transcript about that.
 2       Had you not dealt with the other daughter?          Perhaps you
 3       hadn't .
 4   A   No.   She was totally dressed differently.       I didn't even
 5       see her that day.
 6   Q   There is no reference to somebody thanking you.
 7   A   He actually said "Sarah".      As I say, why it hasn't been
 8       recorded.      There was just this footnote as he stood up as
 9       I was leading out the dock (sic), and he made me stop in
10       my tracks because he said "Sarah".         I said "It wasn't
11       Sarah."
12   Q   Whoever it was must have made a mistake.         There it is.
13       You gave the essence of your evidence that you now give to
|4       me, to the Coroner, but you didn't say it was a policeman?
15   A   No, that is as I say, because in between when I went to
16       see the Coroner, the detective, McCrombie, had been to our
17       house and asked me could I describe the police officer,
18       and all I could give him was that he was young, and even
19       Popper was asking what time.         I had no time to look at
20       people.     You don't keep looking at your watch, yet he was
21       fascinated by times, you know.         I didn't even notice the
22       badge numbers or nothing.      It was just a young policeman
23       who bent down.    There   was two of them because    one bent
24       down and one stood to     the side of him.
25   Q   In effect, he confirmed the conclusion you had already
26       come to.     Is that right?
27   A   Which is what?
28   Q   That she was dead?
29   A   Yes, but as I said, I had never dealt        with adead   person.
30   Q   No, no, I follow that.     But that is the impression you
31       formed, rightly or wrongly?
32   A   It wasn't for me to say or do but I just had to make quick
33       split decisions because, I mean, the amount of things that
34       was going on at the time.          The adrenalin was just pumping
35       away.
36   Q   You obviously did, if I may say so, sterling work in
37       trying to get people out.


                                       15
 1   A      The detective who left our house, he said to me he had me
 2          on pictures and video evidence, so I can't understand why
 3          they can't even tell me who the young lad was, because I
 4          give a description practically of his clothes, and like,
 5          he was the one I was actually working on when the
 6          policeman bent down and felt the pulse.
 7   Q     Did you describe his clothes?
 8   A     Yes.     He had a jumper on with like a round motif in the
 9         middle, with either light brown cords or light brown
10          trousers.    He was only a teenager with a blue padded
11          jacket tied round his waist.       I have tried through the
12          family support group, they said there's only about 4 0 odd
13          of them in the    group.   They are not registered with them;
|4          they don't even know who these other people are that died.
15   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Thank you very much indeed for
16          coming, Mr. Taylor, and giving me your evidence.         There is
17         nothing else is there?
18   MR.   BONE:     I think we might confirm that this officer was
19         wearing gloves     when he took the pulses.
20   A     Ye s .
21   Q     He was.     He didn't take them off?
22   A     No.
23   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Thank you very much indeed.
24                            (The witness withdrew)

               There were              several       short    exchanges        regarding         this and           then    I recall            •;

the    end of the tunnel             it was          split     by a fence and              I ran down to            the

I made my way to the                front     of the          crowd w h i c h was          tightly      packed,

yell i n g at the s p ectators              to       clear the stand.                  I could hear          other

officers       behind me doing            the        same     thing.        As    1 got to the front,                  the

me as    if they were a l r e a d y           dead,,

T here was an officer               on the       fence       kicking       at     it and       I think       he was

joined     by another.            I d o n ’t recall            how but        I realise         they were         trying

to get     the      fence   open so that we                 could get        the dead and           injured         out

onto    the    pitch.        I a s s i s t e d w ith this           task and we very quic k l y m a n a g e d

to force an o p e n i n g .         Having           done    that we        lifted the bodies                over      the

wall    a nd jinto the          pitch where           they were         laid out.            I recall        that

officers/spectators               also    carried some              of the        d e a d / i n j u r e d back    up

Once    the    bodies       had been      cleared           I got     over       the wall      and onto          the

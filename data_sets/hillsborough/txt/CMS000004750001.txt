MEDICAL PRACTITIONER ATTENDANCE AT FOOTBALL MATCHES

Thank you for your letter of 25 January addressed to Mr Kinghan
concerning   Lord   Justice Taylor's   recommendations   on the
attendance of medical practitioners at football matches.

Since your letter you will no doubt be aware that the final
report of Lord Justice Taylor on the Hillsborough Stadium
disaster has been published.   Lord Justice Taylor has modified
his interim recommendation concerning attendance of medical
practitioners, by agreeing that the full-time presence of a
doctor should not be required where there is no reasonable
expectation of more than 2,000 spectators attending the football
match concerned.    However, in these circumstances Lord Justice
Taylor does make clear that the club should make arrangements to
enable a doctor to be summoned immediately to deal with any
medical exigency at the ground.   I refer you to recommendation
66 .
For guidance on how these recommendations are to be implemented I
have passed your letter to David Mould at the Home Office.    You
should be hearing from him after he has consulted colleagues in
the Department of Health. He can be contacted on 01-213-3099.

Yours sincerely

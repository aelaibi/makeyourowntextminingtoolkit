               I am a Police         Inspector    in the West Yorkshire Police    currently posted

               to the Motorway Unit of Operations Traffic.



               On Saturday 15 April         1989 (150489) I was on duty working 4pm        (1600)

               till    12 midnight      (0000).     On my way to work I became aware that some

               sort of incident had occurred at the Liverpool Nottingham Forest

               match.     Although my Force does not cover Sheffield a lot of the fans

               would be using the motorway system to get to and from thp match.



               On arrival      I despatched two vehicles to Woolley Edgje S a r y /i d e ap e a on

               the M1 between junctions 38 and 39 in anticipation of any problems.

               We have a Police Post at this service area situated on the southbound

               side.      I, together with Sgt                          (POL PS
                                                                           PAGE      2
                                                                           S 1 115

attended Woolley Edge at 4.30pm      (1630).     On arrival   one or two

vehicles,   with Liverpool    fans on board started to enter the service

area.



However,    within about   10 minutes they were arriving      in their droves.

Within minutes we had queues up to 50 people waiting to use the public

telephones.      I started to make enquiries of the fans to find

out exactly what had happened.       Their     reaction to us was initially

one of anger saying things such as,      ’The police are to blame*.           I

d i d n ’t pursue my enquiries further at this point.



In view of the large numbers trying to use the public telephones and

that they appeared distressed and shocked.           I and S afe'           POL PS

            arranged groups of 12 at a time to use tjtfe police lines         in

the police post.      Whilst making these arrangement the fans began

telling us about the disaster and that larg 4        numbers of fans had
                                                       y -----
entered the ground by paying the gatemep^£10 c<y%h.            I would estimate
                                          /         7/7
that at    least 50 people told me the jame sto/^f. f      However they did not

identify which gates been used.



Things began to quieten down at about 7pm when the crowds started to

disperse.      At one point   I would estimate that we had between 2 —3000

people on the service area.

HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY:   ADJUSTMENTS TO VOTE XI, 3

I wrote to Finance Division 1 on 2 May providing a detailed
estimate of costs for the Hillsborough Inquiry. The estimate,
for 1989/90, totalled £1,177,000.

In your note to Mr Yates, of 4 May, you advised that you had
agreed with Treasury that the full amount of the estimate did not
need to be put into the newly created subheads at>/time.

We have recently revised out estimates for the cost of the
Inquiry and this has been reported through the FIS system. Our
estimate now, for 1989/90, is for a total spend of £1,150,000.
The close proximity of this present estimate to the previous one
is coincidental. There has been a complete review of expenditure
and a number of the different parts contained within the estimate
differ significantly.

I understand that the Department has intended to make a
supplementary estimate to cover the cost of the Inquiry and I
should be grateful for your advice about this please. The
inquiry team are proceeding at the present time on the basis that
the funds contained in this latest estimate will be found.  If
there are different views about that then it will be important
for us to become aware of this quickly.

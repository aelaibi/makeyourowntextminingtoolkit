EARLY DAY MOTION 733


REMARKS OF MR JACQUES GEORGES


LINE TO TAKE


I   understand   that   the   President   of   UEFA   has   written    to   the
Football Association to say that he regretted that he                 may have
over-reacted to the tragedy at Hillsborough and that the words
that he used in an interview on •French radio were perhaps too
harsh.   I consider his apology to be entirely justified.
EARLY DAY MOTION 733
REMARKS OF MR JACQUES GEORGES




1.       In an interview given to a French radio station the day
after the Hillsborough tragedy Mr Jacques Georges the President
of UEFA (Union of European Football Associations)                               is reported as
describing      Liverpool         fans    as    "like beasts who wanted to charge
into    an- arena."          His remarks have caused considerable outrage,
particularly         in     Liverpool,         and    Liverpool          Football       Club     have
called    for his          resignation      and      the withdrawal            of   England      from
UEFA.


2.       In response to Mr Georges,                   the FA issued a press release
pointing       out    that      there    was    no   evidence       to    indicate       that     the
tragedy had in any w^y been caused by violence among supporters.
They suggested that if Mr Georges'                        comments had been accurately
reported they were untrue, disrespectful to the dead, and utterly
insensitive.


3.       Mr Georges          yesterday         (Tuesday 18 April)              wrote to the       FA
suggesting that he had perhaps reacted "too violently".                                    He said
that his words were perhaps too harsh and that the causes and the
responsibility            for    the    tragedy      may     not    be    as     they    had     been
presented.


4.        On    the       possible       return      of     English       clubs     to     European
competitions          Mr     Georges      says       only    that        "we    will     see     what
decisions will be taken and observed in the future together with
                                                                          *
the     Executive      Committee. "             He   had    earlier       said      that    if    the
Committee were            asked now if English clubs                  should be readmitted
for the 1990/91 season they would likely have said no.

               That this House calls upon M r Jacques Georges, President of the Union of European
             Football Associations, either to withdraw forthwith his insensitive and inaccurate remarks
             regarding football supporters at Hillsborough, which are an affront to the people of the City
             of Liverpool at this tragic time, or to resign immediately.

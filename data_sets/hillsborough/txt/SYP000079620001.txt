                      This    statement           I submit    of rny own v o l ition and          it concerns       the tragic

~-S    ^s.— *4-.     was     d e si gnted for the Liverpool              supporters.         We were       unable      to obtain

                      tickets       for the seating a cc o m m o d a t i o n as       per    1988 so we          chose to have

                      g r o u n d tickets and stand as opposed to no ticket at all.

                      We t r a ve lled       by coach from Liverpool            a r r iving at a p p r o x i m a t e l y      1300

                      hours and entered the ground about                      1345 hrs      quite     normally thro u g h the

                      appropriate           turnstile w hich        permitted access         to    point    'B ’ directly

                      beh i n d the        goal.     At this     time spectators        traffic       into the      ground and
                                                                                                                 P AGE           2
                                                                                                                 S23SS

in close         proximity to the turnstiles was m o d erate and normal                                        w ith no

great      build-up.              At the     emi of the tunnel                we turned          left and took         up a

position to the                  r e a r / ^ f the    ground and about             two    <2) yards      from the

wall     su pporting             the West Stand.             We normally stand               ’m i d - w a y ’ but

because        of the       shallow distance                involved between the supporting                          wall

an d   perimeter           fence we         chose to be near              the     back of the ground to

obtain m axi m u m view.                  Just       prior to the         start        of the game we both had

our    backs       to the supporti ng                 wall and this           later      proved to be our

saviour.

Prior      to the start              there was a small amount                     of    pushing and shoving

where      spectators             lost their          footing       but this       is the expected norm.

The    spectators were well                    behaved with the               usual      banter    between       rival

factions all            of w hich was            good h u m o u r .       I did notice two            instances

prior to the start where                       two               s p e c t a t o r s a p p e a r e d to have    fainted

and where          lifted a 1 ofj><and^noved o v e rhead to safety and treatment.

There      did not a{5p^ear to be any evidence                            of drunkensss           in the area

where we were             standing and similarly                     before      entering        the ground          there

was    no obvious           signs       of a lc oh o l / d r u n k e n e s s .     The    people were moving

about      quite       freely and orderly.

At the start             of the game at               1500 h o j ^ f L e p pings Lane g round a r e a was

like a       ’sardine            can'   with v i r t^if^l 1y no space to m o v e .                 At this       stage       I

was    not aware of any additional                          surge      or abnormal         movement      from the

S D0 C Lc
        ilt/O I"S a

The    game was just a couple                        of minutes        old when some mj^te spectators at

the    front       started          climbing         the high       perimeter          fejXze.    It was       not    clear

at this        stage why this was                    so.    The exodus           of spectators        over      the

perimeter          fence         increased.           A great       push was       experi e n c e d on the back

row where my son and                     I was s t a n d i n g , and this              I thought was

u nc h a r a c t e r i s t i c    of such a position.                  S p e c t a t o r s were also     being

lifted up into the stand above                             us.
                                                                                                        PAGE
                                                                                                        S2388

The mass          exodus    of specta tors        over      the   perimeter    fence      continued

rapidly       but    I was unable         to see the deep seated              cause.       Spectators

spilled onto the             pitch w hi c h      p e r s i pitated a Police Officer              calling

upon the          referee    to stop the game.

The    events w hich followed have a l r e a d y been w i t n e s s e d by the N a t i o n

but    I would       like to express my opinion                   in the hope that          this

statement will assist                in some      small way the         inquiry both the Police

a nd Public         Inquiry which has            been set up to determine               the    causes.



OPIN I O N

1.     Let me firmly            confirm that         this    incident was      not    caused by any

       form of h oo li g a n i s m or violent acts as far as                     I could see

      wi t hi n the ground.

2.     The mood and excitement and e x p e c t a t i o n was                  good humoured.



C RI TI C I S M

1.     L oa t h e d as     I am to    criticise my Police             colleagues        in Sheffield,

       criticise         them    I feel   I must.           It became    very apparent           that

       people       in the ground      behind the fencing required urgent and
                                                    C     ■G *->
       instant       help,      but only a small numJxTr of Officers responded

       to the needs of oj             ?r s .     A gr£at man y officers            c ongregated on

       the    pitch,       not 'helping but standing               in small    groups      talking.

       It was only through the sole                     initiative      of the spectators

       themselves          that wo o d e n hoardings were utilised as

       stretchers          to ferry the         injured to safety.            U n f o r t u n a t e l y and

       wit h great         regret    I was     not    in any      position to help those

       at the front or on the                  pitch.       1 could not    penetrate          the

       crowd       in front      of me.

       the    pitch to cater         for any over spill              emergency.



3.    There were            far too many     spectators         5crammed * into the small

      area behind the goal               before    the    problems        began.



4.    The    siting of the Liverpool               supporters was wrong                  from the

      out-set.          Their    ticket a l l oc at io n was         very muc h        lacking         in the

      extrsem.

      This was not an o r d in ary fixture                  but a cup semi             final      in which

      both sets of supporters w ould have                       been on their            best     behaviour

      and     I ’m sure that a d e q u a t e      s e g r e g a t i o n arra n g e m e n t s   outside        the

      ground would have            been     implemented had the supporters                        been

      al lo ca te d different           ends of the ground to that orig i n a l l y

      decided.

5.   The     ’public a d d r e s s ’ system was ^yffef f ect i ve .                It was inaudible

      because of the            noise    from the      crowd.



6.   Whilst      the     injured were       being tended to on the                  pitch         an

      ann o u n c e m e n t   over the    public address system                requested        people         to

      GET OFF       THE P IT C H w hi c h was most          uncal l e d for and unnecessary.

The    ticket a l l oc at io n should be                 reviewed.        Where     it is common

knowledge           that one of          the     participating        clubs has the greater

spectator           following       then their a ll o c a t i o n of tickets              should be

superior and            that     their     position       in the      stadium should take

pr i o r i t y .



A fairier           d i s t r i bu ti on of tickets would eliminate                  the unwar ranted

crowds at the turns t i l e s                  p a r t i cularly those without          tickets.           Thi

also      applies         to the Cup Final.               Each year        the true supporter              is

left floundering               because of the unfair                 d i s t r i b u t i o n of tickets     to

all    and sundry.             A gain a fairer          d i s t r i b u t i o n of ticketes would

eliminate          u nw ar r a n t e d   crowds at turnstiles             and dr a s t i c a l l y   cut

the ticket touts and black marketeers.



Where an           important       fixture       has ticket a t t a c h m e n t     then to a void

un n e c e s s a r y dis a p p o i n t m e n t   to those     supporters who are             unable        to

obtain tickets             then each           ' h o m e 5 ground    (whepe^it      is played on a

neutral       gerund)        should have           t he faci 1jjfy of televising             the game

via    closed Circ u i t T e l e v is io n                   T.V.).       This a gain would

eliminate          the u nw ar r a n t e d       crowds at the        turnstiles.



The National            Identity Card S y s t e m w ould also                 eliminate      the

unwarr a n t e d      crowds at          the turnstiles,            - B r i e f l y to obtain a

’t i c k e t ’ for the game              the     ID card is to be produced.                To   gain

access      to a stadium the               ID card       is to be       produced along wit h the

ticket.         Access w ould            not be possible wuihout               documents        ie both

the    ID card and the ticket.                      This w ould       prevent a person who             had

obtained a ticket                illegally from entering                 the gorund via the

turnstile because                he was not         in p ossession of an            ID card.

          already        on       the    pitch.           I can         clearly           remember           this       because          it w a s           at

screaming            and        shouting             from     the      crowds          in the             background.

It    became         apparent              to me       th at      something                serious             w as    happening              at       the

of    the      Hop and           the       N Stand.          We      were        all       instructed                 by     Inspector

aware       t hat      this          was       not    the    case,          because             whilst          stood         at       this

Liverpool            supporter                 grabbed       me      and      told         me    people          were         dying          down

As we       walked          on       to    the       pitch       there        was      a    roar          from        the     crowd.          We

formed         the     c o r d o n as           ordered          and      I remained                 there       for        some        4    or 5

minutes.            Whilst           I wa s      there       I was          subjected                to    both        verbal           and

physical            abuse.           Liverpool             supporters             were          spitting,              punching              and

poking         at    us.        We    tried          our    b e st     to     calm         them       but       to     no a v a i l .         They

the      cordon          and      ran       to    the      W Stand area                 as    di d m a n y      other         Officers.

What        I sa w was            horrific,              there          were       people         l y i n g all      o ve r    the       pitch,              a

ground          underneath              the       overhang              of    the     N Stand.           Several        fa ns       were

Th e    f an s       were      well         aware        what          they were            doing       and were        laughing              and

jeering           at     Police         Officers              whilst          they      were       urinating.

I returned               to    the      pitch and                 by    this       t i me    saw a       l a rg e    number         of

to     do    next.          I had       to       escort           a young          Special         Constable          off      the       pitch,

as     he wa s         in a s t a t e            of    sh ock .

The     atmosphere                inside          the      ground            was    very      frightening             and      1 formed              the

opinion           that        the      crowd          were        not    aware        of w h a t        had    happened          and       we      had

to     b ea r     the       brunt       of       their        anger.          Whilst         assisting          with       the      injured              I

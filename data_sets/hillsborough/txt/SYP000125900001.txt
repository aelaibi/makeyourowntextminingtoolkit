CENTRAL PEN AS THERE WAS A GATE WHICH WAS OPEN AJOINING THE TWO PENS SOME WAY
BACK ALONG THE FENCE. MY FRIEND SAID STAY WHERE WE ARE IT GETS TOO CROWDED IN
THE CENTRAL PINS, SO WE REMAINED. THE CENTRAL PEN ADJACENT TO US GOT VERY
CROWDED AS TIME WENT ON BUT VERY FEW PEOPLE CAME INTO THE PEN WE WERE IN.
WHEN THE CRUSH WAS AT ITS PEAK AND PEOPLE WERE CLIMBING OVER THE FENCES, I
DON’T THINK THEY REALISED THAT THEY COULD GET INTO OUR PEN BY THE OPEN GATE.
THERE WERE NO POLICE OR STEWARDS INSIDE THE GROUND.SOME OF MY FRIENDS HAVE
ALREADY PHONED IN TO YOU, I AM NOT PREPARED TO GIVE DETAILS OF THE OTHERS.

I WAS AT THE GROUND LAST YEAR AND FROM PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE THE MIDDLE SECTION
OF THE TERRECES GETS VERY CROWDED. I THEREFORE MADE MY WAY TO THE SECTION OF
THE TERRACES NEXT TO THE NORTH STAND.AS THE GAME STARTED I SAW THAT THE TWO
MIDDLE SECTIONS WERE VERY FULL WHILST THE SIDES WERE STILL FAIRLY EMPTY, THIS
WAS THE SAME AS LAST YEAR AND THE ORGANISERS SHOULD HAVE MADE ARRANGEMENTS TO
DISPERSE THEM. I AM VERY SURPRISED THAT THE POLICE VIDEO CAMERAS DID NOT PICK
THIS UP EARLY ON AND THERE REACTION WAS SLOW EARLY ON WHEN THE FANS WERE
BEING CRUSHED. THE FANS WERE CRUSHED BECAUSE TOO MANY PEOPLE WERE LET IN IN
ONikGO. I THOUGHT THAT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES DID A GOOD JOB AFTER THE
EWT.

IT WASNT CLEAR , THERE NO CLEAR SIGNS AND WHEN I ASKED A PC WHERE WE HAD TO
GO HE JUST TOLD US TO ASK A STEWARD. BY THIS TIME IT WAS HEAVING OUTSIDE
THERE WAS JUST HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE. I WANTED TO MOVE BACK BECAUSE I HAD MY
ELEVEN YEAR OLD SON WITH ME, BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE. I STOOD BY TWO MOUNTED
PCS INORDER TO PROTECT MYSELF. EVENTUALLY WE MANAGED TO GET TO THE
TURNSTILLES AND A PC TOLD ME THAT THEY WERE GOINfJ TO OPEN THE CONCERTINA GATE
SO I WAS TO STAY WHERE IWAS. I WAS BADLY CRUSHED ANDYOU COULD ONLY MOVE
FOMLARD. I WENT THROUGH THE TURNSTILLE AND THE^E WERE NO, PCS AROUND AND ONLY

A POLICE SERGEANT WAS WITH US IN THE STAND AND I ASKED HIME TO DO SOMETHING.
HE SAID,' WHAT CAN I DO' AND I SAID USE YOUR RADIO AND GET THE GATE OPEN. HE
IGNORED ME AND WALKED AWAY. A SHORT TIME LATER A POLICEMAN OPENED THE GATE IN
THE FRONT FENCE, THEN CLOSED IT AGAIN. IT SEEMED LIKE AGES BEFORE THE POLICE
OPENED THE GATE AGAIN. NO-ONE SEEMED TO KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON. ONCE THEY
REALISED THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE SITUATION, THE POLICE DID HELP, BUT IT TOOK
THEM A LONG TIME. THERE WERE A COUPLE OF HEROS AMONGST THE POLICE. I GOT A
GQfiD VIEW OF EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED.

I HAD TO SHOW MY TICKETS A COUPLE OF TIMES. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY ALL
WENT TO THE SAME GATE, CAUSE WHEN I GOT THERE THE CROWD WASN'T THAT BIG. WHY
COULDN'T THE FANS GO TO ANOTHER GATE LIKE I DID. I THOUGH THE SUPPORTERS DID
MORE THAN ANYBODY UNTIL THE FIRE SERVICE GOT THERE, BUT ONCE THE CRUSH
HAPPENED, I DON'T THINK ANYONE COULD HAVE DONE MUCH - IT WAS ALREADY TOO
LATE.

I TRAVELLED DOWN WITH THREE OTHER LADS:

I ARRIVED AT THE GROUNDFS AT APRROX 1420 AND AT THIS TIME THERE REALLY WAS NO
PROBLEM WITH GETTING INTO THE GROUNDS BUT I DID NOTICE THAT THERE WERE NOT
ANY STEWARDS SHOWING YOU TO YOUR SEATS. I MADE MY WAY TO THE TERRACES ABOVE
WHERE THE INCIDENT OCCURED AND I COULD ALREADY SEE THAT THERE WAS A BUILD UP
IN THE TWO CENTRE PENS ALTHOUGH TO THE LEFT AND TO THE RIGHT WERE RELATIVELY
EMPTY ONE THING I DID NOTICE WAS THAT THE SERVICES WERE VERY SLOW TO REACT TO
THE SITUATION EVERYONE WAS TRYING TO CLIMB THE FENCES
THE ONLY OTHER THING I WANTED TO SAY IS THAT THE PA SYSTEM WAS NOT BUT TO ITS
LOGICAL USE THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MESSAGES PUT OUT TO EXPLAIN TO THE MASSES

AS YOU LOOK AT THE PITCH WE WERE TO THE RIGHT OF THE SEATING SECTION. IF YOU
LOOKED FROM THE PITCH WE WOULD HAVE BEEN ON THE LEFT. I CANT UNDERSTAND WHY
ALL THOSE PEOPLE WERE ALLOWED TO CRAM INTO SUCH A SMALL PEN. SOMEONE ON THE
PITCH COULD HAVE SEEN HOW FULL IT WAS AND THAT THERE WAS PLENTY OF ROOM
UPSTAIRS AND    EITHER SIDE OF PEN B. I DID SEE A FEW STEWARDS INSIDE THE
GROUND, AND ALSO A COUPLE OF POLICE OFFICERS IN THE SEATING SECTION OF THE
WEST STAND. I DONT REALLY HAVE A DETAILED,ACCOUNT O f WHAT HAPPENED. ALL I CAN
SAY IS THAT I KNEW SOMETHING WAS TERRIBLY WRONG WHEN MY SONS FRIEND SAID THAT
HE HAD JUST SEEN SOMEONE;LYING ON THE GROUND MOTIONLESS AND THAT SOMEONE
C.CHELE.D HIS FACE AS THOUGH HE WERE DEAD. THE |fEXT THING WAS THAT WE HEARD
THAT FIVE PEOPLE WIRE DEAD.AT FIRST I THOUGHT THAT THERt HAD BEEN A PITCH
INVASION AND THAT OUR LADS WERE LETTING US DOWN BUT OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING WAS
VERY WRONG. ABOUT 20 MINS LATER KENNY DALGLISH MADE AJT ANNOUNCEMENT ON THE
TANNOY ASKING EVERYONE TO CO-OPERATE AS FULLY AS THEY COULD WITH THE POLICE.
THAT IS THE ONLY ANNOUNCEMENT THAT WAS MADE DURING THIS DISASTER. THERE
SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE ANNOUNCEMENTS, AND MORE ORGANISATION.

MY SON WAS WITH ME AT THE MATCH                  25YRS s
               L LIVERPOOL J
THERE WERE ALSO TWO OF HIS FRIENDS WITH US AT THE',MATCH BUT I DQNT KNOW
THEIR NAMES OR ADDRESSES BUT IF I SEE THEM I W£LLj!#ET THEM TO CALL YOU.

  I GOT INSIDE THE GROUNDS AT ABOUT 1500 HRS AND THE ONE THING THAT I NOTICED
 WAS THAT AS SOON AS YOU GOT INSIDE THE GROUNDS YOU IMMEDIATLEY NOTICED THE
  TUNNEL AND SO PEOPLE WERE AUTOMATICALLY HEADING FOR THIS AREA NOBODY SEEMED
TO REALISE THAT THERE WAS A SEPARATE ENTRANCE TO GET ON TO THE WINGS OF THE

INSIDE THERE WAS ASURGE FORWARD AND THERE WAS A MASS OF PEOPLE I WAS SQUASHED
AND I FELT AS IF I WAS GOING TO FAINT BUT AT ABOUT 1515 HRS THERE WAS A
SLIGHT REPRIEVE AND I WAS ABLE TO MAKE MY WAY BACK UP THE TUNNEL. I REALLY
Fgfc THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN STEWARDS ON DUTY TO GIVE US DIRECTIONS AND TO

               PM. A CROWD DEVELOPED BY THE TURNSTILES AND YOU HAD TO GO WITH
               THE CROWD YOU JUST COULDNT MOVE. AT ABOUT 3PM    THE GATE TO THE

THE CROWD JUST CARRIED ON SURGING FORWARD DOWN TOWARDS THE TUNNEL, THERE WERE
NO SIGNS OR STEWARDS TELLING PEOPLE TO GO ANYWHERE ELSE. IT WAS A JOKE, THATS
HOW EVERYONE GOT INTO THE SAME PEN. WHEN WE WERE GOING DOWN THE TUNNEL I SAW
PEOPLE COMING OUT OF THE TERRACES CLUTCHING THEIR CHESTS. WE ENDED UP TOWARDS
THE BACK OF THE PEN BY WHERE THE CAMERAS WERE BUT WE DIDNT STAY THERE LONG,
WE FOUGHT OUR WAY BACK OUT DOWN THE TUNNEL.

INFO      >> I PARKED MY CAR ON THE WISEMAN ESTATE, I WALKED ROUND TO THE
             GROUND AND PICKED MY TICKET UP FROM A FRIEND AT THE PLAYERS
             ENTRANCE AT ABOUT 2.25. AS I WAS WALKING TO THE GROUND I SAW THAT
             A CERTIAN AMOUNT OF ALCOHOL WAS BEING CONSUMED FROM BOTTLES AND
             CANS. I THEN WALKED PAST THE SPION KOP ENTRANCE, AND THE CROWD
             THERE WAS MOVING VERY FREELY. I WENT LAST YEAR AS WELL, BUT THIS
             YEAR THERE WAS...

ONLY dNE PERSON SELLING TICKETS, WHEN LAST YEAR THAT HAD BEEN MANY. I ARRIVED
AT THE LEPPINGS LANE ENTRANCE AT 2.40. THERE WAS A LOT OF PUSHING AND SHOVING
AT THAT ENTRANCE. SHORTLY AFTER I ARRIVED THERE,K THE POLICE PULLED THE
POLICE HORSES ACROSS, I ASSUME TO RELEIVE THE PRESSURE ON THE TURNSTILES. AT
THAT TIME THE POLICE WERE TELLING THE CROWD TO CALM DOWN AND THAT THE
KICK-OFF WOULD BE DELAYED, AND I HAD NO REASON TO DISBELIEVE THAT. IT WAS
TOTAL CHAOS AS WE GOT TO THE TURNSTILES- I COULD SEE THE POLICE THERE HAD AN
IMfl|SSIBEL j o b a s t h e y w e r e b e i n g p i n n e d a g a i n s t t h e w a l l , w e r e m a r k e d w i t h
Tfflffi ON HOW MUCH MORE DIFFICULT THEIR JOB WOULD BE IF WE HAD TO SHOW ID
CARDS. I SAW A LAD, A FOOTBALL FAN, ON A WALL, ENCOURAGING FANS TO CLIMD OVER
THE WALL IF THEY HADN'T GOT A TICKETR, AND OBVIOUSLY SOME WERE. I GOT TO MY
SEAT AND THE GAME WAS IN PROGRESS. APPARENTLY FIVE MINUTES BEFORE THE KICKOFF
THE PEN IMMEDIATELY BELOW US WAS ALMOST EMPTY, THEN WAS FILLED BY THE SUDDEN
SURGE. IT SEEMED TO TAKE A LONG TIME BEFORE ANYONE REALISED THE GRAVITY OF
THE SITUATION. I COULD COUNT FIVE BODIES LYING IN FRONT OF US ON THE PITCH
WITH FANS AND POLICE WORKING ON THEM. I DIDN'T SEE ANY LOOTING OR ANYTHING
LIKE THAT, JUST A LOT OF PEOPLE WORKING HARD.

I WAS ON MY OWN IN THE WEST STAND.

NEXT WEEK I START                        SO I AM AVAILABLE AT ANY TIME TO
MAKE A STATEMENT AND WOULD BE ONLY TOO WILLING TO DO SO.

STANDING AND I COULD NOT SEE VERY WELL SO I WAS NOT TOO HAPPY SO I CLIMBED
ONTO THE BOTTOM PART OF THE RAILINGS AND STAYED THERE UNTIL 1455HRS WHEN
THERE WAS ANOTHER SURGE AND ALL HELL LET LOOSE AND SO TO GET AWAY FROM IT I
HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO CLIMB INTO PEN A. LOTS OF PEOPLE WERE TRING TO CLIMB
OVER FENCES AND I WAS HELPLESS. I SAW THE CRUSH HAPPENING AND WAS NOT ABLE TO
D(M|NYTHING AT ALL. I SAW A FEW PEOPLE UNCONCIOUS AND PEOPLE PASSING OUT AND
I A     FEW PEOPLE RECIEVING EMERGENCY TREATMENT. I DONT THINK THERE WERE
ENOUGH STEWARDS AT THE GROUND. I THINK THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SOME
DIRECTIONAL SIGNS. I LEFT ABOUT 1615HRS. THE POLICE WERE VERY SHAKEN AND I
SAW A COUPLE BEING CARRIED AWAY FROM THE PEN WHERE THEY HAD BEEN TO HELP THE
CROWDS. THEY REALLY DID HAVE THEIR WORK CUT OUT. THEY TOOK A LOT OF STICK
FROM PEOPLE BUT DID ALL THEY COULD TO HELP.

TO PICK HIM UP AND HE HAD GONE. EVERYBODY WAS SCREAMING AND SHOUTING FOR HELP
BUT EVERYONE WAS DOING ALL THAT THEWY COULD. WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME HELPING
PEOPLE OUT. I THINK IT WAS A SUPERINTENDANT WHO STARTED TO RIP THE FENCE DOWN
TO GET EVERYONE OUT. THE POLICEWOMAN WAS BRILLIANT AND STARTED TO HELP
EVERYONE OUT. I DID NOT SEE ANY STEWARDS IN THE GROUND BUT I THINK THAT
WOULD HELP IF THERE WERE MORE THERE. I WAS ALONE AT THE MATCH.

ANYHOW WHEN I MET M Y SON WITH MY TICKET WE WENT INTO THE GROUND AND AS MY
SON HAD BEEN AT HILLSBOROUGH BEFORE HE KNEW WHERE TO GO. THERE WERE NO
STEWARDS INSIDE THE GROUND TO DIRECT PEOPLE WHERE TO GO. WE WERE IN THE LEFT
HAND WING AT LEPPINGS LANE THAT IS ON THE LEFT OF THE GOAL AS YOU LOOK AT THE
PITCH. AT 1400HRS I LOOKED AT THE CENTRE PART OF THE TERRACES AND COULD SEE
THAT THESE WERE OVERCROWDED THEN AND BY 1420HRS I COULD SEE THE CROWD BEING
PUSHED FORWARD AND BACKWARDS IN THE CENTRE PART MY SON SAID"ITS OK MUM ANY
MINUTE NOW THE POLICE AND STEWARDS WILL DIRECT PEOPLE INTO THE SIDE WINGS OF
T m T E R R A C E S AS THEY ALWAYS DO" .BUT THIS DIDNT HAPPEN. WE COULD HEAR A LOT OF
NOTSE OUTSIDE THE GROUND AND ONE MAN CAME AND STOOD BEHIND US AND HE STILL
HAD HIS FULL TICKET AND HE TOLD US THAT NO ONE WAS TAKING TICKETS.
I DO NOT BLAME THAT POOR POLICE OFFICER WHOSE DICISION IT WAS TO OPEN THE
GATES, HE DID WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS CORRECT AND IF ANYONE HAD BEEN INSIDE THE
GROUND TO DIRECT THEM INTO THE WINGS OF THE TERRACES THIS WOULD NOT IM SURE
HAVE HAPPENED
THERE SEEMED TO BE PLENTY OF POLICE INSIDE THE GROUND AND VERY FEW OUTSIDE
I JUST HAD TO GET AWAY FROM THIS COUNTRY FOR A FEW DAYS TO HELP ME GET THIS
AWFUL THING OUT OF MY HEAD SO I WENT TO KOLN IN WEST GERMANY FOR A FEW DAYS

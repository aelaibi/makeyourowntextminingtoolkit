            On Satur day            9th     April       1988          (090488)        I attended                the       FA Cup Semi          Final

            at     Hillsborough             Football             Ground,        Sheffield.                 My    duties          were    at    the

            the     b es t    of    my    recollection                 consisted           of    the       following             officers:

            Our     duties         consisted           of    supervising              Liverpool              fans         mainly    into

            West     and North            Stands.            We       remained        outside          the       gates       unti

            approximately                3.10pm        (1510)          and al th ou gh           there          was       a>flmdful       of

            stand.           I went       towards           the       front     of    the       s ta n d ,      to    the    right       hand     side

All of which actions were, together with others,

consolidated by the Order of the Honourable Mr.

Justice Rose dated the 14th day of May 1990.




                  NOTICE OF APPEAL



TAKE NOTICE that the Court of Appeal will be moved

as soon as Counsel can be heard on behalf of the

abovenamed Defendant, on appeal from so much of the

Judgment of the Honourable Mr. Justice Hidden given

at the trial of these consolidated actions on the

31st day of July 1990 whereby it was ordered that

there be a Judgment for each of the abovenamed

Plaintiffs and that Judgment be entered for each of

the abovenamed Plaintiffs.




FOR AN ORDER that:-



      (i)    the said Judgment for each of the

             abovenamed Plaintiffs be set aside



      (ii)   the claims of each of the

             aforesaid Plaintiffs be dismissed

             and that Judgment be entered for

             the Defendant in each of the

             aforesaid actions and that each

             of the aforesaid Plaintiffs be

             ordered to pay to the Defendant
               his, the Defendant's, costs of

               the action and of this appeal to

               be taxed if not agreed.



AND FURTHER TAKE NOTICE that the grounds of this

appeal are:-



1.    That the Learned   Judge erred in concluding

      that it was reasonably foreseeable that each

      of the Plaintiffs would have suffered personal

      injury by shock.


2.    That the Learned   Judge erred and misdirected

      himself in holding that the Defendant owed a

      relevant duty of care to a parent in the

      position of the Plaintiffs Agnes Copoc, Harold

      Copoc or Maureen Mullaney or to a spouse in the

      position of the Plaintiff Karen Hankin.


3.    That the Learned   Judge erred and misdirected

      himself in holding that the Defendant owed a

      relevant duty of care to a Plaintiff in the

      relationship, or merely in the relationship, of

      sister, brother or uncle to the relevant

      "victim", that is, as to sister,   in the case of

      Brenda Hennessey and Denise Hough and as to

      brother in the case of Brian Harrison, Stephen

      Jones and Robert Spearrit who was also in the

      relationship of uncle to another "victim".
That the Learned Judge erred and misdirected

himself in holding that there was any relevant

duty of care on the part of the Defendant to a

Plaintiff who was not present at the event

alleged to give rise to such breach of duty or

at the immediate aftermath thereof or

alternatively, if there was such duty, that

there was any breach thereof in respect of a

Plaintiff who was not present at the event or

at the immediate aftermath thereof.


That the Learned Judge erred and misdirected

himself in holding that insofar as the

Defendant owed any relevant duty to any of the

Plaintiffs, that duty was breached where the

Plaintiffs1 perception or awareness of the

"event" complained of arose from watching a

television broadcast.


That the Learned Judge erred and misdirected

himself in holding that the Plaintiff, Brenda

Hennessey, who had no concern for any relevant

"victim" at the time of watching television and

learned sometime thereafter of the potential

involvement of her brother, thereafter

suffering, was entitled to Judgment.


That the Learned Judge failed to hold in

respect of any alleged nervous shock suffered

in consequence of watching a television

programme that it was too remote.
That the Learned Judge erred and misdirected

himself in holding that any liability arose in

respect of nervous shock suffered by reason of

watching a broadcast.


That the Learned Judge erred and misdirected

himself in failing to have regard to the burden

upon the Plaintiff of proving that such injury

as was complained of was caused or materially

contributed to by an act or omission for which

the Defendant was liable to that Plaintiff,

rather than by other events, circumstances or

experience of the Plaintiff following the

events at Hillsborough for which the Defendant

was not in law liable.   Examples are:-



In the case of Agnes Copoc, her illness

being "related to the Hillsborough

disaster"



In the case of Harold Copoc, his illness

being "all as a result of losing his son

at Hillsborough"



In the case of Karen Hankin, a result of

"her experience"



In the case of Denise Hough, of being

"typical bereavement reactions of shock,

depression, deep mourning and grief" and
      being someone "who has been affected

      emotionally by the tragic loss under

      extraordinary circumstances"



10.   In all the circumstances of each case the

      Judgment for each of the Plaintiffs was:-



       (a)   Contrary to existing authority


       (b)   More than policy required and/or

             was contrary thereto.



AND FURTHER TAKE NOTICE that the Defendant proposes

to apply to set down this appeal in the Queen's Bench

Final and New Trial List.




                                  W. C. WOODWARD Q.C.



DATED the      8th     day of        November     1990

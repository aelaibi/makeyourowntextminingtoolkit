                  I am a Police Sergeant in the South Yorkshire Police, at present stationed
         at the Sheffield Road Traffic Division, Claywheels Lane, Sheffield.


                  I have over 14 years Police service.


                  During the weekend of JYiday 14 April and Monday 17 April 1989* I was
         between postings, transferring from Woodseats sub-division, and the Traffic
         Section.
                  As such it was my weekend off, and on Saturday 15 April 1989, I was
         weekly leave working, at a football special duty ,due to take place, at
         Hillsborough Football Stadium, Sheffield.


                  I had for some time previous, been aware of the duties I was to undertake
         on that date, and was in posession of a briefing sheet, setting out my basic
         duties and time of briefing, and listing the officers deputed to ray serial.
         (Serial 8). These officers, all Constable®, are as follows:

              The match to be played was the FA Cup Semi - final game between
        Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, kick off at 3«00pm#
              A full briefing was commenced at 10.00 am the same date, and all my
        officers were present at it.


              Immediatley after this briefing, my serial were instructed to take a
        meal, and to be present on specific points at 10.^5 anu


              The duties given to my serial on that day was to police the Spion Kop,
        with emphasis on the raised section of the Kop, which was to house the
         250 or so Liverpool supporters, who were believed to have bought tickets
        in Nottingham for this area which was specifically designated for sole
         occupation of Notts, Forest fans#


              The spion kop at Hillsborough stadium will hold about 22,000 persons
        when full to capacity, and this was to be the situation on that date.


              Together with my serial, I took up position on the Kop at the above
        time, and saw that Police Sergeant 752 Batty and his serial (serial 7)
        were there also*


              A short time after, we were joined by Police Inspector Calvert', who was
        to be the serial Commander.             Insp. Calvert further instructed both myself
        and PS Batty as to his specific Policing requirments, and iterated to me
        his desire to maintain strong presence at the raised corner section.,bf the
        Kop where both rival supporters would come into contact with eachother.


                                                                                             Contd

Continuation of statement of         Richard Anthony Marples                 PS 1203.



          This duty was given over to me and my serial, which was to be
reinforced, as and when the need arose*


          Sometime after 11:15 am,      Police Superintendent Greenwood, the
Ground Commander, came to where the serials had gathered, and spoke further
 to us, firstly outlining the arrangements of the dayi| and indicated to
 us in general of the violent propensity of the Liverpool fans.


          The entire serial and I were in no doubt as to the nature of our
 duties on that date, and each Constable had in turn been briefed by
 myself, as to their specific role.




          As the build up towards the match commenced, I left half of the
 serial to man the point at the raised section, and with the brief that
 ONLY Liverpool supporters were to have access.
          The remaining officers patrolled the ramps giving entry to the
Kop area.


          Whilst undertaking this duty, a large number of Liverpool supporters
 covertly made themselves known to me and the officers, and requested that
 they be directed to the Liverpool section;                     and they were guided in this
 direction*
          After a short time the Kop began to fill up, and the general bustle
 of the area increased, and with it came the attendant problem, of rival
 fans being separated only by a line of Constables*


          I saw several groups of ’loutish* Liverpool supporters',* much the
worse for drink, jeer and taunt at the far larger Notts Forest contingent*
As a result several ground ejections were made immediately by ray serial
officers*
          On seeing this the undesirable Notts Forest eliment assembled closeby,
and the situation changed to one of difficulty*
                                                                                        Contd* **

                  I then saw several Police officers from Sgt Battys* serial eject
        about 5 persons from these Notts Forest supporters, and as a result the
         situation quietened for a short time.


                  Throughout this time the crowd was building within the Kopt and it
        was fast approaching a capacity situation.                        Entry and exit from the
        immediate area began to get harder, and as a result I requested my entire
         serial to the raised section, in order to reinforce the line of officers,
         who were now experiencing difficulty in acheiving proper segregation*


                  With the full serial of 10 men, and myself, now almost isolated from
         other officers, I maintained the cordon, with abuse being shouted at us
         from each side, as well as each faction of fans shouting an d swearing, and
         gesticulating obscenely at each other*


                  It became obvious to me that the situation would develop, and
         deteriorate further, and in anticipation I signalled to Sgt Batty, an d his
         men, to come to our assistance*


                  With the new serial now backing up the cordon, the situation became
         easier for the officers an d myself, an d a double Police line was formed***
         with Police officers standing tightly behind one another*


                  Faced with this situation1, it was difficult to perceive problems in
         any other part of the ground, but the overall impression was that of a full
         and capacity attendance, and was expected.


                  Radio transmissions were frequent, and for my part often went unheard
         and lost within the general noise an d disturbance of the crowd*




                  As the teams emerged from the players tunnel the obscene chanting and
         melee continued', but try now, any attempt to eject unruly fans, would serve
        only to deplete the lin^of officers struggling to maintain, order1, and because
        of the ca-nacitw crourity ease of exit/entrance was severly curtailed*
                                                                                                    Contd.*

                 A short time after play began, I was aware of an incident at the
         opposite end of the ground, and saw fans, Police and players at the
         Liverpool end*


                 My initial reaction, was that there had been a pitch invasion, and
         this view was obviously shared by the Notts Forest supporters, who
         immediatley resumed their hostile attitude to the Liverpool supporters near
         me*
                 I heard them shout in obscene manner, and push and surge toward them*


                 This situation caused me some concern, and I rallied the Police
         officers to maintain the line.


                  This situation prevailed for some minutes.




                  As the first of the Liverpool fans ran toward the Notts Forest end,
          (now known for makeshift strechers) I saw a surge forward of fans on the
          spion kop, and again the situation was disturbing,'


                  When the first of the injured were carried off the area, through
         access at the base of where I was standing, the Notts Forest supporters
         laughed and cajouled at them, probably thinking they sustained their
         injuries whilst invading the pitch.




                  As the fuller circumstances unfurled directly in front of us, the
         entire mood of the Notts Forest supporters changed, to one of quiet
         disbelief, and they began to applaud, the emergency services, Police,
         Fire, Ambulance, and those supporters who had rendered assistance to their
          friends*
                  Almost everyone of the injured persons was strecthered away within
         our full view, and exited the playing area from directly beneath us.


                 Whilst these events were taking place,' two doctors made themselves
         aware to me^and I                        that they were escorted to the field by,                       CONTD,.

                            *f11   Bellamy,
        I did not see these officers until much later, and I was informed they
had taken tip rescue duties, and that Pc Thornhill was now detained with a
body.


        As the events continued, many of the supporters of both teams, were
obviously shocked and sickened by what they had witnessed, and many were
making their way out of the ground quietly, however, the hardcore of
supporters remained, some of them showing little concern for the situation,
enquiring continuously when and if play would reirume,, I was even asked by
Liverpool supporters where they could obtain their money back.


        After sometime, when the main operation had ended, it became obvious
to everyone that play was abandoned, and all supprters were encouraged to
leave the ground.


        When the spion kop was cleared, I took my serial to the area of the
Gymnasium, where I saw numerous other Police Officers, (some of whom were
in deep distress),'




        I was there approached by Chief Insp, Beal (PI)1, and instructed to
take n$r serial cm mobile patrol, due to sparodi# outbursts of fighting about
the area of the ground and went on mobile patrol using callsign ’Mobile 8 »
at k»kO        that date.


        Once outside the ground, I went with my serial to Middlewood Road,
Sheffield, and stood by for direction to any incident.


        At 5*50 pm that date I was instructed to return to Hillsborough stadium
to stand down.

                                                                                    Contd,,

         At 7*00pm that date I was instructed to go off duty, and did so
from the ground.


         I took no further part in the events of that day.




         For the information of the Police inquiry team, I wish to add, that I
  was present at last years semi-final between the same two teams, and had
  the same duty as the one which I was given on                          the 15 April 89.
         The circumstances of the pre - match build                      up were much thesame on the
  last occasion, the Liverpool supporters being violent and aggressive in
  attitude, and became even more so, when Liverpool football team scored
  the first goal.
         The whole situation after that became worse, and a virtual free for
  all broke out on the raised Kop area, with the officers in the middle of
  it.
         Numerous arrests/ejectioni followed, and full order was only acheived
  by the drawing of Police staffs.


         It is within ray knowledge that this entire                     senarion was videoedand was

                 Hie match to be played was the FA Cup Semi - final game between
         Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, kick off at 3»00pm.
                 A full briefing was commenced at 10.00 am the same date, and all my
         officers were present at it.


                 Imnediatley after this briefing, my serial were instructed to take a
         meal, and to be present on specific points at 10.**5 am.


                 The duties given to my serial on that day was to police the Spion Kop,
         with emphasis on the raised section of the Kop, which was to house the
         250 or so Liverpool supporters, Who were believed to have bought tickets
         in Nottingham for this area which was specifically designated for sole
         occupation of Notts, Forest fans*


             Hie spion kop at Hillsborough stadium will hold about 22,000 persons
         vihen full to capacity5, and this was to be the situation on that date.


             Together with my serial, I took up position on the Kop at the above
         time, and saw that Police Sergeant 752 Batty and his serial (serial 7)
        were there also.


             A short time after, we were joined by Police Inspector Calvert, who was
        to be the serial Commander.               Insp. Calvert further instructed both myself
        and PS Batty as to his specific Policing requirments, and iterated to me
        his desire to maintain strong presence at the raised corner section/of the
        Kop where both rival supporters would come into contact with eachother.


                                                                                          Contd,

           This duty was given over to me and my serial, Which was to be
 reinforced, as and when the need arose.


           Sometime after 11:15 am,      Police Superintendent Greenwood, the
 Ground Commander, came to where the serials had gathered, and spoke further
 to us, firstly outlining the arrangements of the day, and indicated to
 us in general of the violent propensity of the Liverpool fans.


           The entire serial and I were in no doubt as to the nature of our
 duties on that date, and each Constable had in turn been briefed by
 ngrself, as to their specific role.




           As the build up towards the match commenced, I left half of the
 serial to man the point at the raised section, and with the brief that
 ONLY Liverpool supporters were to have access.
           The remaining officers patrolled the ramps giving entry to the
 Kop area.


           Whilst undertaking this duty, a large number of Liverpool supporters
 covertly made themselves known to me an d the officers, and requested that
 they be directed to the Liverpool section;                 and they were guided in this
 direction.
           After a short time the Kop began to fill up, and the general bustle
 of the area increased, and with it came the attendant problem, of rival
 fans being separated only by a line of Constables.


           I saw several groups of *]           sh' Liverpool supporters, much the
worse for drink, jeer and taunt at the far larger Notts Forest contingent.
As a result several ground ejections were made immediately by my serial
officers.
           On seeing this the undesirable Notts Forest eliment assembled closeby,
and the situation changed to one of difficulty.
                                                                                     Contd...

         Continuation of statement of       Richard Anthony Marples,              PS 1203




                 I then saw several Police officers from Sgt Battys’ serial eject
         about 5 persons from these Notts Forest supporters, and as a result the
         situation quietened for a short time.


                 Throughout this time the crowd was building within the Kop, and it
         was fast approaching a capacity situation.                     Entry and exit from the
         immediate area began to get harder, and as a result I requested my entire
         serial to the raised section, in order to reinforce the line of officers,
         who were now experiencing difficulty in acheiving proper segregation.



                 With the full serial of 10 men, and myself, now almost isolated from
         other officers, I maintained the cordon, with abuse being touted at us
         from each side, as well as each faction of fans shouting and swearing, and
         gesticulating obscenely at each other.


                 It became obvious to me that the situation would develop, and
         deteriorate further, and in anticipation I signalled to Sgt Batty, and his
         men, to come to our assistance.


                 With the new serial now backing up the cordon, the situation became
         easier for the officers and myself, and a double Police line was formed^
         with Police officers standing tightly behind one another.


                 Faced with this situation, it was difficult to perceive problems in
         any other part of the ground, but the overall impression was that of a full
         and capacity attendance, and was ejected,


                 Radio transmissions were frequent, and for my part often went unheard
         and lost within the general noise and disturbance of the crowd.




                 As the teams emerged from the players tunnel the obscene chanting and
         melee continued, but by now, any attempt to eject unruly fans, would serve
        only to deplete the lina^of officers struggling to maintain order, and because
        of the capacity crowit^ease of exit/entrance was severly curtailed.
                                                                                                       Contd,,

         A short time after play began, I was aware of an incident at the
  opposite end of the ground, and saw fans, Police and players at the
  Liverpool end.


         My initial reaction, was that there had been a pitch invasion, and
  this view was obviously shared by the Notts Forest supporters, who
  immediatley resumed their hostile attitude to the Liverpool supporters near
  me.
         I heard them shout in obscene manner, and push and surge toward them*


         This situation caused me sane concern, and I rallied the Police
  officers to maintain the line*


         This situation prevailed for some minutes*




         As the first of the Liverpool fans ran toward the Notts Forest end,
  (now known for makeshift strechers) I saw a surge forward of fans on the
  spion kop, and again the situation was disturbing.


         When the first of the injured were carried off the area, through
  access at the base of where I was standing, the Notts Forest supporters
  laughed and cajouled at them, probably thinking they sustained their
  injuries whilst invading the pitch*




         As the fuller circumstances unfurled directly in front of us, the
  entire mood of the Notts Forest supporters changed, to one of quiet
  disbelief, and they began to applaud, the emergency services, Police,
 Fire, Ambulance, and those supporters who had rendered assistance to their
  friends*
         Almost everyone of the injured persons was strecthered away within
  our full view, and exited the playing area from directly beneath us*


         Whilst these events were taking place, two doctors made themselves
 aware to me^and I              that they were escorted to the field by,             CONTD..

      I did not see these officers until much later, and I was informed they
had taken up rescue duties, and that Pc Thornhill was now detained with a
body.


      As the events continued, many of the supporters of both teams, were
obviously shocked and sickened by what they had witnessei, and many were
making their way out of the ground quietly, however, the hardcore of
supporters remained, some of than showing little concern for the situation,
enquiring continuously when and if play would resume,, I was even asked by
Liverpool supporters where they could obtain their money back.


      After sometime, when the main operation had ended, it became obvious
to everyone that play was abandoned, and all supprters were encouraged to
leave the ground.


      When the spion kop was cleared, I took my serial to the area of the
Gymnasium, where I saw numerous other Police Officers, (some of^WhOB~wfcre




      I was there approached by Chief Insp, Beal (FI), and instructed to

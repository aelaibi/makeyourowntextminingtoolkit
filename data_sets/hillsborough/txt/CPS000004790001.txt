     Dear Mr Kennedy

     Following your receipt of the West Midlands Report on the investigation
     into the Hillsborough Disaster 1989, the meeting which followed and
     subsequent agreement with the Police Complaints Authority, it was decided
     that certain interviews would be undertaken by the West Midlands Police
     investigators under my supervision, and that I would conduct some of the
     interviews myself.

     These interviews have commenced and in accordance with the forementioned
     agreements, it is now my intention to forward to you the transcripts of
     these interviews at the earliest possible moment, together with any
     associated video and audio recordings.

     Please find herewith the transcripts and associated materials which arise
     from the latest round of interviews.

     Because of the relationship between the interviews you will no doubt wish
     to defer any advice until they are all to hand but in the meanwhile should
     there be any further information required, or any direction you may wish
     to give, I am sure you will contact either myself or Detective Chief
     Superintendent Foster at the above address.

     Although dates of some of the interviews still await confirmation by the
     various legal representatives, it is hoped that the final interview will
     be concluded during the first week of July 1990.

     Yours sincerely

    Q21.       DID YOU SEE ANY INCIDENT IN THAT STANDING AREA WHICH YOU

               BELIEVE COULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THIS DISASTER?



                   THE TWO CENTRAL PENS CONTAINED THE BULK OF THE LIVERPOOL

    FANS, WHILE THE STANDS TO EITHER SIDE OF THOSE PENS CONTAINED VERY         FEW

    FA N S .



    Q22.       DO YOU KNOW IF YOU SAW ANYTHING WHICH YOU BELIEVE WAS DIRECTLY

               CONCERNED WITH THE BREAKING OF A BARRIER IN PEN 3?


    p e '
                   THE TW0 PENS BEHIND THE GOAL WERE PACKED.   AT ABOUT FOUR

~   MINUTES INTO THE GAME PETER BEARDSLEY HIT THE BAR. AND I SAW THE CROWD

    SURGE FORWARD IN THE WEST STAND TERRACES.



    Q23.       WHAT TIME DID YOU TAKE UP YOUR MATCH VIEWING POSITION?

                                                                       D i369

                NO.



     QS7.   DID YOU ASSIST ANY OF THE INJURED?    (BRIEFLY EXPLAIN)



                NO.



     G28.   DID YOU   WITNESS ANY ACT BY SUPPORTERS WHICH OBSTRUCTED EITHER

            POLICE,   STEWARDS OR MEDICAL PERSONS AT THE TIME OF THE DISASTER?



                AT APPROXIMATELY 3.35 PM (1535 HRS) ABOUT SIX LIVERPOOL

     SUPPORTERS RAN TOWARDS THE SPION KOP, WHERE THE NOTTINGHAM FOREST

     SUPPORTERS WERE.     THIS PROMPTED THE POLICE TO PUT A LINE OF OFFICERS

     ACROSS THE PITCH.



     029.   HAVE YOU ANY COMMENT TO MAKE ABOUT THE ACTIONS OF THE POLICE

            OFFICERS AT THE TIME OF THE DISASTER?



                1.    THE LINE OF POLICE OFFICERS COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER

     EMPLOYED HELPING THE FANS RATHER THAN TRYING TO COMBAT A VERY MINOR

     INCIDENT (AS OUTLINED IN 028). OTHER THAN THAT THE REST WERE VERY GOOD,
■T
                2.    THERE WAS A LACK OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE POLICEMEN

     IN FRONT OF THE WEST TERRACING AND THE LINE OF POLICE ON THE PITCH.        I

     THINK THE POLICE ON THE SCENE TOOK TOO LONG TO COMMUNICATE THE SCALE

     OF THE DISASTER TO OTHERS ON THE SCENE.



     030.   HAVE YOU ANY COMMENT TO MAKE ABOUT THE ACTIONS OF ANY OF THE

            MATCH STEWARDS AT THE TIME OF THE DISASTER?



                NO.   THEY WERE DOING WHATEVER THEY COULD.
 HAVE YOU ANY COMMENT TO MAKE ABOUT THE ACTIONS OF ANY OTHER

  PERSON IN AUTHORITY AT THE TIME OF THE DISASTER?



      NO,



  WERE YOU SUBJECTED TO ANY THREATS OR VIOLENCE?



      NO.



  DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL ACT

  BY ANY PERSON?



      1.           FOREST FANS IN FRONT OF THE PRESS BOX WERE ABUSIVE T

LIVERPOOL FANS ON THE PITCH.     SUBSEQUENTLY ONE PERSON WAS ARRESTED

LED AWAY BY OFFICERS.



  HAVE YOU BEEN PRESENT AT. OR HAD EXPERIENCE OF ANY OTHER

  FOOTBALL TRAGEDY?     (BRIEFLY EXPLAIN)



      NO.



  IF YOU ATTENDED LAST YEARS SIMILAR MATCH WAS THERE ANYTHING

  SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT WHICH YOU THINK IS A CONTRIBUTORY FACTOR

  TO THIS DISASTER?     (BRIEFLY EXPLAIN)



      NO.



  HAVE YOU ANY COMMENT TO MAKE ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF FANS IN THE

  STANDING AREA TO THE FRONT OF THE WEST STAND?
                                                                     PAGE     8
                                                                     D1369

            ONLY AS COVERED BEFORE, THE FANS APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN

CHANNELED INTO THE TWO PENS, LEAVING OTHER AREAS WELL UNDER CAPACITY,



037,    DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS ON THE WAY THIS DISASTER WAS CONTROLLED

        FOLLOWING THE RECOGNITION OF THE INCIDENT HAPPENING?



            EVERYBODY DID WHAT THEY COULD. WITH THE AMENITIES AVAILABLE.



038.   IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL

       TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?



            1.   THE TICKET ALLOCATION AND THE FACT THAT THE LIVERPOOL

FANS WERE IN THE WEST STAND WERE WRONG«



           2.    THE EMERGENCY EQUIPMENT AND AMEN IT IEES, ALTHOUGH WERE UP

TO THE CURRENT REQUIRED LEVEL, WERE OBVIOUSLY INADEQUATE,



           3.    THE SPION KOP END WAS FULL OF FOREST FANS BEFORE KICK

OFF, BUT THE LIVERPOOL END WAS WELL UNDER CAPACITY EXCEPT FOR THE TWO

CENTRAL PENS,     I FEEL THE KICK OFF SHOULD HAVE BEEN DELAYED,



           4.    IF A GATE WAS TO BE OPENED TO ALLOW FANS INTO THE GROUND

AT A FASTER RATE, POLICEMEN OR STEWARDS SHOULD HAVE BEEN INSIDE THE

GROUND OF THE TUNNEL ENTRANCE,



           5.    IF THERE ARE TO BE FENCES IN THE STAND SEPARATING THE

TERRACING INTO PENS, THERE SHOULD BE SOMEBODY READILY AVAILABLE TO

OPEN THE GATES IN THE PENS AT THE FIRST SIGNS OF DISTRESS,        THEY WERE

NOT ON THE OCCASION OF THE DISASTER,

     bracket          ( l ess         than 30 years                 old)       and       it w a s      very apparent                   at    this

     A    large      number            of     these       supporters                were       in f a c t        still       drinking

     alcohol         from          beer/lager             cans       and       bottles           of    spirits          and       at    this

     junction          they           were     stopped          and       told       to    leave           the    intoxicants                at    this

     location.                  Some     of    them       did       leave       their          drinks,           but    others          insisted

     on    consuming               the      contents           of    their          can/bottles              before          leaving          t h e m at

     the    scene.               Generally           they       were       all       of    good        behaviour,               they        were

 trouble          had    flared          up     inside          ’T h e    Gate*       Public         House.            This        t i me   I

 fighting          or    trouble,             there        were       about         50-60       people        inside          the     premises.

Police Constable 2718 David John Ward
Bentley Police Office, Arksey Lane, Doncaster

On Saturday, 15th April 1989 I was on duty in company with other
officers involved in duties at the FA Cup Semi Final football match
at Hillsborough Football Stadium, Sheffield between Liverpool F.C.

and Nottingham Forest F.C.

I was part of serial number 34 under the supervision of PS 2248

Sherratt.

At 10 a.m. this date we all attended a briefing in the grounds

North Stand area.

At 11 a.m. serials number 34 and 35 were briefed by our Commander

Inspector Townend.

At 11.15 a.m. we all took up our positions on Claywheels Lane and
in company with Pc 779 Martin Wheatley, we met Liverpool supporters

coaches which were parked along Claywheels Lane.      Together we
boarded a number of coaches, welcoming the supporters and informing

 them that entry to the ground without tickets would be refused and

 that alcohol would not be tolorated in the ground.

 These buses contained a wide cross section of all ages of Liverpool

 supporters and whilst in this location most of them were well behaved

 and they were in good spirits.    We did search a small number of the
 supporters carrier bags, plastic bags and camera cases for prohibited

 articles and/or alcohol.

 I can say that although nothing untoward was found, some of these

 supporters did smell of intoxicants and I know some men were

 approaching the buses asking for any unsold tickets.     I can say that

 two men were successful in purchasing two tickets from one of the

 coaches.

 At 14.25 hours we were further deployed at the junction of Claywheels

 Lane with Penistone Road North.    We were positioned outside a Public
Pc 2718 David John Ward

House called ’The Gate' and our duty was defined as supervising
the arriving fans who were walking down Halifax Road towards us.

We were instructed to form a filter line of officers and to
instruct the supporters that all alcoholic drinks would be left

at this location.   From this location you can see a good distance

up Halifax Road and as far as I could see there was a continuous

flow of Liverpool supporters in groups of 10-12 a breast on both

sides of the carriageway.    The majority of these supporters were

of the lower age bracket (less than 30 years old) and it was very

apparent at this time that a large amount of these supporters had

consumed alcohol.

A large number of these supporters were in fact still drinking
alcohol from beer/lager cans and bottles of spirits and at this

junction they were stopped and told to leave the intoxicants at
this location.   Some of them did leave their drinks, but others

insisted on consuming the contents of their can/bottles before

leaving them at the scene.    Generally they were all of good

behaviour, they were drunk but not incapable or disorderly.

The thing that became apparent to me now at this time (14.45 hrs)

was, how late it was,for hundreds of them to be still walking

toward the ground, and still further, what were the queues like

at the turnstiles, and how long would it be before most of them

would get inside the ground to see a football match.

At about 14.55 hrs in company with other officers I attended at

 ’The Gate' Public House because a report of trouble inside.    I

made my way to the external fire door to the right of the building
as seen from the road.    This door was just being slammed shut as

I approached it and four/five men stood nearby were part covered

in blood on their faces and obviously angry at being ejected from
 the premises.

I ‘banged* on the door of the premises and after a few minutes the
door opened and I was met by other Police Officers who informed me

that the trouble inside had been quelled and we were not required
inside.

I then started to make my way back to the junction of Claywheels

Lane and Penistone Road North, when I again received another report

that trouble had flared up inside ’The Gate1 Public House.     This

time I went inside the premises by the front door and, although

I saw no fighting or trouble, there were about 50-60 people inside
the premises.   It was then decided that the bar be shut and all
persons requested to leave.     This was done and I left the premises,
now empty at about 15.10 hrs.

I made my way towards the traffic lights and I was then informed to
make my way to the front of Hillsborough Football Ground, on

Penistone Road North and to remain there.     This we did in a serial,

arriving outside the gates at 15.30 hours.     The first instruction

given to me was from Inspector Townend to go inside the ground and

stop people coming out of the passageway adjacent to the Spion Kop

and North Stand.   I went into the ground through the gates and the

first thing I saw was an ambulance parked near to the metal fencing

dividing the above two areas and behind this ambulance was two bodies
both men, and they were covered on their top halves with bed blankets
both appeared to be dead, no—one was with them.

I then went to the metal gate into the Spion Kop end of the ground

in company with two other officers but the tide of people wanting

to leave the ground was far too great for us to stop, I did not know
why they wanted to leave or what had occurred.    I honestly believed
at this time that there had been fighting between fans or a

disturbance which had caused the games to be stopped.    I had no idea

of the scale of the ensuing disaster.

I then was told to make my way onto the playing area and this I did
via the passageway at the side of the North Stand, as I walked down

the passageway I saw numerous persons with minor injuries, to shoulders,

arms and chests.   There were people being carried on boards, stretches,

and also being physically lifted and placed on the grassed playing
area in front of me.

I did at this time assist a man who was limping, he was assisted to
the ambulance I had seen earlier near to the metal fencing and I
sat him on the concrete and told him help would be arriving.    I then

went back onto the playing area and assisted another man who complained
of chest pains, he was also being aided by another man.    I did ask,
'whats gone off' but all I was told was that people had ’rushed them'

and that alot of people were hurt at the other end of the field ie

West Stand (Leppings Lane end).    I left this man in the care of his

friend and I went to the centre of the playing area where I was told

by a sergeant to form a cordon across the field and to move the

standing people towards the West Stand and to let through the injured.

This I did with a number of other officers, only allowing the injured
and dead passed us.

I was at this time shouted at by supporters to the effect that we
were murdering bastards and that we didn’t give a toss to what was
going on.

I can say that at this time the Nottingham Forest supporters were
cheering and this seemed to insense the Liverpool supporters who

became more and more agressive, but eventually we did manage to calm

and disperse some supporters.

A large number of bodies were brought passed me on boards and stretches

and after about an hour we were told to resume from the ground and

return to our respective duties.   This I did and I returned to Claywheel

Lane to supervise the Liverpool Supporters coaches.


Even when on Claywheels Lane, the departing supporters were still
abusive to us and giving us aggrevation and taunts, with the number
of dead, saying *I hope you are happy its now 54*     I had no idea

of the scale of the disaster was so large in number.

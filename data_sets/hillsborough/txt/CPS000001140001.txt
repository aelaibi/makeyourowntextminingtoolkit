    David,
                                                                                            /
    As Dru may have mentioned to you, the Hillborough ease is in Court on Friday. We will
    need to have a line to take in respect of why you will not be involved in the decision making
    process. Dru has suggested the following line to take. I wonder if you could contact me to
    let me know whether you are happy with it.

    Either fry home                    or office (0171 273 8100) and leave a message on the
    answer phone.


    "The new Director of Public Prosecutions, David Calvert-Smith QC, will not be involved
    in decisions over whether the Crown Prosecution Service should take over proceedings in the
    Hillsborough mailer, because of his previous personal involvement in the case. The matter
    will, however, be considered at a very senior level in the Crown Prosecution Service."
                                                                                                            y

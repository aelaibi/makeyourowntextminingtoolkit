 The Home Secretary is currently considering proposals to have so m e form of
 judicial examination of representations received over the p a st six m o n th s into the
 disaster at the Hillsborough Football Stadium in 1 989. The term s of reference of
 such an examination could be on th e s e lines:

          "To carry o u t an independent exam ination of w hether there is n ew
          evidence relating to th e disaster at Hillsborough Stadium on 1 5 April 1 9 8 9
          which provides sufficient grounds for:

                  (i)        The Attorney General to apply to the High Court under
                             section 13 of the C oroners' Act 19 88 for another inquest;

                 (ii)    The Director of Public Prosecutions to consider bringing
                         criminal charges against any person;

                 (iii)   The relevant Chief Police Officer to take disciplinary action
                         against any police officer.

          or which m e a n s th a t it would be in th e public interest for th e
          Home S ecretary to establish a public inquiry."

I should em phasise th a t th e Home Secretary is still considering w h e th e r to go
dow n this track. N evertheless in looking at th e s e issues, it has been su g g e ste d

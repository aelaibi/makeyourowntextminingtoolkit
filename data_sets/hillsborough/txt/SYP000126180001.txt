              I GOT THERE AT ABOUT 2.20 AND THERE WERE TOO MANY PEOPLE THEN.
              WE MADE OUR WAY TO THE FAR END AND I SAW A STEWARD, AND ASKED HIM
              WHICH WAS THE BEST WAY TO GET OUT AT THE END OF THE GAME AND HE

WOULD HAVE TO LEAVE VIA THE ENTRANCE AND NOT BY THE GATE HE WAS STANDING AT.
THE MIDDLE PEN AT THE WEST STAND WAS ALSO VERY BUSY AND I AM APPAULED THAT
NOBODY STOPPED THEM FROM GOING IN BUT THERE APPEARED TO BE NO POLICE
SUPERVISION OR STEWARD SUPERVISION. WHEN THE INCIDENT OCCURRED THE POLICE
CAME TO OUR END AS IF TO STOP PEOPLE AND THEY DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON
AND THEY SEEMED TOTALLY LOST. THERE WAS NO PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM USED.

AT ABOUT 2.45 AND NOTICED THAT THE STANDING AREA BEHIND THE GOALPOSTS WERE
VERY FULL.JUST BEFORE THE GAME I NOTICED THAT A NUMBER OF FANS WERE CLIMBING
OVER THE FENCING AT THE FRONT OF THE PEN.I SAW ONE SCUFFLE WITH POLICE
OFFICER NEAR THE PITCH,NORTH STAND SIDE.A LIVERPOOL FAN WAS PUNCHING AN
OFFICER.THE OOFICER HANDLED THE SITUATION WELL AND WAS TRYING TO TALK TO THE
FAN TRYING TO CALM HIM DOWN. I MUST STATE THAT I WAS WELL AWARE THAT WHENCE IN
THE GROUND THERE WAS NO STEWARD PRESENCE TO SHOW SUPPORTERS TO THEIR
RESPECTIVE SEATS,IT WAS UP TO THE INDIVIDUAL TO FIND THEIR OWN WAY WHICH WAS
O V FOR THOSE WHO ARRIVED EARLY, IT MUST HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE FOR THOSE WHO
ARRIVED LATE.

AT ABOUT 1450HRS WE COULD SEE THAT PEOPLE WERE BEING PULLED UP INTO THE
SEATING SECTION IN THE WEST STAND TO GET THEM OUT OF THE CRUSH. AT 1506HRS
THE GAME WAS STOPPED. WE THOUGHT IT WAS BECAUSE OF A DISTURBANCE. THERE WERE
NO PUBLIC ADDRESS ANNOUNCEMENTS. BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED THE POLICE FORMED A
CORDEN AROUND THE DISASTER AREA AND BECAUSE WE STILL HEARD NO ANNOUNCEMENTS
IT MADE EVERYONE REALLY AGGITATED BECAUSE NOONE WAS AWARE OF THE DISASTER. WE
THOUGHT IT WAS A DISORDER BECAUSE ATR FIRST PEOPLE WERE BEING PUSHED BACK
INTO THE TERRACES.

                  HAVE NEVER WITNESSED SUCH A SHAMBLES IN ALL MY LIFE. I COMMENTED
                  BEFORE THE MATCH THAT THE WEST STAND WAS TOO FULL THERE APPEARED
                  TO BE A TOTAL LACK OF POLICE AND STEWARDS. I SAW PEOPLE BEING
                  CRUSHED AND TRYING TO GET OUT THE WEST STAND.

                                     HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER

        With permission, Mr Speaker, I should like to make a
        statement about the final report of Lord Justice Taylor's
        Inquiry into the tragedy at the Hillsborough stadium in
        Sheffield on 15 April 1989, which is published today,




        I am most grateful to Lawi Justice Taylor for the Report,
        which is a careful and thorough analysis of why we have
        had so many major tragedies at football grounds over the
        years and why we have had disorder and hooliganism.                                   As
        the House familiarises itself with the                                Report it will
        become clear it is addressed as much to the football
        industry as it is to the Government,                              Lord Justice Taylor
        explains how in his interim report he concentrated on
        overcrowding                 because       that     was        the     cause of     the
        Hillsborough disaster, but now he goes on to talk of a
        game, the image of which has been much tarnished, and of
        a     blight              over    the   game      due     to    old   grounds,     poor
        facilities,                hooliganism,        excessive drinking          and     poor
        leadership.

E.R.                                                 2.

       Lord Justice Taylor does not spare those who run the
       Industry,. He says indeed that the provision they make for
       their customers is often not merely basic but squalid-,
       and he says that squalid conditions can have an impact on
       safety but they also lead to lower standards of behaviour.


       Lord Justice Taylor.says that the Football Association and
       football League have not seen it as any part of their duty
       to offer guidance                to clubs on safety matters                    and he
       questions           whether      the        directors       of     many    clubs    are
       genuinely           interested         in     the        welfare    of     their    own
       supporters           or their good behaviour*                      Players    too are
       criticised, with Lord Justice Taylor pointing out that
       incitement from the pitch or bad behaviour by players,
       which is not confined to soccer, has a major influence on
       the crowd.           While he recognises that at some clubs changes
       have been made towards realising a new concept of how
       football         should be, he says that the game only has a
       future if the directors and the players can change their
       own priorities and give a leadership which                                 is plainly
       lacking at present.


       He agrees with the Government that there must be a move
       towards         all-seater        stadia           and    points     out     that   the
       machinery for that now exists in section 11 of the
       25    J AN   ’ 90    20:44      QUEEN   ANNS       GATE    R.777               PAGE. 0 5

E.R.
       Football Spectators Act.                  The change will improve safety
       and     will        improve behaviour, and we Intend                       to bring it
       about.        Lord Justice Taylor makes clear that the bulk                            of
       the     finances        for ground improvements will                       have to     be
       raised by           the clubs themselves.             He mentions ways in which
       clubs' finances might be improved to help cover the cost
       and     canvasses            a number of possibilities,                    including       a
       change        in      the      system     of        capital        allowances      which
       discourages expenditure on new stands but encourages what
       he describes as grotesque transfer fees.                              The Government
       will consider these suggestions.


       There are a whole series of detailed recommendations set
       out in Chapters 3, 4 and 5 on matters relating to
       spectator safety such as gates and gangways.                                 Indeed, 43
       of the 76 recommendations appeared in the Interim Report.
       The Government accepts these proposals* some of which can
       be implemented immediately.                    Some will need further work.
       For convenience I am placing in the Library of the House
       a -schedule setting out the Government's response to the
       proposals set out in Chapters 3, 4 and 5,


       Hon Members will recall that section 13 of the Football
       Supporters            Act     provides     for            the   Football      Licensing
       Authority to supervise the safety responsibilities of local
       25   J AN   ’ 90   20:45    QUEEN   ANNS   GATE   R.777                PAGE. 0 6




E.R.
       authorities in respect of designated football grounds.                             We
       intend to           implement that provision. Lord Justice Taylor
       would like us to go further and extend the remit of the
       Football            Licensing       Authority      to cover      all     grounds
       designated under the 1975 Safety of Sports Grounds Act/
       and Indeed all premises requiring safety certificates or
       licences under Parts III and IV of the Fire Safety and
       Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987,                       This would require
       primary       legislation       and we will        have to consider the
       matter further.            There is, of course, also the possibility
       of a voluntary interim arrangement to cover other than
       football grounds, pending any legislation.


       Part III of the Report contains a number of proposals
       relating            to     crowd     control      and hooliganism.                 It
       acknowledges          the crucial      role of the police              in crowd
                                                                   i,
       control.           Lord Justice Taylor rightly reminds us that
       without work by the police many sporting events would be
       chaotic and could not be permitted to take place.                        He pays
       tribute to the police for their service which he says is
       often thankless.           I want to add my personal tribute to his
       and to thank the police for their invaluable efforts in
       maintaining order at sports events.

                                             5.


The Report recognises the advances made in the last couple
of years in the effectiveness of the policing of football,
particularly inside grounds, and to the major impact, of
closed circuit television on the hooligan                           problem,


Lord Justice Taylor also recognises the great potential
value of the police National Football Intelligence Unit in
dealing       with     football-related crime and with hooligans
travelling to matches abroad.


As I hays said, Lord Justice Taylor takes the view that
better facilities and better treatment of fans will bring
better behaviour.                Beyond that, the Report recommends the
creation        of    three       new specific           offences     to     apply    at
                                    t
designated sports grounds:                   throwing a missile;              chanting
obscene or racialist abuse;                         and going onto the pitch
without        reasonable          excuse:           and     it   also       asks    for
consideration to be given to extending the courts' powers
to impose attendance centre orders and for the use of
electronic tagging in the 'case of offenders convicted of
football-related offences.                        I shall     look carefully and
sympathetically             at    the    case      for making        these     changes
recommendations.
Lord Justice Taylor then comes to the question of whether
there should be a national membership schcme and he says
that he has grave doubts about the feasibility of the sort
of    scheme envisaged 1n the Invitation to Tender issued by
the consultants employed by the football authorities, and
serious misgivings about the likely impact on safety.            In
the    light   of   that,   he   says   he   cannot   support   the
implementation of Part 1 of the Act,


The Government have decided in the light of Lord Justice
Taylor's advice not to proceed with the establishment of
a Football Membership Authority.         Part   1 of the Act will
remain on the Statute Book lest we have to return to the
matter.    But the right course now is for. us to follow the
strategy proposed In the Report and give the industry and
the clubs a final opportunity to put themselves in order.
The public will not forgive them if they do not now act.

                  On    Saturday       15 A p r i l      1989    I was          on    duty       at   Hillsborough             Football

                  Ground,       Sheffield          in    connection             with       the    FA Cup          Semi-Final         between

                  Nottingham          Forest       and    Liverpool.

                  I attended          at    the    ground       with      other        officers          at       9.45am      that    date       and

                  at    10.15am       we    were    briefed          in    the       North       Stand       by    Senior      Police

                  Officers.

                  I was    detailed          to    Serial       lb    under          the    command          of    PS   Burns       and

                  Inspector          White.

                  At    11.15am,       together          with    Serial          14 w e      went       to    the       terrace

                  immediately          in    front       of   the W e s t        Stand       where       both       Serials         were

                  briefed       by    Inspector          White.           The    duty       of    our    Serial         was    to    search

                  supporters          entering          the   ground        at       the    Leppings          lane      end    of    the     grund

                  by    turnstiles          1-16.        These       supporters             were      to b e       supporters         with

                  tickets       for    the W e s t       Stand.

Tne     seriai          took        up    position              at     around           il.30am.                 The       gates        were           to

open     at     12      noon.

On     the    outside           of       the       turnstiles               were        another             serial           who       were

searchinq            supporters                   before        they        entered              the       ground.

At     i 2 noon         when        the       turnstiles               opened           a    small          number           of       spectators

began        to m a k e        their          way       into      the       ground.

By     2.30pm        the       volume             of    spectators               increased                 but    even           at    this        time

there        was     still          ample          time      to       search           them          as    they        came       through.

The     fans       up     until          this          point      were        mostly             good       natured              and       in a        jovial

mood,        although           some          had       mentioned             to m e         that          Liverpool              should           have

had     the     other          end       of       the    ground,            because              they       had        a    bigger          following

than     Notts.           Forest.

About        2.40pm        a    fan       appeared              on     top       of     the          turnstiles.                  He       w a s n ’t

wearing         any       football                colours.             I shouted                 to       him    to        get    back        down          to

the     other        side       but       he       said      he       c o u l d n ’t b e c a u s e              crowds           were       beginning

to     gather        outside.                 I    looked         through              the       turnstiles                 and       saw     that          the

crowd        was     beginning                to       build      up     but       even          at       this     stage          there           did       not

appear        to     be    anything                out     of     the       ordinary.                     I shouted              to    t he       youth          or

the     roof       of     the       turnstiles               again          to     come          down       into           the    ground           (It was

my     intention           that          if       he    d i d n ’t h a v e         a    ticket             to    arrest           him       and        take

him     to    the       Poiice           Room).            If     he     did       have          a    ticket           I would             have        taken

t he    ticket          off     him       given          him      a    stern           warning             and    allowed              him        into       the

ground.            One     or       two m o r e          youths          then          appeared             on     the       roof          and     I

looked        through           the       turnstiles                  and     saw       that          there       was        by       now     a    large

number        of     supporters                   gathering            and       some        were          complaining                 of     the

crush.          An      Inspector                 then     arrived            at       the       scene          and        went       on     to    t he

roof     of     the       turnstiles.                     I thought              at     that          time        to       remove          the     youths

on     the    roof.            He    then went               to       the     edge          of       the    roof           and    began           to    help

supporters              out     of       the       queue        on      the      other           side       and        over       the        wall.           A

number        of     fans       came          into        the     ground           by       this          methc                                        what

fans    I couid              and     took       the       tickets         off        them    because              some    were

attempting              to p a s s       their          tickets          back        through           the    turnstiles,

obviously           for       supporters                wno      had     not     got       tickets           on    the    outside.

Around        2 . 45pm,         tiie c r o w d          outside          w a s ,b e g i n n i n g       to g r o w       and     supporters

were    complaining.                     A    number          of    them were              directing              abuse     at    Police

officers           again       stating              that      they       should        have       had        the       other     end       of       the

ground,           calling          us    "Dickheads"                and       stating           that     the       organisation

could        have       been       better.              It w a s        obvious        by       now     that       large       numbers              had

gathered           outside           the       turnstiles.                The        fans       who     were       now    coming           in

were    being          more        aggressive               towards            the    Police.            The       men    on     the

turnstiles              began        having          trouble            with     some       of     the       supporters.                  Some

spectators              hd    gone       to       the     wrong         turnstiles              with     the w r o n g         tickets.               I

spoke        to    one       turnstile            man      who      was        complaining              that       a    fan with           a

ticket        for       the     Spion          Kop      was      attempting            to       gain        entry.         I spoke             to

the    spectator              and       told        him     he     would        have       to    go     to    the       other        end       of

the     ground          and     he      w a s n ’t a d m i t t e d .            I toid           the    turnstiles             man        that

should        spectators                have        standing             tickets       to       allow        them       through           in v i e w

of     the    crowd          that        had      gathered.               (I    had    also        heard           earlier       a    rumour

that     a    ticket           toat       was       selling         tickets           at    the        Leppings           Lane       end       of

t he    ground.              They        were       tickets             for    the    other        end       of     the    ground          and

that     he       had    gone        when         approached              by     the       Police).

By     this       time       things          were       getting           more        hectic          and fans          w e r e still

coming        over        the       wall       at     the       turnstiles             and we          were        helping       them          down

in     case       of    injury.              At     one       stage       the        top    of    a    stone        pillar had             come

loose        and       I asked           the      supporters              to    pass        it d o w n b e c a u s e        if       it    fell

 into    the        crowd          someone          would          have       been     killed          or     seriously           injured.

At     this       stage        we    were         clearing              people       away        from        the    turnstile             area       to

get     them        into       the       ground.              People          coming        into       the        ground    were          now

complaining               of       the       crowd      outside.               Some        were       breathless.                People

were       complaining             that       a    lot       of    them     on       the    outside             d i d n ’t h a v e

tickets.           I then          saw    an       officer          on     horseback             trying          to m a k e     his        way

to    the    front       of    the       turnstiles                but     appeared             to    be     engulfed          oy

supporters          who       were       still          blaming           the    South       Yorkshire                Police        tor

giving       them    the       wrong          end       of    the       ground.

A    Police       Constable          then          came       from        somewhere          behind             us    and     told     one          of

the    stewards          that       he    had           c o m e to      o p e n the       gate        adjacent          to     t he

turnstiles.              The       steward              said that          h e w o u l d n ’t o p e n            the    gates.             I

spoke       with    the       officer             and       said     that       we    couldn't             open       the     gates        and

that       I believed          there          were          a number        of       supporters              outside          who     did       not

have       tickets.           He    told          me    that       he     had       come    to       open       the    gates        because

of    the    volume       of       supporters                outside        and       that       the       other       gate     had        been

opened       to    ease       the    situation                outside.               This       gate       was       then     opened           and

about       two    hundred          supporters                came        through          and       then with           PC    Ford        and

the    stewards          we    closed             the       gate.         This       had    eased          the       pressure         outside

considerably             although             there          was     still several                   fans     outside.              Most        of

the    fans       that    came       in b y             this gate,              I believe,            made       their        way     to       the

North       Section       of       the    terrace.

Things       then    got       back       to       normality              and       I can       recall          looking        at     my

watch       at    3.02    and       saying             to    PC    Ford     "They          should          have       kicked        off        by

now’        Only    a minute             or       so    after        this       a    fan    came          running        from       the

tunnel       towards          us    and       said          that     we    should          get       in     there      because         it w a s

bedlam.

With       other    officers             1 ran           into      the     tunnel          which          was     clear       apart        from

a    few    spectators             making          their          way     out.        On    arrival             at     the    end     of       th e

tunnel       I could          see    some          spectators              trying          to    climb          the     perimeter

fence       but    with       the    amount             of    spectators              in    that          section        which        was       the

Centre       South       Section          it w a s           impossible              to    get       near       the     front.         With

other       officers          I began             to m o v e       spectators              at    the        b a c k ^request ijjg t h e m

to    go    down       tne       tunnel.              Some       of       them       did     so w i t h o u t          question.                 Others

wouldn't          move,          telling             officers             to    "Fuck        orf.        I've          got       a    ticket” .

Eventually             enough          fans          were       moved          and     1, m o v e d     forward             to       t he

perimeter             fence       and       began          to    neip          people        out       who    had       been          injured.

These       people          were       taken          to    the       area       of       the     tunnel          and       they were              s at

against         walls           until       medical             attention              arrived.              At       this       stage        1 do

not    believe             that       anyone          had       realised             the     enormity             of    the          disaster.                I

then       went       back       into       the       ground.              I then          with        another          officer              and

supporters             carried             out       a man       who       was       unconscious              and       took          him     to    the

back.           I gave          him    heart          massage             but     he r e m a i n e d         unconscious.                    I     was

then       joined          by    a man       who       stated             he     was a male             nurse.              He e x a m i n e d       t he

man    and       stated          he    had       a    pulse          and       that he           should       be       l e f t in       the        prone

position.              This       I did.              By    this          time        I saw       that       a n u m b e r of           St

John's          Ambulance             Ambulances                had       arrived           at    the    rear          of     the       tunnel.                  I

asked       some       supporters                to    'keep          an       e y e ’ on        this    man          and     I returned                to

the    terrace.                 The    situation                of    the       terrace           by    this          time       was        chaotic

and more          people          were       asked          to       go    out       of     the    tunnel             but     still          some

took       no    notice.              I then          began          to    help        people          through           the         gate     in     t he

perimeter             fence.           I saw          that       there          were        several          people           crushed

against          the       wall       just       below          the       perimeter              fence.           They        were          lying        in

a pile          about       four       feet          high,       there          appeared           to    be       a    large          number.                It

was    obvious             that       these          people          were       dead        and    that        a major               disaster            had

occurred.              I assisted                in    getting             people           through          the       gate          and     on    to        th

perimeter             track.           A    number          of       people          were        taken       through             this        way.            I

eventually             found          myself          on    the       perimeter              track       and          supporters              and

Police          alike       were       taking          these          people           on m a k e s h i f t           stretchers              to     t he

other       end       of    the       ground.              I went          on     to      the     field        to      assist           where        I

could.           On    the       fields          I saw          some       supporters              making             their          way     towards

the    Spion          Kop.        They       obviously                wanted           to    vent        their         angei           at    the

large            number          ot       officers              had      now       arrived             at    the       rear       of    the      West

Stand            by    this          time          and     I assisted               with          getting          the       injured             to

ambulances                  nearby.                 Whilst          at    the       rear          of    the       stand       I saw          a    supporter

come         round          with          a man          I believe             to       be    the       Chairman             of    Liverpool                   F.C.

I heard               the       supporter                to     say      to    this          man,       that's          the       gate       that          was

opened,               we    d i d n ’t b r e a k              it    down,          it's       not       damaged.              I said             that          no

one         had       said       that          the       gate       had       been       forced             open.        Some          fans       were

abusing               Police             Officers,              some      called             us    murderers             and       some          were          still

complaining                     about          Liverpool              having            the       wrong       end       of    the       ground.

However,               this          abuse          was       taken       by       the       officers             and    the       majority                of

Liverpool                  supporters                were          sympathetic                towards             us    and       kept       the       angry

element               under          control.                 Several          fans          came       and       shook       hands          with me                and

thanked               me,       some          said       that       they       were          sorry          for    the       behaviour                of       a

small            number          of       their          fans.

By     4.30pm              things             began        to      ease,       most          of    the       crowds          had       left,          the

injured               had       gone          to    hospital.                 The       relatives             and       friends           of      people

who         were       missing                were       directed             towards             the       Police       room          under          the

North            Stand.              I    then        returned            into          the       terrace          and       saw       that       there             was

a    lot         of    debris,                clothes,             shoes       etc       scattered                about       on       the       terrace.

I saw            that       a    crash             barrier          had       broken          and       Liverpool             scarves             were

hanging               from       it.          1 then          joined          other          members          of m y         serial.              We       made       o

way         to    the       North             Stand        and      there          we    were          debriefed.

I also            wish          to       add       that       whilst          on    duty          at    the       turnstiles,                just          after

the         crowd          had       been          let     through            the       gate,          the    steward             on    the       gate/""'j

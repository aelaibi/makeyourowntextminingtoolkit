                                         17 April, 1989.




Dear Sirs,


The feelings I have held after watching the deaths at
Hillsborough are of deep sadness for those who have lost
friends and relatives.


I w&s near to the incident and experienced the problems of
trying to get into the ground.


After listening to most of the coverage on Radio City,
Radio Merseyside and T.V. programmes on Sunday,    I feel an
urgent need to inform someone of exactly what the basic
cause of the problem was.


There are only a few turnstiles in one corner to
accommodate all those who are in the North Stand,    the V’est
Stand and the Lepping End terrace, and in that undesirable
situation, there is bound to be a build-up of people.


When there is a build-up of people in any situation, the
only course of action is to form queues to instill order
and establish a feeling of security for people that
everything is under control *    The forming of queues for
the turnstile when there is a large number of people, has
been done at all the big games I have attended over the
past 35 years at Anfield and most other grounds.

 The notable exceptions have been last year and regretfully
 this year at Hillsborough.


 The police were either oblivious to the situation or they
 were not interested.


As the crowd built up, I could se^ four police sat in a
Land Rover just watching,   it was absolutely amazing that
not one policeman was interested in crowd control until
there were people being crushed.


At that point on, I think everything has been said, but to
reiterate my reading of events,   if the crowd had been
policed into queues before the turnstiles,   there would not
have been a tragedy.

                                          '       V ,•'*  »
I am afraid the police failed to perform a basic duty, the
ability to control a section of the crowd at the
turnstile, a function for which they were paid, not sit
around in vehicles.


Yours faithfully,




                                    \

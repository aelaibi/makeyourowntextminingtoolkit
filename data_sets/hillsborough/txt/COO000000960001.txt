draft letter to ps/home secretary                     L. U           Ia i'xi.'k/*



                        HILLSBOROUGH GROUND DISASTER



The Prime Minister held a meeting at No 10 Downing Street at 9.30

am yesterday to discuss the management of the Football Spectators

Bill    in the light of the Hillsborough Ground disaster.                            Present

were     the    Home    Secretary,       the        Secretary       of    State    for   the

Environment,      the Lord President,               the Lord Privy Seal,          the Chief

Whip and the Minister for Sport.                   Mr A J Langdon (Cabinet Office)

was also present.



I should be grateful if recipients of this letter would restrict

circulation to those officials with a strict operational need to

                                 /
know.



The Secretary of State           for the Environment said that,                   since the

Prime    Minister's     meeting    on    17        April,     it   had been    established

that    a power      could be added to the Football                  Spectators Bill to

allow the requirement of all-seated accommodation as part of the

licensing arrangements under the Bill.                        To enable this addition

to be made in the House of Commons, however, a formal Instruction

would need to be moved at some point after Second Reading.                               The
                                                      cxW o
Home Secretary commented that he could issue guidance encouraging
                                               *,       S'
all-seated accommodation to the local authorities responsible for

the licensing of football grounds.                     Although this would not have

the     force   of   law,   he   would    expect        it    to   have   a   real   effect,

                                               2

although      it          would        take          time        (and       money)           before           all-seated

accommodation became the norm.                               But even a statutory requirement

would take some time to be implemented.



The Home Secretary explained that, while Lord Justice Taylor was

responsible for the conduct of his inquiry and could not be given

instructions              by     the          Government,             it     was        understood                 that   he

intended      to     produce              an       interim       report          on    physical              measures      in

June or July.              The inquiry's full report would not be available

before the end of the year.



The Chief Whip said that there were many Government backbenchers

who had never been more than reluctant supporters of the Football

Spectators         Bill,            and        who    were        now        seizing             on         Lord    Justice

Taylor's      inquiry as an excuse to dissociate themselves from it.

The   Home         Secretary                   and     the        Secretary                 of    State            for    the

Environment would                   confirm          froin the approaches that backbenchers

had made to them that the proposition of waiting for Lord Justice

Taylor's report now commanded considerable support in the Party,

including some notable n^mes, and he could not recommend an early

there would be co-operation from the Opposition,                                                      iff7 — irr-a-iHr- the

the most   satisfactory- explanation would be that a comprehensive

Bill t a k i n g f u l l a c c o u n t of Lord Justice TayTor's^inquiry was now

in view for thenext.session.



The   following main       points       were      then made          in this       part    of the

discussion.



      -     The rationale of the present target for Royal Assent in

            July was that this would enable the membership scheme

            to    start    operation         in the Spring of              1990     (ie towards

            the    end    of     the    1989-90         football      season) .        If    Royal

            Assent    were       postponed         to   the    end    of    the    session        in,

            say,     October,          then— the— start— of             the       scheme     would

            the 1 9 9 1 - 9 2 footbaii— season.



      -     The    powers      in, Part        2        of    the Bill       to     enable        the

            imposition            bf     restriction            orders        on     convi ct e d

            hooligans,         so      as    to     require        their      attendance           at

            reporting       centres         in this      country       when major          matches

            were    being        played      abroad,         would    take     some       time     to

            achieve       their      full    effect,         since    they     could       only    be

            applied to people who were convicted after the Act was

            brought       into      force.        The    proposed      restriction          orders

            had general          cross-Party support.                On the         other hand,

            the National          Membership            Scheme, to         which     the    Labour

                                               4

Party was opposed,              would enable much earlier action to

be     taken       to     prevent         hooligans        from      this        country

attending          international           matches        held      abroad.               The

reason for this was that the tickets for such matches

were allocated by the Football Association, which would

be able to inform itself about the people excluded from

the membership scheme, and ensure that tickets were not

issued    to       them     in this       country, though            some       football
         tv                                 .                 ,                       ,    ,

supporl^s       might        evade        this     screening         by        obtaining

tickets       abroad.          The       commencement         of    the    membership

scheme    in Spring 1990 would enable these arrangements

to be in being for the World Cup matches due to be held

in    Italy     in      June      1990,    in     which    there         was    still          a

prospect that the English team might participate.



There was          little doubt that opponents of the National

Membership Scheme would submit evidence on their views

to    Lord     Justice         Taylor's         inquiry,      claiming         that       the

Hillsborough            disaster         would    have     been      worse       if        the

scheme       had     been      in operation.            There       were       many       good

arguments against that, but the inquiry would keep the

matter       in the public eye and                  it could not be assumed

that     Lord      Justice        Taylor        would     not      comment       on        the

scheme.



The    Bill     would,       at    the very        least,         need    to be taken

through        its      Second     Reading        in    the       House    of    Commons

            before the Summer Recess                     if    it were to be enacted in

            the present session,               and the aim should probably be to

            complete as much of the Committee Stage as was feasible

            before the Summer Recess.                     One possibility might be to

            take    Part       2 of     the    Bill      in    Committee before          Part     1,

            since Part 2 was broadly acceptable to the Opposition.



            Since    the       Bolton disaster            in    1946,      nearly    3 00 people____

            record       was    the     worst       in    the    developed      world.          The

            character of            football     had sharply deteriorated in the

            last two decades.              The judgement in the Heysel case was

            expected to be delivered in the                          following week and it

            would    no        doubt    focus       attention         on    hooliganism         once

            again.       This might cause the Football Spectators Bill

            to be seen much more favourably.


                                    /
The Prime Minister,            summing up this part of the discussion,                          said

that making progress with the Football Spectators Bill before the

Summer   Recess      offered        the    only       way      of    having    a    vehicle       to

implement   any     of    Lord      Justice     Taylor's            recommendations        in    the

present session.         Furthermore, there was an overwhelming case for

getting the Football Membership Scheme into operation as soon as

possible,    in     view       of    the      record      of    fatalities          at   football

matches, the 6,000 arrests that took place annually in connection

with    football matches,           and the diversion of police                    effort that

was required to maintain order at them.                           While a short pause for

reflection was indicated,                any delay of the order of 12 months in

the    sch e m e1s    operation      would       be       a    very    serious     matter      that

should certainly not be laid at the Government's door.



The meeting then adjourned and a meeting of the Cabinet followed.

When the meeting reconvened after the Cabinet meeting                                    the Lord

Privy    Seal     and the Chief Whip were not present but the meeting

was joined by Sir Clive Whitmore and Mr A H Turney                                (Home Office)

and    by   Mr    D A    MacDonald       and     Mr   N       Kingha}^ (Department        of     the

Environment).



The    main      points     made    in    this        part      of    the   meeting      were     as

follows.



                 If the Football         Spectators Bill achieved Royal Assent

                 at   the     end    of     the       present         session,     assuming        a

                 spillover,       then   the     membership           scheme   might     still    be

                 implemented, technology permitting, at the beginning of
                                            /
                 the 1990-91 football season,                   in August 1990.          Delaying

                 Royal    Assent     ^rom      July    to      the     spillover    would       not,

                 therefore, postpone the implementation of the scheme by

                 12   months,/     though       postponement           of   the   Bill    to     the
                              /

                 following session would certainly have that effect.

If,     as    appeared        to       be    the     case,    there    was        no

possibility       of getting           the    Bill   enacted before         July,

then none of the nesg^-aeeangeinerits could be brought to

bear before the World Cup matches in June 1990.                               ^

(\-tA

Although the House Authorities had given their opinion

that    requiring        all-seated          accommodation      was    a    topic

that was cognate to the Bill, and which could therefore

be added to the Bill following an Instruction,                         it could

not be       assumed that        the Bill's          scope was necessarily

wide    enough     to     enable       other    recommendations        of    Lord

Justice Taylor's          interim report to be taken on board.

That     depended        on   what      the    recommendations         actually

were.



The Secretary of State's Order confirming a membership

scheme under the Act was subject to negative resolution

procedure.        Whatever wider attraction there might be in

affirmative resolution procedure, that course was ruled

out of court by the                fact that the use of affirmative

resolution procedure would make the Bill hybrid.



If the       Bill's Second Reading                 in the House   of Commons

was     to   be   held    over     until      nearer    the   Summer       Recess,

then further thought was needed about the handling of

the remaining stages in the Lords.

                           The     Prime    Minister,           summing       up the          discussion,           said       that    it

                           would be indefensible                for the Government to leave itself without
                                                                                                                           /
                           a     vehicle    to     implement           any    recommendations                of     Lord        Justice

                           Taylor's     inquiry         in the present             session,       and a year's delay in

                           the implementation of the Football Membership Scheme would also

                           be quite unacceptable.                    For both these reasons there was a clear

                           need to proceed with the Bill in the present session, though the

                           target of Royal Assent in July was no longer attainable and the

                           Bill would need to be enacted later in the session.                                             Those who

                           sought     to    delay        the        Bill's    enactment          had       no     alternative          to

                           suggest, and to abstain from taking action on football safety and

                           hooliganism would be                 the gravest possible matter,                        now that          the

                           need for this action                 had been so conclusively demonstrated.                                 Far

                           should also be brought out that the Bill represented the only-wayii

                            of     controlling          the    behaviour           of    English       football            supporters

                            abroad and that its enactment had been linked with the return of

                            English        clubs        to     European        football.               The      kernel          of     the

                            Government's position was that it was doing everything possible

                            to     implement       Mr    Justice        Popplewell's             recommendations                and     to

                            prepare the way for implementing those that might now be made by

                            Lord Justice Taylor.                    The Government's critics were,                         in effect,

                                                                               9

                                                                       CONFIDENTIAL

saying   that   they     would   respect    whatever   recommendations     Lord

Justice Taylor might make though they rejected those of the last

judge    to   consider    football    questions.       That   was   an   absurd

position.



I am sending copies of this letter to the Private Secretaries to

other Ministers    present       at the meeting,   to Sir Clive Whitmore,

and to Anthony Langdon and Sir Robin Butler.

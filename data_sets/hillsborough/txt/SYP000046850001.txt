   Dear Mr Nicholson

   Enclosed please find the copy of a letter dated 23 May 1990 from Messrs Davies
   Arnold and Cooper Solicitors, acting for Sheffield Wednesday Football Club,
   concerning removal of the remaining barriers and safety fence to the Leppings

   I have already replied acknowledging receipt of the letter indicating that
   before I respond I would wish to consult you concerning any objections you may
   wish to raise.  In this connection will you please let me have your views in
   writing before mid July 1990.

   From my point of view,               I can see no valid reason for objecting to the

Dear Sir

Hillsborough Disaster
Further to my letter of the 17th May, I have been informed by
the Club that it is their intention to remove the remaining
barriers and safety fence to the Leppings Lane terrace
immediately before the start of the forthcoming season.

The Club have already agreed to the removal of a further
barrier from the ground for testing in accordance with the
agreement reached between the experts in the litigation at
their meeting on the 5th April. It is anticipated by the end
of July/beginning of August, that these experts will have
completed their enquiries for the purposes of preparing a
report, and therefore from that point of view, there is no
need for the Lenpings Lane terrace to remain in its present
state as the parties to the litigation will not be prejudiced
by such works being undertaken. I have informed the parties'
Solicitors of the Club's intentions in this regard, and have
said quite clearly that the whole matter should be reviewed
once again at the end of July when we have a much clearer
picture of any potential problems that may be caused by these
 intended works.
 However, I am of course extremely conscious of_ any continuing
 -interest vour investigation team may have in the terrace
 remaining in its. present state, together with that of H.M.
 Coroner and the Crown Prosecution Service. I would ask you to
 confirm whether there is any objection to these works being
 carried out.     As stated above, the position needs to be
 reviewed at the end of July, but at this stage I would be
 grateful if you would indicate whether there is any continuing
           in thi© texxa.ce-
        2/                                    23rd May 1990

        I look forward to hearing from you.

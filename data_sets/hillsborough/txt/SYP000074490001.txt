           On Saturday 15 April            1989 (150489),         I was on duty at the Central Fire

Officers      in total.                     ^

At approximately 3.00pm              (1500),    together with other members of my

shift,   I had occasion to pass the recreation area,                     on the first floor

of my Station,      in which there is a television.

As I walked past the television it showed a Newsflash from

Hillsborough Football Ground, Sheffield,                      where the F A Cup Semi Final

was taking place between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest. The

Newsflash indicated that there was no play in progress and that some

supporters were climbing over the perimeter barriers and gaining

access to the playing area. The Newsflash terminated and together with

my colleagues      I continued to the gym for the purpose of playing five-

aside football.

At approximately 3.15pm (1315) an emergency call out call was                        received

at my Fire Station and it was requested that a total of six

pumping appliances and one emergency tender,                       visit Hillsborough

Football Ground.

The nature of the call was              recordedyas ."Major Incident at

Hillsborough,      cutting equipment            rp iy jft

At this particular time,              I believe the message was recorded,           as being

received at 15.16hrs          (1516)       (3.16pm,     1516).

Together with other Officers and my own crew,                       I responded to this

incident      immediately.

Hillsborough Football Ground is approximately two and a half miles

from the Central Fire/Station and I believe we arrived at the

Penistone Rd entran ^         J lf   tKe   ground within five minutes of leaving the

Stat io n .           v/ ^

On arrival at this point, my Senior Officer, Station Officer FLETCHER,

alighted from the appliance and liaised with the Police Officer on

duty at this point and asked if we could gain access to the rear of
                                                                         PAGE     3
                                                                         S1875

the S Stand.

The Police Officer assisted in opening the main gates, and we entered

at this point     (marked   *B* on map)   (Exhibit No      )(Ref No

There were quite       a lotof members of the public both inside and

outside the main     entrance and they did not appear to be surprised by

our attendance, as would normally happen if we attended a house fire

etc., when they come to see what has happened.

They appeared to know why we had visited. There was no reaction from

them at all.

We proceeded to travel along the rear of the S Stand and eventually

came to a halt at the end of the S Stand and to the back of the Police

control    box.

When we arrived at this point, Station Officer FLETCHER            liaised with

some stewards                   istructed by him to obtain a resuscitator     and

a spare oxyge                   id follow him into the ground.

I collected these items from the locker on my appliance and together

with Fireman                 Followed Station Officer FLETCHER onto the

pitch.We gained access to the pitch via a gate at the end of the S

Stand,    onto the uncovered seated section,       climbed a small 4 ’ perimeter

wall and onto the playing area.

Immediately on my left was the Leppings Ln terracing and seated area

known as the "W Stand".

My initial    response was to see hundreds of people in the area of the
goal,    directly in front of the "W Stand".       It was generally a very

chaotic situation, with some people shouting            in anger toward the

Police who were standing       in the area,   some were in a state of shock,

just wandering around,       some were hysterical and crying and a lot were

pleading with us to help them.

I could also see that one of the safety mesh fencing panels had been

ripped open behind the goal       near to Pen 4.

-\o          could see a white youth, aged about          17 yrijk^ 5*8 tall, slim build and

             wearing a navy blue, short sleevecj ’TJ[/'shi r t , lying on his back. He

             had a very pale face and his eyes appeared to be looking                 into the top

        [\   of his head,    his head was facing    in a 45 degree angle from the           goal

             line pointing towards the S Stand.

             People appeared to ignore him and I could see no sign of life.

             Sub-Officer             , another Senior Officer from my Station, was with

             me and he instructed me to get out my resusciade and place it around

             the m a n ’s mouth.   There was no sign of a pulse and in order to try and

             save time,    I immediately performed inouth-to-mouth resuscitation

             without the aid of this resusciade.          I performed this role for about

             five minutes whilst Sub-Officer                   performed heart massage.         After

             this a man who I cannot describe,       other than being a white man aged

             about 35yrs    possibly wearing a pink shirt took over his position.

             Almost    immediately this man punched the patients chest with two blows

             and I said to him that I tf>eSught what he did was wrong. At this                  point

             he stated he was a d a c t o / and he knew what he was doing, we swapped

             roles and he continues^ mouth~to~mouth and I continued heart ma ssage.I

             performed this for a period of about ten to fifteen mjrrvUtes when a

             man took over from me,       stating he was qualified f^rrst aider. When I

             finished on this patient,       I could see no signyof      life.

             Also during this act of resuscitation I did in fact see a quantity of

             money    (bank notes)    in the patients breast      pocket of his blue      *T*

             shirt. That money was still       in his pocket when I left him,           in the

             company of the Doctor and the first aider.

             After that,    I then went to two females aged/about         17-18 yrs o l d . They

             were    positioned inside the 6 yard box, aM)ut 2 yards from the goal

             line    (as marked on map)    (Exhibit No)    /    Ref No           ).

             The two females       resembled each otheb/and I believe that they were

                    sisters.   They were about 5 ’6 tall and one had mousey coloured shou lde r

l4lC|^-S            length hair. This girl was also wearing a white coloured bl ous e, which

b*      ^    r 'had been loosened around her neck.                    I could see that she was wearing a
            O' •
                                :>ra.

                    Both of these girls were facing                in the same direction,     at a 45 degree

                    angle with their heads towards the N Stand.

                    A number of people had gathered around these two, and some were

                    performing mouth to mouth resuscitation on both of them, although
                                                                                                    /
                    there did not appear any sign of 1i f e .                                   /
                                                                                                /

                    I continued to perform heart massage on the girl w e a r i n g t h e white

                    blouse,    but it was soon evident to me there was no response to this
                                                                                          /
                    and I continued to another patient,                leaving the ot)fer people still
                                                                                      /
                    performing rnouth to mouth resuscitation.

                    I then went to a fourth patient who was a white man aged between 4Q-5Q
            To##
                    yrs old. He was quite overweight for his s y t e , this being about 5* 10

                    tall. He was lying on his back, almost o/f the goal                   line facing with

                    his head towards the S Stand.                Sub-OffLeer            also stationed at

                    Sheffield Central Fire Station, wasytrying to revive him by using the

                    resusciade,       and giving mouth to nt<y€ith. I commenced heart massage.                 I

                    performed this particular duty f o r              ap pr ai< imate ly three minutes,     and

                    again there was no sign of 1 if ^e , and/1            then ceased to look for other

                    casualt i e s .

                    At this point,       I saw an aqjmular^!? which was directly behind the goal

                    on the track area.        This /ambulance stopped and I believe the two female

                    patients    (believed to #e sisters) were then placed on board.                     I cannot

                    say who placed them iyfito the ambulance.

                    After   leaving the mam       (my 4th patient)         I looked around to see that a

                    white man, aged approx 40 years, was b eing carried on an advertising

                    b o a r d , beirta carr/led by a group of supporters and a Police W o m a n . When

                                                                      S 187 5

yard area and towards the corner area, with the Leppings Lri terracing

and the S Stand.

This man appeared to be deceased,      but I ran with his party and at the

same time,   placed the resuscitator machine     (iiotivus Roadman System)

over his mouth and face area.

We gained access to the uncovered seating area of the S Stand,

travelled along a gangway to an exit gate near to turnstiles        19-22.

Outside the turnstiles was a casualty waiting area, and thats where

the patient was placed until such time an ambulance arrived, and he

was taken away.

Whilst   I remained with this patient he vomited, although I feel this

was caused by a body spasm. There appeared to be no sign of life.

After    I had assisted with this 5th patient,    Iwas   then instructed by a

senior Fire Officer to obtain further       resuscitating equipment from my

appliance and assist    in the gymnasiymy^which was situated behind the N

Stand.

On my arrival,    I saw that the gymnasium had been split into two

sections with one half reserved for the injured and the other half

was where the deceased people had been laid.

I assisted the injur<»d>/ w h o had been having problems with their

breathing, whilst they waited for transport to convey them to hospital.

At approximately 4.30pm    (1630)    I left the gymnasium and collected fire

service equipment,    and replaced it onto our appliance.

At approximately 5.00pm    (1700),   together with the rest of my crew I

returned to my Station.

                  Further to my statement dated 11 th May 1989 ( 110j><39) .                     I refer,        in my

                  original statement,               to giving mouth to moutl^r esus c itat ion to a w h i t e

                  youth aged about            17 years 5*8 slim builjfry wearing a navy blue short

                  sleeved T shirt.              Sub Off icerl                performed heart massage whilst
                                                                            'pe                                      I

                  did mouth to mouth.

                  I have today been shown a photographic print                        (Ref NfeN1/5^    (Ex           )

                  by Sergeant KILLOCH of the West Midlands Police.                         ThWyouth     shown in

                  the middle of the print and to the forefront is,                        I believe,    the same

                 youth that I refer to above.                      The body is indicated by a red dot

                 marked 86.

                  I believe that           I am shown on the photograph to the left of the body,

                 although the photograph does not show my face.                          Next to me is I

                  believe Sub Officer                         he is shown with two black stripes at the
                                                                                    PAGE     2

front of his hat.

Z recall      placing the oxygen bottle which is shown on the photograph at

the side of the body.

I have been shown a photograph                 clothing    (Ref NA 86)    (Exh         ) and

can say that this appears t ^ b e          very similar to that worn by the youth

to which I refer.

I have been shown a mortuary photograph                (Ref          ) (Exh         ) of

Gary Phillip JONEB          (86K^lhis     appears to be the same youth,            except

that when X dealt with him he

is shown on the face          in the mortuary photograj

I made reference          in my original statemenjCyto two\girls who were lying

near to one another the two who            I say res&mebed               the r .   I went to

give first aid to one of the girls,              the oneynnth the white blouse.

on photographic Print          (Ref NGN1/55)     (.Ex\yr        ) in the middle of the

picture to the background can be Ysee/f the body of a girl                    being given

heart massage by a man in a patterned jumper,                   the body is indicated by

a blue dot, marked 89.             I believe this to be the girl that I re//r to

above and I understand her name to be Victoria Jane HICKS,. c t i n

I have v iewed a mortuary photograph of Victoria Ja^ie^jjKJKS (Ref                           )

(Exh              ) the picture    is similar to the girl        I dealt with.      I have

viewed mortuary photographs of all of the other females that were

killed at this disaster,           and none,    other than Victoria/} are similar.

In each of the cases above            ie Gary Phillips &QUES              and Victoria

Jane HICKS        (89)   I came across the bodies lyirwron the pitch and

rendered first aid.           I did not move the bodies to or from that

pos i t i o n .

I have indicated on two sketch plans the approximate                    positions of the

two bodies on the pitch as follows;

         I have viewed video footage and other        photographs faut am unable to

         identify the other three bodies that I make reference to in my

         original     statement.

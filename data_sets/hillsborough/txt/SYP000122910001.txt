            On Saturday 15th April 1989, I was off duty and
travelled by road to the F.A. Cup Semi-Final between Liverpool
and Nottingham Forrest, at Hillsborough, Sheffield.  I travelled
with three friends and our tickets were for the Leppings Lane
Terrace Area, Section B.

            Due to delays on the motorway we reached Sheffield at
approximately 13-30 hours.  On approaching the main road to the
stadium, a police officer halted the traffic and we were informed
that all public houses were closed and that we could park our
car in the areas at the roadside.  He further stated that we
should get to the ground in good time.

            After parking my car, we saw people going to an open
public house.  We also went into this public house, it was crowded
but there was no sign of drunkeness and no damage was being caused.
After approximately half an hour we left to make our way to the
stadium.  The time was approximately 14.10 hours.

            On making our way to the stadium, I noticed that at
each junction, on both sides of the dual carriageway, there were
groups of between two and ten police officers.  There were instances
of stop-search and also people being advised that bottles etc. would
not be allowed in the stadium.  Also at intervals, were manned,
marked police vehicles and dog handlers.

            We reached Leppings Lane at about 14.30 hours and I
immediately noticed large numbers of people in the road.  This
group was not moving towards the stadium as there were two sets
of large gates.  One pair of gates were open and these led to the
left hand side and seat area.  The gates we needed to pass through
were apparently closed.

            I then noticed a foot police officer opening these
gates, at intervals, to allow people to pass through.   After a short
time, a mounted officer got in front of the gate.

            I could see no foot officers in the gate, Leppings Lane
area.  There were no queues and the situation was like standing on
terracing - people standing close together, shoulder to shoulder.

                I saw four mounted police officers in this area, all
Merseyside.

            The feeling of the crowd at this time was one of an
urgency to get into the ground, it was about 14.50 with only ten
minutes to go before kick off and no apparent movement towards the
stadium.

            At this time, one of the mounted Merseyside Officers
communicated with those around him that the game was to be
delayed until 15.15 hours and that there was no rush to get in.
This settled the crowd down and we slowly began to move.

                At this time, I saw a Superintendent, on foot, edge
from      the   gate area,   passed the officer who had spoken, andthen
make      his   way to the rear of the crowd.

            Shortly after the horse at the gates moved and the
gates opened.  The crowd immediately moved forward.  This area was
very overcrowded and there were still no foot officers present to

                         -   2-




attempt to line people up.  I saw mounted officers lifting children
outof the people and attempt to edge through.

            I was, at this time, concerned for my own safety and
became aware that two of my friends had moved elsewhere, myself
and the other friend were still together.

            I would say in my experience of similar matches that
it was by far the worst 'crush' I had been in.  My friends and I
had previously arranged to meet inside the stadium if we became
separated.

            Soon we passed through the gates and went into the
court yard area before the turnstiles.    I then heard a roar from
inside the stadium, the game had obviously started.    People then
began to shout at the mounted officers as to why the game
had not been delayed as they had said.   The officers could not
explain.  I noticed that they were, at this time, under increasing
pressure from the push of the crowd.   There were no foot officers
in front of the turnstiles.   The crowd was pushing and shoving
increasingly but this only increased the pressure on those of us
close to the turnstiles.

            My feelings now were for my own safety and to keep
my feet and to try to get to a turnstile.

             As I neared the turnstile, I saw a police officer look
over the wall above the turnstiles and was       looking to the rear of
the crowd.     I looked to where his gaze was    directed and Isaw the
same Superintendent from before standing on a wall, near to the
roadway.   I  do not know what, if anything,     was said.

            The officer disappeared and I then saw him come over
the wall again and he then shouted to the crowd that the side
exit was now open and for people to make their way to this area,
to relieve the crush.

            At this, the crowd immediately increased its activity
to get to this gate.  I was carried   sideways off my feet. I was
very concerned at this time.    I was not in     control    of where I
going.

            I then found myself at the mouth of the end turnstile
before the side exit.   I had become twisted round so I went into
the turnstile backwards.   I saw that there was a railing about
3 feet high, coming from the    corner of the    wall so     separating
the turnstiles from the side exit.

            I held on to the male behind me, as I thought he
was going to fall over this railing and pulled him into the
turnstile with me.  The situation outside was very, very fast,
very confusing.

            I handed the correct portion of ticket to the gateman
and entered the ground.  I saw my three friends and we met up
together.

            Ss I have been to the stadium before, as had two of
my friends, we decided to enter the side terracing as the tunnel
area was too crowded and there seemed no way through.  We entered
 R. 384                     -   3-                            Form 104A




this terracing (the side of the police look-out room).  We found
a space near to the back of the terrace, about six yards from the
dividing fence.  We were about thirty yards from the pitch area.
The game had been in progress for about five minutes.

            At this time, a Liverpool attack ended with a
shotstriking the bar and coming back into play.   The crowd
everywhere had surged forward and as we returned to standing still,
I saw the centre terrace had not and still appeared to be coming
forward.  I saw people climb onto the front fence, but some police
officers pushed them back.

            I then saw a police officer, in a flat cap, walk onto
the pitch towards the Referee.  The game shortly stopped and the
players withdrew.

             I looked to the centre of the terrace, behind the goal,
people were obviously being crushed.   People were climbing over
the front fence. At first Police Officers attempted to push them
back but then began to discard their helmets and help people out.

            A gate at the front also opened,   people came out, then
it closed again, it then re-opened.

            I looked to the pitch and in front of us, a middle-aged
male was lying on the grass.   He was blue in the face.  A group of
people then carried another male towards the stand containing
Nottingham Forrest Supporters.   Somebody then began to give him
resuscitation.  I looked at the other man again to see his face
covered over, he was obviously dead.

            There were now concerted efforts by some police officers
to help people out of the terracing.

            Although the first aid personnel were doing all they
could, there was obviously not enough of them.

            Groups of police officers then began to arrive and stand
on the pitch.  A group of about 100 stood in the penalty area.
This was also filling up with injured people, in places people
were receiving resuscitation.  I saw a young male lying on the
pitch, he was also dead.  Another person was covered over with a
coat.

            The group attending to the male near the stand, and
the people in the stand, cheered as the male was resuscitated.
However, the group went quiet again and again they began to
resuscitate him, he was then removed by stretcher.

            An ambulance appeared at the opposite end of the
ground.  The Fire Brigade also arrived.   Supporters began to pull
advertising boards to assist the injured.

            I realised at this time, that there were at least four
fatalities, possibly more.

            I saw plenty of police officers assisting people, but
on looking to the 100 in the penalty area, these were still looking
to the terracing.
R. 384                   -   4-                               Form 104A



             Supporters were administering resuscitation but it
 was clear they did not know how to do it.  The officers in the
 penalty area did nothing to assist.  At no time did I see an
 officer assist.

              Increasing numbers were being carried off.

              After a bout of cheering from the Forest Supporters,
 a small group of Liverpool fans ran towards them.   A line
 of police officers came from the opposite end and pushed them back.
 These officers remained at the half-way line.   The Nottingham
 Forrest Supporters fell quiet and began clapping people carrying
 the injured.

             This scene remained.  As the pitch began to clear, an
 announcement from the police stated to retain our ticket stubs
 and shortly to leave the stadium.

               The feeling all around was one of shock, upset and
 disbelief,   everybody realised that people had died.

             Personally, |________________________________________I
                   | I also felt disbelief at the actions of some
 police officers.    I could not explain to my friends as to why
 they did nothing.

             At no time did I see a police officer being assaulted,
 or urinated upon.  At no time did I see any person remove property
 from any person on the pitch.

             I accept that people travel to matches without tickets
 but in my opinion it was sheer weight of people that caused the
 crush outside.  I saw plenty of people still with their tickets,
 a friend in my group included, at the end of the game.

             I do not criticise the opening of the exit at     the
 beginning but I do criticise the lack of policing outside     in areas
 of queuing and relieving pressure.   There were obviously     plenty
 of police officers present but in my mind, they were only     ready
 for confrontation and not control.

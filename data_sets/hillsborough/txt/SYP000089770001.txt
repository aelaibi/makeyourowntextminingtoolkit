            I am a qualified d o c to r , my qualifications are M B C h B .        I qualified in

            July    1986 (000786) at Sheffield,         I have worked at the Northern

            General Hospital since February 1988 (000288).



            On Saturday 15th April         1989 <15*0489)    I was working on the labour ward.
                                                  /
            1 started work at approximately 8.30 am (0830).                 At some time around 3

            pm ( 1500)      I was leaving \the/nurses h o m e , in fact I think      it

            was probably nearer 3.30 pm (1530), when I saw an ambulance with the

            blue    light flashing and siren sounding pul 1 up outside the double

            doors to the main corridor leading to the obstetrics and gynaecology

            ward,   just outside the ante-natal         clinic.      The ambulance had obviously

            come the wrong way and was unable to drive any further.                  The re was a

            Poli ce officer on a motorbike accompanying the ambulance
                                                                                                                         PAGE
                                                                                                                         S3403

              immediately went over to see if there was anything that I could do.

              There were two ambulancemen in the rear of the am b u l a n c e » one of them

              was holding a mask over the patients face and the other was doing

              cardiac m a s s a g e .                             I asked what had happened whilst at the same time

              making an initial assessment of the pat ie nt.                                       I was informed that the

              patient had come from the Hillsborough Football Ground but they d i d n ’t

              provide me with any further details.



Bci i d E     The             patient was a white male? and my assessment was that he was aged
GcW5li5^
 _            early to mid twenties.                                     He was of stocky/bui id and I think he had da rk

              had fixed dilated pupils and was cyamosed/ ctsrlTrally as we 11 as

 f \ q        iogether with the ambulancemen I assisted with cardio-pulmonary

              resuscitation                                   (C.P.R.)



              The Policeman had disappeared and I assumed that he had gone to get

              further assistance.                                    He returned in a short time and I asked him if

              assistance was on its way.                                      He informed me that there wasn't and that

              there was chaos in the                                     Accident and Emergency department. At          this

              stage                   I decided to transfer the patient on the t r o 11ey to A &                        E.

              Together with the ambulancemen this was d o n e .                                     We went straight into

              reception at A &                                   E and   I remember seeing people e ve r ywh ere , it    was

              obvious that something                                     was seriously wrong.



              Someone,                            I don *t know who directed us to take the patient along the

              corridor                            into what        is called the recovery room.       Throughout the

              patient was receiving C.P.R.                                     (cardio-pulmonary resuscitation).             Whilst
                                                                              PAGE        ;
                                                                              S34G3

in the recovery room a senior colleague who I believe was an

anaesthetist       introduced himself and asked me the patients history.

I gave him all the detaiIs I could and the patient was then moved into

the adjoining        room whi ch is the A &    E plaster room.   I then left this

patient with the anaesthetist.            Unfortunately I cannot   recall this

persons name.         At the time I left the patient he had not been

intubated but I recal1 there being a discussion to the effect that he

would be.       In my opinion this patient was really already dead upon

arrival at the hospital although resuscitation attempts were m a d e .                I

am unable to say with absolute           certainty whether this patient was

successfully resuscitated or not as I did not have any further                contact

with h i m , after      leaving him in the care of the anaesthetist but due to

his condition I believe that he was un res us c itable.



Having left this patient I moved through Treatment B room (clean

theatre) with the resuscitation room where            I -became invp^ved in the

attempted resuscitation of a patient whossr / ^ J a x was 21              <body 91

patient but I am unable to provide details of these pe opl e.             He was on

a trolley which was situated nearest the door in the resuscitation

room leading into A & E reception,            so as you walked into the

resuscitation room this patient was on the first trolley.



I made an assessment of the patient,

                                                       after fifty minutes

resuscitation attempts we re abandoned and the pat i ent was verified/

certified dead by m y s e l f .   I had no further dealings with this pat ient.



I then moved on and assisted with a number of other patients none of

Some time    later that afternoon/evening     I believe it was around 5.30 pm

(1730)    I returned to A &   E to see if the folder     relating to the second

patient that 1 had dealt with was there.           I could not locate the

folder with the patient or anywhere else.          Whereupon I went to the

hospital mortuary.      1 was still unable to locate the folder and

subsequently made my own notes on a sheet of A4 paper using the ma jax

no. 21.     I left these with the b o d y .



The only way that I am able to identify the patient is by the majax

no. which in this case was SI.        I would describe the patient as a

white male, aged approximately late teens,         early twenties.    He was of

medium buiId and I cannot recall what clothing he was wearing.


                                                     /v/e>~r®7
Whilst treating this patient I do remember that Dr Rachajeif PETTINGEK

was also assisted along with other       people.

X have since located the notes that I made referring to majax no. 21
and used them as reference whilst making this statement.             They are

kept   in medical   records at this hospital and I can produce them if

necessary.

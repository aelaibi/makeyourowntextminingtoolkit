loud noisy          crowd of fans who were                    stood on the fdotpath.                                   was

a s ce rt ai ne d     that 1two .of the youths were                       selling        tipkets         f#r ;the;

The youths were a r r e st ed and e s c o r t e d to the Police                                   rod'in. 'where they

were     processed and detained.                       One    of the youths was                   later       released

after a Verbal               C au t i o n and e s c orted from the ground.

At    T.13 pm the            same    date     I returned          back         to the L e p p i n g s        Lane          end and

joined my. S e r i a l .'           I i mmediately noticed that                       the turn s t i l e s were                   now

open and a l th ou gh a small                   number       of fans were             entering          the       ground,          a    *

 large    number        of    fans were u n c on c e r n e d and                content      to    crowd around all

over     the f o o tpaths and             roads.         A number             of fans were         drinking                from

beer     cans and singing               football         songs.

I joined        the     other Pol i c e Officers                to stop the fans                  from drinking

a 1 coho 1 and. tried to mdve them off                          the       road towards            the    turnstiles.

A l t h o u g h some were           c o - o p e r a t i v e , there was a large               number who were                      now.

getting        quite     drunk ..and abusive.                 I know for a fact                   that       on a normal-

m atch day these youths w o u 1d have                         bee n a r r e s t e d but the              sheer number

pf drunken          fans      in the      crowds w ould           ^ot^have' made             this       feasible,,                The

crowd was        getting        large and noisier                 by the minute and they were                                still

content        to stand a ro u n d everywhere                   instead of going                  into       the       ground,

the    turnstiles            were    c om p a ra ti v e l y \ q u i e t   considering             the    large             crowd.

reasons and as a result a few minu t e s                              later        the entire           road was             now

f i 11ed with f a n s.              Along with other              officers           I was    totally             involved

seen an old man fall                    to the    floor     in the    crowd arid, for almost             ten

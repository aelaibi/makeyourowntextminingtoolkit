                Although            I am      a CID     officer          I volunteered               to w o r k     the m a t c h       in

                travelling              down Herries              Road     towards        the       gro u n d .     This      consisted          of

                displayed.               Whilst        patrolling           the    area        I became           aware      t hat    the F i v e

myself         a n d PC R o y l e      were       instructed            by the S e r i a l            Sergeant             to m ake

our w a y       down     to G a t e        *0*    and      this     we    did. N u m e r o u s        persons             were

s t ill     in the       Five       Arches        Public         House and there                were       still          fans

walking         down     Herries          Road      towards         the g r o u n d .          Some       had      clearly           ha d        a

drink.          Some     fans       enquired          how     far    it was       to      the       ground and when told

it was         a good 20 minutes                  walk ,     some       hailed        down          passing          Hackney          Cabs .

On arrival            at G a t e     ’0*       I c o u l d see       t hat      the       general          a r e a was          clear          of

fans,       although          there       were      one     or    two     hanging          a r o u n d a n d as            we     got       to

the      actual       g ate    we w e r e        instructed          to    go     inside            the    ground          as     t h e re

was      "some     sort       of    bother".            Numerous          officers             including             our       serial

entered         the    ground and made                  our w a y       along        the       side       of    the       pitch       near

the N o r t h      s t a n d a n d as          I looked          into     the     pitch         I could           see      the

players         being     lead       from       the     field .          I looked          towards             the     Leppings

Lane      end a n d      near       the      area     of    gate    2 on        the       diagram          I could             see    what

only      appeared        to       be a      public        order     situation.                 Persons           were         on the

pitch and          persons          were       climbing          over     the     fence         onto       the       pitch.

I looked          to a n a r e a       directly            behind       the     goal       and       could        see      persons

being       lifted       from       the      terrace        area     into       the       stands          above.           On arrival

at    the      Leppings        Lane       end     I t oo k       up a     position             to    the       r i gh t    of     the

goal      and     in this          area      people        were     screaming             that       they wa nt e d             to    get

out      because       people        were        getting         crushed.            As    I looked             I could          see       a

body      on the       floor        against         the     concrete           in w h i c h         the    fence          was

embedded.             Persons        in the         crowd were            trying          to    hold       b ack       people         so

t h at    this     body       could       be     lifted      but     the       crowd       k ep t     pushing             forward.               I

went      to    the    fence        and      helped        people        over    the       fence          onto       the       pitch and

then      officers        and       f a ns     started       to     rock       the     f e nce       backwards             and

forwards            in o r d e r        to    break          it.     I did       not       see     the     fence         g ive      way

because           I was       instructed                by a S e r g e a n t       to      help     persons            out     of     the

terracing              via    gate       4 marked             on the       diagram.               Our    brief         was     to     get       them

on t o    the       pitch         in a n      orderly manner.                    I do        not    recal l         when       t his       gate

was      opened.             Persons          were       by    this       time     climbing             o ve r     the    dividing

terrace           fence       in o r d e r         to    get       out    through          g ate 4.           I helped             people

o nt o    the       pitch and            the m a j o r i t y w e r e            sweating           and     breathing               heavily.

Some      just         fell       to    the     floor         on    the    pitch        to    r ecover.             The       majority

after         a few seconds                  sat    up a f t e r         they    had       got     their         breath.            None

that      I saw a p p e a r e d              i njured.             After       a short        while        I became            aware        that

the      fence         that was          being          rocked       too a n d        fro     had       been       broken and              bent

back      such         that       it a l l o w e d       persons          to    get     off       the    terracing             onto        the

pitch.            This       a rea was          gradually            clearing           and       I then         became        aware        of a

la r ge       number         of    officers             and    fans       to    the     left       of    the       goal       in the a r e a

of    gate        3 on       the       diagram and             I then          became        aware       of      bodies        being

brought           onto       the       pitch.           Immediately             I realised              t hat      these       were        dead

bodies         and a lt ho ug h              officers          and       fans    were        carrying            out     mouth        to

mouth         I knew         this       was     futil e.            I thought           about       going          over       to    this

area      but       I could            see    that       it was          already        an    overcrowded                area and           I

decided           to    concentrate                on the a r e a          in f r o n t       of me        this        being        the

broken         fence.             By    t his      t ime      it a p p e a r e d      to     be    clearing            and     I saw a

man      on the         terracing             obviously             in a d az e         with       s ome      minor       faci a l

injuries.               I shouted             for       him    to    come       onto       the     pitch         but     he    kept

shaking           his     head.          Eventually                the    man    came        towards          me    and       I helped

him      o nt o     the      pitch.           He    smelled          strongly           of    intoxicants.                    As    I walked

him      on    to      the    pitch          two    officers,             one    male        and    one       female,          took        hi m

off      my    hands         and       lead     him a w a y         for m e d i c a l        treatment.                I could         now

people that friends they were looking for were all right.                   Nothing

more could be done.People were wandering          around the pitch     and I was

approaching them just reassuring       them.     I was then detailed to go to

the   half-way   line.   I presume    with a view      to stop Liverpool       fans

going towards the Notts Forest end.           Some of the Liverpool fans were

clearly incensed     and angry and I had        to physically restrain a few

fans from going any further.

At about 4.30 p.m.       (1630) I was detailed to see that the        fans     from

the Leppings Lane end left in an orderly manner and I together with

other   officers   walked   down   Leppings    Lane.    The   fans   left    in   an

orderly manner.

At 5-00 p.m. (1700) returned to North Stand where I was instructed to

attend at Claywheels Lane.         Transported back to Rotherham and went

off duty at 7-00 p.m. (1900) I think.

that      thKjanly            dead        persons             were       the    o nes        on the pitch.              I w oul jdr

were      that      I did         not        dbsenough and                 could        have       dope     mo r e .      Regarding

Everything            was      good          humour^a and                 fans     arriWl           gradually            up to kick

allocated           the       same        end.           Because          of    this     my     opinion          is a n d       it is       CN^ly

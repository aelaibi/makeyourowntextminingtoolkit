way back       towards            the    river     I took up a position towards                           the    river,           to

the    right of the               turnstile        block as you           look from L e p p i n g s Lane away

from the mass of                  people     in    the turnstile area.

Whilst      I was        standing awa y            from the        crowd,        by the river,            I s a w _________

turnstiles.              I w o u l d estimate1 that             1 joined             the    crowd    in front          of the

before.       I became          s e parated 'TT'om                        in the       crowd,       bat was making

steady       progress          towards     the turnstiles.

It was when          I was       in a position about                  six yards            from the       turnstile

block,       still       on a line with the                  centre    of the block,               that    I could

feel    severe       pressure          from the         rear.        It was at this               point    that     I felt

crushed       in by/thfe         crowd,     having           no movement at all.                   There were          three

m ou n t e d P o l y c e a n o n g s t           the    crowd     in the area aro u n d me and                     1 can

reme m b e r^’T h e m 4 a y i n g—if'o u s , "Stop             pushing,        push back."              1 said      to a

moun t e d    officer a couple              of times,           “ Its not us thats                 pushing,        i t ’s the

people at the back,                tell     them to stop              p u s h i n g . 1'    The Officer          didn't

seem to take much                notice and            continued telling               people a r o u n d me           to

stop    pushing.              This was     pointless,           we    c o u l d n ’t move and           it was      the

people at the             rear of the            crowd by the          outer       gates         that were       pushing.

As    I got       nearer       to a turnstile wit h i n about                    four or five             people away,

I had to          put my       right    leg up against               tne wall        by the turnstile,                 to

keep myself          in line with           the turnstile              I had my            leg    locked     in a

horizontal          position against               the wall and within a short                          space     of time,

I could feel             my    leg beginning            to buckle        under       the     pressure.           The

pressure          from behind was           still        very     intense.           I have        done a fair

amount       of                            tn the        past and have been                  in some       tricky

situations.              1 am not easily               put    into a state of               panic,      however,        I

could feel          a sense       of    panic as         I a p p r o a c h e d the turnstile.

1 even t u a l l y got          to the     turnstile,           it was one of the                  central

turnstiles,          and went          through         into the ground.                I handed my ticket                   into

the    turnstile          operator       and      received the stub portion back,                            w hich     I

Once    inside the ground,                 I had a cup of tea and bought a m atch

programme.           I w ou l d estimate               that    1 entered the               ground at about

It was my intention              to watch the match -from the                              left hand side of the

terraces,       t h a t ’s as you        look at the                  pitch, Jfelbwards the North Stand.                      I

a t t e n d e d the    c o r r esponding         semi      firkal ma'tch           AJk    VA   11 shore ugh   last year

<1988)     and w a t c h e d the game from                               section ovL-^Tfie terracing,               which

provided a good                view.      Imade my way around the hack                            of the     stand and

used the tunnel on tbwe left K a n d                         side of the stand,                   that gives access

to the     left hand section              a ft   t \rfe   J C s fr   rac i n g .    It was a few minutes                pr ioi

to the kick off that              XyCook          up a fwreition in what                        I now know as       pen

number     six,       w hich was v i r tually empty.

I watc h e d the game kick               off and then w a t c h e d the game                         itself      until    it

was    stopped.         During    the time           that            the game was          in progress,          I was    not

aware    of what was           happening          in the             central       pens    further across          to my

ri ght hand side.                At    the t i m e , I was              not aware        that     people were       being

crushed      in those           central pens.

It was     not until          the game      had stopped that my attention,                                was drawn to

the area of the           central        pens.            By this time,              there were a lot of

people     in and ar o u n d the area of the Liverpool                                    goal.     My    initial

thoughts were           that    it was an overspill                        from the        central       peris, and      it

w a s n ’t until       I saw a body         lying          on the          ground with the face               covered

that    I realised        it was more             than a crowd overspill.

I immedi ately became             concerned for my brother                               in law,                   whom       I

knew    liked to watch matches                    from behind the goal.                          I went    down to the

front    of the        pen,    towards      the gate                 in the front          perimeter       fence.

There was a single              policeman standing                       on the gate who             initially

prevented me           from going        out      onto        the       pitch.       i explained          that    I wanted

to    look for my brother              in law and               the Po       .1 i ceman    agreed     ^o lee me

through.        Before        going    onto the            pitch         I suggested to the P o l i c e m a n

that he try and get some                  of the           people a way from the                    pitch.       There

a p p e a r e d to be a lot of u n n e c e s s a r y                  people who were             hampering       the

efforts      of those         trying     to help the dying and                           injured on the          pitch.

              The    people were milling a r o u n d on the                           pitch being more       of a hinderance

              than anything           else.           The        policeman         said to m e , "They d o n ’t want          to

              come off,"

              I the n went         onto     the        playing area               1ook ing f or

              success,          I started approa c h i n g                   people myself.,      s u ggesting    that    they

              leave the         playing area and a llow more                          room for    people    tending      to

              injured       people who           needed           room to breathe.             Nobody took any notice              of

              what    I said to them?                  probably due to the effect                  that the disaster was

              having      on them.          There was a display of emotions amongst                              the Liverpool

              supporters at that                 end of the ground;                   so muc h so,   ihat had the Po 1 ice

          SUBJECT:        Hillsborough Disaster Enquiry!


          At 9.00am on Saturday 15th April 1|89 attended at Hillsborough
        football ground for briefing.


        After briefing I formed part of Serial 6 3 . This was a mobile serial
        covering the area of Middlewood Road/ Langset Road. During         $his
        patrol we attended at various licenced premises re: public disorder
        situations*


        At approximately 3.00pm we were returning to the ground when we heard
        the assistance calls. Our duties then were to assist marshalling fans
        away from the Leppings Lane end to get people out of the stand as fast as
        possible and to allow a clear way for the ambulances. We were then told to
        form a cordon beside the dead that had been placed next to the fence
        bordering onto the river.


        When the dead had been removed we resumed to van patrol and attended various other
        disturbances.


        At approximately 7•30pm together with an other Officer I was given duties
        at the Directors main entrance to allow only authorised person to gain access.


        At 8,30pm we mealed at Clay Wheels Lane and at 9«00pm we were told to stand-by
        at Niagra Bar. At 10«00pm that day we were told to stand down.

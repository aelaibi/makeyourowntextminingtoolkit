the    goal,     I could not            believe what          I was      seeing.         There wer e a sea of

faces      pressed against          the square metal               mesh.         Most     of them,       I say

twenty      in number,      were        blue.      There      faces were          bloated and their                 eyes

bulging.       Many of them were               vomitting       t hr ou gh the mesh.               The    full

last    breath.       U n i f o r m Poli ce j>fti cers were                 fr an ti ca ll y trying        to       pull

casualties       out of the         op^n gate          into that ^5* ct i on but the                  force     from

behind was       so great       t bn.    people against            the      fence    could not move             one

inch either         to t h e i r left or          right,      even w i th i n       reach of the open gat?

My    immediate      r ea ction was simply one of horror.                            I thought          that    I

w a s n ’t there,     I was w a t c hi n g        it from a d is tance whilst                   not     really

being      there,    as t ho ug h       it was a video           recording.              It c o u l d n ’t h ap pe n

ha pp en    in front     of your         eyes.

The    sight    is one    I will         remember and will               no doubt         never    forget.           The

most    u ps etting thing        looking         back was the fact                that these          people,

s q u as h ed against     the metal            were wi th in       inches        of you,       in fact you

could touch them,          but do nothing                to hel p them.             They were         dying     in

front      of you and wit h all            the will         in the w or ld          nothing       could    be done,

Some    people were       being         h au le d out of the            crowd,      thro ug h the often,

na rr ow gate,      and han de d back            to a chain of Pol ic e Of' f p e € r s .                 I joined

the    chain a nj^jaody after             body     passed t h ro u gh jfty-'lnands.               At the

checking       for vital       signs      of    life     but few s ho we d any.

  a few minutes             realised         it was a useless             gesture.         There were       dazed,

  crying      fans all around.                  I stood up and            looked a ro u nd me at the             full

  extent      of the tragedy.                 Little       pockets      of   people,       Police,     stewards,

^supporters          we re all      beating          the     chest    of horizontal            v i ct ims^^ki ss i ng

  My    personal         victim was          Lyi ng dead at my feet

  A group of supporters                  brought a large a d v e rt i se m en t                hoardi ng and

  placed      ’my b o d y 5 on the            stretcher.           I told them to             leave him where          he

  was and      look       for    one alive,          a casualty for who                they    could do

  something.             One    of the       supp or te rs     punched me at the side                of the      head

  on my      right       ear and f r an t i c a l l y star te d y el li ng              "Leave him,       he's

  alive,      he's       fucking    breathing,             he wants an a mbulance".                 There    was      no

  point      in reasoning w ith this                   group.        Th-ey were all           screaming,     crying

  the hoarding and               run jp-ff w i t h him towards               the K o j f end.

  I went      back to t j ^ ^ h u m a n        chain       in the     vai n ho^e        that a real       living

  The y all        efassed thro ug h the             line,     all    obvious ly d e a d .        Like    the

  casualty         I tried to       resuscitate,             they all        looked the same.             T he y were

  all      blue and       bloated.           I can't       recollect any          of their       faces    only blue

  bodies all         looking       the same age,             the same        size and weight.

  The      only faces          I can recall          were    those      of the P o l i c e me n and women.

  O ff icers       who    I had w o r k e d w it h for years all                   busying      thems el ve s    with

                                                                                                         PAGE

shocked,        bewildered,         but all       looking      the same,       like busy androids.

Some were        crying,         I know how they felt.                 I w an te d to cry         in

f r u s tr a t i o n at   not    being able        to do anything.             I looked towards           the

perimeter        fence w here          the faces       had been      pressed against.              There were

no faces.          The    pressure       from behind had            been released and they had

f a l l e n back    onto a pile of other                bodies.

I r emembered TV           clips       of the h ol ocaust          in the S ec o nd W or ld War,           piles

of bodies m a r s h a l l e d       into a heap by bulldozers.                      I was    looking at the

same     thing.      There must          have    been 40 bodies             still    piled up and almost

as many handed back.                   It was    then      I think that        I just w an te d to         run

a w a y and     leave     it all.        The e no rm it y of the trag ed y had just u nf ol de d

but     still    1 refused to           believe      it.

As    I stood,      b ew il d er e d    not    really knowing what             to do,       I h eard a

horrible        scream.         I looked a ro u nd an d saw a casualty being                       lifted by

well mean i n g      fans       onto a hoarding.             His    left     leg was       o b vi ou sl y broken

at the shin wit h h p s             foot      coming    out at      right ^arfig 1 e s .     He must     have

been     in some     r,4al pain.             I helped      p 1a c e d^lln^o n the      hoarding and

carried hifn to the              e:<it across^tj>e-^pitch.              I    knew the a mb ul an ce s would

be arriv i n g      shor tl y at        the P en i st o ne Rd end.

T o g e t h e r wit h the       supporters,       we    carried the          casualty to an a rea             by

the side of ti^e gym.                  For    the next 20 m i nu te s         or so     I assisted       in

o rgan i s i n g / as u al ti es w ith the a m b u l a nc e          staff.         Most    of the

casualties; at that a re a were                  b reathing        okay but s uffering           from broken

bones.

W hen   the     last of the         casualties         had been w hi s ke d off            to hospital I

went    into the gym.             It became h or ri b ly           clear     how big       the   t r ag ed y had

been when one w a l k e d           into the gym.           Lines and        lines     of bodies       covering

an area 40 yds            by 40 yds          square.

I remained         in the       gym a ss i st i ng     in placing       the    bodies       in bags an d

m oo d           the fans were          of horror     bu^/also       of

aggression.             As well        as want i ng    to get    to the Forest             fans,     they were

aggressive            towards Police,          amb ul an ce   staff and stewards alike.

T here     is     little doubt          that their        behaviour was made worse                 by the     fact

that man y of the fans                  I dealt w ith       on the       pitch    itself       had been

drinking          heavily.        M an y were      so o bv i ou s ly drunk that            they were

staggering.

Their      behaviour was           very strange           I thought,       in view of the fact               that

they had just w i t n e s s e d            such horror.         The y     seemed now          intent

on reprisal            against     everyone        else    in the ground          rather       than quiet

m ou r n i n g   of    reflection.

I cannot make            comment        on radio      procedure as         Idid not have ac ce ss             to

    I am afraid that the Home Secretary's minute to the Prime
Minister of 2 August contained an error. The press will have
embargoed copies of Lord Justice Taylor's report at 9.30 am on
Friday 4 August.

    I am copying this to Private Secretaries to recipients of
the Home Secretary's minute and I should be grateful if they
could make this alteration. I apologise for the mistake.




                                                                     \

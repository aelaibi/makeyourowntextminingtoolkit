            Dear

            Thank you for your recent letter.            I apologise for the delay
            an replying to you.                                                  *

        will not solve the problems of crowd safety and control has
        been noted.  However, it is a view which the government does
        not share and which does not equate with the views expressed

        Stadium disaster.   He recognised that there was no single
        solution to achieve total safety and cure all the problems of
        crowd control.  However, he was satisfied that seating does
        more to achieve these objectives than any other single
        both FIFA FUj^hermore
                  and UEFA.    this is in line with the policies of

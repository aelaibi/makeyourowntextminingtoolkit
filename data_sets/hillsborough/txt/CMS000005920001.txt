Dear Mr Baden

NATIONAL FEDERATION OF STADIUM COMMUNITIES (NFSC)

We spoke this pm about the attached application for our Special
Grants Programme (SGP) on which you kindly agreed to give a Sport
and Recreation view.
I suspect that DOE will be unable to fund this proposal as the
NFSC's primary objective is to offer advice to those living near
major sport stadia. Our SGP interest is in alleviating inner city
deprivation which the applicant admits is a secondary objective.
Nonetheless we must consider the application fully.

I should be grateful if you would complete our standard appraisal
form, attached, as best you can which covers those aspects of an
application on which we focus in our consideration. Given that
we are unlikely to support, it would also be helpful to know if
you would consider heiping the proposal. We can then advise the
NFSC accordingly.
Your comments by 18 October would be greatly appreciated.

Yours sincerely




John Sherman
Inner Cities Directorate

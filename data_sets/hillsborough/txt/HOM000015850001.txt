CHARGES FOR POLICING FOOTBALL MATCHES IN LONDON

You asked me for comments on Mr Boys Smith's submission of 20
July which was not copied to PRB.

I have not been able to speak to either him or Mr Townsend;
therefore my advice has not been agreed with Police Department.

I have three points to suggest:

(1)   Could the Metropolitan Police_be persuadfed to delay the
      second increase until 1991/92 and to announce only the first
      increase at this stage?                 t

(2)   In any case they should try to avoid quantifying the
      potential increases. They can reasonably say that it is
      impossible to do so because the situation will vary so much
      from club to club.
(3)   If possible, they should try to announce it by Tuesday of
      next week well before the Hillsborough Report.  If it
      follows the Report, the stories are bound to be linked.

Another i m p o r t a n t presentational point to bear in mind is that
the police decide how many officers are needed in grounds.
Although this is double-edged, it will enable us to refute
suggestions that clubs will be encouraged to ask for less police
than they really need.

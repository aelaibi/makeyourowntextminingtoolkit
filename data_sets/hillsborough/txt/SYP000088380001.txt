I then went with a police                  officer       into a small        room across           from the

plaster      room where          there was      one body lying on a t a b l e,                   I stripped

this    body and the Police               officer      recorded the       detaiIs.              I cannot

identify either              of the bodies        that    I stripped apart               from stating        that

I then went         back to the m o r tu ar y and was             told that t h e j r s          were     some

dealings with this               body.

A short      time          later a man    came to the m o r t u a r y and stated that he

list and that one of the                  descriptions        fitted that of his                 relative.        I

got a full       d e s c r i p t i o n of the mans        nephew and the         clothing and then

checked      it against          the details       that we a l r e a d y had.             fne man was

convinced that the d e s cr i p ti on fitted his                    nephew.         I decided to show

the man the         clothing and once he had seen this                      he was         happy/satisfied

that    it was      not his        relative.       I d o n ’t know this mans               details.         He was

DISASTERS AND THE LAW
Thank you for your note of 14 March.     I have seen the comments
of Messrs Brook, Whalley and Clowes.
2. I think you might emphasise the "public expectation" point
and the pressure it puts on Ministers. I also think you might
also point out the desire for one inquiry (although, to some
extent, it links with the parallel enquiry into the
duplication between public inquiries and coroners' inquests).
3. My own view is that, while I understand the Lord
Chancellor's concern about "judge time", his colleagues are
always likely to bow to pressure to set up what is seen as a ^
fe4»e±y independent inquiry. (Your own draft mentions section
33 of the Fire Services Act 1947? I suspect that this would
provide too narrow a statutory base for inquiries like those
on Bradford and Kings Cross.)

pubs drinking.              The   bus got to the ground at almost                   exactly 3 pm

(1300)    and       it was obvious        that these       fans    had no     chance    of   reaching

the ground          prior    to the kick off.



The    bus s topped a l o n gs id e       the entrance       to        the service     road leading to

the    rear    of the S o u t h Stand.



M ys el f and the other 2 officers a l i g h t e d and made our way towards                               gate

0.     A gain there were a number                of fans    outside       the ground wit h only a

minimal       police    presence.         Upon entering          the    ground through gate 0

there was a half             hearted attempt        by some       of fans     to gain entry with us



I went     towards      the gym na si um where           1 knew my serial w o ul d be.              By this

time    the game       had started and had              probably been under w a y for 2 or 3

minutes.        I was met at the g ymnasium door                       by Inspector Alf      8 ar/er who

told me to tak /a my serial               onto    the    peryrfeter      tra^pfc.    I collected m y

officers       fro/ the gym         (they were me-^ti. ng along with abtj^n, 50 or 60

others.)       Idrt this      stage   I was uij^are         of what had happened.



We entered the track via the w a l kw ay between the kop and the

cantilever          stand and saw that           to the    left    of the goals        in front of

the Leppings Lane was what                  I initially s up posed to be an overspill                      of

fans    onto    the    running      track and      1 assumed       that we were        going    to be

deployed       to    control      them.    At    that    precise moment         there was      no

fighting       or disorder and nothing              to suggest what was happening.                    I

w o ul d estimate       that      there were about 20 fans on the track.                       By the

time we had          reached the half way           line the numbers           had    increased to 50

or 60 and some were               encroaching      onto    the    playing area        itself.       There

was still       no sign of disorder              or any    indication to me of what was
                                                                                                     PAGE
                                                                                                     S3430

happen!ng.



I then saw a police officer                     1/2    (half)    walk    1/2    (half)    run onto      the

pitch towards          the       referee and at this stage               I decided       to take my

serial       over    the    playing are a towards              that    location.     W it h i n seconds

a lmost      the whole       corner of the L ap pi ng s Lane              half was       covered with

people.        By this       time       played had all         but stopped as far as           I could

see,     a nd even at        this       stage   there was       no    indication as       to what was

happ en in g and       I still          thought    that ail we would be doing was ushering

them off       the    pitch or containing               them.



As we a p p ro ac he d       the area we started               to move    quicker and fans were

m ov in g    towards us.           They were       saying      that    people were       dying or had

been killed.           The       scene was      chaotic       by now and as we       reached the

L ep pi ng s Lane      end       X could see that         p e ople on the terraces were              crushed

up ag ai ns t       the wire       fencing and were            obv io us ly    in trouble.        I w ould

estimate       that 30 seconds             had passed         between then and the time we had

first s tepped onto               the    perimeter      track.



By this time other                officers      had    climbed the fencing and were                pulling

people       up and over and others were                  by open gates          pulling    people      out

w h i ch was    near       impossible       due to the         crush.



W hile      officers       from my s e r i a / went       to assist       1 immedi at el y went         over

the    radio    to call          for bolt/cutters         using       something    like    "We need bolt

cutters       here    immediately A o           cut the fences          down,    there are     people

dying       in front of us."              Whilst      doing    this    I was making my way towards

the half way          line to get a way from the noise whi ch was                         e xt remely    loud.

I did not hear             the    reply    clearly enough to a s c e rt ai n whether my

m es sa ge    had been       received and          I a g a i n made     the    request    using    the same
                                                                                                                       P AGE           4
                                                                                                                       S3450

                                                             received a reply / n        the af f i rmat ive.



              S a t i s f i e d that my           request was    being a cted on I returned             to the fencing

              immediately.



              The    scene was           now      complete    bedlam.     People were still          being       dragged

              out    either          over      the fence     or through    the gate and        it was obvious               to me

              that      some were           dead.     I joined a number          of other     officers and together

              with some          fans we          began tearing       down one of the fencing           sections.                The

              fencing          s ub se q u e n t l y gave way and we       began pu 11 yng p e o p 1e out,             some of

              w ho m were        o bviously dead,            some of whom were a\^.ve and            relatively

              uninjured.              E ac h    person dragged out was           pushed or m a n h a n d l e d    or

              carried a wa y from the                 immediate area and onto            the grass where           first

              aid was being adrni nistered and a tt empts                        of resus ci ta ti on were         being

              made      by both police,              fans and St Johns       personnel.          By now    I would

              estimate          that some 3 minutes             had    passed and a routine of sorts had set

              in



              At some          stage,       and    I cannot    remember exac tl y when,          I heard officers

              shouting          to    people       still   on the     terraces    to move     back and upon            looking

              I could see that                  there was an area on the terraces about mid way                             in

              w hi ch    relatively few people were                    standing and was        such that had those

              nearer      to the front and who were obv io us ly                     in little or no danger,

              m ov ed backwards,                it w ould have      c on si derably eased the        pressure          on

              those      crushed up against                the fences.      These     requests were        to no avail.



              After      the a rea behind the section of fencing                        that had been torn dowr

              had been e mp tied to the extent where                       thera/was       no further      danger           I
< 7cJ& br
              joined other             officers       outside    the gate JCo the        left of the goals and

              a s si s t e d    in removing          persons    both ^e^rai and al^ve^.

             I later f ormed       part of a cordon across    the half way   line and      later-

             still     took what    remained of my serial    outside   into L ep pings Lane.



             I took no further        part thereafter.

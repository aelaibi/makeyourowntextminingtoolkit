 T h a n k you for y o u r letter of 1 A ugust in which you asked me to reconsider m y
 decision, conveyed in my letter of 25 July, n o t to agree to y o u r request for a meeting to
 discuss th e difficulties which have been faced by y o u r constituents, M r and Mrs C h u rch
 in relation to th eir so n ’s death during th e H illsborough disaster. I am sorry th a t you
 sh o u ld feel that in coming to m y decision I did not consider the matter properly. I can
 o n ly assure you that this is not the case and I th in k that m y earlier reply refleas this.

H av in g considered the points contained in y o u r recent correspondence, I have to say
th a t I rem ain of the view that it w ould n o t serve any useful purpose for me to agree to
such a meeting - either w ith me o r w ith one of the junior ministers. To do so w ould
o n ly raise the hopes of M r and Mrs C h u rc h when, ultimately, there is no action I can
p ro p e rly take.

Y o u m e n tio n th a t y o u r constituents have been badly served by those legally
representing them . Y ou will appreciate th a t this is not a m atter for the H om e Office
and should M r and Mrs C hurch wish to m ake a formal com plaint about this, they
sh o u ld contact th e Lord Chancellor’s D epartm ent.

Y ou say th a t y o u have not yet received a reply to correspondence to Iain Sproat at the
D e p artm en t of N ational Heritage, about th e names of those comprising the
H illsb oro u gh Steering Group. I can o n ly suggest that you raise this matter w ith that
D e p artm en t once more. In the m eantime, I have arranged for a copy of this, and y ou r
correspondence, to be sent to Iain S p ro at’s Private Office for his information.

If there is any specific m atter you can identify which is for the H om e Office and which
has n o t already receive full consideration, I w ould of course be prepared to reconsider
y o u r request.

Dear

I enclose a copy o f a letter I have written to the Chief Constable following my intervention in
Parliament last Monday about the costs o f defending former Officers Duckenfield and Murray
out o f Police Authority budgets. (Copy o f Hansard attached)

I am aware that the questions are actually proper ones for the Authority to respond to and
should be grateful if you could let me know the answers.

I also attach a copy o f the response I received from Ian Daines to my initial query.

I am not very impressed by the arguments relating to Police morale, and the national interest
being damaged by the decision o f the Police Authority the other Friday to cease funding the
legal action. I will reply in full to the Chief Constable, but am not minded to support their
bid for Home Office funding for their High Court Action.

I am copying this correspondence to the Admin and Legal Department o f Sheffield City
Council, and to the Office o f Paul Boateng, Minister at the Home Office. .-


                                            Yours sincerely

Dear Miss Jackson

Hillsborough Stadium Disaster 1989

Last week I wrote to you and promised to write again after the Police Authority meeting on
5 February 1999. I am now able to provide a more detailed response to the points you
raised. It may help if I summarise some of the principal facts of the disaster. I will then go
on to make some observations about these specific private prosecutions and then make
some general observations on private prosecutions.

On 15 April 1989 an FA cup semi final football match was due to be played at the home of
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club; the Hillsborough Stadium. Liverpool and Nottingham
Forest were the two teams.

Overcrowding occurred in the areas behind the Liverpool goal in the period immediately
before and after the 3.00 pm kick off. The crowd crush caused the deaths of 96 spectators
(95 people died that day, one person lived in a vegetative state until his death in 1993).

The disaster happened in full view of over 50,000 spectators. It was transmitted, as it
unfolded, by BBC Television. It was recorded by the football club’s CCTV system and the
police CCTV system. Sports photographers took hundreds of still photographs. The
impact of the Hillsborough Disaster is unique because it was beamed live into the homes of
millions and was recorded so graphically.

Lord Justice Taylor was invited to conduct a public enquiry and the West Midlands Police
were commissioned to gather evidence. The Taylor enquiry considered 3,776 statements,
1,550 letters, 71 hours of video tape, hundreds of photographs and the personal and public
testimony of 174 witnesses. Taylor’s interim report (published 4 August 1989) analysed the
causes of the disaster and apportioned blame.

In March 1990 the West Midlands Police submitted a report to the Director of Public
Prosecutions (DPP). In August 1990, Mr Allan Green, then the DPP, concluded that there
should be no prosecution of any person for any matter arising from the disaster.

Between November 1990 and March 1991 the Sheffield Coroner and jury heard 230
witnesses. The jury returned verdicts of accidental death. In 1993, relatives of six of the
deceased applied to the High Court to quash the inquest verdict; the High Court turned
down the application. In December 1993, the West Yorkshire Coroner returned a verdict of
        al daaJte^ierfiSth victim who had recently died.

CONFIDENTIAL

In December 1996, Granada Television broadcast a drama programme titled,
“Hillsborough”. The drama purported to show the discovery of significant evidence which
had not been considered by previous enquiries. The Hillsborough Family Support Group
(HFSG) is an association of some of the relatives of some of the deceased. -They pressed
for a fresh enquiry into the disaster.

In June 1997, the Home Secretary announced the establishment of a scrutiny to look into
the reports that fresh and relevant evidence had been found. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, an
Appeal Court Judge, reported in February 1998. He found that there was no relevant
material which should be put before the DPP which might cause her to reconsider the
decision not to prosecute. The DPP, then Dame Barbara Mills, considered the position and
decided there should be no prosecutions. The Home Secretary, and other Government
Ministers, accepted Stuart-Smith’s findings.

In June 1998, the solicitor to the HFSG, Ms A Adlington, began a private prosecution at
Sefton (Merseyside) Magistrates against David Duckenfield and Bernard Murray. Mr
Duckenfield was a chief superintendent at the time of the disaster and was in charge of the
police operation. Mr Murray was a superintendent and was in charge of the control room
arrangements. They are each charged with the manslaughter of two named individuals
and with the criminal offence of, being a public servant, neglecting their duty (culpable
malfeasance in public office). Mr Duckenfield is also charged with attempting to pervert the
course of justice.

The Police Authority agreed to pay the costs incurred by Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray in
defending themselves against these private prosecutions.

Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray challenged the jurisdiction of Sefton Magistrates, the case
was withdrawn and Ms Adlington started them afresh at Leeds Magistrates.

The DPP has a legal right to intervene in a prosecution initiated by a private person. He
can take over the prosecution and pursue it or take it over and discontinue the prosecution.
Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray invited the DPP to take over the prosecution and discontinue
it. On 18 December 1998 the DPP, now Mr David Calvert-Smith, announced that he would
not intervene to continue or discontinue the prosecutions. If the DPP had been satisfied
that there was sufficient evidence to be confident of a conviction and that the public interest
required a prosecution, Mr Calvert-Smith would have been obliged to take over the
prosecution and conduct it through the Crown Prosecution Service.


Some Observations on the Private Prosecution

Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray have not been living abroad, they have not been in hiding;
they have been available for prosecution throughout the (nearly) ten years since the
disaster. One must therefore ponder why the private prosecutions were not started earlier.
                                            3




CONFIDENTIAL

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s scrutiny was established largely because of claims by the
Hillsborough Family Support Group (HFSG) that they had uncovered significant fresh
evidence. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith decided those claims were not accurate and referred
to some of their arguments as ‘irresponsible’. After his report was published, HFSG again
claimed to have uncovered fresh evidence.

After beginning the private prosecutions, Ms Adlington wrote to me to ask for copies of all
the witness statements. It is normal procedure to gather evidence before launching a
prosecution, not after. This leads me to conclude that HFSG do not have the relevant fresh
evidence they claim to have discovered.

Three Directors of Public Prosecutions (Mr Green, Dame Barbara Mills and Mr Calvert-
Smith) have each reviewed the case and decided not to prosecute.

The HFSG are not just conducting a prosecution against Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray,
they also lobbied the Authority to cease funding the cost of Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray’s
legal defence. Thus the HFSG are seeking to impose a financial penalty on Mr Duckenfield
and Mr Murray and to limit their ability to defend themselves.

Members of the HFSG have said that it is unfair that they have to struggle for funds while
Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray have access to the Authority’s funds. I do not know what
funds are held by HFSG or whether they publish accounts. In summer 1997 a pop concert
raised a reported £500,000 for their funds. It is incumbent upon the prosecutor to be in a
position to sustain the prosecution. Neither I or my legal advisors have before encountered
a case where a solicitor prosecuting a case has tried to influence the funding arrangements
for the defence. In her submission to the Authority, Ms Adlington made it clear that she
sought a revocation of funding in order to influence the defendants’ ability to defend
themselves.


General Observations on Private Prosecutions

Police officers have to make split second decisions which affect people’s liberty and even
their lives. Those decisions are open to challenge through the police complaints
procedure, action in the civil courts and action in the criminal courts.

Private individuals can initiate prosecutions, that is a valuable safeguard against official
inertia. The DPP can terminate a private prosecution, that is a valuable safeguard against
capricious prosecution.

Home Office Circulars offer Authorities guidance on how to deal with applications from
officers for funding to meet the cost of defence against a prosecution.
                                              4




CONFIDENTIAL
Some commentators have suggested that Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray’s costs are taking
funds away from the policing of South Yorkshire. In a superficial sense that is correct but
that is not a situation of their choosing. However at a more profound level the decision to
pay their costs sustains the morale of the Force and its efficient functioning. ■

I consider it vital to the morale and good management of the Force that officers should
know that, if they act in good faith when performing their dangerous duties, the Chief
Constable and all the Police Authority will do whatever it can to support them. If officers do
not have that confidence, they will push decisions up the rank structure, thereby delaying
resolution of problems and reducing the ability of managers to manage. In medical circles,
the fear of litigation is prompting talk of “defensive medicine”; using valuable resources to
eliminate every conceivable cause of illness. In policing terms, “defensive policing” would
mean that officers would be less inclined to make those necessary split second decisions of
life and liberty if they thought that, years after the event, after previous enquiries, they
might face the cost of defending themselves against the action of a private individual.

At it’s meeting on 5 February 1999 the Police Authority members received independent
legal advice to the effect that there was no power in law for them to fund the legal
expenses of police officers (serving or retired) who face private prosecutions. The Chief
Constable’s legal advice is that they do have such a power. Indeed, Home Office Circulars
offer guidance on how Police Authorities should exercise that power. This implies that the
Home Office accept that there is such a power.

The Chief Constable has received letters from the President of the Association of Chief
Police Officers, the Chairman of the Superintendents’ Association and the Secretary of the
Police Federation, all of which refer to the long standing understanding that Police
Authorities across the country have this power and have exercised it Because this is an
important matter of national interest highlighted by this specific case, the Chief Constable
has applied to the High Court for a legal determination of whether the power exists.
Unfortunately, this clarification of the power will itself involve substantial legal bills. The
Chief Constable will be writing to the Home Secretary to ask for central government funding
and any support you can offer would be much appreciated.

I hope this more detailed response provides a fuller picture than I was able to provide in the
limited time available last week.

Yours sincerely

         Dear

         Funding of the legal costs of former Police Officers, Duckenfield and
         Murray.

         I was most concerned to hear from my colleague, Maria Eagle about the potential cost
         to the Police Authority o f South Yorkshire Police’s intentions to start to fund the civil
         defence case o f former Police Officers, Duckenfield and Murray.

         I unfortunately only heard about it after we had our meeting in the Commons, and was
         sorry not to be able to talk directly to you.

         It does seem to me that it is hard to justify as one o f the Authority’s top priorities just
         now, when you are making some good efforts to build up community confidence in the
         Force.

         I understand from the newspapers that the decision is to be reviewed. I should be
         grateful if you could let me know exactly what the situation is and when a decision on
         this spending will be made.

      a) it is a Police Authority issue and they are advising the Authority
      b) the position is complicated in that there are 3 separate and different
          applications for financial assistance (this is probably not yet public
          knowledge)
      c) the position is changing all the time and the Secretariat have all the relevant
          information
      d) The Hillsborough Families Support Group (represented by Trevor Hicks) has
          asked to make representations to a special meeting of the Police Authority.
          This has been agreed.
      e) We are discussing privately with the Secretariat whether Sheffield members
          need to declare an interest

        In the circumstances I have agreed with Maureen Oades from the Joint
        Secretariat that the attached response is the most appropriate one.

        N.B. Dr Ed Walker treated patients at the Northern General Hospital on the day
        of the disaster. He has always been critical of a number of things, including the
        response of the emergency services. In the review of the tragedy, ordered by the
        Home Secretary Jack Straw, his evidence, together with the evidence of others,
        was included in the submissions. The particular submissions were found to be
        unfounded.

Dear Dr.

Thank you for your letter dated 23 December 1998.

The decision to underwrite legal costs in these circumstances is one that is made through the
South Yorkshire Police Authority and the South Yorkshire Joint Secretariat. I have therefore
spoken to the officer dealing with this matter and arranged to pass a copy of your letter to her
for a response. The Secretariat is in the best position to respond to the issues you raise.

Yours sincerely,




CHIEF EXECUTIVE

Dear Mr. Kerslake,                                                                       ^

    I should like to register my concern at the way some of South Yorkshire's council-tax-payers1
money is being spent. I was one o f them until last year. On February 27th 1998, at a meeting o f
the South Yorkshire Police Authority, it was resolved that defence costs in relation to private
prosecutions of South Yorkshire police officers that may arise out o f the Hillsborough football
stadium disaster would be met by the Authority, which is of course in turn funded by the people
of South Yorkshire.

    Private prosecutions have now begun against two of the police officers, David Duckenfield
and Bernard Murray. Both are retired. One was severely criticised by Lord Justice Taylor’s report
into the disaster, and also took early retirement on ill health grounds before he could face a
disciplinary investigation by the Police Complaints Authority. I understand that so far five hundred
thousand pounds has been set aside to cover defence costs, and no doubt more will be made
available if the need should arise.

       The former chief constable of South Yorkshire police, Richard Wells, was interviewed on
YTVs 'Calendar1on Wednesday 18th February 1998. This is a partial transcript:

       Mike Morris:       "Well if somebody has been to blame, who is that person?"

       Richard Wells:     "David Duckenfield has been blamed, by Lord Justice Taylor. The South
                          Yorkshire police are culpable, in the sense of, that they lost senior officer
                          control on the day. We've said that repeatedly."

       Assistant Chief Constable Daines argued nine days later that the officers involved had "acted
in good faith", and therefore the expenditure o f half a million pounds was justifiable.

       I am concerned that this is not a reasonable way to spend such a large sum of public money.
I welcome your comments. You may receive more than one copy o f this letter.

       Yours sincerely,                     \    ,/




                                                                                     Dr .

Stuart Webb has confirmed to Granada that they cannot have the art work for the crest for
the chairs to the Council Chamber. This is in the interests of accuracy because for the
duration of the inquest, plain black chairs were used and not the normal Council chairs.
Granada appear to be happy with this, given that their interest is in the accuracy of the
programme. I have also informed Phil Andrews of the position and Councillor Bower.

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS - HILLSBOROUGH

Please find attached a copy of an article which appeared in the Observer on
9th June, 1996.

Mr. Webster and Mr. G. MacKrell are aware of it's contents.

I believe the tone of the article casts severe doubts on the validity of the
claims by Granada Television that Mr. McGovern will write a balanced screen
drama documentary, as has been suggested.

You may wish to discuss the Council's further involvement with Granada with
the Leader. You know my opinion.

                             DRAFT HILLSBOROUGH LETTER

    Further to our brief telephone conversation o f yesterday afternoon and to your subsequent
    “memo”.

     Having now had an opportunity to consider the draft letter from a member o f your staff
    which is intended to be sent to the newspaper, in question,from her in her private capacity I
    would suggest only one alteration to the same. This would be to insert the word
    “relatively” in the seventh line o f the third paragraph as indicated in the copy which I now
    return. This suggestion is made on the basis that I believe that there was approximately 7
    years between the incidents there referred to.

    Otherwise I believe the communication is a measured response to an article that is anything
    but and one which brings into serious question the real aim and intent o f the proposed
    drama documentary.
In response to Jimmy McGovern’s article in last week’s Observer


I worked at the Medico-Legal Centre, containing the mortuary in Sheffield, in an
administrative role at the time o f the Hillsborough Disaster. My colleagues and I gave what
little help we could to those Liverpool families who came to identify their dead on the
Sunday after the disaster. The horror of what had happened and the agony and grief of those
families will remain with me for the rest of my life. In the course of my work at the Medico-
Legal Centre over the months and years which followed as the inquests were arranged and
held, I had cause to talk to many o f them and developed a deep respect for their courage and
dignity in the face of tragedy.
In some respects Jimmy McGovern is right and I sympathise with his sense of injustice on
behalf o f the families. The compensation payments to South Yorkshire Police Officers do
beg many questions. How can it be possible to compare the loss o f a child with the effects of
post traumatic stress syndrome? How can degrees o f suffering be quantified in financial
terms? What are the long term implications for the emergency services? But these are
matters o f law not of choice for those making the payments.
And yet I remain uneasy at his article for it does not give the whole picture. It does not take
into account my own experience o f the police officer crying down the phone begging me to
find out whether the fan he had tried to resuscitate was alive or dead. It does not take into
account the broken and traumatised officers whom I talked to when they came to the Centre
to be seen by the police surgeon in the months and years following the disaster. It does not
take into account the fact that poUc(epfficers made their fatal misjudgement of the situation at
the 1989 FA cup semi-final so£oon affer tne Heysel Stadium disaster where crowd
disturbances by Liverpool fans were said to be responsible for the deaths of supporters of the
opposing team. Finally it does not take into account the changes which have taken place at
Hillsborough as in every other football stadium in the country as a result of the
recommendations o f the Taylor Report and which I fervently hope will prevent such a
disaster ever happening again.
I write with some hesitation on so sensitive and painful a subject but feel that to make any
sense at all o f what happened requires a wider perspective than the one offered in last week's
article.
The need to find someone to blame following a disaster is understandable. Attempts to
understand why something as awful as this happened, take us into deeper questions about our
societies and our human failings and are deserving o f greater efforts to reflect whole rather
than partial truths.

                         DRAFT HILLSBOROUGH LETTER

Further to our brief telephone conversation o f yesterday afternoon and to your subsequent
“memo”.

 Having now had an opportunity to consider the draft letter from a member of your staff
which is intended to be sent to the newspaper, in question,from her in her private capacity I
would suggest only one alteration to the same. This would be to insert the word
“relatively” in the seventh line of the third paragraph as indicated in the copy which I now
return. This suggestion is made on the basis that I believe that there was approximately 7
years between the incidents there referred to.

Otherwise I believe the communication is a measured response to an article that is anything
but and one which brings into serious question the real aim and intent o f the proposed
drama documentary.
In response to Jimmy McGovern’s article in last week’s Observer


I worked at the Medico-Legal Centre, containing the mortuary in Sheffield, in an
administrative role at the time of the Hillsborough Disaster. My colleagues and I gave what
little help we could to those Liverpool families who came to identify their dead on the
Sunday after the disaster. The horror of what had happened and the agony and grief of those
families will remain with me for the rest of my life. In the course of my work at the Medico-
Legal Centre over the months and years which followed as the inquests were arranged and
held, I had cause to talk to many of them and developed a deep respect for their courage and
dignity in the face of tragedy.
In some respects Jimmy McGovern is right and I sympathise with his sense of injustice on
behalf of the families. The compensation payments to South Yorkshire Police Officers do
beg many questions. How can it be possible to compare the loss of a child with the effects of
post traumatic stress syndrome? How can degrees o f suffering be quantified in financial
terms? What are the long term implications for the emergency services? But these are
matters of law not of choice for those making the payments.
And yet I remain uneasy at his article for it does not give the whole picture. It does not take
into account my own experience of the police officer crying down the phone begging me to
find out whether the fan he had tried to resuscitate was alive or dead. It does not take into
account the broken and traumatised officers whom I talked to when they came to the Centre
to be seen by the police surgeon in the months and years following the disaster. It does not
take into account the fact that policepfficers made their fatal misjudgement o f the situation at
the 1989 FA cup semi-final so£oon afte?me Heysel Stadium disaster where crowd
disturbances by Liverpool fans were said to be responsible for the deaths of supporters of the
opposing team. Finally it does not take into account the changes which have taken place at
Hillsborough as in every other football stadium in the country as a result of the
recommendations of the Taylor Report and which I fervently hope will prevent such a
disaster ever happening again.
I write with some hesitation on so sensitive and painful a subject but feel that to make any
sense at all of what happened requires a wider perspective than the one offered in last week's
article.
The need to find someone to blame following a disaster is understandable. Attempts to
understand why something as awful as this happened, take us into deeper questions about our
societies and our human failings and are deserving o f greater efforts to reflect whole rather
than partial truths.

Dear David,
                              RESEARCH ON HILLSBOROUGH


I am sorry that our arrangements over Hillsborough have got o ff to a slightly unsatisfactory
start, but I believe we are all now clear on w hat the guidelines should be.


I am sure that w hat has been described as 'pestering' in Mark Webster's recent letter to you
is due to the misunderstanding over contact arrangements for which I am, in part at least,
responsible. I am sorry if this has caused you any embarrassment.


In the meantime, I can confirm that I have spoken to|_____________ pf Catering for
Sheffield, w ho is happy that you should contact her direct. She has undertaken to inform
her staff that they are free to speak to you if they wish, and that they will be under no
pressure should they decline to do so.


I am sure that we have both learned from the problems we have encountered this week and
that the arrangement will work much more smoothly in future.


Yours sincerely,




Philip Andrews

                     Dear Mr Price

                     RESEARCH O N HILLSBOROUGH

                     Further to the meeting which took place in my office on Wednesday, 28th February 1996
                     involving the Leader of the Council, myself, my Assistant Head of Department, David
                     Purchon and Phil Andrews and your colleague, Katy Jones, I believe that the Leader
                     made it perfectly plain that whilst the Authority w as w illing to supply pieces of
                     information that could be deemed to be in the public domain, the sole point of contact
                     between yourselves and the Council was to be Phil Andrews as the Head of Public
                     Relations. As you are aware, the circumstances surrounding the Hillsborough Disaster
                     have been investigated and documented through Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry, the
                     Inquests and Judicial Review.

(                    Si nce that meeting, there have apparently been two occasions w hen you have contacted
                     individuals within the organisation direct and, in their opinion, "pestered" them to
                     respond to your requests for information. Quite apart from the fact that such individuals
                     are extremely busy and may not in any event be able to give any priority to such
                     requests, this is directly contrary to the agreed position as per the above mentioned
                     meeting. I would inform you that unless you comply with the agreement reached at our
                     meeting then I w ill recommend to the Leader that all further co-operation by the
                     Authority be withdrawn.

                     I trust I have made the position clear but if you are in any doubt then please let me
                     know.

STRICTLY PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER 1989 - APPROACHES FROM GRANADA
TELEVISION

I thank you for your communication o f 5th March which crossed with mine o f a similar date which has
gone to all Chief Officers and Senior Chairs concerning the manner and mode o f the intended “co­
operation” between the Authority and the producers of the proposed drama/documentary.

In particular, I am able to assure you that the points concerning Council employees and the stress
problems that they suffered was clearly borne in mind by those involved in the discussion from the
Council side hence the requirement that the Company only access the Authority through Phil Andrews
as you will see from my communication (a copy o f which I attach) and which in particular, makes the
point that individuals are not required to co-operate or communicate in any way with the makers of
the programme and that the Council can and will support them in their decision not to be brought into
the issue.

Clearly, however, we need to ensure that this message is put across by departments to those that may
be contacted and any suggestions and ideas that you might have in ensuring that this is done would be
gratefully received.

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - GRANADA TELEVISION DRAMA
PRODUCTION

Further to my communication o f 18th January 1996 concerning the above matter in which I undertook
to write again informing you o f developments, the current position is that a meeting took place on
Wednesday, 28th February with Granada Television, involving the Leader o f the Council, myself and
other officers. Granada were represented at the meeting by David Price and Katy Jones who appeared
to be the individuals making enquiries o f officers within the organisation.

During the course o f the meeting, the Leader made it clear that the Council’s concern was o f the effect
on everyone, including staff.

For their part, the representatives of Granada indicated that they were interested factual information ie
in knowing where things were and how things were set out when the Inquiry and the Inquests were
dealt with in the Old Town Hall and the net result was that it was agreed that if they wished to make
enquiries o f the organisation, they must route those through Phil Andrews. Consideration will be
given to each request but to the extent that if information is publicly available then obviously that
information will be passed on. Accordingly, if approaches are made direct to anyone within your area
then they should be referred back through Phil Andrews before any response is made as the agreed
process.      ‘

Also, I would be grateful if you would make it clear to staff within your area that the Council’s
position is that no one is required to co-operate and if they do not wish to talk to Granada, they will be
supported in that stance by the Council.

Finally, you will note that I have copied this communication to Committee Chairs, some o f whom
were directly personally involved in the issue arid I therefore thought it appropriate that they be made
aware o f developments.

             We refer to your memorandum dated 18 January 1996. It is important that w hen the
             City Council is considering whether to co-operate with Granada that the risk to the

             A number of Council em ployees suffered ill health in the aftermath of the disaster
             and in the period that follow ed. It is our advice that there is a significant foreseeable
             risk that som e Council em ployees could suffer distress if the Council decides to
             co-operate and requires an individual to be involved. Such potential distress should
             be avoided if at all possible. Additionally, such distress could be worse if unsolicited
             and unsupported approaches were made direct to individuals.

                       The meeting referred to in the final paragraph of my letter of 6th February 1996 has now
                       taken place with Councillor Mike Bower and myself, David Purchon, Phil Andrews (PR
                       Unit) and Liz Bashforth. Granada being represented by David Price and Katy Jones.

                       They explained a little about the programme and what they wanted from the Council
                       and apparently, at the moment, all they appear to want is factual information about the
                       organisation of the Inquiry and the Inquest, eg which rooms were used, how the Council
                       Chamber was laid out, etc.

                       Councillor Bower made it clear that no individual would be required to co-operate or
                       contribute to the making of the programme which they appeared to accept They, for
                       their part, also made it clear that they were concerned to be as accurate as possible in
                       terms of every detail.

                       It was left that they w ould contact Phil Andrews as and when they required anything
                       and that he would liaise with Liz. Any requests would be considered on their merits
                       and on an individual basis.

                       Kind regards.

                       I know John Derricott has been keeping you informed on events in relation to the above
                       matter. I am writing to let you know that Councillor M Bower and Senior Officers
                       (Mark Webster, David Purchon, Phil Andrews (PR Unit) and myself) met with
                       David Price and Katy Jones from Granada on 28 February 1996.

                       They explained a little about the programme and what they wanted from the Council.
                       A t the moment all they appear to want is factual information about the organisation of
                       the Inquiry and the Inquest, eg which rooms were used, how the Council Chamber was
                       laid out, etc.

                       The Council made it clear that no individual would be required to co-operate or
    )                  contribute to the making of the programme which they appeared to accept They, for
                       their part, also made it clear that they were concerned to be as accurate as possible in
                       terms of every detail.

                       It was left that they would contact Phil Andrews as and when they require anything and
                       he w ill liaise with me. Any requests w ill be considered on their merits and on an
                       individual basis. If you have any concerns or queries please give me a ring.

                       Yours sincerely

  There was a general discussion about the sort of programme Granada were intending to
  produce which included their intention to recreate the Inquiry/Inquest so they might need a
  plan of the Town Hall for a set to be built They have been to the Medico-Legal Centre they
  wanted to get the detail right and the co-operation that they wanted from the Council was a
  response to factual questions and about staff. They have already had talks with the
( )Ambulance Service and former Police Officers. The programme would be written from the
  view of two families. They already have copies of the major statements and the transcripts
  from the Inquest and Inquiry. "There is a lot of public information around about this
  disaster". Mike Bower said that the Council's concern was the effect of the programme on
  everyone, including staff. The Council w ill co-operate to the extent of the information that is
  publicly available. If individuals w ish to talk to the producers they w ill not be stopped but
  no-one w ill be required to co-operate. At the end of the meeting they asked to see the
  Council Chamber and then came back to ask where the Coroner and Lord Justice Taylor had
  operated from (ie the Ante Room). They also wanted to know where people were sitting and
  they wanted to know what rooms had been made available for the families and the press,
  etc. They also wanted to know what facilities had been available in terms of refreshments.

    They also wanted information about the counselling that had been provided. Mark is to
    speak to Martin Manby about that They said that it was very important to them that
    everything in the programme, whether visual or spoken, was based on fact and could be
    cross-referenced to evidence. They also asked if Mark and I had been involved at the time.

    EB has briefed David Bownes and John Derricott

    MW to write to Richard Wells to keep him informed.

    EB to write to Arthur Butler to keep him informed.

                       O N THE HILLSBOROUGH TRAGEDY

                       Further to earlier correspondence in connection with this matter in which I undertook to
                       keep you informed of all developments, I w ould inform you that first of all, I have had
                       to circulate all Council staff with a memorandum asking them not to respond to
                       enquiries being made by researchers acting on behalf of the above mentioned
                       programme as it came to light that they were approaching individual employees in
                       advance of the meeting with the Council regarding co-operation on their work.

                       In addition, they have also approached as part of that process, the Council's Archive
                       Service, first of all to access Radio Sheffield tapes of the actual day of the incident which
                       are the property of Radio Sheffield and which are merely held in storage by Archives.
                       Accordingly, they have therefore been referred to Radio Sheffield as to whether or not
                       they should be allowed access. Secondly, to obtain the Coroner's videos, ie videos
                       relating to the Inquest/Inquiry which are not available for general public without the
                       consent of the Coroner for 75 years. In any event, immediately prior to this approach
                       through the Archives, the current Coroner, Chris Dorries, withdrew the tapes from the
                       Archives Section. Thirdly, they have now made a request to see all newspapers
                       currently in the Archive Section.

                       The meeting with the Company's representatives and Council Members and officers was
                       scheduled for Monday, 5th February but unfortunately, this had to be cancelled due to
                       other requirements. It has been re-arranged for Wednesday, 28th February.

                       Kind regards,

  G RANADA TELEVISION - DRAMA DOCUMENTARY - HILLSBOROUGH
) DISASTER

    I thought it might be useful to let you have brief details of recent approaches by Granada
    Television.

    1       I enclose a copy of a letter dated 12 December 1995, the contents of which are self
             explanatory. Granada also approached Sheffield City Hall for information. Such
             informal approaches are being discouraged on the basis that until the Council has
             taken a decision as to whether or not to co-operate with Granada then no response
             w ill be given to these approaches. In any event, it would seem more appropriate on
             the Council's part to have some common contact point to co-ordinate the Council's
             response.

    2       Radio Sheffield lodged certain cassette tapes of broadcasts at the time of the
             Hillsborough Disaster with Sheffield Archives. Radio Sheffield has given permission
i           for those tapes to be released to Granada Television and appropriate arrangements
             are being made through Sheffield Archives.

    3       Granada approached Sheffield Archives asking to be allowed access to the videos of
            the Disaster Inquiry/Inquest. Those records were deposited by the Coroner's Office
            and are deemed to be public records,,and subject to closure periods laid down in the
            Public Records Act, ie 75 year closure. The Coroner alone can grant permission for
            the material to be viewed. However, those records have in fact been withdrawn by
            the Coroner's Office from Sheffield Archives (on the same day as Granada Television
            m ade the enquiry).

Dear

Following our phone conversation here is an outline of our task and the way you could
perhaps be of important assistance to us.

We are in the early stages of researching a drama documentary based on the aftermath
of the Hillsborough Disaster.

It will be a two hour factual drama written by the award winning, Jimmy McGovern,
the creator of ‘Cracker’ and it is due to be screened either late Autumn 1996 or early
Spring ‘97.

All the main organisations concerned have promised assistance in the making of the
film and we have contacted all the bereaved families who have given unqualified
support to the project.

Jimmy McGovern will begin writing the drama in the new year and professional actors
will play the characters involved in the aftermath It is proposed that there will be
several scenes which will concern the lengthy inquest which, as you know, was held at
the City Hall.

These scenes will include members of the families talking in the VIP lounge which was
used as the canteen. This will obviously concern some of your past staff who got to
know some of the families during the lengthy proceedings.

Which is why I am trying to trace those who served in the canteen around the time of
March 1991, first to inform them as a matter o f courtesy that they may be portrayed on
television, secondly to try and get actors who bear a resemblance to them and also to
ask for their recollections of the time.

Any assistance you - and they - can give would be most welcome.

Yours sjtKerely

Thank you for your memorandum dated 31 January 1996.

The Public Relations XJnit will be contacting you direct with the letter from Radio Sheffield
which has been passed on to us by Granada Television. As discussed, you should deal with
that in the usual w ay which will probably involve contacting Radio Sheffield and asking
them to collect the tapes.

I would also like to thank you for the way in which you and your staff have handled these
queries to date. I was very pleased that the "message had got through" to staff at
appropriate levels to enable them to respond to the telephone calls and enquiries they have
received.

No doubt w e w ill be in contact again if anything further arises.

  URGENT

  HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER 1989 - APPROACHES FROM GRANADA
  TELEVISION

  It has just come to my attention that Granada Television have made approaches to certain members of
i staff regarding their contribution to a proposed drama/documentary on the Hillsborough disaster to be
  produced by Granada.

  Would you please take immediate steps to inform all staff within your department that at the present
  time, they should not agree to take part in such programme nor make any contribution whatsoever. I
  would, however, be grateful to receive details in writing of the type and nature o f any approach made
  by the Company.

  Sheffield City Council has not made a decision on whether to co-operate with Granada but will be
  meeting representatives of the Company shortly and I will write to you again following such meeting
  to let you know the outcome. Until such time, and in view o f the sensitive nature of this subject,
  please ensure all staff are made aware o f this communication as soon as possible.

     Dear Richard

     Thank you for your letter dated 22 December 1995.

     Like yourself I have severe doubts about the motives behind the Granada
     documentary/drama. In fact, in earlier correspondence, I made the initial observation
     that Mr McGovern’s opinions of Hillsborough are well documented and I would
     question any such balance.

     Out of courtesy, however, I had a meeting with Granada who have offered to write
     me a formal letter setting out the basis on how such a programme would be
     produced.

     This is still awaited but I can assure you that I will make no decision without
     discussing the matter with you and my initial reaction still stands that such a
     programme is best avoided.

     Yours sincerely

                    Police concern over plans fo r Hillsborough drama


South Yorkshire Police have been approached by Granada Television, asking for co­
operation in their making of a two-hour drama documentary about the aftermath of the
Hillsborough disaster.


The author of the drama documentary is to be Jimmy McGovern, who writes the popular
"Cracker” series, one episode of which featured the Hillsborough disaster.


After a meeting before Christmas with Granada representatives, attended by serving
officers of the South Yorkshire Police and representatives of the force's Occupational
Health Unit, both past and present, the Chief Constable decided that the force will not
co-operate with the making of the programme.


"This is against our normal policy of openness with the media and I want to explain why
I have taken this decision," said Mr Wells.


"Best medical advice tells me that the screening of dramatic incidents can trigger, in the
minds of those affected by the trauma - whether families, friends, members of the
emergency services or simply onlookers - serious emotional reactions. These reactions
will range from various anxiety states to a virtual reliving of the events and all the
implications of such an experience.


"This leads me to the belief that there can be only two beneficiaries of such a
programme: the television company and the author. Though it is said that the bereaved
families unanimously support the making of the programme, the professional advice I
am given suggests that they may be unaware of the longer-lasting and negative effects
of what they are entering into."

                    Another reason for the force deciding not to endorse the programme comes from a
'"V\                "rrooi'ec" episode from the same author, which gave rise to doubts about Jimmy
                              s ability to see the aftermath of Hillsborough with a sense of objectivity and
                              the force complaining to Granada at the time.


                            Wells: "A further complementary objection lies in the fact that the events of the
                          ve already been exposed to a number of judicial processes, none of which has
                                 ldusive agreement on even all the facts, let alone the many theories
                          from those facts. A two-hour drama-documentary, however balanced the authors

Granada Television Documentary/Drama production on the Hillsborough Tragedy

In common with yourselves, I have recently been approached by Granada Television who have
commissioned Jimmy McGovern (the author of the books upon which the 'Cracker' television
series were based) to write a drama/documentary dealing with the aftermath of the 1989
Hillsborough tragedy.

I had a meeting with the Production Team yesterday together with a number o f South
Yorkshire Police staff in an attempt to establish what exactly defines the genre
'drama/documentary', what was meant by Granada's claim to "strictly factual" drama and what
support was sought for the programme from the South Yorkshire Police.

The team intend to conduct research with a large number of those who were involved with,
and affected by, the tragedy with particular emphasis upon the view of the relations o f those
who died. On the basis of the material obtained by this process McGovern will write the
piece, which will probably be screened some time in the Spring of 1997. My suspicion is that
the 15 March anniversary, or close to it, will be favoured by Granada. The Granada team
sought my support in allowing access to South Yorkshire Police officers who were involved
and to statements obtained in the aftermath of the tragedy.

The view we expressed to Granada at the meeting was that the weight of medical opinion
suggested that people who suffered from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder would all find such a
programme to be both distressing and disturbing and that, therefore, no possible good could
accrue to anyone involved with the tragedy as a result of the programme being made. The
sole benefit would be to Granada and to Mr McGovern. Moreover, one of Jimmy
McGovern's previous books was dramatised in a 'Cracker' episode which dealt with the
murderous effects of the tragedy on a Liverpudlian man, and suggests that the author is
unlikely to produce an objective account o f any aspect of the tragedy.

As a result, the South Yorkshire Police have taken the unusual step for an organisation which
prefers and promotes openness and have withheld co-operation from the programme makers.
I thought that you should be aware of our decision as well as the fact that we have referred
Granada to several other independent sources of advice on the likely effects of the
programme.

Thank you very much indeed for your thoughtful letter of 28 November about the
'Hillsborough' drama/documentary by Granada.

I attach a copy of my reply to Granada's invitation.

'Help' at this stage means only meeting them for preliminary discussions on
20 December at 2.30 pm. We are still a long way off co-operation, which is dimly
viewed in our organisation as a prospect for doing anything other than fuelling the
continued grief of the bereaved families and enhancing Granada's ratings. Leslie Sharp
is not minded to help and Ken Threlfall of SYMAPS has adopted the same line as
ourselves.

We will, likewise, keep you informed.

DRAMA-DOCUMENTARY - HILLSBOROUGH

Thank you very much for your letter of 30 October to which I'm now able to turn after a week
away at Conference.

You will probably not be surprised when I start by saying that, after our episode with Jimmy
McGovern and the Hillsborough theme on "Cracker", we are not bouncing with optimism
about the "strictly factual" treatment which you envisage. As an armchair critic, I am not even
sure how drama can be strictly factual.

However, we do have substantial facts at our disposal and we have two options: keep them
from you and let you portray something hopelessly inaccurate or provide what we can and
leave choice amongst those facts to Jimmy McGovern's dramatic creativity. It seems a stark
choice.

However, we are resolved to help.

Please contact our Private Office on 0114 2523401 and arrange the meeting you suggest. I
will make arrangements for at least one middle-ranking commander to be present, a counsellor
from our Occupational Health Unit and a senior representative from our Complaints and
Discipline Department, who handled the post-Disaster legal proceedings.

Leslie Sharp, the Chief Constable of Strathclyde, is just into his final weeks before retiring.
You might consider it prudent to see whether he would want to speak about the investigation
as part of the "aftermath" or put you in touch with one of his senior investigators. I am
sending a copy of this to Leslie to alert him to my suggestion.

I await further contact about our meeting.

For your information I have informally contacted Mr. A. Butler [Retired
Building Surveyor] and Dr. Eastwood. Both appreciated being informed and
confirmed that if they were approached were likely to refer any researchers to
the club or the city council. Both felt that the time had come, if only for
the sake of he families,, to let the matter rest.

I said I would keep them informed.

I have spoken to Alan Frith and Dennis Fogg about the proposal. Both have
confirmed that they will refer any enquiry to the city Solicitor or myself.

I understand from Mr. Mackrell that the club are not happy at the prospect; do
not feel that Mr. McGovern can give a balanced view, and are placing what
pressure they can on the company to drop the project.

Liz knows my feelings on the subject. I don't believe such a programme serves
any constructive purpose and will only cause pain to the families and friends
of those who lost their lives.

                           for the co-operation of the Service to ensure the factual content o f the proposal.

                           Miss Jones has a number o f questions on which she requires points of clarification.

Dear Mrs Gordon,

Granada television is in the early stages o f preparation for a drama/documentary based
on the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster.

The two hour programme will be strictly factual and it will be written by the dramatist,
Jimmy McGovern. It is intended for screening Autumn 1996 or Spring 1997.

A great deal o f research will be involved in the project and we are writing to you first
as a matter of courtesy and also to solicit your co-operation with the project.

All the bereaved families involved with Hillsborough have been contacted and notified
o f our intentions. Mr. McGovern, myself and my colleague Katy Jones recently
attended a meeting o f the Hillsborough Family Support Group who have given their
support to the project.
                                                                                                                        H &
A similar meeting with you would be most welcome.
                                                                                                                         0
Your comments on the matter would be greatly appreciated.


Yours faithfully

COMMENTS BY MR. B. CLOUGH, TELEVISION INTERVIEW
SUNDAY llTH DECEMBER, 1994


On 11th December, 1994 Yorkshire Television broadcast an interview with Mr.
Clough.

Part of the interview made reference to the Hillsborough Disaster which as you
know he makes reference to in his autobiography.

Mr. Clough referred to the fact that the disaster, in his opinion, would not
have happened if a certain section of Liverpool fans had turned up at the
ground well in advance and all with tickets.

Mr. Clough also made reference to reports of Liverpool fans leaving Public
Houses just prior to the start of the match.

He also commented that in his opinion some good, in the form of better stadia,
had come from the tragedy, although he did say that improvements were not
happening quickly enough.

His comments were restricted to about 2 to 3 minutes of air time.

Note from Mr. W. J. Derricott to Mrs. E. Bashforth,
Mr. M. Webster and Mr. A. Eaton____________________



       Safety of Sports Grounds - Hillsborough stadium
        Channel 4 Programme "Dispatches". 9.00 p.m.. 12th October, 1994



I refer to my conversation with Mrs. Bashforth on 11th      October,      1994,
concerning the above programme which looks at the safe      operation     of several
football stadia, including the Hillsborough stadium.

I have not seen the tape of the programme as it is held by the Sheffield Stax,
Mr. Simon Smith, and felt that to request to see the tape would probably draw
a need to comment on its content.

Sheffield Wednesday have however seen the tape and commented to the Sheffield
Star. Dr. Eastwood has also viewed the tape and commented to the Star.

Apparently, the Channel 4 Programme "Journalist" finds three "faults" at the
Hillsborough Stadium:-

1.    West Stand (Leppings Lane end) - Provision of concertina gates contrary
      to Taylor Recommendations. These gates do not form part of the exit
      calculations for the Ground but are opened at the end of a match to ease
      egress. The gates are used on match days by mounted Police Officers,
      Police and other emergency services vehicles if required, and club
      personnel. On a non-match day, the access route.is retained for service
       vehicles. This was specifically requested by the Club and agreed by the
      Advisory Group at the time the proposal was considered toreshape the
       Leppings Lane end of the stadium.

      THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEM WITH THE RETENTION OF THESE GATES; THEY
      ARE STEWARDED ON MATCH DAYS AND INDEED SEVERAL POLICE OFFICERS ARE
      USUALLY AVAILABLE IN THIS AREA, GIVEN ITS PROXIMITY TO THE POLICE
      CONTROL ROOM.

2.    South Stand lateral gangway and refreshment area - This gangway
       separated the old covered stand from the uncovered stand. As you are
       aware, the Stand is approximately 100 years old and following the
       removal of the roof, which was required by the Council, the gangway was
       retained until the remainder of the stand was redeveloped. The proposal
       before the Council for full redevelopment of the south stand removes the
       lateral gangway and the refreshment area. The gangway itself vaxies in
       width due to buttresses which protrude into -the length of the gangway at
       approximately 15 points. At these points the gangway-width varied
       between 1,020 millimetres to 1,060, slightly under the 1.1
       Recommendation of the Green Guide, but acceptable to the South Yorkshire
       Fire service in view of the substantial upgrading of the Stand and
       importantly the ability to move every person that sits in the stand
       forward on to the pitch.
                                       - 2 -




3.       Unmanned Exit Gate - Probably in the West Stand. It appears that a
         camera still is taken of an unmanned exit gate on a match day. This is
         a concern, but as you are aware, final exit gates are now operated on a
         push bar to open mechanism and can easily be opened by any member of the
         public in an emergency. The need for a Steward is primarily for
     ■                                                             v*s&m£tftna •■^eaad
         then opening the doors to allow other people to enter without paying.
         The programme does not indicate when the camera still is taken. I am
         informed by Dr. Eastwood that it is likely to have been taken well
         before the start of the match when only a handful of the public were in
         the Ground due to the lack of spectators crossing the field of camera
         vision.

The club have commented to the programme makers and to the Sheffield Star and
Dr. Eastwood has commented to the Sheffield Star. It would appear that the
Star is taking a fairly sensible line and trying to defuse the sensationalism
of the programme.

I have informed the Council Leader's Secretary of the programme and Councillor
Pat Midgley. Councillor Midgley has asked that I phone her on Thursday
morning following the programme.

I have informed the Department of Environmental Services and Standards, and
asked that Mr. Frith, Mr. McGrogan and Mr. Purchon, be appraised of the
programme. I have also informed the South Yorkshire Fire Service. I see no
reason to contact the South Yorkshire Ambulance Service or the Building
Surveyor at this time.

I have also spoken to Mr. Wilson, Football Licensing Authority, who wasaware
of the programme. The FLA are not pleased by the programme content.

From what I have been told, the programme does not focus on any of the safety
improvements that have taken place at both Sheffield Wednesday and Sheffield
United, and merely tries, in a very uninformed way, to sensationalise a very
serious subject.

If you need any further information, please give me a ring.

HILLSBOROUGH JUDICIAL REVIEW

Chris Dorries, the current Coroner, has asked me to pass on his thanks to the
team who worked on the Judicial Review case for the hard work and effort that
was put in. He is obviously pleased and relieved at the outcome of the case.

I would also like to add my personal thanks for the professional, effective
and caring way in which you dealt with the matter in very difficult
circumstances.

It is very much appreciated.

Dear Sir,

In the High Court of Justice Queens Bench Division
In the Matter of an Application for Judicial Review
Regina and Her Majesty's Coroner for South Yorkshire
Ex Parte Stringer and Others________________________

I act on behalf of Sheffield City Council in the above case which concluded in
Court 26 of the Supreme Courts of Justice on Friday 5th November 1993.

At the end of this case it was noted that any appeal against the verdict would
have to be made within the following 7 days.

It is important therefore that I receive as soon as possible 4 copies of the
transcript of the judgment and the summing up relating to the verdict in this
case.

I thank you in anticipation of an early receipt of these, should*you require
any further information do not hesitate to contact the undersigned on the
telephone number given below.

Yours faithfully




City solicitor and

I enclose copies of recent correspondence with Mrs stringer and Mr Glover.

The Coroner, Chris Dorries, asked me to respond to the parents through their
Solicitors from this office or to ensure that the Police responded again to
their Solicitors.

I understand from the Coroner that the post-mortem photographs weren't put in
in evidence to the Inquest and therefore they are not the property of the
Coroner. Previously I understand the Police haven't agreed to the photographs
being released but the Coroner suggested I contact Chief Superintendent John
Lowe of South Yorkshire Police. As you will see, I wrote to him initially
about Paul William Carlisle but assumed the same would apply to Ian Thomas
Glover, whilst I was on leave Chief superintendent Lowe had asked for a copy
of Mrs stringer's letter to be sent to him and this was done.

I have since tried to contact Chief Superintendent Lowe to make sure that he
is aware that there is more than one request and to discuss theresponse with
him so that we are aware of what is happening.

In Chief superintendents absence I have spoken to PC K Greenway today. He
has confirmed that the police hold copyright of the photographs, they are not
in the public domain and south Yorkshire Police have made a policy decision
not to disclose the post-mortem photographs to families or their
representatives. Each case is considered individually against the policy
decision.

This position needs to be borne in mind with regard to the Judicial Review.

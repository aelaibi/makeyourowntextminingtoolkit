a P.C.         They managed               to     revive          him     tw i c e .       T he      lad     vomitted           in      the

Sergeants          face.         Two      friends           of    t hi s       young      lad w e r e          at    his      f ee t     and

they     clapped         when       they        thought          when      he     w as    revived.              The      crowd         having

observed         this,        all    seemed          to     clap,        thinking             t ha t     the    officers            had      been

successful.              He    was       l a te r     put      on a s t r e t c h e r          and       taken       across         the

                        Throughout             the        incident,           I could           see     many       bodies          being       carried           over

                        At     about      half          past      three       I observed              the     Notts         Forest           fans    suddenly

HILLSBOROUGH WRITS




We can confirm that writs                on behalf of South Yorkshire police officers were

issued on Monday afternoon against the Chief Constable, Richard Wells.




The writs      are    in   respect of      the     shock       and      stress           suffered by officers who

dealt with the Hillsborough disaster in April                                 1989 and this action has been

taken on their behalf by solicitors representing the Police Federation.




South Yorkshire Police intends to defend this action.




The Chief Constable has already gone on record expressing his disappointment

that   some    officers      feel    the    need    to     pursue          claims.                  "There    are well-tried

avenues in the South Yorkshire Police for helping officers to overcome grief

and mental      anguish      and I'll do all         I can personally to help them and their

families      to     recover.       An     expression           of       some         understanding                and   shared

responsibilities           from Merseyside         to match           our      own       expression           of    sorrow and

shared   liability         would    be   enormously        helpful.                But      meanwhile,             I think   the

claims   are    as much      symbolic      - a bid        for mental                suffering            to   be recognised

- as about search for compensation".

            SUBJECT:   HILLSBOROUGH - PRESS STATEMENT




            CONFIDENTIAL




            Following the tragedy at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989, representatives of
            the deceased and persons injured have understandably been actively pursuing
            claims for compensation against Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, Sheffield
            City Council, Eastwood & Partners and ourselves.-

            After protracted consultations with our lawyers they have now advised that
            the best way forward, without making any admission of liability, is to offer
            an out-of-court settlement and this will be done at 2.30 pm today
            (30.11.89).

             The advantages of this course of action are that it avoids the necessity of
             anyone - spectators or police officers - experiencing the trauma of re­
             living the event through involvement at a trial.   Furthermore, a number of
             people in genuine need of compensation will receive it much earlier than
             would otherwise be the case.

             The civil case was likely to-take place in advance of any criminal
             proceedings against anyone arising out of the events at Hillsborough.  Had
             this occurred a number of police witnesses, acting on legal advice, would in
             all probability have declined to give evidence on the grounds of possible
             self-incrimination.  The South Yorkshire Police would therefore have
             unnecessarily appeared evasive and the civil hearing been unduly prejudiced
             because of the lack of information forthcoming from those witnesses.
             Furthermore, any findings of liability may have been prejudicial to officers
             concerned in the criminal enquiry.

             I have agreed therefore to accept the legal advice given to me and to settle
             out-of-court.  Details of the press statement I have issued relative to this
             are attached hereto.

             It is essential that all members of the Force, particularly those directly
             involved at Hillsborough, understand what is occurring and why and I would
             appreciate it if you could cause this information to be disseminated
             throughout your Division without delay.  The official representatives of
             both the Federation and the Superintendents' Association have been informed
             of the above.

PRESS STATEMENT OF THE CHIEF CONSTABLE




              EMBARGOED UNTIL 2.30 PM, THURSDAY 30 NOVEMBER 1989



It has been decided by the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire and the South
Yorkshire Police Authority, in conjunction with their insurers, Municipal
Mutual Insurance, that those bereaved and injured in the tragic events at
Hillsborough stadium on 15 April should not have to await the outcome of a
further lengthy hearing in 1990 before receiving      compensation.

In the circumstances, the Chief Constable, in conjunction with his insurers,
intends to open negotiations with the aim of resolving all bona fide claims
against him for compensation arising out of the Hillsborough disaster.

The other parties presently named as Defendants in the civil proceedings
arising out of the Hillsborough tragedy, namely, Sheffield Wednesday Football
Club, Eastwood & Partners, and Sheffield City Council, have been offered the
opportunity of joining in the course of action now taken on behalf of the
South Yorkshire Police, but have refused to do so.  It is the intention of the
Chief Constable and his insurers to pursue legal action against those parties
to recover moneys paid out to the claimants pursuant to today's offer.

CONTRIBUTION PROCEEDINGS IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUSTICE 2 TO 8 OCTOBER 1990
BETWEEN    THE    CHIEF   CONSTABLE    OF   SOUTH    YORKSHIRE    POLICE
SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB PLC AND EASTWOOD & PARTNERS IN THE
MATTER OF THE DISASTER AT HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM

I refer to our telephone conversation of last Friday and to the evidence in chief of Noel Burne
given in the above proceedings on Friday 5 October 1990, a transcript of which I have forwarded
to you under separate cover. Reference is made in this evidence to a report prepared by
Mr Burne for the above trial and circulated to the parties in the proceedings. I have not seen, nor
do I have a copy of, this report, and this letter is based on my reading a transcript of the first four
days of the above proceedings.

 I came to look at the transcript of the proceedings as a result of reading a copy of a letter from
Mr Brian Alderman of the South Yorkshire Police Authority to Lord Justice Stuart Smith dated
25 November 1997 relating to civil claims arising from the Hillsborough Disaster. In particular, the
fourth paragraph of the letter at the top of page two, when I learnt that the football club and
Eastwoods had made a payment of £3 million and Sheffield City Council £1 million to relieve
them of any liabilities arising from the disaster. I subsequently realised that at the time this offer
was made in December 1990 the total estimated liability arising from the Hillsborough Disaster
was between £7 and £8 million and that the three parties had between them contributed over
50% of the then known liability. I therefore read the transcript of the proceedings to determine
how this came about.

On the fourth day of the proceedings Mr Noel Burne gave oral evidence on a considerable
number of points concerning the layout and structures at the Leppings Lane end of the
Hillsborough Stadium. Some of these had been covered in Lord Justice Taylor's Interim Report
to a greater or lesser extent. One point in particular that I do not believe was considered by
Lord Justice Taylor, nor by the Inquests, was the height of the crush barriers in pens 3 and 4 of
the Leppings Lane Terraces. The recommended height of the top rails of the crush barriers from
the nose of the step immediately behind the barrier is 1.02 metres to 1.12 metres (between 3 feet
4 inches and 3 feet 8 inches). Mr Burne found that the majority of barriers in pens 3 and 4 were
below this height. In pen 3, barriers 124a, 125, 136 and 136a were below the recommended
height, whilst in pen 4 it was barriers 125, 127, 128 137 and 138. I have illustrated this on plan
C275 (a copy of which you have) by appropriately numbering all the barriers and high-lighting
those below height. Mr Burne's oral evidence does not give an actual height for the various
barriers apart from 124a, which varied from .83 to .86 of a metre along its length (approximately
2 feet 10 inches) and was the lowest barrier on the terrace. His report is said to contain a table
of the heights of all the barriers.

Mr Burne then went on to describe the consequences of the barriers being below the
recommended height and this is made clear on pages 69 and 70 of the transcript of his evidence,
without my repeating it here. It was immediately following this that the proceedings were halted
and subsequent agreement reached between the parties.

I am unable to find reference to the height of the barriers in the Taylor Report, nor do I believe it
to have been an issue at the Inquests. I would therefore wish to bring to the attention of
Lord Justice Stuart-Smith the existence of Mr Noel Burne's report and for its contents to be
considered as part of the Scrutiny being conducted by him. I believe you will be able to obtain a
copy of the report from Mr Peter Metcalf, solicitor of Hammond Suddards, Leeds.

I have briefed my Assistant Chief Constable, Ian Daines, on the above and made the
Chief Constable, Richard Wells, aware. Both are in agreement with my writing to bring this
matter to attention.

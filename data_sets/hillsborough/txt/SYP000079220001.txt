queues          at     the       turnstiles                 j u st    one       mass     of      thousands           of    people            milling

about.            At      t h is      stage,           I saw a            few P o l i c e        on f o o t    and a few more                       on

horseback,                but      I don't             remember            seeing        any        stewards.             My    ticket            was

for       gate       ,!B"    and        I was          looking            for    section            " B !i, but      the       queues            were        so

big       and     section             "A"       was     smaller            so    I chanced              it a n d w e n t        for      section              "

A"     to      try     to    get        in a n y w a y .             I made          my way         eventually            to    the      front           of

turnstile              "A",        after         about         ten minu tes              and        presented         my       ticket.              The

man       at    the       turnstile              said         to me        at    first         t hat     !'I c o u l d n ’t come                 in"     and

 "You       will       have        to      go     to    g ate        B",       but    all      the      fans    behind          me    w ere

shouting             to     let       me     in a n d         after        a    few    seconds           the   man        let    me       in.          At

this        stage         I had         l os t       contact          with my          two       friends,           who    I had         travelled

down        with and             we     had made              arrangements               to m e e t        after      the       g am e       in the

same        pub as          we     knew         we     would         get       split     up.         Just      before          1 went            through

the       turnstile,               I d i d n ’t see              any       gates       open,         but    I saw a            large         portion

of     the      crowd        rush          to     one       side,         but    I c o u l d n ’t see          where           they      were

going.

Once        through          the        turnstile              I made           my    way with           the    rest       of    the         crowd

around          the       side        of     the       stand         and       into    an      enclosed         pen,       pen 6         I

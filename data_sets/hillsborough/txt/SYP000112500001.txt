much     so       that       myself       and       other       plain          clothes         officers          were    moved         on

Nevertheless                 the    situation             was       still       orderly         at    this       time.        1 moved

the      broken                 white             line       is m a r k e d      on L e p p i n g s          Lane       prior        to       entering

which            numbered                    4 were          proving        ineffective                    and were          having           difficulty'

in m o v i n g                in       the        crowd.         We       were     Joined           by DS M c S l o y              and other

of     being                 involved              in    pickpocket              offences.                  Together           with       DS M cSloy

a n d DC           Locking                   I walked           along       Leppings              Lane       towards           Wadsley          Bridge       in

an     effort                 to        locate          the     2 suspects.                  As     we      moved along              the       road    there

and      quite                orderly.                  We    turned        at     Law       Brothers             garage           and    walked       back

towards                  the         ground         amongst           a    constant           stream             of L i v e r p o o l         supporters

wh o     filled                 half          of    the       roadway         as    well          as       the    footpath,               I was       asked

about            'tickets                   all    along        the       return      journey               to    the     ground          always       the

As     we        approached                       the    ground           I heard        a    siren          from       behind           and    on

looking                  round              I saw       the    P o l i ce     short          wheel          based       Landrover

at    that        en d      of t h e     ground.               The     situation                was    by    now      desperate              with

fans       climbing           onto       the       tops        of    the        turnstiles             and     then      pulling             up

others          to     escape       the       crushing              below.

Still        large          contingents                of    supporters               continued             to a r r i v e        at    the

Iain William Askew     Detective Constable 1209   Hammerton Road Police Station


I am a detective constable in the South Yorkshire Police presently stationed at
Hammerton Hoad Police Station,Hillsborough,Sheffield.
I have 8 and a half years service and during this time I have policed a large number of
football matches at Hillsborough in both uniform gnd plain clothes.Whilst in uniform
the majority of my duties at Hillsborough vpre at the Leppings Lane end involved in
various dufciefil including coach reception^turnstiles, and general public order patrols,
I worked last years semi final at Hillsborough between the Liverpool and Nottingham
clubs in plain clothes and experienced no problems.I have always piided mjjrself on the
positive and well run policing operations at HUlsboruogh which without doubt made it
one of the best grounds in the country fo£ football fans to attend and enjoy a trouble
free match.


At 8.30am on Saturday 15th April 1989 I signed on duty at Hammerton Road Police Station
CUD office.My duty at the match was to be in plain clothed working under DS McSloy
and Det Xnsp Towell on the    pick pocket squad,this tour of duty was to commence at 9am.
This scjj^td had been set up in an effort to identify and catch persons, believed travelling
Liverpool fans,who were responsible for pick pocket offences.Therftwere a large number
of complaints        from supporters at the previous semi final in 1988, relating to
pickpocket offences.
On arrival at the station I was informed that a prisoner I had circulated as wanted
had been arrested and required intervieweing.I liased with the custody officer and
DI Towell after which I attended the match briefing at Hillsborough with other CID *
officers. The briefing was much the same as the previous year with no significant
alterations.After the briefing I returned directljr to Hammerton Road Police Station
and dealt with my prisoner completing my dealing with him at 1 .30pm the same date after
which I walked alone to Hillsbofcough football groun<S intending to met up with DI Towell>
DS McSloy and other CID personel wofcking the pickpocket operation.


The walk to the ground along Middlewood Road and down lappings Lane went peacefully
enough put I noticed a large queue of fans outside Threshers Off Licence near
Hillsborough c o m e r on Middlewood Road and as I continued up   theRoad althoughthere
was a good Police pfcescence along the route there were a large number of fans I passed
and observed in the Park carrying and drinking from beer cans, usually they were in
possession of packs of four cans,they were all good natured and no signs of trouble was
apparent.In Hillsborough park nearer to the Leppings lane end I did see half a dozen
fans urinating in full view of the public obvoiusly well the      worse for drink.lt was
hard to determine from which city they hailed*


I continued down Leppings Lane and met up with DI Towell, DS McSloy and other officers
namely DCs Hallam^Locking,Lawrence and Lilley.I moved into a position near the gates
to the turnstiles where with the other officers I kejb£ in close contact with DC Hai iam ■
* who was stood alone with a large wallet in his rear trouser pocket acting as bait for

 the pickpockets who we expected to be in the area.I would estimate that the time would be
 1«50pm.^he crowd       in the Leppings Lane area at this time appeared orderly and officers
 on duty were managing to Police the sitation effectively,even so (I appreciate that these
 observations are made in hindsight but from past experiences I felt this at the time)
 I thought th&t the Police resorces on the Leppings Lane end of the ground were sparse
 and I would have thought more mounted officers should have been available in the area.
 As time went by the crowd gradually grew in density within the turnstile anea and
 up to the roadway.^he mounted officers were doing everything possible to keep the crowd
 moving so much so that rayself and other plain clothes officers were moved on repeatedly*
 Nevertheless     the situation was still orderly at this time.I moved into a position inside
 the small protected area caused by the groundgates being in the fully opeh position
 from where I could clearly see DC Hallam and not get moved about by the growd.Whilst
 stood in this position I recall being pushed and watching three Liverpool fans urinate
 up the dividing fencing between those fans queuing for the West Stand and those for :
 the Leppings Lane end.I would estimate that the time would be 2«20pm at this time and I
 thought this is getting a bit congested and I moved from this position to outside the
 gates.From this point onwards the situation outside the ground seemed to steadily
 increase in intensity and deterriate.I was repeatedly asked by Liverpool fans if I      had
 tickets for sale.I then witnessed fans walking towards me with their tickets in their
 hands in readyness to enter the ground when other Liverpool fans moved up to them and
 snatched the tickets out of their hands which resulted in a confrontation after which the
 ticets were returned.The time now would be approximately 2 .25pm and after talking to
 DC Hallam I voiced the opinion that the operation regarding pickpockets was impossible
 in such a dense crowd and we withdrew to a position where the broken white line is marked
 on Leppings Lane prior to entering the ground area.Gn standing there and watching the
 situation it was obvious that we had    problems   regarding the croud control.The horsed
 which numbered k were proving ineffective and were having difficulty in moving in the
 crowd.We were joined by DS McSloy and other officers after which DS McSloy mentioned 2
 persons whom he suspected of being involved in pickpocket offences.Together with DS McSlo;
 and DC Locking I walked along Leppings Lane towards V/adsley Bridge in an effoaet to
 locate the 2 suspects.As we moved along the road there were a large number of fans
 walking towards the ground many were drinking from cans and they all appeared merry and ii
 good spirits and quite orderly.We turned at Law Mothers garage and walked back towards
 the ground amongst a constant stream of Liverpool supporters who filled half of the roadwe
 way as well as the footpath.I was asked about tickets all along the return journey
 to the ground always the same "Have you any tickets for the game" always delivered in a
 scouse accent.
 As we approached the ground     I heard a siren from behind and on looking round I saw the
 Police short wheel based landrover approaching with its headlights illuminated my instant
 thought was relief that at last a senior officer was arriving to sort the situation out.

The landrover pulled up outside the Leppings Lane end facing into the crowd./Myself
DS McSloy and DC locking went and stood nearby and to my amazement the only occupant in
the vehicle was PC Mick Buxton the officer who usually drove the officer incharge usually
the Chief Superintendent around.PC Buxton alighted from the vehicle and delivered a
massage over the PA system attached to the vehicle requesting the liverpool fans to
move J>ack and stop   crushing at the front,This was repeated numerous times and appeared t-
have no effect whatsoever on the crowd.At this time I remember stopping an elderly man
who passed me as I stood beside the landrover telling him to stay out and not to go
anyfurther into the crowd trying to get into the ground he just looked at me and carried
on pushing into the crowd infront of me.The time now would be about 2 .^5pm and without
doubt the situation was well out of control the monnted police officers who still to my
amazement only numbered h    were hard pressed to stay on thiir horses.I was also suprised
to observe that no extra officers had been drafted into the area to assist with crowd
control.The PA system was later taken over by an Inspector who repeated the message
PC Buxton had been saying,at this time I also recall seeing Chief Inspector Creaser
from South Yorkshire beside the landrover I didnt see any other higher ranking officer
at that end of the ground. The situation was by now depperate with fans clittnbing onto th
tops of the turnstiles and then pulling up othersto escape the crushing below.
Still large contingents of supporters continued to arrive at the ground in large numbers
and confirmed to swell the crowd outside the ground,some had the good sense to walk over
the road and stand on the footpath but these numbered only a few dozen the rest continued
to try to get into the ground.lt was also apparent that not all had tickets for the
match as myself and other plain clothes officers continued to be asked had we tickets for
the match. The time now would be nearing the kickoff and the situation outside the ground
at Leppings Lane was serious,no support had arrived and DSMcSloy decided that we would be
better utilised elsewhere and we made our way via Vere Road to the gymnasium.As we v/alked
down Vere Road a large cheer went up from the ground and fans in Vere Road began to run
past us toward.s the Leppings Lane end of the ground. On arrival at the Gym I got somethin;
to eat and sat down with other CID officers inside the Gym,almost as soon as I had sat
down reports began to come into the Gym that people had been killed inside the ground
after which the first body arrived in the g^m,which was a young boy.I was ordered with
certain other officers to remain inside the gym.
I began to check the boy for any signs of life and almost immediately Iwas surrounded by.
uniform officers who were all bringing people who were dead and .injured into the gym
                                                      Me dLec&tsecL
area.From then on I was involved in the laying out off/and looking after the i r
personal effects and lates making the bodies presentable for identification and actaally
paricipating in some of the identifications by relatives and friends.

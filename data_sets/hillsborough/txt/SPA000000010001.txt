Dear Member
I have no doubt that you will have been as shocked as I was by the tragedy at
Hillsborough on Saturday. I enclose a copy of the press statement I have made
available on behalf of the Authority expressing our sorrow and concern.
The role of the Police Authority at this juncture is of course extremely
limited. Nonetheless the Chief Constable has expressed a wish to make a formal
report to the full Authority and I have therefore agreed that a special meeting
should be held before the start of this Friday’s Finance and General Purposes
Committee meeting. A copy of a formal notice is enclosed.
You will appreciate that the Chief Constable’s report can only be of a very
restricted nature because of the establishment of the public enquiry which was
announced this afternoon by the Home Secretary.
Yours sincerely

      JACK

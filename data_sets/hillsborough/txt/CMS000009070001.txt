          Dear

          Thank you for your recent letter to the Prime Minister
          which has been passed to this department in view of our
          responsibilities for the Safety of Sports Grounds Act. I
          apologise for the delay in replying to you.

          Thank you for submitting you rplan for the redevelopment of
          football grounds. Your view that all seated accommodation at
          football grounds is not essential to solve the problems of
          crowd safety and control has been noted. However, it is a
          view which the government does not share and which does not
          equate with the views expressed by Lord Justice Taylor in his
          Final Report on the Hillsborough Stadium disaster. He
          recognised that there was no single solution to achieve total
          safety and cure all the problems of crowd control. However,
          he was satisfied that seating does more to achieve these
          objectives than any other single measure. Furthermore this is
          in line with the policies of both FIFA and UEFA.

                                                                          Yours sincerely


                                                                                        5    ■

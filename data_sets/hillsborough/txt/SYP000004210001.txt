               this      I broadcasted                 by       x o u d h a i 1e r to           the     crowd       and    asked          for    calm and

                             co-operation              so       that       matters          be    resolved.               The       broadcast             had

               the    immediate               effect        of       quietening             things          down and           so    I determined

               that      I would           broadcast             to     the      S pion H o p a n d            spectators             in the          rest       of

  i/v/v i t h e       ground            because        I believe                at   t hi s      stage        nothing          had    been       said

      1     - sibout the               match    being           abandoned            and        1 had       a fear        of    p a ni c       and

               potential               problems        resulting                from     people          leaving          the       ground.           I

               therefore               broadcasted              to    spectators                along       the     Spion       Kop and          North

               clearly            been     casualties                and    that       we       were     working          under       extremely

               difficult               circumstances                 and    requesting                the     co-operation                of    spectators

               to    remain where               t h e y w e re.             I also          advised           t hat      there       would       be

               spectators               who    would        not       be a b l e       to       he ar    this       message          clearly

               because            of    the    limitations                 of    the     loudhailer                and    requested             that

               supporters               who    had     heard          it    relay        the m e s s a g e          to    those       behind          who

               would         not       have    heard        it.         Every        broadcast              was     followed          by a p p l a u s e

               both     from Notts              Forest           supporters              in the          Sp io n Kop and Live rpo ol

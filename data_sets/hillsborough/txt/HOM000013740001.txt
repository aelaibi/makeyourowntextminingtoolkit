HILLSBOROUGH:     PAYMENT OF SPECIAL GRANT



As you will know, Mr Addison and I met with representatives
from the South Yorkshire and West Midlands police authorities
on Thursday last to discuss the reimbursement of West Midlands
costs in the Hillsborough investigations.          I will let you have
a copy of the minutes when they have been finalised but in the
meantime I wanted to let you know that the West Midlands
representatives estimate that the costs falling in this
financial year as a result of their assisting South Yorkshire
with Lord Justice Taylor's enquiry plus the complaints and
discipline cases, coroners inquests and now criminal
investigations will amount to around £5m.          Costs to date are
£1.996m to mid August and there will be someincrease in
activity due to the criminal investigation.


2.   I should be grateful therefore if your division would
include an amount in your bids for supplementary funds to
cover this expenditure when you write to the Treasury shortly.
You will need to bid for 51% grant up to £1.3m and 90% grant
above that threshold for invoices up to £4,927,000.
Thereafter we will pay 100%.     We will therefore need about £4m
in the supplementary estimate to cover our additional
payments.     Mr Nagler's note of 25 August to Mr Boys Smith
refers to the amounts involved.

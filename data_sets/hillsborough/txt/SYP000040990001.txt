   Dear Sir

   Further to my telephone conversation of 16 October 1989 with your Deputy Mr
   Hewitt concerning the re interviewing/showing of video and photographic
   evidence to individual firemen for the purpose of trying to establish
   continuity within the ground of a number of those people that died in the
   Hillsborough Disaster on 15 April 1989.

   Enclosed please find a list of those firemen that we would like to see together
   with their Fire Stations according to our records.

   Subject to your agreement I would propose that my Inspector Layton, who is in
   charge of the video and photographic unit dealing with the Hillsborough
   Disaster, contacts one of your staff who could act as a liaison officer, with a
   view to arranging mutually convenient times and dates for your firemen to be
   seen.

   Given their present level of commitment I anticipate Inspector Layton and his
   team will be in a position to start this aspect of our enquiry some time during
   the week commencing 23 October 1989, if this is convenient to you.

   May I take this opportunity of thanking you for your co-operation and
   assistance in this matter. If you have any queries please do not hesitate to
   contact me at Nechells Green Police Station.

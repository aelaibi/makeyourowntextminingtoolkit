              I am a single man and I reside at the above address.



             On Saturday April          15 1989 (150489)         together with fifteen other mates

              I travelled to Hillsborough to see Liverpool                 play against Notts Forest

              in the FA Cup semi-final.               We travelled in a convoy of three

              cars.      I ’ve got                        and I had six lads in mine including

             myself.          It was an indepdently organised trip that we sorted out

             ourselves.         Through a friend of my w i f e ’s I was given two tickets for

              the West Stand.          On the way to the game we stopped at Hartshead Moor

             Services on the M62 for about ten minutes.                    This was a break to use

              the toilets there.              We left home at about ten o ’clock        (1000)   in the

             morning and we got to Sheffield by half past eleven                              o I cannot

              say we suffered any travel delays at all.                   When wj/arriS^ed        the
                                                                          PAGE      2

    area of the ground we went   into a pub but it was too full so we walked
                                                 V      7*"
    a short way and found another one that w|is 4 pen.      There were other
                    ---------------------------- “ T ------
    fans in the pubs having a pint as well. ^ I cannot remember where we

    parked but it was within half a mile from the ground.          We did not get

    escorted either from the car to the pub or from the pub to the ground.

    There was certainly no disorder or drunkeness.        Everyone was just

    joking and singing and having a laugh.      We got to the entrance to the

    ground in Leppings Ln at about twenty to three      (1440).      I still had

    my two West Stand tickets so I wanted to swap one for two standing

    terrace tickets for two lads who travelled with our sixteen without

    tickets.      I managed this without too much problem.        I remember that

    out of t he sixteen of us,   three h a d n ’t got tickets but I knew later

    that everyone ended up with tickets.

                               (
                               I
    T/iere was an absolute mass of people outside the ground when we
    /            ■ '-    ■■■■■     .
    /
/arrived.
f                 There was no queues or anything like that.       The crowd was

    so big that they even spilled out onto Leppings Ln itself outside the

    blue gates.



    I joined in the mass of people at about ten to three       (1450) and was

    really badly crushed and pushed around.       It was ridiculous because

    everyone was stuck    in the small yard area between the blue gates and

    the turnstiles.      I ended up next to a police horse and was really
                                          t             /
    crushed up against    it.    I think 1/saw ^bout three mounted police

    officers at this point but tjfiey jpa^really yfst control of the crowd

    by this time. There was not King they co u l]/fl io or say to help.     I

    eventually squeezed into one of the turnstiles and gave my stand

    ticket into the gateman.      Before I got into the yard between the blue

    gates and the turnstiles     I had walked all around the ground trying to

    find the entrance to the West Stand but could n’t because until you
                                                                                 PAGE        3
                                                                                 S 1651

were almost          in the ground there were no signs.



On entering the ground at about three o ’clock                (1500)   I did not see any

gates open other than the turnstiles and I did not see anyone open any

gates.


 C /V T    t Pis/>
I did see people!                     over the top of the turnstiles to get       into

the ground       but I»could see that they had got           tickets because they

showed one       of the mounted bobbies that all they were doing was             getting

out of the       crush.       A couple got in this way       but the policeman   made

others get       back down.



By the time          I got into the ground it was       three o ’clock   (1500) and all

I wanted to          do was watch the game.      I had a ticket for the seats          but

at that late stage I c o u ldn ’t be bothered to go and find it.                 I

thought that perhaps at half time I could go and find it but at the

time    I just       wanted to get    into the game. Just    inside the turnstiles

in the yard          area Imet two mates who     had    travelled in our convoy.

They were                                                   We ran up to the tunnel

leading to the l/eppj/fig/ Ln             nding area and went     into the tunnel.

U w a s p a c k e d M /£he liwfmel at this stage and I almost            immediately

lost sight of them.             I got i n t o Pen 3 a nd it was absolutely chocca

block full of people.                I just thought at the time all the jostling

was    people trying to get settled down into a good spec,                but I soon

realised that the crush was more than I have ever experienced on the

Kop or anywhere.



There were,          to my recollection no pol i cey<!)f f i cers or stewards at the

mouth of the tunnel or in the t u n nel . /            I dicj) np^T^ee anyjrrte fighting

or any drunken people.

When I got into the Pen 3 I stood against the back wall but then

shortly afterwards moved forwards to a position I consider to be

pretty well    central   in that pen.



The crush was terrible,       I cannot describe how tight             it was.     I ended

up standing with a crash                        front of me and my left arm was
                   f
pinned to the barrier,                   us no way I could help myself to move

either my arm or my body to prevent the injury to my arm,



Whilst    I was stuck in this position I saw people grown men being given

the kiss of life on the pitch and I realised how serious things were.

I do remember the players going off the pitch but d o n ’t recall anymore

after that.     I d o n ’t know if I lost c o jr€ c iou/n§.»-s'‘> r    not but I think

thats    possible because my arm was pinned againsVLjay I'ibs and I was

having trouble breathing.



I d o n ’t know how I got out of the o-f'ound but I next recall being on

                                                  two lads I know from

Anfield.      I think I was (crying and they took me to a telephone and I

phoned home.



Soon after that I made my way                to where we had parked the cars and

eventually met up with all t                r I^ds except one,            Peter
                                            —T"----L ,.~
McDonnell.       M S '8 3 \ ^ > O O V    O' O



I h a d n ’t seen Peter since we walked down to the ground and no one else

had seen him either.        We waited until six o ’clock (1800) and decided

to tour the police stations and hospitals.                We all thought he had

been arrested at first but the police could not help us at all.

                                                                                SI 651



    We had no luck at the hospital so we eventually travelled home.                  I

    found out from P e t e r ’s family on the Sunday afternoon that Peter had

    died.      Throughout the whole day I did not see anything          I consider to

    be a criminal offence.



    I feel that the design of the entrance to the ground in Leppings Ln

    was bad, to have all those turnstiles for all those parts of the

    ground in such a small           confined space is terrible.     I t ’s no wonder

    that there were problems before the game started.              When I returned




    I feel that as football supj/rters we are all herded around and

    treated as the lowest of^Che low.                   In my view drink was not a

    contributory factor              thi* disaster.     The police were wrong to

A   insist on us^, t h e y O v e r p ^ o l      going in via Leppings Ln just

    because of tn ^ / q e ography^of the ground.          We have been to grounds and



    ticket allocation was wrong as well.              The FA should have taken into

    account our average gate and catered for the numbers we took.

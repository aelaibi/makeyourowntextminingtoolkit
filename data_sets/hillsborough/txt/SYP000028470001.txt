   Accident and Emergency Department                                      ,

   15th June, 1989




   Dear Colleague,

   As you may know, the West Midlands Police are investigating the incident
   at Hillsborough Stadium on the 15th April 1989.     One arm of the investigation
   concerns the Coroner and he is especially interested in the patients who were
   brought to the Accident and Emergency Department of the Northern General
   Hospital and have subsequently died.   I have provided an over used statement
   of the situation but the Coroner would like much more detail on the
   activities in the Resuscitation Room on that day.   I have therefore provided
   the Police with a list of people involved in the Accident and Emergency
   Department.

   You may therefore be asked for a statement by West Midlands Police. 5
   There may be difficulties in patient identification but all the available
   information on patients is housed with!                      |in the Medical
   Records Office.

   I have contacted the Solicitors acting for the Health Authority in this
   matter and they have advised that if you have any reservations regarding
   these statements, you contact them before speaking to the Police.

   The»Solicitors concerned are Oxley & Coward, address - 275 Glossop Road,
   Sheffield S10 2HB. T e l e D h o n e No. 727485 and the person dealing with this
   matter is


   Yours sincerely,




   J. WARDROPE
   Consultant in Accident and Emergency Medicine.

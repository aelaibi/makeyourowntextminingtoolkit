the •p a r t i c u l a r      area         l aid      out       in the      operation             order.

On S at ur da y,           i5 A p r i l         1989       I commenced           duty        at 9 . 0 0 a m at             the N i a g a r a

stables.             I intended             meeting             officers        who were              attending            on a m u t u a l

aid      basis       from     other         for c e s .          On a r r i v a l      at    Niagara             1 saw         that

Superintendent                Marsh         was       already          in a t t e n d a n c e         there         and    since        I had

to a t t e n d       the    briefing             at H i l l s b o r o u g h      at     9.45          am    1 left         Niagara          at      9.


and made          my w a y       to    the       ground.              On a r ri v al        at    the       ground         I drew

a   r ad i o    and went          to       the N o r t h         Stand where            the       briefing            c o m m e n c e d at

10.00am.             Following             the       briefing          refreshments               were        available            and

serials         were       instructed                to    be    in    position         by       11.00am..            Having          had

something            to    eat    a n d a drin k,                I went        out     into       the       street         on     the

Penistone            Road     s ide        of    the       ground        just    before           11.00am.                My    in i t i a l

pat r o l      was    around          the       triangle          area where            I noticed                that      all     officers

and      barriers          were       in    position.                 I had a        short        conversation                  with       each

pair      of    constables             as       1' w a l k e d     round       t his    area and was                  satisfied             that

it w a s .p r o p e r l y        contained.                 I continued              and walked               out     into        the

Catchbar          Lane      and       then M idd le woo d               Road     area where                 I saw         t hat    officers

were      deployed          on    their          patrols          and     it w a s      at       this       time      that        I noticed

t h at    the     Park      Hotel          on .W a d s ley ..Lane w a s              obviously              closed         and     the

windows         boarded          up.        I took          particular           notice           of       t h is    because          at    the

Semi-Final            1988       I had          to    close       these        premises           at 2 . 1 5 p m          following

trouble         with       persons          drinking             therein,            I then walk ed                  back       along       the

length         of L e p p i n g s      Lane          to    the    traffic        roundabout                 end,      again        seeing

t h at    officers          were       deployed             on    their        patrols           as    required            and     I spent

s o me    time       at    that       end       considering              the    segregation                 of      supporters             after

the      match.           This    proved             to    be    somewhat        problematic                  last        year     when

large       numbers         of    people             left       the    ground        because           opposing            fans"

the    closest            points       that         the two          opposing           sides       come        together,             Last

year,       I had         had    to      d e p l o y a large           cordon across                  the       r oad    here        to

ensure       that         segregation,               and     I spent              some       time w o n d e r i n g          how     this

could       be a c h i e v e d       t h is    year.

During       my    initial           walk      round         there          were        supporters              already         about       but

there       were     not       that      m a n y.       1 am          not     aware       what        t im e     the     turnstiles               at

Leppings          Lane      actually           ope n e d ,            I rec a l l         from      the     briefing            that       s om e

gates       were     to     be      opened        at    "M.QQam             but      t hat      the      majority            were     to    be

o p e n e d at     12     noon.

As    the    morning           progressed              I patrolled                 on     foot      in the         area       I have

previously           described              but     I did            not     go    r i g ht     down       to    the     Hillsborough

shopping          precinct,            having          had a s h o r t             conversation with                     1           ctor

As    the     pedestrian             traffic           increased:,                and     particularly               with       the

weather        being        good       at     the      time,          groups         of    people          were      making          their

At    about         1 „ 3 0 pm      I walked             along       Leppings          Lane       w h i c h was       very        busy       on

both         sides       of    the       road w i th           pedestrian             traffic        a n d as         I passed          the

Leppings            Lane       end       I saw       that          it w a s     very     busy.         I remember                stopping

there a         few m o m e n t s             and    seeing          mounted          officers         encouraging                p eop l e       to

enter         the    ground          or       to    c l ear        away    from       the    rear      pen       if   they        were       not

ticket         holders.              I then wal ked                  out      into     Middlewood             Road where               it was

again         fairly          busy,       Liverpool                supporters          being       encouraged               to    park

their         cars       in t h a t       area,          particularly              in s id e       roads.

I recalled               t h at     the       one    special           train      expected           was      due      to a r r i v e        at

intending            to       go    to    the       traffic:          island      end       and    observe            the    movement              of

spectators               with       regard          to    segregation.                 As     1 walked           f r o m Cat chbar

Lane         I saw       that       the       area       around        the      bridge        over     the       r iv e r    was       vjh ^


busy         indeed       with       people          and       that       the    Leppings          Lane       enclosure            was

similarly            extremely                busy al tho ug h             apparently             under       control.             I

    continued        along          Leppings             Lane       which       was    also       extremely            busy       toward

the      traffic          island          end.           As    I approached              the      traffic         island          I s.?w the

front         end    of       the    escorted             f ans      who      I as sum ed were              the       occupants           of

the      special          trai n .            They       were       being       escorted          by m o u n t e d         officers,

fo o t       officers,             and    I saw at             l east      one     dog      van.       T he      majority          of     t h e se

people         appeared             confined             to    the     footpath          and      there       was      a    considerable

number         of    them,           1 arrived                at    the    traffic          island         end    of L e p p i n g s         Lane

and      saw    t hat         there       were       no       difficulties             regarding            segregation                and     I

remained            at    t hat      t r a f f i c .i s l a n d        for      some. time.

l't is        difficult             to    be       precise          but    I think          it w o u l d      be a p p r o a c h i n g

    had an a l t e r c a t i o n          with a driver                    who       had      driven       at      speed        through

    persons        crossing             the    road w hil e            sounding               his     horn      but      making        no

    but    in no u n c e r t a i n            t e r m s a n d as           he    set       off      he was         in f a c t       the     f i rst

    vehicle        to      be    denied        access           to L e p p i n g s         L a ne .       Still       being         busy with

    pedestrian             traffic        but .with a p p a r e n t l y                 no     threat         of    segregation

    problems,           I left          the    traffic           island          end       of L e p p i n g s       Lane        and    started

    was    walking          along        it w a s        fairly        evident             to me        that       the     persons

    approaching             the     ground were                 those       who       had      either         been       to     licensed

    premises          or    had     stayed away                 from       the       ground         in o t h e r      places          drinking

    because        the      proportion              of     peop l e        who       I would          describe           as     boisterous

    through        drink         seemed        to     h ave      significantly                   increased.                As    1 neared

    the L e p p i n g s         Lane     end     of      the     ground          1 could            see    that       the       number       of

    people       waiting           to    enter        the       ground          had     increased             sign if ic an tl y and

    now    stretched             certainly            to       the    roadway           of L e p p i n g s         Lane       but     I do       not

    not    in the          middle        of    the       road.         1 could             see      mounted         officers           among

    the    crowd and             from     where          I was        standing,               although          the      crowd        was    very

sort    of    public             order        pro b l e m .         I then        heard a message                on m y            radio        to

the    effect          that       no     further             persons       were        to    be a l l o w e d    into          the        ground

difficulty             and alterc ation with                         people        arriving             late w h o        were        ticket

holders.           However,              I was          able,       using        these       officers,          to    hold          the      rear

of L e p p i n g s      Lane          fairly        sterile.              There        were       still       quite       a    large

number       of    people             out     in L e p p i n g s         Lane     itself.           While       holding             the      rear

of L e p p i n g s      Lane          outside           the    ground        other          officers          began       to       turn      up

presumably             in    response              to    the    radio        message.              After       some       few m i nu t es

Superintendent                   Marshall           returned             to m y    position             and    having          had a

short     conversation with                         h i m we        estimated           that       we    had    s ome         40    or     so

use    his    radio          to a s k         control          where       these        officers          could       be       best

deployed          but       he    received              no    reply.         In v i e w       of    this       inability              to

communicate             he       instructed              me    to    go    personally              to    the    control             box     and

advise       regarding                th e    situation             in L e p p i n g s       La n e .     I entered                the

numerous          people          together              with    police           officers          in t ha t     open          area

I continued             towards              the    control          room        and    climbed          the    stairs.               On

what     appeared             to    be    numerous             casualties.                 I entered           the       control           box

with        an     incident            of       these          proportions               that      he a n d       Ic o u l d p e r h a p s

He    agreed       and      left       the       ground             almost         immediately               en    route for          HQ.           I

went        to     find S u p e r i n t e n d e n t                 M a r s h a l l to   see       if    I could           be r e l e a s e d .

The    situation            in L e p p i n g s            Lane        was     contained            at    this        tim e     and     I found

to    be    released            from       d u t y at          the      ground.           I left         the      ground and              picked

up m y      private        motor           vehicle             and      drove       to HQ.           Due to          traffic

conditions             I did         not    arrive             at    HQ     u nt i l     s ome     t ime      j ust       before       6.00pm.

I went       to    the     Force           Operations                Room        and     together          with

Anderson          we    discussed               the       requirements                 and    together            went       through           the

On Saturday,                15 A p r i l           1989       I commenced            d u t y at 9 . 0 0 a m         at    the      Niagara

stables.            I intended meeting                            officers         who     were       attending           on a mutual

aid       basis     from          other       forces.               On arrival           at N i a g a r a      i saw        t hat

Superintendent                    M a r s h was          already          in a t t e n d a n c e      there        and     since         I had

to a t t e n d      the       briefing              at    Hillsborough                at 9 . 4 5 a m         I l eft       Niagara           at 9 . 3


and       made    my        way     to      the     ground.              On ar ri va l         at    the     ground        I drew

a     radio      and        went       to    the N o r t h          Stand      where       the       briefing        commenced               at

10.00am.               Following             the     briefing             refreshments               were     available            and

serials          were        instructed              to        be   in    position         by       11.00am.         Having            had

something              to    eat a n d            a drink,           I went       out      into       the    street        on      the

Penistone              Road       side        of    the        ground        j ust     before         11.00am.            My      initial

 patrol          was    around           the       triangle            area      where         I noticed          that      a n     officers

 and       barriers          were        in       position.              i haa a short                conversation with                      e ach

 pair       of    constables                 as    I walked            round       t his       area and       was        satisfied            tnai

 it w a s        properly           contained.                    I continued and walked                       out       i n to    the

 Catchbar          Lane       and        then M m a l e w o o d              Road      area         where     I saw       that      officers

 were       deployed          on t h e i r           patrols           and    it w a s         at    th is   time        that      I noticed

 that       the     Park      Hotel           on W a d s ley L a n e             was     obviously            closed        anu        bhe

 windows          boarded              up.         I took         particular           notice         of     this    because           at      the

 Semi-Final             1986           I had        to    close         these      premises           at 2 . 1 5 p m       fonowiny

 trouble          with        persons              drinking            therein.          I then walk ed              back         along        the

    length       of L e p p i n g s          Lane        to    the      traffic        roundabout             end,       again         seeing

    that    officers              were       deployed             on    their        patrols         as     required        anc        I spen t

    some    time       at     that          en c    considering              ihe      segregation             of    supporters               aft e r

    the    match.           This         proved          to    be.somewhat              problematic            last        year        when

    large     numbers             of     people          l ef t     the    ground        because            opposing           fans*

    coaches       are        often          parked        in the          Herries        Road        area     and    this         is     one      of
                                                                                                                                    PAGE
                                                                                                                                    R77

the    closest        points          that      the       two     opposing            sides      come       together.               Last

year,       I had     had       to    deploy         a    large        cordon across              the        road       here       to

ensure       that     segregation,                and         I spent        some       t ime    wondering              how       t his

could       be a c h i e v e d       t hi s    y e ar.

During       my    initial           walk      round          there     were      supporters                already          about        but

there       were     not     that       many.            I am     not       aware       what     t ime       the       turnstiles              at

Leppings          Lane     actually            opened.                I recall        from      the      briefing            that        some

qates       were     to    be     opened        at       11.00am         but     that      the     majority                were     to    be

opened       at    12 noon.

As    the    morning            progressed            I patrolled               on f o o t      in the           area       I h a ve

previously           described            but        I did       not     go     right       down       to    the       Hillsborough

shopping          precinct,             having        had a short               conversation                with       Inspector

Humphries          who      stated        that        things           were     relatively             quiet          at    t hat    end.

Pedestrian            traffic           in the        Middiewood               Road/i_ep p i n g s          t_a ne/ P e n i s Cone

Road     area        gradually            increased              as    t ime    went      by     particularly                 with        the

 commencement,             of     the     arrival           of    coaches         which         were     initially                parked        in

Claywheels            Lane       and      then       l a ter      directed            to H a l i f a x      Road        for       parking.

As     the     pedestrian             traffic            increased,            an d    particularly                with       the

weather           being      g o o d at        the       time,        groups      of     people        were        making          the i r

way     to     the    ground          while      others           were      sitting           on w a i l s       or     standing           in

 groups        on s p ar e        land and           a significant                number         of    these          were        drinking

 alcohol          from     t i ns     and      l a rge        plastic       botties.             i myseif             advisea

 numerous          people         t hat       they       would        not   be a l l o w e d      to     take         aicohol            into

 the    ground        nor w o u l d           they       De a d m i t t e d      if t h e y      were        crunk         and      i hear d

 other       officers           regularly            advising           peo p l e       the     same.            I am      satisified

 that       officers         on      patrol       in      the     areas        were      paying        active           attention              to

 the    crowds        as     they       built        up.         With       regard       to     the    behaviour              of     the

 Liverpool           f ans      as    they a p p r o a c h e d           the     ground,         i would              describe           it as

 boisterous           but       there         were       no    outbreaks          that        I saw         of    public          order

 problems          although            1 do     recall           hearing         transmissions                   on    the    r a uxo

regarding          trouble        at     the    Fox        Public       House       on F o x h i l l        R o ad.

At    about     1„30pm          I walked           along       Leppings          Lane     w h i c h was        very         busy     on

both    sides       of     the    road       with         pedestrian          traffic        a n d as         I passed             the

Lepoings        Lane       end    I saw        that        it w a s      very     busy.         I remember                  stopping

there    a    few m o m e n t s        and     seeing          mounted        officers          encouraging                  people       to

enter     the      ground        or     to    c l ear      away      from     the     rear      pen     if      they were            not

ticket       holders.            I then        walked          out      into M i d d i e w o o d       Road        where       it was

again     fairly          busy,        Liverpool           supporters            being      encouraged                 to    park

their     cars      in t h a t         area,        particularly             in s i d e      roads.

I recalled          that         the    one     special           train      expected          w as    due      to a r r i v e       at

around       2.00pm and               with     t hat      in m i n d       I returned          along         Leppings          Lane

intending          to     go     to    the     traffic           island      end a n d       observe           the      movement           of

spectators          with         regard        to    segregation.                As     I walked        from Catchbar

Lane     I sa w         tha t    the    area        around        the      bridge       over     the        ri v e r    was    very

busy     indeed wi t h            people        and       th at      the     Leppings        Lane      enclosure              was

 similarly         extremely             busy       although           apparently          under        control.               1

 continued         along         Leppings           Lane       which       was    also     extremely               busy      towaru

 the    traffic          island        end.         As     I approached             the    traffic            island         I saw        the

 front       end    of     the    escorted              fans     wno     1 assumed         were       the      occupants             of

 the    special          train.          They        were      being       escorted        by m o u n t e d            officers,

 foot    officers,              and     I s a w at         least       one    aog     van.       The        majority           of    t n es e

 people       appeared           ccnfinea            to    the    footpatn          and    there        wa s       a    considerable

 number       of    them.         I arrived               at   the     traffic        island          end     of       Leppings          L a ne

 and    saw     t ha t     there       were        no     difficulties            regarding            segregation                 and     I

 remained          at    that     traffic            island       for      some     time.

 It    is d i f f i c u l t      to     be    precise          but     I think        it w o u l d      be      approacning

 E.SOpm wnen              I heard           a message          on my       raai o     which      was        officers           at    the

 Leppings          Lane        entrance         to      the    ground        asking       for    vehicular                  traffic        to

 be    stopped          along         Leppings          Lane.        I recall         this      particularly                  because           I

 was    standing           next        to    the     PC w o r k i n g      traffic        duty        on the           island who
                                                                                                                                  R77
had    an    altercation               with           a driver          who had          driven        at    speed          through

persons       crossing             the       road        while        sounding           his    horn        but    making          no

attempt       to       slow       dow n .          The       officer         advised        this       driver       quite          properly

but    in    no    uncertain                terms        and     as     he    set     off      he     was    in    fact          the     first

vehicle       to be          denied          access           to L e p p i n g s      Lane.          Still    being          busy        with

pedestrian             traffic             but     with       apparently            no     threat       of    segregation

problems,          I left          the       traffic           island         end     of      Leppings        Lane          and    started

to    walk    back       towards             the        Leppings         L ane      entrance           to    the       ground.            As      I

was    walking          along          it was           fairly        evident         to me          that    the       persons

approaching             the       ground           were       t h ose    who     had       either       been       to       licensed

premises          or    had       stayed           away       from      the    ground           in    other       places          drinking

because       the       proportion                 of    people         who    I would           describe          as       boisterous

through       drink          seemed          to       have      significantly                 increased.               As    I neared

the    Leppings          Lane          end       of     the     ground,        I recall              seeing       Inspector              Sykes

standing          in    that        location             and     a number           of     other       officers             whose        names

are    not    known          to     me      who       were      manning        the       barriers.            I could             also        see

that    the       number          of       people        waiting         to e n t e r         the     ground       had       increased

significantly                and       now       stretched            certainly            to    the    roadway             of    Leppings

Lane    but       I do       not       recall           it    completely            blocking           it.        By    the       time        I

reached       this       point             it m u s t        h ave    been     between           quarter          to    and       ten

minutes       to       three.

I    stood    at       the    back          of     the       crowd      in    the     area       of    the    sweet          shop        in

Leppings          Lane       and       I    in     fact       was     standing           in     the    roadway          itself           but

not    in    the       middle          of    the        road.         I could         see       mounted       officers             among

the    crowd       and       from          where        I was        standing,           although           the    crowd          was     very

large       there       was       no       indication            to me        t hat      there        was    any       serious

problem       by       the    turnstiles                 themselves.                From        my    position          I could           see

the    right       hand       side          of     Gate       A and      turnstiles              1-16.        I could             no t    see

Gate    B or G a t e          C.       While          standing          in    t his      position           people          were

continually             turning             up     and       I was      jostled          among        the    crowd          and

continually             bombarded                by     people        asking        which        was    the       North          Stand,

West    Stand,          standing              areas          etc.     Even     though           tickets       and       entrances

were    colour          coded,             t his      did     not     seem     to     have       been       readily          appreciated

cannot        rec all       hearing          specific               r a dio     transmissions                 a l t h o u g h at        about

this     time       I became           aware         of    the       Police         landrover              pulling       up on m y

to    to p    pushing         forward             and     he    repeated            this        message         several           times.          A

moment        or    so a f t e r       this         I recall           seeing         Gate       A    being        tugged         open

although           I could           not    see      due       to    the      crowd        in    front        of    me who          was

openina           it.      I remember               thinking           to m y s e l f          that     if     that     g aie       was

 opened       it w o u l d       never           be m a n a g e d      to     be     closed          again.           However,           after-

 some     few       seconds          the     gate        in f a c t      was       pullea         to.        During          t:.at tj.me a

 position           to e s t i m a t e       how many            but     I can         say        t h a t a f t e r tnat           g a t e had

 been     closed          the     numbers           in the          Leppings           Lane       entrance            pen ha a          reduced

 time        I am    unable          to     say.         After        the       closing         of G a t e       A,     people

 continued           to     enter          via     tne    turnstiles                and     the       numbers         in that

 entrance           pen     further          reduced.                In the         few     moments           that      followed

 things        seemed        to       have       quietened            down        considerably                and     I t hen        hear* a

time    what       had     happened          within         the        ground          and       I assumed           it w a s           some

sort    of    public          order        problem.              I then          heard a message                    on my             radio       to

the    effect         that      no    fu r t h e r    persons           were          to    be a l l o w e d        inuo          the       ground

persons        in.       We        commenced         to     do    this          but     had        a great         deax          of

difficulty            and     altercation             with        people             arriving              late    who       were           ticket

holders.            Hcwever,           I was       able,         using           these       officers,             to    hold           the       rear

 of    Leppings          Lane       outside          the    ground              other       officers             began       to        turn       up

 presumably           in      response        to      the    radio              message.              After       some        few m i n u t e s

 Superintendent                 Marshall          returned             to       my    position             and    having           hdd a

 use    his    radio          to     ask    con trol        where           these          officers          could           be    best

 deployed          but     he      received          no    reply.               In    view       of    this        inability                to

 communicate             he     instructed            me    to     go       personally                to    tne     control             box a n d

 behind       tne      West        Stand     and      some        of    the          people        appeared             to    be       injur eu.

what      appeared                 to    be     numerous             casualties.                 I entered             the     control          bo,

and     spoke           to,        I think,            Superintendent                 Murray.              I explained               that       we

had      some        officers             available              for      deployment                in L e p p i n g s     Lane          a n d he

for    my    needs,          a very        difficult              situation             appertained              for       some

considerable               time.          Due     to    this          I remained             in the L e p p i n g s           Lane

area.        I was         sti l l    not       aware,         nor       were       the      officers           with       me,     of     the

scale       of    what       had     occurred.               It w a s         not      u n t il     some    time           later     when        I

was      approached             by two           doctors           in L e p p i n g s L a n e who           said        that       they        had

answered          the       public        appeal        and       1    was       a b l e to       use m y       radio       to     ask

where       these          should     be    directed.                  I was        told      the      gymnasium.                Things

had    begun          to    quieten         down       outside           by      t his     time a n d       I personally                  took

these       two       doctors        underneath               the      North        Stand          through       to        the

gymnasium.                 I entered            the    gymnasium              and      directed          the         doctors         to    the

injured          persons        area.            I there           saw Su p er in te na en t               Marsh           and    it w a s        at

this        stage      that     tne       scale         of    the      disaster              was    made    known           to me.           In

view        of   the       situation            I suggested                 to    Superintendent                 Ma rs h that             faced

with        an   incident            of    these        proportions                 t h at    he and        I        could perhaps

serve        the      joint        effort        better           by m a n n i n g        our      posts        at    Headquarters.

He     agreed         and     left        the     ground          almost          immediately              en        r o u t e for     HQ.        I

went        to   find        Superintendent                  M a r s h a l l to      see      if    I could           be     released.

 The    situation             in L e p p i n g s        Lane       was        c o n t a i n e d at      this         time     and       I found

END       Of REPORT
INCIDENT AT HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL GROUND - SHEFFIELD
ON SATURDAY 15 APRIL 1989


I am ROY WARING, a Chief Inspector in the Headquarters Operations Division of
South Yorkshire Police. On Saturday, 15 April 1989, I was detailed for duty
at the Hillsborough Football Ground in connection with the Semi-Final match
between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest. I was working Sector 2 under the
command of Superintendent Roger Marshall. This sector was divided into two
halves and I was responsible for Sector 2A. This sub-sector covered serials
22 to 33 and serials 44, 46, 47 and 48. All these serials were deployed outside
the ground, the lower numbered serials being responsible for patrolling
Middiewood Road from the Hillsborough shopping precinct through to the top of
Leppings Lane and as far as Crofton Avenue. Other officers were deployed in
Leppings Lane itself in the Catchbar Lane area and other serials manned the
barriers which block off the small side streets off Leppings Lane and Penistone
Road known locally as the triangle. Other serials have responsibility for
policing the traffic island area at Leppings Lane/Penistone Road with a view
to preventing clashes of supporters from opposing sides. Serial 33 is
responsible for policing that part of Penistone Road North from the Travellers
Rest Public House to Wardsend Road North. The serials having responsibility
for the barriers on the side roads are static points, the other serials have
a patrol responsibility in the particular area laid out in the operation order.

On Saturday, 15 April 1989, I commenced duty at 9.00 am at the Niagara Stables.
I intended meeting officers who were attending on a mutual aid basis from other
forces. On arrival at Niagara I saw that Superintendent Marsh was already in
attendance there and since I had to attend the briefing at Hillsborough at 9.45
am I left Niagara at 9.30 am and made my way to the ground. On arrival at the
ground I drew a radio and went to the North Stand where the briefing coimnenced
at 10.00 am. Following the briefing refreshments were available and serials
were instructed to be in position by 11.00 am. Having had something to eat
and a drink, I went out into the street on the Peniston6 Road side of the ground
just before 11.00 am. My initial patrol was around the triangle area where
I noticed that all officers and barriers were in position. I had a short
conversation with each pair of constables as I walked round this area and was
satisfied that it was properly contained. I continued and walked out into the
Catchbar Lane and then Middiewood Road area where I saw that officers were
deployed on their patrols and it was at this time that I noticed that the Park
Hotel on Wadsley Lane was obviously closed and the windows boarded up. I took
particular notice of this because at the Semi-Final 1988 I had to close these
premises at 2.15 pm following trouble with persons drinking therein. I then
walked back along the length of Leppings Lane to the traffic roundabout end,
again seeing that officers were deployed on their patrols as required and I
spent some tune at that end considering the segregation of supporters after
the match. This proved to be somewhat problematical last year when large
numbers of people left the ground because opposing fans' coaches are often
parked in the Herries Road area and this is one of the closest points that the
two opposing sides come together. Last year I had had to deploy a large cordon
across the road here to ensure that segregation, and I spent some time wondering
how this could be achieved this year.

During my initial walk round there were supporters already about but there were
not that many. I am not aware what time the turnstiles at Leppings Lane
actually opened. I recall from the briefing that some gates were to be opened
at 11.00 am but that the majority were to be opened at 12 noon.

As the morning progressed I patrolled on foot in the area I have previously
described but I did not go right down to the Hillsborough shopping precinct,
having had a short conversation with Inspector Humphries who stated that things
were relatively quiet at that end. Pedestrian traffic in the Middiewood
Road/Leppings Lane/Penistone Road area gradually increased as time went by
particularly with the coimnencement of the arrival of coaches which were
initially parked in Claywheels Lane and then later directed to Halifax Road
for parking. As the pedestrian traffic increased, and particularly with the
weather being good at the time, groups of people were making their way to the
ground while others were sitting on walls or standing in groups on spare land
and a significant number of these were drinking alcohol from tins and large
plastic bottles. I myself advised numerous people that they would not be
allowed to take alcohol into the ground nor would they be admitted if they were
drunk and I heard other officers regularly advising people the same. I am
satisfied that officers on patrol in the areas were paying active attention
to the crowds as they built up. With regard to the behaviour of the Liverpool
fans as they approached the ground, I would describe it as boisterous but there
were no outbreaks that I saw of public order problems although I do recall
hearing transmissions on the radio regarding trouble at the Fox Public House
on Foxhill Road.

At about 1.30 pm I walked along Leppings Lane which was very busy on both sides
of the road with pedestrian traffic and as I passed the Leppings Lane end I
saw that it was very busy. I remember stopping there a few moments and seeing
mounted officers encouraging people to enter the ground or to clear away from
the rear pen if they were not ticket holders. I then walked out into Middiewood
Road where it was again fairly busy, Liverpool supporters being encouraged to
park their cars in that area, particularly in side roads.

I recalled that the one special train expected was due to arrive at around 2.00
pm and with that in mind I returned along Leppings Lane intending to go to the
traffic island end and observe the movement of spectators with regard to
segregation. As I walked from Catchbar Lane I saw that the area around the
bridge over the river was very busy indeed with people and that the Leppings
Lane enclosure was similarly extremely busy although apparently under control.
I continued along Leppings Lane which was also extremely busy toward the traffic
island end. As I approached the traffic island I saw the front end of the
escorted fans who I assumed were the occupants of the special train. They were
being escorted by mounted officers, foot officers, and I saw at least one dog
van. The majority of these people appeared confined to the footpath and there
was a considerable number of them. I arrived at the traffic island end of
Leppings Lane and saw that there were no difficulties regarding segregation
and I remained at that traffic island for some time.

It is difficult to be precise but I think it would be approaching 2.30 pm when
I heard a message on my radio which was officers at the Leppings Lane entrance
to the ground asking for vehiclular traffic to be stopped along Leppings Lane.
I recall this particularly because I was standing next to the PC working traffic
duty on the island who had an altercation with a driver who had driven at speed
through persons crossing the road while sounding his horn but making no attempt
to slow down. The officer advised this driver quite properly but in no
- 3 -


uncertain terms and as he set off he was in fact the first vehicle to be denied
access to Leppings Lane. Still being busy with pedestrian traffic but with
apparently no threat of segregation problems, I left the traffic island end
of Leppings Lane and started to walk back towards the Leppings Lane entrance
to the ground. As I was walking along it was fairly evident to me that the
persons approaching the ground were those who had either been to licensed
premises or had stayed away from the ground in other places drinking because
the proportion of people who I would describe as boisterous through drink seemed
to have significantly increased. As I neared the Leppings Lane end of the
ground I could see that the number of people waiting to enter the ground had
increased significantly and now stretched certainly to the roadway of Leppings
Lane but I do not recall it completely blocking it. By the time I reached this
point it must have been between      quarter to and ten minutesto three. Istood
at the back of the crowd in thearea of the sweet shop in Leppings Lane and
I in fact was standing in the roadway itself but not in the middle of the road.
I could see mounted officers among the crowd and from where I was standing,
although the crowd was very large there was no indication to me that there was
any serious problem by the turnstiles themselves. From my position I could
see the right hand side of Gate A and turnstiles 1-16. I could not see Gate
B or Gate C. While standing in this position people were continually turning
up and I was jostled among the crowd and continually bombarded by people asking
which was the North Stand, West Stand, standing areas etc.    Even though tickets
and entrances were colour coded, this did not seem to have been readily
appreciated by spectators.

The time now must have been approaching three o'clock as I recall hearing a
concerted roar from the crowd inside the ground as though the teams had come
out. As I recall it was not the start of the game as I am sure it was just
prior to three o'clock. While standing in this position among the crowd and
due to the noise from the stadium I cannot recall hearing specific radio
transmissions although at about this time I became aware of the police land
rover pulling up on my left and an Inspector     using the public addresssystem
asking the crowd to stop pushing forward and     he repeated this messageseveral
times. A moment or so after this I recall seeing Gate A      being tuggedopen
although I could not see due to the crowd in front of me who was opening it.
I remember thinking to myself that if that gate was opened it would never be
managed to be closed again. However, after some few seconds the gate in fact
was pulled to. During that time a significant number of people passed through
Gate A. I am not in a position to estimate how many but I can say that after
that gate had been closed the numbers in the Leppings Lane entrance pen had
reduced significantly. Whether other gates were opened at about the same time
I am unable to say. After the closing of Gate A, people continued to enter
via the turnstiles and the numbers in that entrance pen further reduced. In
the few moments that followed things seemed to have quietened down considerably
and I then heard a transmission to the effect that all available personnel were
to enter the ground. Also at this time I could see Superintendent Roger
Marshall who was standing some 10 - 15 yards to my right. There were quite
a number of PCs in the vicinity also. Superintendent Marshall obviously having
heard this message walked towards me and shouted words to the effect that he
would take the majority of the men with him into the ground and that I was to
keep a grip of this back end. I recall in particular using the words 'keep
a grip'. He went into the ground through either Gate B or Gate C taking with
 - 4 -


him the majority of the PCs and leaving me with about one dozen. I formed these
officers into a loose cordon across the entrance pen and remained there. It
was unknown to me or the officers with me at that time what had happened within
the ground and I assumed it was some sort of public order problem. I then heard
a message on my radio to the effect that no further persons were to be allowed
into the ground and almost inmediately the narrow blue turnstile gates behind
me were all closed. I instructed the officers who were with me to clear the
Leppings Lane entrance pen of people and not to allow any further persons in.
We commenced to do this but had a great deal of difficulty and altercation with
people arriving late who were ticket holders. However, I was able, using these
officers, to hold the rear of Leppings Lane fairly sterile. There were still
quite a large number of people out in Leppings Lane itself. While holding the
rear of Leppings Lane outside the ground other officers began to turn up
presumably in response to the radio message. After some few minutes
Superintendent Marshall returned to my position and having had a short
conversation with him we estimated that we had some 40 or so officers with us
and available. Superintendent Marshall attempted to use his radio to ask
control where these officers could be best deployed but he received no reply.
In view of this inability to communicate he instructed me to go personally to
the control box and advise regarding the situation in Leppings Lane. I entered
the ground by Gate C and headed for the police control box. I saw numerous
people together with police officers in that open area behind the West Stand
and some of the people appeared to be injured. I continued towards the control
rocan and climbed the stairs. On looking over the playing area my initial
impression was that there had been some sort of pitch invasion but I then saw
that there were what appeared to be numerous casualties. I entered the control
box and spoke to, I think, Superintendent Murray. I explained that we had some
officers available for deployment in Leppings Lane and he said words to the
effect that we were to hold the back end. I returned to Leppings Lane and
conveyed the message to Mr Marshall.

Realising that something fairly major had occurred and hearing snatches of
transmission referring to ambulances and casualties I decided to clear as far
as possible the rear of the Leppings Lane entrances and maintain an open roadway
in Leppings Lane. I instructed the PCs with me to keep the rear of the service
road and the entrance pen as clear as at all possible and I asked Sergeant
Thomas of the Mounted Branch to try and clear, again as far as possible, people
away from that back end. I walked out into Leppings Lane itself the roadway
of which was reasonably clear and stopped a traffic mobile. I asked officers
in that mobile to close Leppings Lane at the traffic light junction with
Catchbar Lane. I similarly spoke to a traffic motorcyclist and then to a
traffic supervisor although I cannot recall who that was. Shortly after this
fire appliances began to arrive and ambulances. I tried to maintain a through
route so that ambulances could enter the service road at the Leppings Lane end,
collect casualties near to Gate C and then leave the ground via the service
road into Penistone Road. People began then to leave the ground in large
numbers which made Leppings Lane again very congested. However, emergency
vehicles were able to get through.

As more and more people began to leave the ground there was an extremely
belligerent mood taking over and a great deal of abuse was directed at police
officers. There was in my view a grave risk of a public order situation
developing and while I had sufficient officers for my needs, a very difficult
situation appertained for some considerable time. Due to this I remained in
the Leppings Lane area. I was still not aware, nor were the officers with me,
of the scale of what had occurred. It was not until some time later when I
was approached by two doctors in Leppings Lane who said that they had answered
the public appeal and I was able to use my radio to ask where these should be
directed. I was told the gymnasium. Things had begun to quieten down outside
by this time and I personally took these two doctors underneath the North Stand
through to the gymnasium. I entered the gymnasium and directed the doctors
to the injured persons area. I there saw Superintendent Marsh and it was at
this stage that the scale of the disaster was made known to ire. In view of
the situation I suggested to Superintendent Marsh that faced with an incident
of these proportions that he and I could perhaps serve the joint effort better
by manning our posts at Headquarters. He agreed and left the ground almost
immediately en route for HQ. I went to find Superintendent Marshall to see
if I could be released. The situation in Leppings Lane was contained at this
time and I found Superintendent Marshall at the control room and received
permission to be released from duty at the ground. I left the ground and picked
up my private motor vehicle and drove to HQ. Due to traffic conditions I did
not arrive at HQ until some time just before 6.00 pm. I went to the Force
Operations Room and together with Superintendent Marsh, Chief Inspector
Edmundson and Superintendent Anderson we discussed the requirements and together
went through the Major Incident Manual to ensure all support services were being
properly utilised. As part of the operations effort I later attended at
Hairtnerton Road Police Station and following discussions with Chief Inspector
McRobbie arranged for the Church Hall on Forbes Road to be opened as a reception
centre for relatives. I later returned to HQ and remained on duty until 11.30
pm that night.

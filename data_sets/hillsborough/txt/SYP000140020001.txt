    Your ref:

     Dear Sir,

    Hillsborough Inquest

    You may recall that on a previous occasion I prepared a computer
    sorting of alcohol content and times of arrival of the deceased,
    partly from the evidence of Dr. Forest and partly from a
    schedule prepared by or on behalf of Sheffield Wednesday Football
    Club.

    Since then, the coroner has supplied everyone with his own
    schedule which contains other information, some of which the
    coroner indicated may not be relevant for any further purpose.

    I have amended my original schedule to include the ages of the
    deceased and to substitute the coroner's times of arrival. I have
    shortened "Probably Gate C - 14.30 plus” to "After 14.30" to make
    for a narrower column. There are some minor discrepancies in
    times of arrival between the coroner's list and the SWFC list,but
    they do not seem to me to be of great consequence.

    There is a note against No. 51 Kevin Daniel Williams which may
    indicate some special feature of which I am not aware - others may
    well understand it.

    I have dispensed with the alphabetical list so that there are now
    two versions - one in the original order, with reference numbers,
    for checking. The other is in order of alcohol content rising
    from zero, through less than 10, to the number of milligrams in
    each case.

    I still have the data on computer in case anyone would like the
    data sorted in some other way for ease of reference. I can also
    reprint quickly if it is discovered that I have made any errors in
    transferring information from the original sources.

    I have given a copy of this.letter and of the attached sheets to
    each advocate. If no-one objects, I propose to use the sheets, as
    an aid to questioning of the statistician in due course and would
    like the jury to have copies. The unsorted data seems to me to
    be very difficult to follow in any ordered way.



    Yours faithfully,
    VINCENT HALE & CO

    Chief Superintendents Nesbit, Thompson and Wain
    Superintendents Bates, Marsh and Swann
    Chief Inspector Bettison

(2) P Hayes Esq QPM LLB MA, Deputy Chief Constable - Chairman
    Superintendents Greenwood, Marsh, Oughton, Simpson and Sleath
    Chief Inspectors Beal, Bettison and Donnelly



The Deputy Chief Constable introduced the Taylor Report to each meeting and
distributed copies. He pointed out that there were 43 recommendations in the
Report some of which applied to the South Yorkshire Police. Those
recommendations which are asterisked must be implemented before the start of
the 1989/90 football season - 19 August 1989.

The Deputy Chief Constable drew attention to paragraph 26 of the
recommendations and pointed out that he was the appointed chief officer. In
the short term it was intended to address the recommendations and in the long
term to review Force policy in terms of policing football by reference to the
previous Popplewell Report recommendations and to the Green Guide. This would
eventually lead to revision of the Force standing instructions in respect of
policing football events.

A working party is to be convened chaired by the Deputy Chief Constable with
Chief Superintendent Broomhead as deputy chairman, Chief Inspector Bettison as
secretary, five sub-divisional officers representing each of the football
grounds within South Yorkshire and, Superintendent Marsh representing
Operations Division.

Chief Superintendent Wain asked why divisional officers could not just be left
to get on with it. Mr Hayes replied that he wished for there to be a
consistent response across the Force as far as this can be achieved, both in
relation to liaison with clubs, other emergency services and the local
authorities.

It was agreed the following recommendations would be considered first

Recommendation three - counting spectators into self-contained sections of the
ground

The Deputy Chief Constable said the local authority will determine capacities
in the various sections of the ground and will convey those to the police
amongst others. The responsibility for 'counting' - however achieved - lies
with the club and he asked members to discover in time for the meeting
scheduled for 11 August, how they intend to achieve this.
The responsibility for closing off access when capacity is reached is also to
be that of the clubs. However, if assistance is required on any occasion we
will react positively.

Superintendent Oughton referred to the Harris -v- Sheffield United Football
Club and said the police have additional responsibilities in respect of
'comfort and safety of spectators'. He asked if we have monitors in control
rooms should we not also have responsibility?

The Deputy Chief Constable said the clubs, in this situation, also have their
own monitors.

Superintendent Sleath made the point that the purpose of the monitors is to
assess the rate of filling and the numbers still to arrive, not to determine
whether an area is full. This was agreed.

Chief Inspector Beal stated that Annex 2 to the Green Guide places
responsibility for monitoring, and such determination, on the club.


Recommendation four - which calls for a written agreement between the police
and the club

The Deputy Chief Constable stated that the proposals agreed at these meetings
on the recommendations will be conveyed to the club via the respective sub-
divisional officers. It should be pointed out to the clubs that the aim is to
take a consistent view across the Force and that certain principles are
proposed by the police in respect of the demarcation of responsibilities.

Sub-divisional officers are to address respective club officials - present our
'preferred options' and ask for their proposals. They should inform club
officials that it is our wish to be in a position by Monday 14 August after
considering their proposals (to be discussed at 11 August meeting) to
present a composite agreement with the five clubs for their written approval.


Recommendation five - the monitoring of crowd levels in each self contained
pen or terraced area

The Deputy Chief Constable posed the question 'Is this to be the clubs
responsibility?'. Chief Superintendent Nesbit made the point that this has
already been agreed with Sheffield Wednesday and Mr Bates added that there is
a similar agreement with Sheffield United. Mr Marsh queried whether there
would be a difference at Barnsley where, he believed, there is a reluctance to
accept certain responsibilities. Mr Swann rejected this view and said that
post Hillsborough he expected better co-operation.

Mr Thompson made the point that stewards who will have this responsibility at
Doncaster Rovers will be wearing different coloured tabards. Mr Bates added
that this is done at Sheffield United as well. The Deputy Chief Constable
commended this idea to both meetings and raised for consideration the question
of identifiable clothing for police officers on perimeter track detail.

The Deputy Chief Constable said our combined stance will be that
recommendation number five is to be carried out by the club.

We need to know, by Friday 11 August 1989, how they divide up the ground
(plans required) and how they intend to monitor each area.
A discussion followed regarding recommendation six (which is not on this early
agenda) concerning the training of stewards/police officers to recognise crowd
densities.

It was agreed that responsibility for training stewards will be the clubs but
as we will be training our officers the club are welcome to be involved with
our programme. (They retain responsibility for ensuring all relevant stewards
have been trained).

Further to this the Deputy Chief Constable recommends that all police officers
and stewards deployed to those duties should be consistently deployed so that
rapport and experience is built up and the training need minimised.


Recommendation nine - the policing of the open perimeter fence gates

Mr Hayes pointed out that a police officer is to be responsible. Mr Bates
confirmed this is the existing policy at Sheffield United. A discussion
took place about how many officers are required for the number of gates in any
perimeter fence. It was agreed that one police officer is to be deployed to
each gate in a perimeter fence for the purposes of deciding whether or not to
allow spectators through that gate to relieve overcrowding at any time. It
was further agreed that this officer will be in radio contact with match
control and will liaise with the steward referred to at recommendation five.

A discussion took place about whether the officer so authorised ought to be
identified in some way. It was unresolved.

It was pointed out to the meeting that the 'authorised' officer deployed to
any perimeter fence gate must not under any circumstances be diverted to other
duties. It is a condition that an officer should remain at the gate at all
times, though additional officers/stewards with no such specific task might
supplement these officers.

Superintendent Greenwood raised the question of terraced areas which had no
perimeter fences and would not normally have a police officer deployed in that
area. The point being that there is no liaison officer for the monitoring
steward.

After discussion the Deputy Chief Constable proposed that if there is a
terraced area with a gate, but no perimeter fence, we will man the gate. Any
terraced area without fence or gates should have at least one officer in that
area.

Superintendent Simpson asked about sanctions for stubborn clubs and the Deputy
Chief Constable stated that if we do not achieve a written agreement we may
have to consider seeking a match postponement.


Recommendation 10 - cutting equipment

The club will make the provision. The police do not want the responsibility
of using this equipment therefore its use will be the task of the Fire Brigade
or    trained club employees. The Deputy Chief Constable pointed out to the
meeting that a 'nominated' senior police officer has the decision whether and
when such cutting equipment should be used. It was agreed that the nominated
officer would be the officer in overall control at the match. This officer
would therefore need to familiarise himself with the location and type of
equipment available. We need also to write details of the arrangements into
operational orders.


Paragraph 24 - information on tickets

The Deputy Chief Constable informed the meeting why this recommendation had
arisen in the light of the ticket information at the Semi-Final game at
Hillsborough. There will be a need for both the club and ourselves to
consider the number of spectators expected, the segregation policy to be
applied, the number of turnstiles for each group of spectators and the
potential throughput of 750 an hour so that in respect of each match the
arrival information can be particularised accordingly. The requirement is for
the club to liaise with the police on every occasion and we must be able to
advise sensibly.

The Deputy Chief Constable pointed out to Chief Superintendent Nesbit that the
Sheffield Wednesday -v- Everton game which is to be all ticket for away
supporters is important in this regard.

The Superintendents were asked to find out from the clubs how they propose to
meet the arrangement.


Paragraph 27 - operational orders

The Deputy Chief Constable pointed out to the meeting that he is considering
the worth of a 'model' operational order but was aware of the dangers
involved. The 'model' order could be used too readily and important changes
missed.

The Deputy Chief Constable suggested that recommendation 27 calls for (a) a
greater awareness, to be written into the operational order, of the primacy of
public safety over the concerns for public disorder, and (b) a further
requirement to think through difficulties that may arise in respect of
overcrowding and to have contingency plans to cope with these.

The Deputy Chief Constable asked the superintendents to have some thoughts for
revising operational orders by Friday 11 August.

Mr Thompson digressed at this point and suggested that any working party ought
to review the formula for police charges to football clubs. It was obvious to
him that more police officers were going to be required inside the ground than
previously.

The Deputy Chief Constable thanked him for this comment and asked all members
at the meeting to address the question of total manpower need inside their
respective grounds and to inform the working group of any changes envisaged.


Recommendation 28 - contingency plans for dealing with arrival/departure
patterns

The Deputy Chief Constable listed what some of these patterns may be, for
example, non-tickets holders at ticket games, late arrivals, emergency
departures, etc. Mr Hayes pointed out other patterns are foreseeable. He
asked that all members of the meeting come up with a list of patterns which
are foreseeable at their ground and, for the meeting on 11 August 1989,
representatives should have contingency plans in mind for coping with these.

The second part of this recommendation deals with 'sufficient reserves'. The
question was posed what is sufficient? Superintendent Bates made the point
that rapid deployment is the key feature of this recommendation, sufficiency
would be a matter for ground commanders to determine for each match at each
ground. The superintendents meeting thought that one serial was a minimum
reserve.

The Deputy Chief Constable asked members to tell the clubs that we are
required as an imperative to provide these reserves and that they are to be
deployed inside the ground. They ought to be aware that costing arrangements
will reflect this matter.


Paragraph 29 - delaying kick-off

The Deputy Chief Constable proposed a view that, as an absolute fail safe, the
referee ought to ask permission from the ground commander before taking the
players out onto the pitch. Mr Wain agreed with this view. A discussion took
place and Mr Thompson pointed out that any such proposal ought to have
national ratification. The Deputy Chief Constable repeated his proposal and
requested that all clubs be asked, pending national agreement, to adopt this
strategy.

Superintendent Sleath envisaged few problems as the South Yorkshire Police
already have a policy of liaison with match officials. Requesting this
additional courtesy from referees would, in his view, be acceptable.


Recommendation 35 - liaison with emergency services

The Deputy Chief Constable pointed out that 'regular liaison' was ambiguous
and that representatives should address this matter before the meeting on
11 August and be able to explain what happens at the moment and make proposals
about what should happen in the future.

Superintendent Simpson pointed out that a Mr Morley of SYMAS is offering his
services to clubs and to football liaison officers. It was felt by the
meeting that a SYMAS representative should be invited on to the Safety at
Sports Ground Working Group.

This matter to be further considered.


Recommendations 36 and 37 were taken together - the contingency plans for
emergency vehicle access and provision of information about the event to the
emergency services

The Deputy Chief Constable suggested that these two recommendations can be met
by amending operational orders to show the contingency plans that exist at the
various grounds, and to identify the officers deputed to liaise with emergency
services, to show the rendezvous points etc. Such amended operational orders
will be sent to Ambulance and Fire Brigade controls. They each should be
asked to nominate a liaison officer for any 'on the day' updates.
Recommendation 38 - notifying officers at the ground of contingency plans for
the arrival of emergency services

The Deputy Chief Constable suggested that this again be caught up in the
operational order revision.


Communications

The Deputy Chief Constable said this would be fully considered at a later
time. For the time being he enjoined the superintendents to have a reserve
set at every football match until new equipment was available.


The Deputy Chief Constable closed the meetings with the following
instructions:-

     i)   make contact with the clubs and, in the light of the corporate
          policy determined through these meetings, be in a position to
          discuss on Friday 11 August a draft agreement for the
          policing/stewarding of football matches in South Yorkshire in
          the future;

    ii)   think about contingency plans arising out of these recommendations;

   iii)   estimate the manpower/cost implications of meeting these
          recommendations;

    iv)   to meet again on Friday 11 August at 2.00 pm - Conference Room
          - when we must progress, if possible to conclusion, the various
          issues referred to.

 1/89      MINUTES OF PREVIOUS MEETINGS

The minutes of the meetings held on 7 and 8 August 1989, were accepted as a
true and accurate record of those meetings.


 2/89      LEAVE/COMMITMENTS

The Deputy Chief Constable commenced the meeting by stressing the importance
of team members attending future meetings. He said that in all cases where
they would be absent, the meeting must be attended by their deputy or in the
case of a chief inspector member his superintendent. He added that he had no
objection to both parties attending future meetings if they so wished.

It was agreed that in the absence of Chief Inspector Bettison, Chief Inspector
Donnelly will act as secretary.


 3/89      TIMESCALES

Mr Hayes said that by 19 August 1989, the asterisked recommendations must be
implemented and prior to that date the written agreement described in
recommendation four must be established with each of the clubs. He said that
it was intended to finalise those agreements by Tuesday 15 August 1989 and the
content will be discussed as a separate agenda item later in the meeting.

After achieving that deadline it is intended to complete the implementation of
all the recommendations by 31 October 1989 or before if possible, when the
results will be communicated to Lord Justice Taylor whilst he is considering
his final Report.

The Chairman said it follows that in order to achieve these timescales and
objectives meetings will be held on a regular basis as necessary.


 4/89      FUNCTIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES

The Chairman said that it will be necessary for each member of the group to
undertake a specific function which will enable the team to achieve the
implementation of the recommendations within the timescales previously
outlined.

Mr Hayes then allocated the functional responsibilities as follows:-
                                - 2 -

'model' Operational Order to assist in producing a consistent and
comprehensive Order at all matches in South Yorkshire.

The Order is to take account of all recommendations and reflect the
deliberations of the working group.

Superintendent Simpson to be provided with all South Yorkshire Orders
(including those for football matches on 19 August 1989) as soon as these

The Deputy Chief Constable said that the first requirement on team members
will be to gain a detailed grasp of their specific functions in order to lead
or act as an information resource on these subjects at future meetings and, as
the team progresses it is expected that whenever aspects arise relating to a
particular function, the necessary research will be carried out by the team
member allocated that responsibility. Others with expert knowledge in a
particular field will be seconded to the group whenever necessary.


 5/89        DOCUMENTATION

The Chairman said the following documentation has been identified as relevant
to the implementation of the recommendations and group members should ensure

              communications.

The Secretary, Chief Inspector Bettison confirmed that each member was in
possession of these documents.


 6/89         MATTERS ARISING FROM THE PREVIOUS MINUTES

        6.1   Written Agreement (Recommendation 4)

The Chairman reiterated his intention that the written agreement between South
Yorkshire Police and the Football League Clubs should be completed during the
week commencing 14 August 1989   and therefore it was imperative that the
content of that document should be finalised at this meeting.

Mr Hayes referred to Recommendation 3, ie:-

        'Arrangements should be made:-

        (a) to limit the number of spectators entering each self-contained pen or
        area to the maximum capacity figure assessed in accordance with
        Recommendation 2 above either electronically, mechanically, by a
        ticketing arrangement, by counting or otherwise, and

        (b) to close off further   access to such pen or area when itsmaximum
        capacity is about to be reached1

and asked what arrangements, if any, had been made by the clubs in respect of
this recommendation.

Superintendent Greenwood said that the monitoring of spectators entering the
single pen at Doncaster will be by way of numbered tickets. He explained that
four turnstiles service the one pen and a ticket will be given to each person
at the time of entry to the ground and when the maximum capacity minus 15% is
reached the stewards will close the turnstiles.

Superintendent Simpson reported a lack of co-operation by the Barnsley
Football Club. He said that he had approached the Club Secretary, Mr Spinks
on two occasions to discuss the recommendations but this had been met by a
refusal on their part to enter into any discussions.

Mr Simpson continued stating that he attended a meeting on Wednesday 9 August
at Barnsley Football Club which was also attended by the Director of Planning,
the Fire Brigade and Ambulance Service when the recommendations were discussed
and a course of action was agreed but the Club did not attend that meeting.

On Thursday 10 August a further meeting was held at the ground when the
Chairman, Vice Chairman and Club Secretary for Barnsley Football Club also
attended. He said the club officials initially showed resistence to any
suggestions which were being made but quickly realised it was inevitable that
changes had to be made. The meeting was concluded with the club stating that
they will not supply the police with any agreement in writing until they have
had chance to consider the common agreement agreed by other clubs, which they
will then agree to and sign.
Mr Simpson said it had been pointed out to them that in these circumstances
they would have no input into the agreement but that did not affect their
stance.

Regarding recommendation three, Mr Simpson said the turnstiles at Oakwell are
very old and operate a mechanical counting system and the club are planning to
set up a system of runners for each section of the ground who will then report
at intervals of 15 minutes to the police control the numbers that have entered
particular sections of the ground.

The Chairman accepted that the police control should be aware of the numbers
in the various sections of the ground, to be aware of late arrivals amongst
other things, but stressed that the club must understand fully that it is
their responsibility to monitor the numbers and when the capacities have been
reached close that section of the ground.

Mr Simpson said they are experiencing problems but it is hoped that these will
be resolved in the near future. In reply to a question from Chief Inspector
Bettison, Mr Simpson said that Oakwell did not have any pens but the geography
of the ground is such that certain turnstiles service certain areas of the
terraces and Spion Kop therefore it is possible to isolate specific areas.

Superintendent Oughton said that the system at Millmoor for monitoring the
numbers entering the ground is computerised and is relayed to the Club
Secretary's office and shows the capacities at each section of the ground at
any given time. He said the computer has been programmed to sound an alarm
when the capacity has been reached, then the turnstiles servicing that section
will be closed down by the club.

Chief Inspector Donnelly said that Bramall Lane also has a computerised
counting system and with the exception of the Spion Kop specific turnstiles
service particular sections of the ground. With regards to the Kop that is
presently split into two sections by a fence and the turnstiles give access to
both these sections. He said the club are considering two options, ie (i)
remove the fence, or (ii) employ stewards to monitor the number of spectators
in each of the two sections.

Mr Donnelly said that it has been initially agreed that when the computer
showed that the capacity has been reached, the club would contact the police
control room and they in turn would inform officers on the turnstiles via
radio to instruct the turnstile operators to close, and the control room would
also instruct the chief steward by radio in order that he can reinforce this
instruction.

After discussion the Chairman said the above is a sensible fallback position
but it is the clubs responsibility to ensure the turnstiles are closed down,
therefore, alternative arrangements will have to be made by them to initiate
these controls in the first instance without police intervention.

Superintendent Sleath said it was a computerised system at Hillsborough
connected to their control room. When the numbers reach 15% below capacity an
alarm sounds and the turnstiles' supervisor is contacted by radio and
instructed to close these turnstiles serving that section of the ground.

The Chairman said that the agreements will be drawn up on the basis of the
arrangements already made with the clubs and in accordance with
recommendation four it will include the condition that any variation of the
agreement in respect of an individual match will be agreed in writing in
advance.

Mr Hayes said the agreement will state that the club will provide on the
perimeter track a steward for each pen or terraced area for the duration that
spectators are in that pen or terraced area, whose sole duty will be to
monitor the crowd conditions for any signs of overcrowding or distress
(recommendation five). The police will provide a police officer for each gate
(or group of gates if they are close together) who will be authorised to
decide whether or not to allow spectators through a gate to relieve
overcrowding (recommendation nine). Those officers will be in possession of a
radio and will identify themselves to the steward(s) appointed by the club to
monitor the pen or terraced area.

Chief Inspector Bettison said that clubs will be asked to provide a plan of
their ground showing where stewards, with the responsibility to monitor the
crowd, are located and this will be appended to the agreement.

Chief Superintendent Broomhead pointed out that recommendation nine states
that a police officer will man the open gate to the pitch (recommendation
eight) but in practical terms it will need at least two officers per gate as a
contingency for any public order situation. He said that this should be borne
in mind when considering the contractual agreements in respect of costs.

After discussion the Chairman asked members to be in a position to outline the
additional costs in manpower caused by the implementation of recommendations
eight and nine at the next meeting. Also details of any other foreseeable
additional costs caused by the implementation of the Taylor recommendations.

Superintendent Simpson suggested that there is now a very good argument for
using manpower dedicated to policing inside the ground instead of the three
phase policing presently carried out at each game. The cost of the dedicated
manpower should then be charged in total to the club. The Chairman said that
this should be considered at a later meeting.

Returning to the content of the written agreement, the Chairman said it will
include that each club will provide suitable and sufficient cutting equipment
to permit the immediate removal of enough fencings to release numbers of
spectators if necessary. That equipment will be operated by employees of the
club who should be trained in its use (recommendation 10).

The Chairman said the agreement will also include a formal arrangement whereby
in advance of each football match the police liaison officer and the club
liaison officer will meet and consider the planning arrangements which will
apply in respect of the match in question.

As a part of this they will need on each occasion to take into account the
number of spectators anticipated, any intelligence or behavioural
difficulties, the pattern of arrival, the segregation policy to be adopted,
the number of turnstiles to be used in respect of each major spectator group,
the state of those turnstiles and, the possible input speed in respect of each
main spectator group. When tickets are to be sold they will consider the
information provided on those tickets by way of plans, arrival times, colour
coding or anything else which is seen as relevant from the point-of-view of
public safety (recommendation 24).

After discussion it was agreed that the police liaison officer will be the
sub-divisional commander or his deputy in charge of policing that ground.
The Chairman said that he has been nominated by the Chief Constable as the
Chief Officer with the responsibility for liaison with the management of each
football club and local authority concerned in respect of the safety and
control of crowds. This will be included in the written agreement
(recommendation 26).

Mr Hayes referred to recommendation 28 concerning police reserves available
for rapid deployment to any point inside or outside the ground and asked if
there is a need to include in the agreement reference to these reserves, their
locations and the financial consequences to the club. After discussion it was
agreed that this should be dealt with in the contracts to the clubs and
omitted from the written agreement.

The Chairman said that the option to postpone kick-off is at the discretion of
the officer in command at the ground and it is therefore essential that the
club provides a telephone link between the referee's room and the police
control room (recommendation 29). He said that this requirement will be
included in the written agreement.

Mr Hayes said that in relation to recommendation 37, brief reference will need
to be made in the written agreement saying that the emergency services as
required by the Report are working together to agree contingency plans in
respect of access, rendezvous points, accessibility within the ground for
vehicles from all three emergency services, and as appropriate the intention
is to enjoin club officials in the preparation of these plans.


     6.2   The Operational Order - Recommendations   1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 10
           27, 28, 31, 32, 33, 34, 36, 37 and 38

The Chairman said that with regard to recommendations 1, 5, 8 and 9
Operational Orders will include a plan of the ground showing the maximum
number of people to be allowed in each section or part of the ground; also
identifying the pens or other designated areas to be monitored by stewards
regarding overcrowding or distress; showing precisely the location of these
stewards and the police officers manning the gates and making it clear that
each officer will have a radio with direct access to ground control.

It will be made clear that whilst the primary responsibility of designated
stewards is to monitor the crowd as above, police officers also have this same
responsibility as part of their general duties. It is an absolute requirement
that the officers at the gates, which will always be left open, make
themselves known to the designated stewards referred to so as to enable
immediate contact from the steward via those officers to ground control inthe
event of difficulties.

At the grounds without gates officers will be located on the perimeter to
provide this same communication facility and will identify themselves to the
stewards monitoring the crowd. The proposal was agreed.

The Chairman suggested that mention should be made of recommendations 3(a) and
3(b) by way of information as to the responsibilities of the club and
additionally regarding 3(b) in the form of a contingency plan dealing with the
event of a public order situation following the closure of a particular pen or
section of the terracing. The proposal was agreed.
The Chairman suggested that reference should be made to the availability of
cutting equipment, who will use it if necessary other than ourselves and that
the decision to use it is with the police officer in command at the ground
(recommendation 10). The proposal was agreed.

The Chairman said that both the Operational Order and the pre-match briefing
must alert all officers on duty to the dangers of overcrowding and also
contingency plans to deal with this wherever it occurs in the ground
(recommendation 27). Also reference should be made of those officers on
reserve available for rapid re-deployment in terms of their identity, location
availability, transportation and the communication arrangements regarding this
(recommendation 28). The proposal was agreed.

The Chairman said that recommendation 28 states that the Operational Order for
each match should enable the police to cope with any 'foreseeable' pattern in
the arrival of spectators at a match and in their departure. He said that
this refers to late arrivals, people attending all-ticket matches without
tickets, the opening of emergency gates, etc., and asked members if they could
identify foreseeable reasons for late arrivals and problems with departures.

Superintendent Oughton said that there has been other occasions when a match
has been cancelled at short notice in Sheffield causing a massive influx of
supporters attending the game at Millmoor.

Superintendent Greenwood stated that on occasions where there has been a
morning kick-off in the area, some of these supporters make their way to a
game taking place in the afternoon.

Chief Superintendent Broomhead said that a standard pattern is now emerging
where some spectators are travelling in private vehicles, not showing any club
colours, parking three/four miles from the ground and their presence is not
known in that city/town centre.

Superintendent Greenwood suggested that the report prepared by Detective
Inspector A King in respect of Liverpool supporters details evidence on the
pattern of some supporters. The Chairman asked Chief Inspector Bettison to
make copies available to the group members.

Regarding departures, Superintendent Simpson said there is always a potential
for fans leaving early and congregating outside the ground in order to create
a public order situation.

It was agreed that segregation of supporters is essential.

The Chairman decreed that our Orders will reflect contingency arrangements as
appropriate apropos the above.

Turning to recommendations 31/34 concerning communications, the Chairman said
that once these matters contained in these recommendations have been addressed
then the details will need to be included in the Order. The proposal was
agreed,

The Chairman suggested that in order to comply with recommendation 36, ie, the
requirement to provide the emergency services with information about evening
football matches, a copy of the Operational Order should be supplied to them
with the relevant information contained therein at least five days before the
match. Changes will be notified to nominated officers. The proposal was
agreed.
The Chairman said that Operational Orders should also include the contingency
plans for the arrival at each football ground of emergency service vehicles,
which should include routes of access, rendezvous points and accessibility
with the ground itself. Also the police officer posted at the entrances of
the ground should be identified and included in the Order (recommendations 37
and 38). The proposal was agreed.


        6.3   Liaison with Emergency Services

The Chairman referred to the 'Note for File' dated 9 August 1989, which was
circulated at the meeting. He said that he had met with the Ambulance Service
regarding recommendations 35 to 38 and it has been agreed that Mr Morley,
Assistant Chief Ambulance Officer, will be the nominated officer required at
recommendation 35 to liaise regularly concerning crowd safety at each of the
grounds. He said that it was seen that meeting twice a year outside the
Safety Certificate meetings may well be sufficient.

The Chairman asked for suggestions as to who should benominated as the senior
liaison officer for the police.    Afterdiscussion it was agreed that it should
be the sub-divisional commander   or his deputy for the division in which the
ground is situated.

The Chairman said that it was also agreed at that meeting that after receipt
of an Operational Order the Ambulance Service will notify the Divisional
Commander concerned of a specific liaison officer who, should there be any
changes we feel they need to beaware of, will be available to be contacted
both in the days preceeding and   on the day of the match.

The Chairman said he would endeavour to achieve a similarunderstanding   with
the Fire Service before 19 August 1989.


 7/89         ANY OTHER BUSINESS

        7.1   Implementation Programme

The Chairman circulated to members the proposed programme for the
implementation of the recommendations consisting of six phases (see Appendix
 'A'). He said that it is anticipated that phase one will have been completed
by the next meeting on Thursday 17 August 1989 and the agenda will take the
form of phase two in addition to the matters arising from the present meeting.
Not included is the Review of the Major Incident Plan. This will be the final
task.


        7.2   Manpower

Superintendent Marsh requested through the Chair if members would consider the
implementation of a proposal whereby the supply of manpower to other divisions
for football matches is undertaken after some careful consideration on their
selection to ensure maximum output from those officers. He suggested the use
of the Divisional PSUs.

The Chairman asked members to address their minds to this proposal for
discussion at a later meeting.
There being no further business the meeting closed at 4.25 pm. The next
meeting will be held at 10.30 am on Thursday 17 August 1989 in the Lecture
Theatre at Police Headquarters.

 8/89          MINUTES OF PREVIOUS MEETING

The minutes of the meeting held on 11 August 1989, were accepted as a true and
accurate record of that meeting with the following exceptions

        a.    Page four - item 5/89 - paragraph two

        The sentence "The Secretary, Chief Inspector Bettison, confirmed that
        each member was in possession of these documents" should be amended to
        read "The Secretary, Chief Inspector Bettison, confirmed that each member
        was in possession of the documents relevant to their functional
        responsibility".

        b.    Page five - item 6.1 - paragraph five

        The sentence "He said the computer has been programmed to sound an alarm
        when the capacity has been reached" should be amended to read "He said
        the computer has been programmed to sound an alarm when the crowd reached
        10% off capacity".

        c. The Chairman referred to item (v) of minute 5/89 - 'The ACPO Guide to
        Policing Football' and asked Chief Inspector Beal to add this document to
        his existing functional responsibilities.

        d. The Chairman referred to item (vii) of minute 5/89 - 'South Yorkshire
        Police - Standing Instructions for the Policing of Football Grounds' and
        asked Superintendent Oughton to add this document to his existing
        functional responsibilities.


 9/89          MATTERS ARISING FROM THE PREVIOUS   MINUTES (11   AUGUST 1989)

        9.1   Written Agreements (item 6.1)

The Chairman said that he is endeavouring to attain a common position across
the Force in respect of police/club responsibilities at each of the grounds,
in order to achieve a situation whereby any officer of this Force assigned to
a football match in South Yorkshire will   be fully   aware oftheir
responsibilities and that of the clubs.    He added   that theagreements are a
major step in that direction.
Mr Hayes informed the group that a meeting with representatives from each of
the clubs will take place at Police Headquarters on Thursday 24 August 1989 to
discuss the recommendations by Lord Justice Taylor.

The Chairman said that although the agreements firmly put the responsibility
of implementing recommendations three and five with the clubs, paragraph 165
of the Taylor Report states

     'There remains, however, the question whether there are some grounds or
     parts of grounds where the club may need to rely upon the police (whom
     they pay to attend) to control filling of pens and monitoring them for
     overcrowding. In other words, whilst the duty in law to ensure safety
     rests upon the club, they may need, and by agreement be entitled, to
     employ the police to act as their agents in certain circumstances. This
     very difficult and grey area as to club and police responsibility will
     need to be reviewed in greater depth at stage two of this Inquiry.1
                                                       q\
He said there is also the ACPO submission at paragraph 19 of their report
which indicates that crowd control is always going to be inextricably linked
to criminal hooliganism and the police will never accept direction from
stewards. It is suggested in these circumstances the police must accept a
leading role and despite the requirements and civil liabilities of football
clubs themselves take on supervision of the overall conduct of events wherever
crowd safety is an issue.

The Chairman said that all officers will be briefed that they are primarily
concerned with crowd safety and this should be included in the Operational
Order.

Mr Hayes ascertained that each club had now reviewed the maximum capacities in
each section of their ground as per recommendation two of the Taylor Report.
At the request of Superintendent Torr, the Chairman asked members to be in a
position to relate the reviewed permissible density for each section of the
terracing.

Chief Superintendent Broomhead asked that with the exception of 'A' Division
members should forward copies of the amended Safety Certificates directly to
him for his information.

Superintendent Simpson said that the police have an input into each of the
Ground Safety Certificates and suggested that the Force strive for a common
policy in this respect. Superintendent Marsh said that the Fire and
Ambulance Services had also suggested that the four Districts should meet to
agree common policy. The Chairman said that this was a valid suggestion and
the proposal will be put to them.

Chief Superintendent Broomhead reported to the meeting that the written
agreement required by recommendation four had been agreed and signed by
Doncaster Rovers, Sheffield Wednesday and Sheffield United.

Superintendent Oughton said it is likely the agreement with Rotherham United
will be completed by noon on Friday 18 August 1989.

Superintendent Simpson said regarding Barnsley Football Club he had handed the
agreement to the Club Secretary, Mr Spinks, and they are now considering it.
     9.2   Operational Orders (item 6.2)

Superintendent Simpson stated that he had commenced the collation of the South
Yorkshire Orders together with Operational Orders from other Forces. He said
after research has been completed he will commence the production of a draft
'model' Order for consideration by the Implementation Team.


     9.3   Liaison with Emergency Services (item 6.3)

Regarding the service of Operational Orders to the Ambulance and Fire
Services, the Chairman said that it has been initially agreed the Order will
be served five days in advance of the match but after discussion it was agreed
this should be reduced to three days.

The Chairman referred to 'Note for File' dated 14 August 1989,   which was
circulated at the meeting. He said he had spoken to the Chief    Fire Officer
regarding recommendations 35 to 38 and it has been agreed that   Mr Alan Seaman,
Assistant Chief Fire Officer, will be the nominated officer as   required by
recommendation 35 in respect of arrangements in the County.

Superintendent Oughton said that each sub-divisional commander has now met
with the local nominated officers from the Ambulance and Fire Services and the
arrangements have been agreed for the service of the Operational Orders direct
to the local liaison officer.

The liaison officers are as follows:-

     Doncaster       Ambulance Service        Mr Wade
                     Fire Service             Mr Pritchard

     Rotherham       Ambulance Service        Mr Eason
                     Fire Service             Mr Copley

     Barnsley        Ambulance Service        Mr Horner
                     Fire Service             Mr Robbins

     Sheffield       Ambulance Service        Mr Morley
     United          Fire Service             Mr Liversidge

     Sheffield       Ambulance Service        Mr Higgins
     Wednesday       Fire Service             Mr Ryder

The Chairman asked what method was to be employed in order to communicate
alterations which might occur after the service of the Operational Order.
Superintendent Hale suggested the use of a telex. This was agreed.

Superintendent Oughton informed the meeting that the contingency plans for the
arrival of emergency services at each of the grounds have now been agreed in
accordance with recommendation 37.


     9.4   Additional Manpower Costs (item 6.1)

Superintendent Hale said that at present the criteria for charging the clubs
is laid down in the form of a commercial contract between the Police Authority
and each club. This contract includes the scale of charges based on the
estimated crowd.
The contract itself is relatively new and was not introduced until the 1987/88
season and resulted from the problems encountered in 1987 as a result of the
serious financial difficulties of Rotherham United.

Prior to the introduction to the contract the arrangements were that prior to
each season a meeting was held with the clubs to discuss the proposed scale of
charges.

Mr Hale said that following representation from the clubs that South Yorkshire
charges were comparatively higher than elsewhere in the country the charges
were reduced for the 1982/83 season to the criteria currently operating.

The Harris judgment clearly stated that the police duties inside the ground
are a special service and that the police were asked by the club to ensure
safety and generally supervise the crowd and most importantly the club should
pay for these services.

He said the financial implications for the police are considerable in manpower
terms alone, the cost of reserves for each match will add substantially to the
football budget. Additional areas of cost will be new communications
equipment and training.

Mr Hale said the Harris judgment states that the police inside the ground were
carrying out the duties owed by the club to those whom it had invited onto its
premises, ie the spectators, and that this is in addition to that which an
ordinary citizen would not expect and were not entitled. It was therefore a
special police service under Section 51(1) of the Police Act 1964 for which
the Police Authority could charge. Those duties on behalf of the club in
addition to public order were crowd management and safety/rescue and the
enforcement of ground regulations.

He said that it is quite clear that policing inside the ground and related to
the duties described above should be paid by each club. It is also clear that
criteria for levelling charges certainly does not now reflect the levels of
policing required by the Taylor report. Officers exclusively on duty inside
the ground include all officers designated to perimeter exits and exits out of
the ground in the event of an emergency. Added to this must be officers there
without specific essential duties, but responsible for general crowd
management.

He said the scale of manpower related to the crowd size was set prior to both
the Popplewell and Taylor Inquiries and because of this he argued that these
specific duties should form the minimum level of policing regardless of crowd
size and that thereafter additional police officers are added according to the
levels set out in the current criteria for levying charges.

Mr Hale suggested that the minimum levels for each ground would be   as at
Appendix 'A'.

He then outlined Appendix 'B' which gives the average manpower charged to the
club in the season 1988/89 and the effect of using the suggested new criteria
set out above. In addition there are other personnel whose duties are
essential to the football matches, but could be said to have functions
relating to both inside and outside the ground (Appendix 'C').

He said one other major area of cost are police reserves whichshould be built
into every match. However, the recommendation does not give any indication of
the numbers or who should pay, as it states they must be available for
deployment inside or outside the ground.

Mr Hale said if the above is used as a basis of charging the clubs, as a
general approximation the costs to the club would double. He added that his
suggestions are intended as points to discuss and are not intended as the only
way forward. He said that his suggestion does in fact produce an anomaly
whereby Sheffield United would in fact pay more than Sheffield Wednesday
despite lower average crowds simply because there are more gates to cover.

Chief Inspector Bettison stated that during the Inquiry he had held a
discussion with Mr Metcalf (solicitor for South Yorkshire Police) regarding
which officers on duty at Hillsborough were responsible to Sheffield Wednesday
Football Club by way of special services to the club under Section 51(1) of
the Police Act 1964. He said that Mr Metcalf was of the opinion that any
officer employed on the clubs property, either inside or outside the ground,
were employed as special services.

The Chairman said he intended to raise this issue with the Police Authority at
the meeting on 18 August 1989, particularly the cost of the police reserves,
and this item will be taken forward to the next meeting.


        9.5   Contingency Arrangements (item 6.2)

The Chairman referred to the discussion at the previous meeting regarding the
inclusion of contingency plans in the Operational Orders. He said there was
an urgent need to identify specific problems that could occur and the action
necessary to deal with them adequately.

During the ensuing discussion it was agreed that a core of contingency plans
will be common to each match, whilst others will be dependant on additional
factors. The Chairman asked Superintendent Simpson to prepare a paper
outlining the core of contingency plans to be implemented at each of the
grounds to be discussed at the next meeting.

Chief Superintendent Broomhead indicated that he intended to hold a sub-group
meeting with members of the Implementation Team on Friday 18 August and
Tuesday 22 August 1989 when the whole aspect of contingency plans will be
addressed. Core plans will be available in ground control rooms from the
start of the football season.


10/89         TRAINING IN CROWD DENSITIES (RECOMMENDATION SIX)

Superintendent Torr said that recommendation six outlined three main areas
with which all officers and stewards with duties in relation to the terraced
areas, particularly the designated officers and stewards on the perimeter
track, should be fully briefed and trained. These areas being -

        (a)   recognition of crowd densities;
        (b)   recognition of signs of distress; and,
        (c)   crowd dynamics.

He said that it is the intention to produce a training video of 15 minutes'
duration which will encompass the whole of those areas recommended and this
can be used to train officers and club stewards. However, production of the
video will not be completed for four/six weeks.
Mr Torr then presented a short video outlining the intended format.   The
format was agreed.

Superintendent Torr informed the meeting that he had organised a series of
photographs showing the various densities per 10 square metres and these will
be distributed to the sub-divisional commanders prior to the commencement of
the football season. The Chairman said these should also be brought to the
attention of the club stewards.

Mr Torr suggested that the designated officers should also be aware of the
agreed density for each area of the terracing.

Superintendent Simpson suggested that AVA department produce a video showing
how each of the five grounds in South Yorkshire should be policed and the
aspect of crowd densities could be included in that film.

Superintendent Torr circulated to the meeting an aide memoire outlining     the
symptoms, signs and treatment of compression of the chest and suggested     its
issue to all officers deployed in football duties. The Chairman agreed      to the
proposal and stated issue should take place immediately. He added that      the
club stewards should also be issued with copies.


11/89    CCTV/TURNSTILE MONITORING EQUIPMENT

Chief Inspector Beal said that CCTV was funded by the Football Trust in 1981
for the installation of the first purpose built closed circuit television
system at Aston Villa Football Club, Birmingham. Since that time the
development of CCTV has been away from its use as a Command and Control
facility towards its use as an intelligence and evidence gathering system.

He said both the ACPO Public Order Guide and ACPO Working Party Report on CCTV
highlight this move and it is interesting to note that nowhere in either of
these weighty volumes is the monitoring of crowd safety by CCTV even
considered.

Mr Beal said the limited timescale given to achieving this review of both CCTV
and turnstile counting equipment throughout South Yorkshire had necessitated
those involved in undertaking brief surveys at the grounds in question and
making 'estimates' in respect of installation costs of such equipment.
Therefore, the information can only be used as a guidance for further
discussions with clubs.

On behalf of Superintendent Sleath he wished to record his thanks to the staff
of the AVA department and in particular Sergeant Foster and Mr Hall, for their
assistance in completing the surveys in the short time allowed.

Mr Beal then outlined the details of the survey in respect of each club
(Appendix 'D').

The Chairman said that it is important that the systems installed enable the
monitoring of crowd densities outside the ground, within concourse areas and
in pens and other standing areas in line with recommendation 21 of the Taylor
Report.

The Chairman referred to recommendation 30 which states that there should be
available in the police control room the results of all closed circuit
television monitoring both inside and outside the ground and asked what was
the implications of this recommendation for the clubs in this Force area.

Chief Inspector Beal said that Sheffield Wednesday presently have a CCTV
monitoring system linked to their own control room and arrangements are in
hand to link this system into the existing system in the police control room
and this will increase the present number of monitors from seven to nine.

After further discussion the Chairman thanked Chief Inspector Beal and said
the survey should form the basis of further discussions with the clubs.

Superintendent Simpson said the Football Trust carried out surveys of the CCTV
systems at the South Yorkshire clubs which were completed last year. He said
that Mr Andrew Fordham from the Home Office Scientific Research & Development
Branch was carrying out those surveys and suggested that it may be beneficial
to consult with him. This was agreed and Chief Inspector Beal will do so.

Chief Inspector Beal said the report (Appendix 'D') also contains a survey of
the turnstiles in operation at each of the grounds and outlines the required
work and estimated cost to comply with the second part of recommendation 30,
ie, there should be available in the police control room the results of any
electronic or mechanical counting of numbers at turnstiles or of numbers
admitted to any area of the ground.


12/89       COMMUNICATIONS - RECOMMENDATIONS 31/34

Superintendent Marsh circulated at the meeting a discussion paper on the
aspects of communications as recommended by the Taylor Report.

The Chairman thanked Mr Marsh and stated that the paper will be discussed at
the next meeting.

The Chairman informed the meeting that the communications system at
Hillsborough had already been changed and the portable equipment replaced with
a permanent base station. The advantages are increased reliability, a built
in standby system and most importantly a technical change whereby even on
"talk through" the operator always maintains control. The intention is to
similarly replace the equipment at the other football grounds and a paper is
being submitted to the Finance & General Purposes Committee meeting on
15 September for the necessary finance.


13/89       ANY OTHER BUSINESS

        13.1 Tabards

The Chairman stated that the designated officers under recommendation nine
should wear a yellow tabard as a means of identification. He said that this
decision should be implemented from the first match of the season and sub-
divisional commanders should ensure they have sufficient numbers to comply.

Mr Hayes added that it is intended to purchase 'purpose made' tabards for this
use and asked members to suggest a suitable colour etc. at the next meeting.
                                    - 8 -


     13.2 Advisory Groups - Recommendation 17

The Chairman promoted a discussion concerning the formation of local authority

    SUMMARY
    BrariL.all Lane is reasonably well served by CCTV. Camera 'A' might be improved by re-siting away from the concrete pillar referred to.
    Experimental sighting with assistance of Fire Brigade is an option worthy of consideration. Approximate cost - £800. Camera 'B' would
    benefit from having a lens with a greater zoom ratio to enable better monitoring on crowd conditions at the opposite end of the ground
    (Bram all Lane terrace - front). Approximate cost - £3,000. Installation of cameras in the concoyrse areas at the rear of the Bram all
    Lane Stand and Cherry Street Stand would be necessary for these areas to be fully .monitored. Approximate total cost - £6,000. (no
    telemetry required). Picture quality inside the ground would be much improved by the installation of enhanced lighting particularly in
    covered areas. The power supply to Bram_.all Lane is such that when a heavy electrical load is in use (floodlighting), there is a
    considerable adverse effect op CCTV equipment. A consultants/contractors opinion would need to be sought on this issue.

 SUMMARY
 Perhaps the poorest picture quality of the South Yorkshire Clubs. Turnstiles for away supporters Millmoor Lane are not covered by any
 camera. This is a potentially dangerous area in public order/public safety terms. Approximate cost - £5,000. There is no camera
    ering the concourse behind the Tivoli Stand. Again an area where public safety could be seriously effected. Approximate cost - £3,OOC

 ■   telemetry required). There is no camera cov^kig the concourse beneath the Main Stj»d which serves the members 'facilities' (bars
    etc). This is an area quite: heavily used and is U p otential fire risk. Approxim il        l mill    (no telemetry required). Picture
 quality inside the ground could be improved by installation of enhanced lighting particularly in the covered areas.

SUMMARY
Perhaps the best quality pictures of all the South Yorkshire clubs.

There is no camera facility to monitor the front of the crowd who occupy the PaddockTerraces.      Installation of a camera on the Brevvery
Stand would overcome this inability. Approximate cost £5,000

There is no camera facility to monitor the turnstiles at the rear of the PontefractRoad   Stand.   Approximate cost £5,000

Camera 'B' would be enhanced by the addition of infra-red lighting for night work.   Approximate cost - £500

Overall picture quality would be enhanced by up-grading of lighting throughout the ground particularly in covered areas.

 SUMMARY
 A small football ground with limited facilities.

 Re-siting camera 'A' to give only a view of the turnstiles would give no view at all of the Rossington end of the ground, but would
 improve the view of the build-up of crowds at turnstiles. Approximate cost - £800.OOp

 Siting a further camera giving a view into the Stand with a suitable zoom facility would enable overcrowding and crowd distress to be
 monitored throughout the ground. Approximate cost - £5,000

 The limitation on low light capabilites is brought about by poor lighting, a problem encountered by all South Yorkshire clubs.
 Enhancement of the lighting, particularly in covered areas would greatly improve the picture quality.

SUMMARY
Hillsborough is reasonably well served by CCTV. Camera 'A' could be improved by re-sighting on a pole above turnstiles Leppings Lane.
Approximate cost - £2,000. A re-sighting exercise with Fire Brigade was carried out earlier this year, but until the future plans for thi
area are announced by the club, it is unlikely that re-sighting will take place. Camera 1C 1 would be more effective in assessing crowd
distress were it fitted with a higher ratio zoom lens. Approximate cost - £3*000. Two concourse areas in the North Stand and* concourse
facilities in the South Stand would also require monitoring. Approximate"cost - £9,000. (no telemetry).    15 other CCTV cameras belonging
to the club monitor turnstiles and areas behind turnstiles throughout the ground. These are monitored in the Club Control Room. The cost
of extending such monitors to Police Ground Control would be Approximately £4,000, but is physically impossible at present owing to the
sM   of the Police Control Room. Improved picture quality inside the ground would be obtained by the installation of enhanced lighting
particularly in covered areas .
SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL GROUND


1.     The Sh e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y Football G r o u n d has a total of 93
       Turns t i l e s of the r o t a t i n g barr i e r type and are
       f o r m u l a t e d as follows:

        1-8,   9-16 and A-G.

       For the f o r t h c o m i n g season, b e a r i n g in m i n d the west
       stand will only be used, t u r n s t i l e s A-G will be in use.
       However, should there be an ove r s p i l l in m o r e spectators,
       than these can cope with, then t u r n s t i l e s 9-16 wil l be
       used.

       On the south stand area, t u r n s t i l e s 19-22 will be used
       for the seated, u n c o v e r e d area up to the h a l f w a y line and
       turns t i l e s 22-28, 29-32, wil l be used for the south stand
       centre and w i n g sections.

       Turn s t i l e s 33-36 wil l be used for the u n c o v e r e d seated
       area between the Kop and the h a l f w a y line of the south
       stand. Turn s t i l e s 37-42, 43-48, 49-54, 55-72, 73 and 76,
       c o v ering the w h o l e of the Ko p area.   Any persons e n t e r i n g
       into those t u r n s t i l e s can go in any part of the Kop, he
       or she desires.

       Turn s t i l e s   77-78 wil l be u sed e x c l u s i v e l y for the north
       stand.

        S e c urity Room under the south stand.                       At this stage in
        time, there is no Police link ava i l a b l e from the Security
        Roo m to Ground C o n t r o l .

3.     I d e n t i f i c a t i o n of c a p a c i t y is via a light w a r n i n g in the
        S e c urity Room, w h e n figures get w i t h i n 10% of capacity.
        However, it m u s t be n oted that this is total c a p acity of
        section, eg Kop and south stand.

       No other form of c o u n t i n g takes place at the S h e f f i e l d
       W e d n e s d a y Football Ground.

4.     The cost of e x t e n d i n g the C o m p u t e r V D U to the Police
        Control Room, w o u l d be £700 but the system c u r r e n t l y does
        not have the c a p a c i t y to achieve this and the Control
        Room has ver y little space ava i l a b l e for such a facility.

             MEETING OF THE TAYLOR RECOMMENDATIONS IMPLEMENTATION TEAM
                     HELD AT 2.30 PM ON THURSDAY 31 AUGUST 1989
                 IN THE RECRUIT INTERVIEW ROOM, POLICE HEADQUARTERS


Present:

P Hayes Esq QPM LLB MA, Deputy Chief Constable - Chairman
Chief Superintendent Broomhead
Superintendents Brookfield, Hale, Marsh, Parker, Simpson
Chief Inspectors Beal, Bettison, Chambers, Hellewell, Purdy, Waring,
   and Warne

Apologies for absence were received from Superintendents Greenwood, Oughton,
Sleath, Torr, and Chief Inspector Donnelly.



Before the meeting was called to order Mr Broomhead reported that on 30 August
1989 he had met with the Fire Service and SYMAS, Fire Service represented by
Messrs Seaman and Ryder; SYMAS represented by Mr Morley. At the meeting it
had been pointed out to Mr Broomhead that the Operational Orders from around
the various divisions had material differences. The Fire Service were
particularly keen that emergency evacuation procedures - i.e. those that begin
'Mr Meadows' - are not consistently entered on Operational Orders. Chief
Superintendent Broomhead requested that all future Operational Orders contain
this information and that Superintendent Simpson take account of the
inconsistency problem apropos the model report he is preparing.

Mr Broomhead reported the agreement he had reached with the emergency services
representatives on delivery of the Operational Orders. Two copies to be
delivered to the Fire Service Headquarters Control, one copy to SYMAS Control.
For a Saturday game, on the Wednesday preceding that game; for a mid-week
match, on the Saturday preceding that game. The point of contact out of hours
is the Control Rooms of the respective emergency services who will determine
whether to handle the query within the Control Room or call out the respective
contact personnel.

It is important that any departures from the safety certificate, e.g. change
of turnstile allocation or alterations to sections of the ground, must be
brought to the attention of the emergency services contact officers. Chief
Superintendent Broomhead reported that the Chief Superintendent (Operations)
is to meet with the emergency services liaison officers bi-annually. He also
reported that the Fire Service is reviewing the emergency evacuation
procedures at each of the grounds.

Meeting called to order.


14/89        MINUTES OF PREVIOUS MEETING

The minutes of the meeting held on 17 August 1989 were accepted as a true and
accurate record, with the following exceptions

        a.   line one of paragraph 4, page 2, should read "paragraph 91".

        b.   line three of paragraph 13.2, page 8, should read "sub-divisional
             commander or his deputy and the Operations Chief Superintendent or
             his deputy".
15/89        MATTERS ARISING FROM THE PREVIOUS MINUTES (17 AUGUST 1989)

        15.1 Written Agreements (item 9.1)

The Chairman notified the meeting that we have signed agreements from all
South Yorkshire football clubs.

        15.2 Manpower Costs (item 9.4)

The Chairman informed the meeting that on 18 August he had addressed the
Police Authority on the subject of the implementation of the Taylor
recommendations. He pointed out at that time that the implementation of these
recommendations would have increased cost effects which would need to be
addressed by them in due course.

The meeting was reminded that Superintendent Hale assisted by Chief Inspector
Donnelly is putting together a report on the cost arrangements for policing
football. Supt Hale confirmed that he was at the second draft stage of this
report and hoped to be able to present a working document in the next few
days.

             Item deferred pending Supt Hale's report.

        15.3 Contingency arrangements (item 9.5)

Chief Superintendent Broomhead reported the results of the sub-meeting on
22 August 1989 which was attended by the five sub-divisional commanders or
their representatives who have a responsibility for each of the five South
Yorkshire clubs. He referred to a report produced as a result of that meeting
which details the core arrangements for contingency planning. These core
arrangements are to be fleshed out by each of the sub-divisional commanders
concerned to include local factors. Chief Supt Broomhead had set a deadline
for 1 September 1989 for the submission of those local arrangements. All,
with the exception of 'C.' Division, were handed to the Secretary, Chief
Inspector Bettison. Chief Inspector Warne of 'C ' Division promised delivery
of local arrangements in respect of Rotherham United by 1 September 1989.

It was agreed that copies of the plans would be passed to the Force Operations
Room and that each sub-divisional commander would be responsible for ensuring
the plans are available at each football ground on the day of a football
match, and a copy filed at sub-divisions.

        15.4 CCTV (item 11/89)

Chief Superintendent Broomhead referred to a previous discussion that he had
held with representatives of the football clubs in South Yorkshire and had
offered South Yorkshire Police assistance in obtaining 'best advice' regarding
CCTV equipment and siting. He informed the meeting of a discussion with
Mr Fordham of Sandrich Home Office Research establishment. Mr Fordham
confirmed that South Yorkshire Police were the first to enquire about the
suitability of equipment. Mr Fordham agreed to seek advice, and to research
the matter further. He did confirm to Chief Supt Broomhead however that CCTV
equipment for the purpose of safety may be very different to that which exists
for evidence gathering at the moment.

             Item deferred to next meeting.
        15.5 Tabards (item 13.1)

The Chairman confirmed that tabards had been ordered for use by police
officers engaged in gate control at perimeter fences of football grounds.
They would be lime green in colour and be marked with the words 'Gate
Control1.

Chief Inspector Warne informed the meeting of problems encountered at a recent
match at Rotherham United where yellow tabards issued temporarily to police
officers had clashed with the yellow shirts of the visiting football team. It
was confirmed that lime green was unlikely to create a similar difficulty.

        15.6 Advisory Groups (item 13.2)

The question was posed whether the advisory group referred to in the
recommendations was to be seen in terms of an extended officer working party
on the Safety of Sports Ground Act or whether it was in addition to that group
and subordinate to it. After some discussion the Chairman confirmed that it
was really a matter for the local authority to decide, but he felt that we
should have consistency across the various local authorities within the
county. The Safety of Sports Ground Act of 1975 was consulted and this failed
to resolve the issue.

After some discussion the Chairman decided that the police stance would be
that such advisory groups should be separate from the officer working groups.
For one thing, the presence of a representative of the football club on the
group may compromise decisions taken by the group to enforce the club to take
certain action.


16/89       MEETING WITH FOOTBALL OFFICIALS

The Chairman introduced this item by referring to minutes of the meeting which
was held at Niagara Sportsground on 24 August 1989. The minutes were
circulated to this meeting and the opportunity was taken to read the minutes.

The Chairman informed the meeting that discussions had taken place about the
recommendations that still needed to be implemented, e.g. CCTV, and the
difficulties the clubs might experience in getting the individual advice to
enable them to implement the recommendations. The view of the club
representatives had been that our own deliberations, as an implementation
team, might well direct their own thinking on an individual basis.

The Chairman had told the representatives of the football clubs that it was
intended, now that the 19 August deadline had been met successfully, to de­
centralise some of the implementation team's functions to take account of
their individual local needs. The emphasis is therefore now placed upon
divisional efforts towards implementing the recommendations of the Taylor
Report. The central implementation team meetings would continue to provide a
co-ordination of effort and a focus for the individual members.

A discussion then took place about local difficulties that individual members
were experiencing, particularly Superintendent Simpson at Barnsley and Chief
Inspector Chambers at Doncaster Rovers. The difficulties raised by each
officer concerned turnstile counting arrangements which appeared to be
ineffectual at the two grounds. The Chairman confirmed that we must continue
to press both clubs to effectively implement the Taylor recommendations in
this regard.
17/89       COMMUNICATIONS

Reference was made to a paper prepared by Superintendent Marsh which had been
circulated prior to the meeting.

        17.1 Transmitting equipment

The Chairman reminded the meeting of the limitations of the present equipment,
most notably a. there being no contingency plan in case of equipment failure,
and b. talk-through does not allow for priority by ground control. The
equipment to remedy these limitations was now in place at Hillsborough.
Mr Hayes told the meeting that on 15 September 1989 the Finance and General
Purposes Committee would be asked for monies to provide similar equipment at
the remaining grounds.

Supt Parker pointed out that the equipment has a facility to complement sub-
divisional equipment at Barnsley, Rotherham, and Doncaster. A similar
facility can be provided for each of the Sheffield clubs back to the host sub­
division if required. Neither representative from 'F' or 'D' Division pursued
the matter.

        17.2 Staffing levels

Supt Marsh in his report recommends a minimum of two officers in each football
ground control room. A lengthy discussion took place regarding the numbers of
officers to be given radios and the numbers of radios which can be monitored
and controlled by an individual operator. Supt Parker suggested a sensible
maximum of 50 radios to each operator. Supt Hale pointed out that in normal
circumstances at Bramall Lane 100 officers are controlled via radios through
one operator. The Chairman pointed out that in implementing these
recommendations we were not catering for the normal but must take account for
abnormal circumstances such as occurred at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989.
Supt Parker pointed out that at a time of an emergency such as occurred at
Hillsborough 20 radios would overwhelm the system. It was difficult therefore
to have a realistic network for normal circumstances which nevertheless meet
emergency demand. Supt Hale suggested a need to look more fundamentally at
separate channels and recommended the use of a command channel for ground
commander and selected senior officers up to a maximum of 12 in number. He
pointed out that the latest equipment had the facility to scan both a standard
channel and a command channel and therefore these commanders would receive all
messages.

Discussion then took place about the nature of the equipment and the
facilities available. The Chairman decided that trials of this dual channel
system of communications would take place at each of the football grounds in
the near future and asked Supt Parker to arrange. The results of these trials
would then be brought back to a future meeting and a decision could be based
on the empirical experience of each ground commander.

For the time being it was decided that two officers would operate the single
communications channel at all grounds, except Doncaster Rovers. Chief
Inspector Chambers confirmed that Doncaster Rovers, with a much lower radio
cover, could normally be controlled by one officer. The Chairman agreed that
one officer could continue to perform the task at Doncaster except where
exceptional circumstances, e.g. large or potentially unruly crowds. In these
cases two officers would control the communication system. Supt Parker took
the opportunity at this stage to remind the meeting that there is a limited
supply of radios within the Force and that early and realistic demands on the
                                    - 5 -

existing supply would assist. All representatives from sub-divisions with a
football ground confirmed that they are now using the call sign that denotes
the football ground concerned, e.g. Hillsborough Control, Bramall Control,
etc. to overcome confusion which occasionally occurs when transmissions from
two grounds overlap.

     17 .3 Training

The Chairman raised the question, is it required, for if communications
trained officers are utilised for the task, then there is little else for them
to be trained in? Chief Inspector Purdy confirmed that communications
training could not simulate emergency conditions at football grounds. It was
agreed by the meeting that the need for training is therefore not apparent.
Chief Superintendent Broomhead suggested a need for ground commanders to visit
the various grounds in South Yorkshire to identify best practice in terms of
communications and control. The Chairman put this to the meeting for
individual action of ground commanders where they felt necessary.

     17.4 Radio Channels

The Chairman suggested that this matter had been covered in 17.1.

     17.5 Acoustics

It was revealed that all ground control rooms were sufficiently soundproofed
with the exception of Bramall Lane and Hillsborough. Sheffield United were
providing new facilities at Bramall Lane and soundproofing would be taken into
account. Chief Inspector Beal confirmed that Sheffield Wednesday football
club are constructing a new control room within a south stand development at
Hillsborough before the 1990/91 season. He had already made representations
to the club that the control room should be adequately soundproofed.

          Item discharged.

     17.6 Land Lines

The Taylor Report recommends land lines located at appropriate points of the
ground - such areas might include the perimeter track, the rear of terraced
areas, and points outside the ground. Supt Parker confirmed that British
Telecom could install such equipment and estimate a cost of about £2,000 for
each system. The Chairman asked the divisional representatives to visit each
of the football grounds in company with Supt Marsh to decide upon the optimum
numbers and positions of telephones required. The club should be informed
that telephones could usefully be sited on the perimeter track, at least four
in number, and that where possible telephone links should be established with
each of the turnstile areas within the ground. The telephones should be
waterproof, vandal-proof, have a two-way call facility, and be equipped with a
flashing light to warn officers nearby of a call. There should also be a
volume control on each of the handsets. Divisional representatives were asked
to return with the plans for such a system and Supt Parker was asked to
examine further equipment availability, costs, etc.

          Item deferred.

     17.7 Public Address Systems

Supt Hale confirmed that Sheffield United football club are installing, within
the next week or two, a zoned public address system of the type envisaged by
                                        - 6 -

    Lord Justice Taylor. The Chairman asked ground commanders from the other
    football clubs to visit Sheffield United before the next meeting to produce a
    plan of their own ground showing where installation should be made. The
    various plans, estimates, etc. should be passed in the meantime to Chief
    Superintendent Broomhead. The Chairman suggested that the review of public
    address systems could take place at the same time as the review of the
    telephone systems at the grounds.

                 Item deferred.

            17.8 Illuminated Boards

    It was discovered that only two of the five football clubs have illuminated
    boards. Supt Hale informed the meeting that certain police messages are
    passed at Sheffield United football club via the illuminated board. Supt Hale
    was aware of the limitations of these messages as the board could not be seen
    from all parts of the ground.

    Chief Insp Beal stated that whilst Sheffield Wednesday does have such an
    electronic board the police have never sought to use it for messages.

    The item was discharged by the Chairman who asked Chief Insp Beal to examine
    the use made of the Sheffield United board by Supt Hale and to examine the
    value of implementing such use at Hillsborough.

            17.9 Hand Signals

    Supt Marsh confirmed that an ACPO working party chaired by Mr Hadfield was
    examining the question of hand signals by police officers nation wide. The
    Chairman directed that South Yorkshire Police would await the recommendations
    of that ACPO working party.

                 Item deferred.


    18/89       ANY OTHER BUSINESS

    Chief Superintendent Broomhead asked all representatives to furnish plans of
    their football grounds as they had been requested to do at a previous meeting.

             MINUTES OF THE TAYLOR RECOMMENDATIONS IMPLEMENTATION TEAM
                    HELD AT 10.00 AM ON FRIDAY 22 SEPTEMBER 1989
                    IN THE LECTURE THEATRE, POLICE HEADQUARTERS


Present:

P Hayes Esq QPM LLB MA, Deputy Chief Constable - (Chairman)
T F Broomhead Esq, A/Assistant Chief Constable (Operations)
Superintendents Greenwood, Oughton and Parker
Chief Inspectors Beal, Bettison, Donnelly, Edmundson, Hellewell, Purdy, and
   Waring
Sergeant        ~|


Apologies for absence were received from Superintendents Brookfield, Hale,
Marsh, Simpson (all on annual leave) and Sleath (on a course).


Before the meeting was called to order the Chairman reminded all members to
table discussion papers at a time sufficiently in advance of the meeting at
which those papers are to be discussed. A copy of all relevant papers to be
provided through           Chairman's secretary, for his attention.

Meeting called to order.


20/89       MINUTES OF PREVIOUS MEETING

The minutes of the meeting held on 31 August 1989, which had been previously
circulated, were accepted as a true and accurate record with the following
exception:-

        item 15.4, page two, the representative of the Home Office Research
        Establishment should read Mr Ford not Mr Fordham.


21/89       MATTERS ARISING FROM THE MINUTES

        21.1 Manpower Costs

The Chairman told the meeting that the process of collating the data to enable
costs to be calculated is on-going. Mr Hayes indicated that the ACPO may
attempt to establish some national guidelines in this regard and Mr Broomhead
told the meeting that the ACPO Sub-Committee on Hooliganism at Sports Grounds
is conducting a national survey to establish the costs involved in policing
football.

For the information of the meeting the Chairman reiterated that
representatives of the five football clubs in this area had agreed informally
to meet last year's agreement plus 9\% to cover recent pay increases. That
informal commitment is now being formalised. This arrangement will be
reviewed as soon as the on-going research into policing costs has been
completed.

(Please also see item 24/89 of these minutes in respect of manpower costs.)

Item deferred (pending further report from Supt Hale).
     21.2 Contingency Plans

Mr Broomhead has now received contingency plans from each of the relevant sub-
divisional commanders and is satisfied with their content. He asked that
copies be placed with Force Operations Room and that each sub-divisional
commander place a copy of the relevant contingency plans with his own sub-
divisional and ground control rooms.

Mr Broomhead reported that the following scenarios are covered by each of the
contingency plans:-

     a.   all ticket, or otherwise restricted, matches
     b.   early arrival of spectators
     c.   unexpected and joint arrival of large numbers of spectators
     d.   individual section of a ground approaching capacity
     e.   whole ground approaching capacity
     f.   late arrival of spectators
     g.    emergency opening of external gates (or forcing of external
             gates) thereby allowing influx of spectators
     h.   early departure of spectators from ground
     i.   emergency evacuation

The Chairman asked whether these contingencies were contained in the various
Operational Orders or merely referred to by those Orders. A discussion took
place on this subject and the Chairman concluded by reminding the meeting the
aim of the Operational Order must be to be comprehensive but to retain
simplicity. He recommended that the methodology of documenting contingency
plans on the Operational Order be refined and captured by the 'model'
Operational Order currently being prepared by Superintendent Simpson.

Chief Inspector Hellewell pointed out that he had tabled a discussion paper
produced by himself and Mr Simpson which might be discussed at the next
Implementation Team meeting. The Chairman agreed and asked Chief Inspector
Hellewell to take note in respect of contingency plan arrangements.

Item discharged.


     21.3 CCTV and Turnstile Monitoring

This item was deferred until later in the meeting.


     21.4 Tabards

Mr Broomhead reported that delivery of sufficient tabards for Force use will
be completed in three weeks. Mr Broomhead also pointed out that the ACPO Sub-
Committee on Hooliganism at Sports Grounds is considering the use of the
colour green for distinguishing emergency gates. Mr Broomhead has suggested
to that Committee that the tabards of officers who man such gates should also
be green in colour.

Item discharged.
     21.5 Meeting with Local Authorities (18.9.89)
     21.6 Advisory Groups

The above two items were taken together.

The Chairman reported the meeting with local authorities had taken place on
18 September and circulated to members a copy of the relevant minutes.

Mr Hayes highlighted a point made by Mr Paxton of Doncaster MBC regarding
police activity towards implementing the Taylor recommendations which was
taking place outside of the officer working group. He suggested the following
as a strategy for progressing recommendations through the officer working
group. He proposed that we continue to examine the means for implementing the
recommendations of the Taylor Report and, when complete, a package of
proposals will be prepared in respect of each of the football clubs. Sub-
divisional commanders will then be asked to consult with each club SEEKING
THEIR VIEWS NOT COMPLIANCE.  Following this consultation we will present the
package through the officer working party to the various local authorities.
Our proposals should provide an agenda for advancing the recommendations of
the Taylor Report. The clubs should be advised not to implement changes until
the views of the officer working group was known to them.

The Chairman reported the different constitutions to the 'Advisory Groups' as
envisaged by the four local authorities and reported the different investiture
of emergency powers to officers of the local authorities. These matters are
fully documented in the minutes of the meeting of 18 September.

Items discharged.


     21.7 Communications

          (i)   New Transmitting Equipment

The Chairman reported that at a meeting of the Finance & General Purposes
Committee of the Police Authority on 15 September 1989, it was resolved to
spend £25,000 to enable football grounds within South Yorkshire to be equipped
with base stations. This resolution is to be ratified at the full meeting of
the Police Authority on Friday 29 September.

Superintendent Parker reported that following ratification the equipment will
be delivered and installed within two/three weeks at each of the grounds.

Item discharged.


For items (ii) (iii) (iv) (v) - Chief Inspector Waring submitted a report
which is attached to the minutes.

          (ii) Radio Channels

Chief Inspector Waring spoke to his report. There was a general discussion
regarding the scanning of two separate channels.

Chief Inspector Donnelly reported that at Sheffield United the dual channel
trial had worked well albeit there were certain problems in ensuring
uninterrupted traffic. Superintendent Parker reported that this was due to
operator fault rather than any difficulty with the system.
Chief Inspector Hellewell reported that at Barnsley the trial was successful
but identified a further training need in that the inspectors using the
equipment could not get used to using the command channel without waiting for
a gap in general transmissions.

Chief Inspector Beal reported that at Sheffield Wednesday the trial was
successful albeit channel 19 chosen for the command channel interfered with
radio traffic from the Chesterfield football match in Derbyshire police force
area.

A general discussion took place and the Chairman concluded that the trials
with their separate command channel appeared to have been successful and
recommended our utilisation of the command channel in future. Regarding
training needs, the meeting felt there was sufficient expertise within
Divisions to carry out training 'on the ground'.

The Chairman recommended that a command channel be employed judiciously. He
asked Superintendent Parker to chair a sub-group to examine policy for
employment of a command channel. Mr Parker will meet together with Chief
Inspectors Waring and Hellewell.

Item deferred (pending recommendations of sub-group).


            (iii)   Land Lines

Chief Inspector Waring referred to his report and recommended that all clubs
be asked to adopt the policy of Sheffield United in inviting specialist
companies to prepare a specification.

There followed a discussion about problems envisaged with telephone land lines
and various alternatives were considered. The Chairman pointed out that land
lines were an imperative of the Taylor recommendations and must therefore be
pursued. He reviewed our progress to date in that the police have tried to
establish where the land lines should be located and suggested various
specifications such as security of equipment, flashing lights to indicate a
call, etc.

The Chairman asked that the same communications sub-group examine a common
specification for systems at grounds in South Yorkshire. Superintendent
Parker pointed out that Sheffield United must be told of this initiative and
asked to await our proposals. Mr Broomhead agreed to speak with
representatives of the club.

Item deferred (pending recommendations of sub-group).


     (iv)   Public Address Systems

Chief Inspector Waring referred to his report and said each of the grounds has
a public address system. Sheffield United are re-equipping and are likely to
acquire an excellent p.a. system but each of the other grounds had
deficiencies in respect of their systems. Surveys having been completed at
each of the grounds, the Chairman decided that our results should form part of
the package to be subsequently discussed with the clubs and put before the
officer working groups.

Item discharged.
        (v)   Hand Signals

Chief Inspector Waring again referred to his paper and pointed out that the
question of hand signals had been raised by South Yorkshire Police with the
Public Order Forward Planning Unit. In turn they had referred it to the ACPO
Sub-Committee on Public Order. Superintendent Revill-Johnson had visited
South Yorkshire and had reported as recently as 22 September that six hand
signals were proposed. These have to be ratified before the ACPO Sub-
Committee and ultimately before the ACPO itself. The Chairman proposed that
we await ACPO recommendation.

Superintendent Oughton raised the problem of the difficulty of seeing officers
deployed to areas around the ground. The Chairman suggested that the ACPO
Sub-Committee would presumably take this into account in arriving at
recommendations.

A discussion took place about the advisability of issuing officers with high
visibility clothing. The Chairman proposed that we await Lord Justice
Taylor's Final Report as he may offer further recommendations on such matters.

Item deferred.


        2.8 CCTV/Turnstile Monitoring

Chief Inspector Beal referred to a report submitted by Superintendent Sleath
on 17 August 1989 dealing with this matter. He proposed to visit three
football grounds in the near future to examine CCTV equipment installed at
those grounds.

The Chairman thanked Superintendent Sleath and Chief Inspector Beal for the
progress they had made. He asked that they report back following their visits
by which time the research into CCTV and turnstile monitoring equipment would
be as far advanced as this Implementation Team could take it. The information
could then join the package of proposals to be discussed with the club and
laid before the officer working parties.

Item deferred.


22/89         FORCE MAJOR INCIDENT ROOM

Chief Inspector Edmundson referred to his report and pointed out that officers
deployed to the Force Major Incident Room were providing feedback to ground
commanders on the performance of their ground control rooms.

The Chairman enjoined the meeting to positively look at communications
procedure at their respective ground and to firmly manage the practices
employed there.

Item discharged.


23/89         TRAINING IN CROWD DENSITIES

Chief Inspector Purdy reported that the video was nearing completion but
required a commentary adding to the pictures. He agreed to arrange for a
showing of the video (without commentary) at the next Implementation Team
meeting.
In respect of crowd densities the Chairman established progress was being made
at each football ground to produce photographs showing varying densities in
the different sections of the ground.

Chief Inspector Beal told the meeting of an initiative at Hillsborough whereby
ground control obtains, from time-to-time, a computerised total of the number
of people entering a particular section. Officers on duty are then advised to
take note of that section and are told how many people are contained therein.
The Chairman commended this initiative to all other ground commanders.

Item deferred.


24/89     MANPOWER REQUIREMENTS

See item 21.1 previously.

The Chairman outlined a plan to develop a formula for establishing a standard,
but realistic, charging policy in respect of each of the five South Yorkshire
football clubs. He referred to a chart (attached) prepared by Superintendent
Hale.

The chart broke down policing deployment at football matches into 15
categories. Each of the categories was discussed by the meeting to establish
those which should, and those which should not, be included in the formula for
police costs. Resolved as follows


     1.   Perimeter gate officers                                In
     2.   Emergency gates officers                               In
     3.   Control room officers                                  In
     4.   Officers deployed to emergency routes within stadia    In
     5.   Searching fans and enforcing ground regulations        In
     6.   Chief supervision and management                       In
     7.   Preserving routes for emergency vehicle access         In
     8.   Logistics staff                                        Out
     9.   Supervisors - to be established on a pro rata basis
            when total manpower requirement is known
    10.   Mobile patrols                                         Out
    11.   Detention room staff                                   In
    12.   Civilian operatives                                    Out
    13.   Mounted officers                                       In
    14.   Dog section                                            Out
    15.   'Taylor' reserve                                       In

Ground commanders were asked to use the above list as a basis for determining
minimum manpower requirements for the purpose of levying charges on the
football clubs. He asked that they take account of two qualifications:-

     i)   that there should be no double counting of officers engaged
          at different duties at different phases of the match; and,

    ii)   the reserve be deployed inside the ground on a formula still
          to be resolved.

A proposed calculation formula for these reserves was distributed and the
Chairman asked that all members consider the formula prior to the next
meeting when manpower requirements will again be discussed.
Mr Broomhead made reference to the significant increases in manning levels at
football matches (discounting any increases made necessary by the Taylor
recommendations). Mr Broomhead asked that all members review their manning
levels for football matches to ensure that they are both necessary and
sufficient.

On this point Mr Broomhead made particular reference to the deployment of
mounted officers. There are 18 horses in Force and Mr Broomhead foresaw few
match days for the remainder of this year when it would be necessary to
request mutual aid from surrounding Forces. He asked all members to be
sensible when requiring mounted support.

Item deferred.


25/89     ANY OTHER BUSINESS

Chief Inspector Beal asked for direction on a temporary policy of taking the
sub-divisional major incident box to each football match. The Chairman stated
that the practice should be not to take the major incident box to the football
match whilst ever it is to hand at the sub-division concerned.


The Chairman fixed the date for the next meeting for 10.00 am on Wednesday
4 October 1989, to be held in the Conference Room at Police Headquarters.


There being no further business the meeting closed at 12.10 pm.
           MINUTES OF THE TAYLOR RECOMMENDATIONS IMPLEMENTATION TEAM
                  HELD AT 10.00 AM ON WEDNESDAY 4 OCTOBER 1989
                  IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM, POLICE HEADQUARTERS


Present:

P Hayes Esq QPM LLB MA, Deputy Chief Constable - (Chairman)
T F Broomhead Esq, A/Assistant Chief Constable (Operations)
Superintendents Brookfield, Greenwood, Hale, Oughton, Parker, Simpson,
   Sleath,
Chief Inspectors, Bettison, Donnelly, Hellewell, Waring, Warne

Apologies for absence were received from Superintendent Marshand Chief
Inspector Beal (annual leave) and Chief Inspector   Purdy (otherduties).


26/89        MINUTES OF PREVIOUS MEETING

The minutes of the meeting held on 22 September 1989, which had been
previously circulated, were accepted as a true and accurate record.


27/89        MATTERS ARISING FROM THE MINUTES

        27.1 Manpower Costs

             (i)    Paper to Police Authority

The Chairman outlined to the meeting that a paper was being prepared to be
presented to the Police Authority suggesting a review of the recovery of
costs arising out of policing football in South Yorkshire. He highlighted
the fact that over the last two years costs had been in the region of £2
million and the Police Authority had recovered approximately 22% of that.

The South Yorkshire Police had received an opinion that police performing
duties outside the ground exclusively in relation to an event taking place
inside the ground were equally chargeable to the club.

The Chairman asked Chief Inspector Bettison to prepare a general paper for
the Police Authority updating them on the progress of implementing the
Taylor recommendations etc. The Chairman, in consultation with
Superintendent Hale, would provide a proposal for the review of charging
arrangements to be included in that general report.

Item discharged.

             (ii)    Proforma for post match statistics of manpower employed

Superintendent Hale introduced this item. In trying to cost the policing
of football matches for the last two seasons he had found disparity in the
collation of statistics of manpower employed. Supt Hale felt that any
future review of these costs ought to be based on accurate and consistent
statistics. He therefore asked all sub-divisional commanders to complete
and return the proformae which he had previously circulated to them. As
well as providing the basis for a review of costing arrangements these
proformae will also provide useful management information. Costs will be
extracted from the information by Finance Department and will form the
basis of Supt Hale's subsequent report.
The Chairman asked all sub-divisional commanders to complete the proformae
accordingly.

Item discharged.

           (iii)   Formula for calculation of costs

The formula for calculating the standing charge would be captured from the
proformae referred to above.

The Chairman then raised the question of calculating reserves to meet any
contingency at football grounds. Mr Broomhead pointed out that a national
review of 'reserves' had shown that there is no commonality of approach,
the numbers ranged from very small to very large numbers of reserves with
no apparent justification for differences. The Chairman pointed out that
the word 'sufficiency' in the Taylor recommendation was crucial. How are
we to calculate this? Superintendent Sleath pointed out that each
individual ground with its own contingency plans cannot be captured in
either a national or forcewide formula for reserve calculation.

A discussion took place on this point with several members pointing out
the need for local experience to determine need on an individual match
basis. The Chairman agreed that the ground commanders discretion was an
important factor.

Superintendent Simpson raised the question of having mounted officers in
reserve. A discussion took place on this issue. Chief Inspector Waring
pointed out that mounted and dog section officers were not plentiful and
therefore may not be suitable as reserve officers.

The Chairman proposed the calculation of reserves on the principle of
providing 'first aid'. In other words, the reserve should not be expected
to perform monumental tasks alone but should be available for rapid
deployment to an area of need and may be supplemented by additional
officers subsequently. These additional officers could be involved in
other aspects of the operation itself or be drawn from normal policing
strength or even from Operation Support.

On this basis the Chairman proposed that a reserve should never be less
than one sergeant and five constables, but need not in the majority of
cases be more than two sergeants and 20 constables. If a ground commander
thought it necessary to increase the reserve beyond this figure then he
should seek approval from ACC (Operations).

Superintendent Sleath made an alternative proposal: that ground commanders
produce a local formula for calculating the reserve based upon previous
experience of certain fixtures and anticipated need in respect of
subsequent fixtures, having regard to local contingency plans etc. The
clubs would be charged on the basis of this formula but the local ground
commander might increase or decrease the reserve if warranted by intelligence

After some discussion the Chairman invited all ground commanders to
attempt to provide a local formula and to consider the two proposals put
to the meeting, i.e.

(1)   a minimum reserve which may be supplemented according to the ground
      commander's discretion up to a certain level and thereafter on the
      approval of ACC (Operations);
(2)   the reserve to be at the ground commander's decision based upon a
      local formula for each club.

The Chairman asked for comments on these two proposals at the next meeting.

Item deferred.

At this point Superintendent Oughton raised the question of what he
considered to be wasteful deployment of officers manning gates onto the
perimeter track which were set in very low and easily climbed walls. The
Chairman's response was that having set the high standards which had been
required in respect of the Taylor recommendations, it was proposed that an
inspection team would subsequently review the arrangements at each club
aiming to achieve adequate, but realistic, standards.

      27.2   Communications

              (i) Command Channel

The Chairman asked two questions of Superintendent Parker.

(1)   With just four emergency radio channels can we cope with more than
      two games on any one day in South Yorkshire?

      Supt Parker's answer was a qualified 'yes', the channels could be
      mixed and matched so that each ground had two channels available
      without interfering with neighbouring grounds. Any of these
      permutations however would need to be tested.

(2)   What is the criteria for judicious use of these emergency channels?

      Supt Parker's answer was that the use is really at the discretion of
      the ground commander.

There followed a discussion about the perceived need for a command channel
at each of the five football grounds and the Chairman agreed that subject
to four days' notice to ACC (Operations) ground commanders could employ an
executive channel at any particular football match. The four days' notice
would enable Supt Parker's department to resolve any problems of
interference with the communications equipment at any other ground in
South Yorkshire or neighbouring force.

Superintendent Hale reminded the meeting that the command channel even
though employed would not be used except in an emergency. Whilst
regularly employed at Bramall Lane the command channel is little used.
The Chairman suggested to Superintendent Simpson that he might reflect the
use of command channel in his model order.

Item discharged.

             (ii)   Land Lines

The Chairman established that each club was aware of the police inspection
in respect of proposals for a telephone network. There would follow a
response to each local authority where the proposals for land lines etc.
would be incorporated. The Chairman therefore felt it was courteous to
inform the clubs of our proposed response to the licensing authority.
When the response in respect of an individual club was completed the
ground commander concerned would be asked to liaise with the club before
its formal presentation to the local authority.

Item discharged.

               (iii)   CCTV

Superintendent Sleath reported his intention to visit Chester Football
Club on Saturday 7 October to inspect an advanced CCTV system. The
Chairman asked that following this visit Supt Sleath should visit each of
the grounds in South Yorkshire and confirm that the existing report in
respect of CCTV was accurate in its proposals for each of the South
Yorkshire grounds. The proposals for CCTV would then form a part of the
package to be laid before the relevant local authority after discussion
with the clubs.

Item deferred.

        27.3    Turnstile Monitoring

The Chairman felt that the existing report captured what was in existence
at each of the football grounds in South Yorkshire but asked the meeting
if there were any recommendations of what should be in existence.

There then followed a discussion about local difficulties in respect of
turnstile monitoring that are encountered at Rotherham, Barnsley, and
Doncaster. Mr Broomhead pointed out that the written agreements with each of
the clubs made it clear what their responsibilities were in this area. It
appeared now that these three clubs were each failing to meet those
responsibilities. Mr Broomhead proposed to review the arrangements with each
individual ground commander.

The Chairman agreed and reminded the meeting that where the written
agreement with the club was revised in some way, or was being broken by the
club, then these matters should be raised centrally with ACC (Operations).
Also that any changes, even for a single match, had to be agreed first in
writing on the form designed for this purpose.

Item discharged.


28/89          AMBULANCES AT FOOTBALL GROUNDS

The Chairman referred to a report by Chief Inspector Edmundson and asked
all members to note the report for information only.

Item discharged.


29/89          BRITISH RAIL CONTINGENCY PLANS

Chief Inspector Waring introduced this item by speaking to the report
which had been circulated.

The item was discharged by the Chairman asking individual ground
commanders to liaise with Chief Inspector Waring in order to establish
where, in the event of British Rail being unable to provide rolling stock,
the stranded supporters should be collected.

Item discharged.


30/89         INSTRUCTIONS TO STEWARDS

Superintendent Sleath introduced this item by pointing out that at
Hillsborough written instructions to stewards were provided by the police,
and were in the process of being revised in accordance with the
recommendations of the Standing Instructions on Policing Football. Supt
Sleath proposed that such written instructions should have a forcewide
commonality.

A discussion ensued during which the question of training of stewards was
raised. The Chairman pointed out that the responsibility for stewards'
duties at each ground remained with the club, but training and briefing of
stewards is certainly something with which the police can assist.

The Chairman asked whether photographs were being prepared at each of the
grounds to show the variable density of spectators in sections of the
ground. The photographs were either prepared or in the process of
preparation at each of the grounds.

The Chairman asked Superintendent Oughton to look at the question of
training and briefing of stewards and the written instructions provided to
stewards throughout the force and to report back at the next meeting.

Item deferred.


31/89         'MODEL' FOOTBALL MATCH ORDER

Superintendent Simpson introduced this item and spoke to the report which
had been previously circulated.

Chief Inspector Hellewell had compared football match orders from many
police forces in England and Wales. After describing several such orders
he referred to the Hampshire orders as a model for the preparation of
orders in South Yorkshire. After some discussion this was agreed by the
meeting.

Supt Simpson then referred to page 7 of his report, in particular
paragraph 5. He invited comment on the question of:-

              overall strategy
              command structures
              sectorisation
              deployment of resources
              briefing and debriefing of personnel

        (i)    Overall strategy

A form of words was to be produced by Supt Simpson and brought back to a
subsequent meeting for approval.
         (ii)     Command structures

After discussion it was agreed that different command structures were
necessarily employed at different grounds and this was quite acceptable.
The model order should reflect this variation.

        (iii)     Sectorisation

After some discussion it was agreed there was no perceived advantage in
colour coding and that sectorisation of South Yorkshire grounds would
remain as it is at present.

         (iv)     Deployment of resources

The consideration was whether officers should be deployed to static
positions or be deployed to alternating positions at different phases of
the operation.

After some discussion it was agreed that phasing was both necessary and an
efficient use of resources. The model order should therefore reflect this
practice. It was pointed out however that the phases do not coincide at
each of the five grounds and, in order to overcome any difficulties that
this creates, the various phases should be announced by ground control at
the time of change-over.

          (v)     Briefing and debriefing of personnel

Supt Simpson would like to capture these items in the model order. Current
policy is that the match commander fully briefs sergeants and above and
performs an initial briefing of all officers involved in the operation.
The sergeants are then expected to more fully brief their individual serial.
This was echoed by other members of the meeting.

The Chairman asked that each officer pass to Supt Simpson their individual
format for briefing from which he might establish best practice and
include such in the model order.

The Chairman asked Supt Simpson to produce a model order including a
briefing document and to hand that out at a subsequent meeting for further
discussion.

Supt Simpson raised the question of providing information about a football
match event to the emergency services. Currently we provide a copy of the
full operational order. He produced a proforma which might include the
information required by the emergency services but would omit irrelevant
information.

The Chairman agreed that the proforma be taken into use and asked Mr Broomhead
to call a meeting with the emergency services to ratify this proposal.

The 'model' football match order item was deferred.


32/89           ANY OTHER BUSINESS

Mr Broomhead asked that all ground commanders acquire and provide plans
from the football clubs showing the deployment of stewards monitoring the
crowd for signs of over crowding from the perimeter track.
    4

                                          -   7 -

        Mr Broomhead told the meeting that he had asked Operations Division, in
        particular Inspector Hand-Davis, to project the need for mounted officers
        at forthcoming football matches in South Yorkshire. From these projections
        ground commanders would be told what mounted support was available for
        their use.

        Supt Sleath asked the meeting to consider a policy for non-ticketholders.
        Mr Broomhead told the meeting that at a pre-season meeting with football
        clubs in 1987 a policy had been established that non-ticketholders would
        not be allowed to enter the ground. Supt Sleath pointed out that this
        rigid policy was causing him local difficulties. Because of the closure
        of Leppings Lane terraces, 'away' supporters were restricted to ticket-
        holders only. Supt Sleath had, and needed, a contingency plan for dealing
        with large numbers of non-ticketholders by allowing them entry to a section
        of the ground. The Chairman asked that this be an agenda item for the next
        meeting at which it could be fully explored.

        The Chairman pointed out that by the end of October it was his intention
        that the Taylor recommendations should be completed insofar as the South
        Yorkshire Police were involved in their implementation. It was proposed
        now that ground commanders would visit Mr Broomhead individually and
        review the progress in respect of their particular ground. As a result
        the South Yorkshire Police would be in a position to provide a package of
        proposals for each local authority in which we can highlight local
        arrangements or deficiencies in the implementation of these recommendations.
        Once this process was completed the need for a centrally directed
        implementation team would disappear. It was obvious however that there
        would be on-going discussions and proposals in respect of policing
        football grounds in South Yorkshire (not arising as a direct result of
        Lord Justice Taylor's interim report). These discussions would continue
        under the chairmanship of Mr Broomhead.


        DATES OF FUTURE MEETINGS

        The Chairman fixed the dates for the next two meetings for 10.00 am on
        13 October and 20 October, to be held in the Conference Room at Police HQ.

33/89       MINUTES OF PREVIOUS MEETING

The minutes of the meeting held on 4 October 1989, which had been
previously circulated, were discussed.

Superintendent Sleath made reference to an error in item 30/89 - Instructions
to Stewards. The first paragraph states that written instructions to
stewards were 'provided by the police'. This should read 'provided by the
club'.

The remainder of the minutes were accepted as a true and accurate record.


34/89       MATTERS ARISING FROM THE MINUTES

        34.1 Manpower - Formula for Reserves

This item was introduced by the Chairman who said that these reserves of
manpower were intended to be utilised for instant response to incidents
and it is essential they are not encumbered by other duties of any kind.
They should be sent direct without delay to the problem and added to as
required if necessary. We do not need a substantial number of reserves
that are capable of working without assistance at large problems, they are
essentially a first response to be augmented if required.

Superintendent Sleath said that after applying the formula prepared by
Inspector Jones to both previous and future matches he found that the
formula gave him exactly what he wanted. He proposed the formula be used
as a basis for calculating the reserves required and for charging the
clubs.

After some discussion this proposal was agreed by the members and was
approved by the Chairman, with the qualification that inspectors will not
normally be part of the formula, ground commanders may include them
but they will not be charged for. These proposals, however, would not
apply to Doncaster which because of its low attendances is a unique
situation and may adopt a lower figure for the reserve number.

It was decided that should it be required to exceed the formula for
reserves then approval must be obtained from ACC (Operations).

Item discharged.
                                     - 2 -

The Chairman then took the opportunity of discussing item 5 on the agenda
'Training in Crowd Density'.


35/89        TRAINING IN CROWD DENSITY

Chief Inspector Purdy presented this item with assistance from Sergeant
       (AVA). The presentation took the form of a video film which was
intended to be used for in-force training purposes relating to crowd
dynamics, densities, and reactions. The film was incomplete, comments had
to be added, and Chief Insp Purdy requested members to consider the
video's content and suggest any amendments, additions, and conclusions
they felt would be of benefit.

Following viewing of the video the members discussed the benefits of the
film and the use of graphics to emphasise the pertinent points. The
general opinion of the members was that actual film would have more impact
than graphics, but that film of Hillsborough should not be used due to its
distressing nature. The members suggested various incidents at football
matches that they were aware had been recorded on film.

In conclusion the Chairman suggested that the video be progressed in more
general terms, bearing in mind the suggestions made by the members and the
use of certain graphics, and that the film would be viewed again when it
was nearing completion.

The Chairman thanked Chief Insp Purdy and Sergeant          [for their
presentation. Sergeant ______ then left the meeting.

Item discharged.


             MATTERS ARISING FROM THE MINUTES (continued)

        34.2 CCTV

The Chairman introduced this item and referred to a letter received from
the ACPO General Purposes Sub-Committee on Hooliganism at Sporting Events,
which had been previously circulated. The Chairman pointed out that CCTV
was the basis of recommendation 21 of Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry and
that a sub-committee working group had been set up to consider in detail
the use of CCTV. This working group will endeavour to provide a 'package'
for use as a test for common minimum standards of performance of CCTV as a
matter of urgency. The Chairman wished for the members and Mr Broomhead
to be aware of this national initiative and said we will suggest to the
local authority officer working party and the clubs that we await the
recommendations before any changes to CCTV facilities are made.

Item discharged.

        34.3 Briefing and De-Briefing of Stewards

This item was presented by Superintendent Oughton and he referred to a
report previously circulated. He had recommended that stewards should be
briefed by the police regarding their duties during a game and he
suggested that this should be undertaken at the beginning of the season
and twice again during the season. Supt Oughton made the point that if
they were briefed in detail by the police at every match then there was a
likelihood that they would be seen as becoming a police responsibility.

The matter was discussed and mention was made that at Barnsley and
Doncaster the practice was to brief all stewards for each match. At
Sheffield and Rotherham only the senior stewards were briefed at each
match.

Chief Inspector Bettison brought to the attention of the members paragraph
165 of Lord Justice Taylor's Report and mentioned that this aspect would
be the subject of further review by Lord Justice Taylor and would be
included in his second report.

The Chairman determined that stewards at each of the clubs were being
briefed at the very least in excess of the minimum requirements and the
situation should continue as at present pending the outcome of the second
report on this subject from Lord Justice Taylor when it will be further
considered.

Item deferred.

     34.4 ’Model1 Football Match Order

Superintendent Simpson presented this item and referred to a proforma he
had circulated the purpose of which is to create a routine method of
notifying the Fire and Ambulance Services with standardised information of
impending football matches. Use of the form was discussed and Chief
Inspector Waring suggested that the format could    be included on the
Command and Control for use by message switch. The form was agreed, and
the Chairman decided that because it was an integral part of the model
football match order it could not be put into use until the order was
agreed. Because of    that the form should be agreed with the emergency
services and implemented along with the model order. (See Appendix 'A')

Item discharged.

     34.5 Contingency Plans for Non-Ticket Holders

The Chairman addressed the members on this subject and referred to a
letter received from the ACPO General Purposes Sub-Committee on
Hooliganism at Sporting Events regarding latecomers at football matches.
The Chairman outlined the contents of the letter which related in part to
football supporters   continuing to grounds even though the capacity of the
football ground had   been exceeded and they had been informed of this. The
problem was identified so that forces could draw    up contingency plans on
how best to deal with these supporters, a course    of action that has
already been completed in South Yorkshire.

A further problem associated with latecomers was the non-ticket holder at
all ticket matches. The Sub-Committee was of the opinion that these
supporters should not be allowed into the ground even if there was
sufficient space inside in an attempt to create a national policy to
discourage this apparently deliberate practice. Clubs should be asked not
to sell tickets on the day to help comply with this policy. The views of
the individual clubs within South Yorkshire should be sought. A direct
consequence of large numbers of latecomers is the delay in the kick-off
time of matches. It has been suggested by the press that this option had
been abused by some ground commanders. The Sub-Committee did not intend to
respond to this speculative journalism but wished to draw the matter to
the attention of all chief constables.

The final matter raised in the letter was that of the difficulties some
clubs were experiencing regarding recommendation 4 of the Taylor Report.
This required for written agreement between the police and the football
clubs. In the light of such disparities the Sub-Committee had arranged a
meeting with Lord Justice Taylor to discuss and resolve a number of key
areas of the interim report. This meeting was arranged for 18 October
1989.

The contents of the letter were discussed by the members in detail and
Chief Inspector Bettison brought to their attention the fact that certain
of these points would form part of Lord Justice Taylor's second report.

With regards to all ticket matches and supporters arriving without tickets
the national recommendation seeking to provide a common purpose for the
police will be implemented with due consideration for public safety. The
Chairman also decided that each of the clubs should be informed of this
national initiative and their opinions obtained.

Regarding delay of kick-offs, it was determined that this was not a problem
evident in South Yorkshire. Ground commanders should retain the option of
delaying the kick-off time if circumstances demanded it.

Item deferred.


36/89     POPPLEWELL REPORT AND GREEN GUIDE

Chief Inspector Beal introduced this item by speaking of a report he had
previously circulated. He highlighted the 'grey' area of club/police
demarcations which Popplewell did not clear up. The written agreement
South Yorkshire Police has with each club covers these 'grey' areas and it
may be further clarified in Taylor's final report. Chief Insp Beal stated
that he had looked at any discrepancies between the Popplewell report and
the Taylor report. He immediately pointed out that paragraph 46 of the
Green Guide (arising from the Popplewell report) created a club
responsibility to have contingency plans to deal with large crowds
gathering outside. The Chairman asked if any clubs had such contingency
plans. None were known.

Chief Inspector Bettison was asked to raise this aspect with all local
authorities when they were presented with the police 'package of
proposals'.

Item discharged.


DATE OF NEXT MEETING

The Chairman fixed the date for the next meeting for 10.00 am on Friday
20 October 1989 in the Conference Room at Police Headquarters.

37/89         MINUTES OF PREVIOUS MEETING

The Minutes of the Meeting held on Friday 13 October 1989 which
had been previously circulated were discussed. They were accepted
as a true and accurate record.


38/89         TRAINING VIDEO - FACES IN A CROWD

Chief Inspector Purdy introduced this item which emanated from
Recommendations 5 and 6 of the Report.    This referred to police
officers   and  stewards   being  trained   and  briefed  in the
recognition of crowd densities, distress and dynamics.        The
Force Training Department had produced a short video on the
subject entitled 'FACES IN A CROWD'.      This was shown to the
members present.    At its conclusion the Chairman reflected on
the quality of the       finished product congratulating those
responsible for its compilation.

A discussion then ensued on the distribution and circulation
of the video.    Chief Inspector Purdy stated that it would be
shown to the majority of in-force courses at Ecclesfield whilst
the Divisional Training Officers would have the responsibility
of ensuring that Sub-Divisional personnel also viewed the same.
Additionally it was decided that Sub-Divisional Commanders would
write to their respective clubs informing them of the film,
in order that stewards could be suitably informed.    On receipt
of a blank tape the Force Audio Visual Aids Department would
provide a copy for their use.

All Police Forces in the UK would be circulated with regard
to the existence of the video, they would also be provided with
a copy on production of a blank tape.
The Chairman also asked that Local Advisory Groups be shown
the video in order to acquaint them with our work in this area.

Finally the Chairman stated that he would provide            the Police
Committee with full details of this area of training.

Item discharged.


39/89       THE GROUND SAFETY CERTIFICATE - ALL TICKET MATCHES

This item was introduced by Superintendent Simpson. A discussion
took place on all ticket matches and the rationale behind such
games.    Superintendent Greenwood stated that in his opinion
it should form part of the club's safety certificate, whilst
Superintendent Oughton thought that the club should assume more
responsibility than is the case currently.

After this exchange     of   views, the Chairman decided it was a
subject that should     be   further explored as part of a future
agenda item.

Item deferred.


40/89       ACTION BY    THE   LOCAL   AUTHORITIES   ON   RECOMMENDATION
            PACKAGES

The Chairman in his thoughts on the above stated that the
individual Local Authorities must be encouraged to consider
their package and subsequently have special meetings in respect
of the same.    He said he would look at each package and then
convene an extraordinary meeting to consider the various aspects.

Superintendent Oughton said that he expected Rotherham to await
the final Taylor Report before arriving at any firm decisions.

In conclusion the Chairman said it would be the responsibility
of individual Commanders to ascertain the Local Authority's
reaction to the package before any HQ involvement would be
implemented. He welcomed any feedback for the next meeting.

Item deferred.


41/89       PROGRESS OF THE OPERATIONAL ORDER

Superintendent Simpson distributed a package to members present
explaining that it was based on a similar one originating from
Hampshire.    The order he enunciated consisted of standard
instructions, serial duty sheets and personnel sheets.
In thanking Superintendent Simpson for the material presented
the Chairman stated that this matter would feature as an agenda
item at the next meeting.

Item deferred.


42/89       FOOTBALL INTELLIGENCE/INFORMATION

This item took the form of a presentation by Superintendent
Brookfield who had previously circulated all members with an
appropriate paper illustrating its content.

Summarising the document Superintendent Brookfield outlined
the historical aspects of football intelligence, the ACPO
involvement, the recent extension of CCTV, post match analysis
and the need for an enhancement of duties for the Liaison
Officer.

Utilising a series of overhead projections to explain the
structure of his argument, Superintendent Brookfield began by
highlighting the objectives of the National Football Intelligence
Unit in the field of analysis and distribution of information.
He further stated that ultimately a Home Office Circular would
be produced defining the necessary commitment to intelligence
gathering and dissemination.

He then explained the role of the NFIU in the extension of the
Local Intelligence Officer, its ability to advise on best
practice and the utility of a standard administrative system.

Subsequent slides concerned the role of the NFIU in relation
to known football hooligans, their travel patterns including
international movement.   The British Transport Police and their
liaison with all Forces relative to football intelligence were
discussed in addition to past and current intelligence operations
and the football index held by Local Intelligence Officers.

Reflecting on the South Yorkshire experience, further slides
outlined the role and responsibilities of the football/major
events manpower officers and the Detective Sergeant at HQ who
has responsibility for monitoring community tension, football
supporters movements and exclusion orders. It was Superintendent
Brookfield's opinion that such a diversity of responsibilities
was too great for the individuals involved.

He then described a flow chart depicting the in-force staffing
and structure necessary under the NFIU, emphasising the need
to keep a Football Intelligence File at Divisions in order to
update new Commanders. Such a file would include ground
profiles.    Superintendent Brookfield stressed the importance
of accurate post match summaries, the result of which was a
general discussion on this subject.    The Chairman stated that
post match debriefing and ground profiles would be agenda items
for the next meeting.

Superintendent Brookfield pointed out that we must employ a
flexible forcewide system of debriefing and that Sergeants should
personally debrief each of their men before standing down.
It followed, therefore, that Inspectors should debrief Sergeants
in a like manner.

Finally Superintendent Brookfield mentioned the importance of
pre-match liaison with our local clubs and in conclusion showed
members the prospective South Yorkshire form relative to football
intelligence.   He strongly emphasised the need for our Force
to show a definite commitment in support of the newly formed
national unit.

The Chairman in thanking Superintendent Brookfield for his
presentation said that as far as South Yorkshire was concerned
we would not move in advance of the Home Office Circular.

Item deferred.


DATE OF NEXT MEETING

The date of the next meeting was arranged for 10.00 am, Friday
29 December 1989 in the Headquarters Conference Room.

The Minutes of the Meeting held on Friday 8 December 1989 which had
been previously circulated were accepted as a true and accurate record.


43/89       MATTERS ARISING FROM THE MINUTES

43.1.       Training Video - Faces in a Crowd

             In   response to    a question     from the Chairman, Chief
             Inspector Purdy     confirmed that all Police Forces in the
             United Kingdom     had been circulated with regard to the
             existence of the   video.

             Item discharged.

43.2.       Action by the Local Authorities on Recommendation Packages

             The Chairman introduced this   item by asking individual
             members for the reaction of their Local Authorities on
             the Recommendation Package.     Superintendent Greenwood
             stated that at Doncaster informal discussions had taken
             place and that further meetings were planned to consider
             the recommendations in detail.

             Superintendent   Simpson    in  reflecting   the  Barnsley
             experience said that the package had been well received
             by all concerned.    Formal meetings had already been held
             and although more were planned it was fair to say the
             recommendations were being actively pursued.

            In Rotherham, Superintendent Oughton reported that the
            Package had been received and a formal meeting was planned
            for 9 January 1990 when all      the recommendations would
            be subject of debate.

Broomhead, said that in Sheffield a two hour presentation
had already taken place, and that on 2 January 1990 an
additional one would be given to the General Purposes
Panel.   There had been a co-operative response from all
concerned.

Item deferred.


Progress of the Operational Order

The Chairman reported that Superintendent Simpson had
produced a model Operational Order which was now in final
draft form.   It had previously been circulated?- to members
who were now asked for their views.

Reflecting on an issue raised by Superintendent Hale the
Chairman agreed that the Order should be particularised
for each ground in the Force area.        A discussion then
took   place   on contingency   planning.      The Chairman
emphasised that it should be viewed as the first step
in the overall strategy for the day.      Whilst considering
the   content    of  the   Order   its    distribution   and
accountability were reviewed.     Summarising the position
the Chairman stated that Sergeants and above should receive
a copy of the booklet as a personal issue.       On transfer
or retirement the booklet would be returned to its place
of issue.     It was decided the forcewide cover for the
document would be blue.

Superintendent    Marsh   then    addressed    the meeting    on
emergency communications, given a scenario of the match
control room proving to be inoperative.           Those present
were reminded that . base stations at Barnsley, Doncaster
and Rotherham were not situated at the football grounds
i.e. Doncaster at Coal House and Barnsley and Rotherham
at the respective Divisional Headquarters.             Therefore
loss of control room useage at those locations would not
be critical as the base station would still be in
existence.     Utilising the talk through facility via
personal radios     would      ensure      the continuance    of
communications in Sheffield, however, the situation was
slightly   different in that the base stations are at the
ground.      In addition both venues have a command channel,
19 at Hillsborough and 29 at Bramall Lane.           In respect
of these channels their base stations are at Shirecliffe
and Hyde Park and should a major problem exist with match
control,   the command channel could be operated.              A
discussion followed thereafter concerning the procedure
to be       followed   in the light     of a break down       in
communications at the ground.
           It was evident that practical variations existed throughout
           the county relative to this problem and in view of this
           the Chairman asked     Superintendent Marsh to write an
           APPENDIX   ’E ’ (EMERGENCY COMMUNICATIONS) particular to
           each ground in South Yorkshire, and produce the same for
           the next meeting.

           Following an observation by Superintendent Greenwood,
           the attention of members was drawn to Paragraph 3.1. of
           the booklet, relative to the physical position of the
           officer in overall command on match days.    A protracted
           discussion took place but ultimately the following was
           held to be the definitive response.     "BRAVO ONE, XRAY
           ONE will be in overall command. Unless there is something
           which warrants his personal attendance, he will remain
           at Oakwell Control".     This paragraph will of course
           ultimately reflect the different grounds in the Force
           area.

           In   concluding    this   section,   the  Chairman   asked
           Superintendent Simpson to update the booklet and circulate
           the same in time for the next meeting.

           Item deferred.

43.4.      Ground Safety Certificate

           Superintendent Simpson introduced this item by briefly
           outlining the ACPO Guidelines relative to all ticket
           matches.    In essence this criteria merely covered cup
           fixtures involving teams from different Divisions i.e.
           a Fourth Division side playing a top First Division team.
           The general feeling was that this needed to include
           ordinary fixtures and furthermore it should feature as
           part of the Ground Safety Certificate.

           The Chairman requested Superintendent Simpson to prepare
           a document including the ACPO Paper, and circulate this
           for the next meeting.    It would be fully discussed at
           that juncture.

           Item deferred.


44/89      MAJOR CRIME CONTINGENCY PLAN

Acting Assistant Chief Constable (Operations), Mr Broomhead, commenced
a discussion on the above by reminding those present that in the
compilation of the model order, under APPENDIX 'H' - Contingency Plan,
it was felt that such action ought to include the implications of
a major crime      being committed on a match day.    He sought the views
of members on      this subject.    In reply, Superintendent Simpson said
that a uniform     planshould exist applicable to all the Force.

Superintendent Hale stated that Detective Chief Inspector Meek,       ’D '
Division, had done some preparatory work in this area.

As a result, the Chairman asked Superintendent Hale to ensure Detective
Chief Inspector Meek's attendance at the next meeting, in order that
he could acquaint members with his progress, thus far, relative to
this matter.

Item deferred.


45/89       TAPE ON PERIMETER GATES

The Chairman illustrated the practice at Barnsley of taping the
perimeter gates now open as a result of the Taylor Report. He observed
that this appeared to satisfy both the needs of the Report, in that
the tape would not be a physical barrier in the event of necessary
movement on to the perimeter track/pitch, whilst at the same time
the very existence of the tape appeared to be satisfactory in
restricting the crowd to the terracing.    He asked for members' views
on this topic.

In agreement with the previous thoughts, Superintendent Oughton stated
it was now standard practice at Rotherham where no problems had been
encountered.

Mr Broomhead extended the discussion in stating that the use of tape
could also be implemented to promote sterile areas and pens.   These
sentiments were shared by Chief Inspector Beal.

In conclusion the Chairman said that as a result of the above we would,
in future, therefore, as a matter of force practice, tape perimeter
gates and also use tape as a means of lateral development for pens
etc, where necessary. This was agreed.

Item discharged.


46/89       MATCH DAY INFORMATION SUPPLIED TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES

Mr Broomhead reported that we have recently been requested by the
Local Authorities in Barnsley and Sheffield to update them with match
day information on the Friday before the match.  As we already submit
these details to the emergency services, he saw nothing wrong in the
idea.
The Chairman agreed with the principle and suggested that the mechanics
of distributing such information be discussed at the next meeting
in the light of the progress of the model operational order.

Item deferred.


47/89       ANY OTHER BUSINESS

Superintendent Marsh informed members that the Home Office Circular
relative to Football Intelligence would be published in February 1990.

The Chairman thanked him for this information.

Item deferred.

          SUBJECT:        PROVISIONS FOR MAJOR CRIME INVESTIGATIONS AT
                                         FOOTBALL STADIUMS




           INTRODUCTION

           Major crime incidents within the confines of association
           football grounds have been relatively rare in this country when
           the numbers of persons attending such venues throughout the
           season are considered.

           The Police services experience of such occurrences is not
           therefore great but the history of our response has been to
           contain the relevant section of the crowd pending the
           identification of suspects and witnesses.

           The implications of the Hillsborough tradegy and the
           implimentation of recommendations following the subsequent
           enquiry have placed crowd safety as the paramount consideration
           for future policing of football stadiums. As a consequence,
           consideration must be given to the feasability of crowd
           containment and if inappropriate, other contigencies which would
           assist in the identification, arrest and prosecution of
           offenders, together with securing evidence available to us from
           witnesses.
           The purpose of this report is to firstly ascertain if the
           concerns I identify are shared by others and to highlight
           courses of action which would assist in the successful detection
           of offences within the constrains imposed by crowd safety
           objectives.

           COMMAND RESPONSIBILITIES

           My experience of crowd control this season is limited to Bramall
           Lane Football Ground and may be somewhat parochial as a result.

            I have recently visited the Sheffield Wednesday stadium however,
            and it would appear that similar policing considerations are
            existent at both locations.
            The interior of each venue is under the control of a ground
            commander of Superintendent rank and I would suggest that should
            a serious crime incident occur within the ground, the ground
            commander (not the Senior CID officer present) would control
            such an incident until all crowd safety considerations have been
            successfully implimented.

                                                              Cont'd
We must therefore conclude that unlike any normal major crime
investigation, the presence of Senior CID personnel would not
result initially in them assuming direct command and directing
the investigation.

I therefore recommend that the ground commander has available
to him, a Senior CID officer of the rank of Detective Inspector
or Detective Chief Inspector, in order that the investigative
problems of such an incident could be highlighted (if necessary)
at an early stage and that immediately crowd safety considerations
were satisfactorily overcome, that the subsequent action designed
to lead to the detection of the offence can be the responsibility
of that CID officer.

I wish to make it clear that such availability of the Senior CID
officer requires his presence in the ground control room with the
ground commander throughout the time that the control room is in
use.

There is also a requirement to maintain a CID commitment with
designated responsibility at the ground should a serious crime
incident occur.

The CID contingent should be in radio contact with the ground
control room at all times and available for deployment as required.

They can however be used for other duties in and around the
stadium but their primary function should always be to assist in
the initial response to any serious crime incident within the
confines of the ground.

I do not mean to infer that the ground commander cannot efficiently
direct such an investigation of the incident, but his considerations
however will always be directed to different primary objectives.
The removal of such a responsibility at an early stage for directing
that initial investigation into the crime would clearly allow him to
concentrate fully on his remaining duties.

THE IMPLICATIONS OF CROWD SAFETY PRIORITIES

The result of our change in priorities as a consequence of the
Hillsborough tragedy, leads me to the conclusion that in most cases
it will be impractical to isolate and detain large sections of the
crowd on the terracing at the scene of the incident.

Secondly, the reduction in ground capacity allows persons the
opportunity to change position in standing areas much more easily
than was previously the case.

My recommendations are therefore based on combating the difficulties
brought about by these two changes.

Little of what I suggest is new, but simply a reinforcement of the
existing strategy.



                                                  cont'd /
RECOMMENDATIONS

1)   When possible the most effective response to a serious crime
     incident on the terracing must be the containment of the
     scene and persons present at that location.

     That action may be possible dependant on the position in the
     ground and the crowd capacity but unlike our previous
     practice, it should never be automatically implemented.

     The decision to introduce such a containment must be the
     decision of the ground commander who will of course be fully
     conversant with the crowd safety implications of such action.

2)   The use of video surveillance to monitor crowd behaviour is
     well established.  Incidents of crowd disorder are normally
     already the subject of recording as is the scanning of the
     crowd at the commencement of the football match, and after
     the half time interval.  This should continue but further
     scanning if crowd disorder is apparent is also necessary to
     identify changes in position by possible offenders.

3)   The policy at both Bramall Lane Football Ground and Hillsborough
     Football Ground is that the video cassettes from each football
     match are stored after use for a period of 12 months.

     If however they are required for evidential purposes they
     would of course be retained until the completion of court
     proceedings.

     A Force wide policy as to the retention of video recordings
     originating from Football Grounds should be introduced.  I
     would suggest that 12 months is the optimum period for such
     retention.

4)   Comparison of colour and black and white video recordings
     indicates a need for a sufficiency of both.

     Black and white recordings provide better definition of the
     facial features of spectators.

     In addition black and white recordings are superior in poor
     light conditions.

     Colour recordings can be of great assistance evidentially if
     identifiable clothing seen to be worn by an accused on video
     subsequently is taken from the offender and retained in Police
     possession.  If produced in conjunction with the video evidence
     to a court, this is of benefit to any prosecution where
     identification is a point of issue.

5}   I also recommend that both video and still photographs
     incorporate date/time of use and that lighting in covered
     spectator areas of the ground should be such that photograph
     quality is sufficient for identification purposes.


                                                   cont'd / ....
6)    To facilitate enquiries into a serious offence within the
      ground, photographs taken prior to 'kick off' and at half
      time would assist in a visual identification of who was in
      the locality of the scene of the offence and the position of
      the complainant at these times.

      Where attempts to arrest offenders immediately following the
      incident are unsuccessful action must be taken to identify
      by name those shown on the photographs and a response is
      required at the ground prior to the dispersal of supporters.
      The following procedure is suggested.

      There needs to be a selective process where -

      a)   Pro-forma statements (appendix A) should be obtained
           from supporters leaving the ground at the appropriate
           egress points. The statement will contain basic
           information i.e. name, address, dob, telephone number.

      b)   Attached to the proforma will be an outline of the
           stand or terrace in question on which the individual
           will indicate, approximately the position he was stood
           at the relevant time.

      c)   A poloroid photograph will be taken of the individual
           which should be attached to the pro-forma.

7)    The poloroid photograph and pro-forma statement will
      subsequently be used in conjunction with the Scenes of Crime
      (recommendation 12) and video photographs to commence the
      process of identifying individuals who can be contacted at a
      later time.  Interviews can then be arranged to gather
      evidence and identify further individuals shown on the SOC
      photograph as being in the same location as such persons.

8)    I would suggest that if this system is to be accepted pro­
      formas and poloroid cameras should be available at each
      football ground. All CID Officers and Crime and Vandal Units
      who are engaged in duties at the grounds should be fully
      briefed as to their responsibility in completing the
      pro-formas.

 9)   In view of the highly selective nature of the process out­
      lined and the fact that by implication only a minute percentage
      of spectators could be identified and photographed in this way.
      consideration should be given to implement a restrictive exit
      from the ground, which would facilitate use of an egress point
      adequately covered by a video camera.

       This would of course allow all persons exiting a particular
       area of the ground to be the subject of video recording and may
       assist in identifying groups of persons of Police interest.

       Such a response must again be the decision of the ground
       commander within crowd safety constraints.

                                                         cont'd /
                             - 5 -


10)   If restriction of exits is deemed inappropriate in the
      circumstances, a filter system using lines of Police
      Officers to isolate sections of the crowd as they leave
      the stadium is another contingency which could be
      effectively implemented.

      Such implementation would again be the responsibility of
      the ground commander.

11)   Additional video assistance and evidence is also available
      as a result of the current use of officers from the under­
      water search unit and hand held video equipment.

      These officers are already utilised to target specific areas
      of the crowd where indications are that difficulties may
      develop.

      This practice should continue but their duties should be
      directed specifically by the Senior CID Officer present.

12)   Still photographs of all sections of the crowd are also
      already obtained immediately after kick off and the half
      time interval.  These are used in a supplementary role for
      identification purposes in conjunction with the results of
      video scanning.  This should continue.

13)   Both Sheffield Association Football Grounds have excellent
      public address systems.  The difficulties of any Police
      operation may be eased if non unruly sections of the crowd
      are advised of Police actions and the reasons for it.

      This would be particularly of benefit if decisions were
      taken to implement recommendation 6 if restrictions on crowd
      exiting or filtering were envisaged.

      I suggest that a copy of this report be circulated to
      committee members at the meeting scheduled for Friday the
      26 January 1990 and their comments invited.

             Dear Sir,
                                            CCTV AND PUBLIC SAFETY
                  I write in my capacity as Chairman of the ACPO Working Group on CCTV
             and Public Safety.
                  In my previous correspondence to all Chief Constables, dated 29
             September 1989, I sought to put on record that the Working Group had been
             established by the ACPO Sub-Committee on Hooliganism at Sporting Events.
             The terms of reference of the Working Group had been to arrive at an
             acceptable specification for camera equipment to comply with the
             requirement made under Recommendation 21 of the Interim Report into the
             Hillsborough disaster by Lord Justice Taylor expeditiously.
                  In my capacity as Secretary to the ACPO G.P. Sub-Committee on
             Hooliganism at Sporting Events, I represent the ACPO at meetings of the
             Football Trust. As such, I have been apprised that the Trust has been
             inundated with applications for financial assistance towards the provision
             of additional CCTV equipment, prompted, in the main, by the requirements of
             Recommendation 21. In the assessment of previous applications for funding
             for items of specialist equipment, such as CCTV, the Trust has relied upon
             the advice of a Football Trust Technical Committee. This Committee of
             technical advisers included a representative of the ACPO.          On this
             occasion, the Football Trust has sought to capitalise upon the initiative
             of the ACPO rather than convene a separate Technical Committee, which would
             research the requirements of Recommendation 21 in tandem with the ACPO, and
             has approached Mr. Anderton, Chairman of our parent Committee, the ACPO
             G.P. Sub-Committee on Hooliganism at Sporting Events, with a view to
             pooling our expertise.
                  Mr. Anderton has acceded to this suggestion and invited Mr. Grattan
             Endicott, a senior trustee of the Trust, to join the ACPO Working Group.
             The Trust, in turn, has resolved not to provide further sponsorship until
             the Working Group has concluded its findings and applications have been
             considered against that yardstick. It further directed that any additional
        i    equipment purchased in advance of the Group's findings cannot be guaranteed
        I    retrospective part/full funding.
     Some direction has already been achieved and it may be considered
prudent to elaborate on some of our progress to date for the information of
Ground Commanders. There has been a clear indication from the Football
Trust of the need for a Cfi^laxjMijtejiance contract which will need to be
immediately addressed for all existing Trust funded CCTV equipment and a
necessary pre-requisite for all future applications for funding. Failure
to include same will be viewed as false economy and will be adversely
reflected in the consideration given to such future applications.
     In making applications for additional equipment, it should be noted
that an increase in roonitorijTg equipment will require additional space in
Police Control roomsTo'saxcommodate those monitors and the officers to view
same. It will be an additional requirement, preceding any funding, that
the Trust will need to be satisfied that Control Rooms are adequately
proportioned. The Group has also made preliminary enquiry to assess the
maximum number of monitors which can be viewed effectively by an observer.
Whilst this aspect of our research is in its infancy, there are implicit
indications that any increase in equipment may well incur additional
manpower requirements.
     It is acknowledged that the funds of the Trust are limited and demands
for financial assistance increase daily, nevertheless the Trust will
endeavour to accord priority to CCTV. In order to assess the probable
total demand, it will assist the Working Group if information could be
supplied for all football league ground commanders in your respective Force
areas.
     1. The full technical specification for CCTV equipment, currently
installed and details of maintenance contracts.
     2. A ground plan for each stadium , endorsed with the position of
such equipment and the Control room.
     3. Whether CCTV equipment is considered by the Ground Commander to be
a priority in the coverage of concourse areas.
     Your urgent co-operation in this necessary enquiry will be of immense
benefit in promoting a speedy conclusion both to the efforts of the Working
Group and consideration of sponsorship applications to the Football Trust.



                              Yours sincerely,

                                              IN T R O D U C T IO N

   1. On 15 April 1989 a football match to decide a semi-final round of the FA Cup competition was to be
played between the Liverpool and Nottingham Forest Clubs. The neutral venue chosen was Hillsborough
Football Stadium, Sheffield Wednesday’s ground. Only six minutes into the game, play was stopped when it
was realised that spectators on the terraces behind the Liverpool goal had been severely crushed. In the result,
95 died and over 400 received hospital treatment.

  2. On 17 April 19891 was appointed by you to carry out an Inquiry with the following terms of reference:

     To inquire into the events at Sheffield Wednesday football ground on 15 April 1989 and to make
     recommendations about the needs of crowd control and safety at sports events.

   3. Two Assessors were appointed to assist me: Mr Brian Johnson QPM, Chief Constable of Lancashire,
and Professor Leonard M aunder OBE, BSc, PhD, ScD, FEng, FI Mech E, Professor of Mechanical
Engineering at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne. Their help has been invaluable and I am very grateful
for their expert advice and wise counsels. While the sole responsibility for this report is mine, I am comforted
in the knowledge that both Assessors agree with it.

  4. Mr Robert Whalley was appointed Secretary to the Inquiry. He and his assistants have worked
prodigiously and skilfully to give me all the advice and support I could have wished. I also wish to acknowledge
the help I have received, as always, from my clerk, M r Ernest Pott.

   5. The policing arrangements for 15 April were in the hands of the South Yorkshire Constabulary. The
efficacy of those arrangements and their im plementation was from an early stage called into question. It was
therefore decided that the investigation of the disaster and the gathering of evidence for this Inquiry should be
conducted by an independent police force. Mr Geoffrey Dear QPM, Chief Constable of West Midlands
Constabulary, undertook this task. He was made responsible directly to me; he appointed Assistant Chief
Constable Mervyn Jones to take full-time charge of the investigation. I am deeply indebted to both of them.

  6. On 18 April I visited Hillsborough Stadium. I inspected the scene of the disaster on the terraces and all
relevant parts of the stadium and its approaches. My Assessors and I have made further visits during the
Inquiry. I also visited Liverpool on 21 and 29 April.

   7. The Lord Mayor and the Sheffield City Council kindly offered to make the accommodation and facilities
of Sheffield Town Hall available for the hearing of oral evidence. This offer was gratefully accepted and I would
like to record my thanks for those facilities and for the co-operation afforded to the Inquiry by the authorities
in Sheffield.

   8. On 28 April 1989,1 held a preliminary hearing to announce the date when the oral evidence would begin,
to give some directions as to the procedure I intended to follow and to hear applications from those wishing to
be represented at the hearing. I accorded representation to the following:
      (i)  Those bereaved or injured as a result of the disaster.
      (ii)  The Football Supporters’ Association.
      (iii) The Football Association.
      (iv)  Sheffield City Council.
      (v)   Sheffield Wednesday Football Club together with the Football League, the Club’s casual staff and
            their insurers, the Sun Alliance.
      (vi) South Yorkshire Constabulary.
      (vii) South Yorkshire Fire and Civil Defence Authority.
 Subsequently, during the hearing, I further accorded representation to:
       (viii) Trent Regional Health Authority, for the South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service
              (SYMAS).
 and (ix)    D r W Eastwood, consultant engineer to Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

   9. Since the circumstances of the disaster raised urgent questions o f safety, especially at football grounds,
 you indicated at the outset that you would welcome any recommendations, even of an interim nature, which I
 might be able to give in advance of the new football season due to commence in mid-August 1989.1 therefore
 announced at the preliminary hearing on 28 April that I would conduct an oral hearing with all possible
 expedition as the first phase of the Inquiry to discover the facts and causes of the disaster and enable me to
 make any im mediate interim recommendations necessary in the short term.

   10. The West Midlands Police investigation began on 24 April. A “Freephone” num ber was advertised to
enable members of the public, especially those who had attended the match, to offer their evidence to the
Inquiry. Initially this num ber was available for three days on 28 different lines. The response from the public
was such that the lines were continued for a further three days by the end of which 2,666 calls had been
received. There were also many written offers of help. Some 440 West Midlands officers were deployed on the
             serv' ce ^ ' s operation, special police offices were established in Birmingham, Liverpool and
S e field and computer technology was used to the full. In all some 3776 statements were taken. There were
f s o “ e 1550 letters t0 Ministers, to the Inquiry and to me personally all of which I read. The police,
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and the BBC had video cameras filming at the ground on 15 April. In
aggregate, they recorded some 71 hours of film covering the period before, during and after the disaster. Thus
the material gathered and potentially available for presentation at the oral hearing was enormous. From this
mass it was essential to select only sufficient good and reliable evidence necessary to establish the facts and
causes of the disaster.

   11. Where it seemed likely that any allegation or criticism might be made of the conduct of any person or
party, the Treasury Solicitor, after consultation with Counsel for the Inquiry, wrote to the party concerned
setting out the likely grounds for complaint. This followed the practice established by the Royal Commission
on Tribunals of Inquiry (the Salmon Commission).

  12. The hearing began on 15 May. It continued, sitting long hours, for 31 days concluding on 29 June. In
that period, 174 witnesses gave oral evidence. Counsel’s submissions were delivered in writing on 7 July and
on 14 July I heard their brief oral submissions supplementing the written argument.

  13- Witnesses were not sworn. Since this is a departmental inquiry, there was no power to adm inister the
oath but there was no instance of any witness giving evidence which I considered might have been different
had he or she been sworn.

       J / 16 w'j nesses called were only a small fraction of those from whom statements were or could have been
taken. Nevertheless, I am satisfied that they were sufficient in num ber and reliability to enable me to reach the
necessary conclusions. To have called more would have prevented me from presenting an interim report in the
required time and would not have added significantly to the relevant evidence. I have, however, been able to
take into account many written statements in addition to oral testimony.

   1 ^                 evidence called by Counsel for the Inquiry which was drawn from statements taken by
   e West Midlands Police and others volunteered by individuals, each of the represented parties was given full
opportunity to put forward any witnesses they considered should be called. A final submission was made by
Counsel for the South Yorkshire Police that since the investigation by West Midlands Police is still continuing
all the evidence has not been assembled and it would be unsafe for me to make findings of fact. I should
therefore make clear that the investigation continues principally to furnish as much detail as possible to HM
Coroner for the City of Sheffield as to the cause of death, the precise position at death and the care and
movement of each of the 95 victims individually. I am assured by Chief Constable D ear and Assistant Chief
Constable Mervyn Jones that it is most unlikely any further evidence gathered will significantly alter or add to
the history of events which emerged at the hearing.

  16.     I should like to thank all those who made it possible for the oral hearing to take place so soon after the
event and for evidence to be efficiently presented and tested so as to give a full and fair account of what
happened in all its aspects without irrelevancy or duplication. I pay tribute particularly to the West Midlands
Police tor their speed and dedication in gathering the evidence and to all those responsible for processing it.
The most eloquent tribute to the fairness and thoroughness of the police investigation came from the Secretary
of the Football Supporters’ Association. He said there had been initial anxiety in Liverpool as to whether that
investigation would be fair and objective. His Association therefore collected 200 witness statements
themselves. Having heard the opening statement by Counsel to the Inquiry based upon the evidence gathered
by the police, he found that it accorded entirely with his Association’s evidence and the initial anxiety was
wholly dispelled.

   17. Before and during the Inquiry I derived great assistance on a wide range of technical issues from the
Health and Safety Executive who providentially have a laboratory in Sheffield (the Research and Laboratory
Services Division) where tests were conducted and reports prepared swiftly and efficiently. This was done
in close consultation with Professor Maunder. I am most grateful to the Director, D r A Jones, and to the
Deputy Director, D r C E Nicholson, for their invaluable help.

  18. I wish to com m end Counsel to the inquiry, Mr Andrew Collins QC, M r Alan Goldsack and Mr
Bernard Phillips for their industry, care and fairness in selecting and presenting the necessary evidence; also,
Counsel for all those represented who tested that evidence fully but expeditiously. This Interim Report could
not possibly have been prepared in so short a time had I not had the whole-hearted co-operation of all those
m entioned and many others.

   19. The second phase of the Inquiry will be directed to making final and long term recommendations about
crowd control and safety at sports grounds. I need to consider in depth information, opinions and arguments
from a wide range of sources and contributors both here and abroad. It was clear from the outset that this
second phase could not be carried to completion before the next football season. However, at an early stage of
the oral hearing I invited evidence from all who wished to contribute to it and specifically from many sporting,
local authority, emergency service and police bodies as well as technical consultants. I asked that submissions
should be in writing and should be made promptly so that the second phase of the Inquiry could
follow immediately after the first. I shall now proceed to consider the large body of written evidence which has
been submitted. I shall want in some instances to have further oral evidence or discussion in conjunction with
my Assessors. We will also need to make a num ber of visits and inspections.

  20. I now present my Interim Report and Recommendations. I shall prepare my Final Report and
Recommendations as soon as reasonably possible.

Fixing The Venue
   21. On 20 March 1989, the Football Association (the FA) requested that their Cup semi-final between
Liverpool and Nottingham Forest be held on 15 April at Hillsborough Football Stadium. The corresponding
semi-final between the same two teams had been held there in April 1988. The arrangements had been
successful in the view both of the police and of the host club. Sheffield Wednesday (the Club) were therefore
willing to accommodate the 1989 match. South Yorkshire Constabulary were prepared to police it but only if
the ticketing arrangements were the same as those for 1988. Otherwise, the FA would have to look elsewhere.
Those arrangements did not please Liverpool or its supporters either in 1988 or 1989. They thought the ticket
allocation was unfair for reasons to be explained later. Reluctantly, however, the police requirement was
accepted and the match was fixed for 15 April at Hillsborough.

The Ground
  22. The Hillsborough Stadium is some 2h miles to the north-west of central Sheffield in the district of
Owlerton. The ground was opened in 1899 on what was then a greenfield site by the river Don. The pitch lies
roughly east to west. A plan of the ground and its immediate environs is at Appendix 1.

  23. The west end, with which this Inquiry is principally concerned, is known as the Leppings Lane end. The
east end abuts on Penistone Road, the A 61. To the south is the river Don and to the north a residential street,
Vere Road, which runs between Leppings Lane and Penistone Road North.

   24. Alongside the river is a private roadway giving access to the south stand, to the Directors’ and players’
entrances, and to the administrative block under the stand. The roadway gives both vehicular and pedestrian
access between Penistone Road and Leppings Lane, but there are gates which can shut it off at each end. There
is some car parking along this roadway principally for Directors, players and employees of the Club. The south
stand dates from 1914 and is the oldest at the ground. It is all seating with places for 8,800. 5,500 o f those are
roofed over and 3,300 are uncovered.

  25. The north stand is also all seating and accommodates about 9,700. Behind it is a gymnasium or sports
hall. There are also a first aid room and police room close by.

  26. The east end is all terracing and is known as the Spion Kop. It was enlarged and roofed over in 1986 and
now accommodates some 21,000 standing spectators. There are crush barriers in the Kop running parallel to
the goal line but no dividing fences to prevent free movement from side to side.

   27. At the west or Leppings Lane end o f the ground there is terracing close to the pitch. Behind it is the west
stand which provides covered seating and was built in 1965 for World Cup matches, some of which were held
at Hillsborough in 1966. The covered stand accommodates 4,456 seated spectators. The terracing in front of it
extends higher in the corners between the stands and its total capacity was stated to be 10,100. At both the Kop
end and the west end access to the pitch is barred by perimeter fencing. The fencing is about eight feet high
m ounted upon the low wall at the foot of the terracing. At the top of the fencing the wire returns back at a sharp
angle for some 15 inches to make it difficult for anyone to climb over towards the pitch. There are gates at
intervals along the perimeter fencing to afford access between terrace and pitch. These gates are less than a
metre wide and were designed to be opened only from the pitch side for police purposes or in an emergency.
They are marked and numbered on the plan Appendix 1.

  28. Unlike the Kop end, the west terracing has not only crush barriers parallel with the goal line but radial
fences at right angles to it, dividing the area into pens. This division was begun after an FA Cup semi-final in
1981 when crushing occurred due to overcrowding and gates had to be opened. It proceeded in stages, the final
arrangement being shown on the plan Appendix 1. The first section of the west terracing moving south to north
contains gates 1 and 2 and is known as pens 1 and 2 although in fact constituting only one pen. Next is pen 3
with one gate; next pen 4 with one gate; pen 5, which is extremely narrow, was intended as a sterile area to
divide pen 4 from pen 6. This was to isolate home and away fans on occasions when both might be
accommodated on the west terracing in separate pens. Finally there is pen 7 at the north-west corner. Pens 5,6
and 7 each have a perimeter gate. At the back of the pens, under the front of the west stand, there is a gate in
each radial fence. When those gates are open, the back row of the terracing is intended to perm it access from
pen to pen along the whole west side. In practice, when substantial numbers are present, those gateways are not
readily visible or accessible. The present layout of the pens, fences, crush barriers and gates has resulted from a
series of piecemeal changes. The nature and effect of those changes must be considered later.

The Turnstiles
   29. Because of the housing in Vere Road there is no access from the north side of the ground. Along
Penistone Road N orth there are some 46 turnstiles which usually give access both to the Kop and to the east
end of the north stand. They are marked 43 to 88 inclusive on the plan. The 12 numbered 77 to 88 are designed
to feed the north stand but were not used for that purpose on 15 April in order to segregate supporters of the
two teams as appears later. Two of them, 77 and 78, were however used for access to the Kop.

  30. At the south side of the ground there were 24 turnstiles (numbered 19 to 42 on the plan). Those
numbered 37 to 42 led to the Kop and the rest to the south stand.

  31. In summary, the south and east sides of the ground accommodated some 29,800 whose access on the
day was through 60 turnstiles.

  32. The other two sides of the ground, north and west, with a capacity of 24,256 were fed solely from the
Leppings Lane entrance where there were only 23 turnstiles.

Travel to the Ground
  33. Most supporters were expected to come by road although rail transport was available. Nottingham
supporters travelling by train would arrive at the main line Sheffield Midland Station whence they would be
directed and escorted northwards by the police. They would arrive at the ground along Penistone Road.
Nottingham supporters travelling by coach, mini-bus or car would approach Sheffield from the south mainly
on the M 1. Again their arrival at the ground would predominantly be via Penistone Road or Herries Road.

   34. Liverpool supporters travelling by normal rail service would arrive at Sheffield Midland Station just
like their Nottingham counterparts. The police aimed to segregate the rival fans and put them into separate
coaches. Liverpool fans could alternatively travel by special train to Wadsley Bridge, a British Rail station
catering solely for football supporters and situated to the north of the ground. A police escort was available to
conduct them on foot to the Leppings Lane entrance. Those coming from Liverpool by road would approach
Sheffield either via the M62 and down the M 1 from the north or across the Pennines from the north west. All
such routes would bring them to the ground via one or other limb of Leppings Lane as shown on Appendix 1.
Broadly, therefore, arrivals from Liverpool would be from the north and west; arrivals from Nottingham
would be from the south and east.

Allocation of Places and Tickets
  35. Experience in recent years has produced a policy of segregation to prevent trouble between supporters
of rival teams. The need for this policy to be m aintained was endorsed and emphasised by the Popplewell
Report following the Bradford City disaster in 1985. Accordingly, before the 1988 semi-final the police decided
that sections of the Hillsborough Stadium should be allocated so as to achieve efficient segregation of
Liverpool and Nottingham Forest fans. The section to be granted to each was determined by the direction
whence each predominantly approached. Thus, Liverpool were allotted the north and west sides of the ground
for which access was from Leppings Lane. Nottingham Forest were allotted the south and east sides with access
from Penistone Road.

    36. The effect of the decision was that for this all-ticket Cup Tie, Liverpool were allotted only 24,256 places
 as against 29,800 for Nottingham Forest. This, although average attendance of supporters at home matches
 was substantially higher at Liverpool than at Nottingham. Moreover, with standing tickets at £6 and seats at
 £12, Nottingham Forest had 21,000 standing places compared with Liverpool’s 10,100. So, Liverpool’s
 allocation was more expensive as well as smaller. Understandably, Liverpool were aggrieved by the allocation
 of places and tickets. They sought with some support from the host club and the FA to have it changed in
 1988, but the police were adamant. To switch ends would, in their opinion, have involved rival supporters
 crossing each other’s paths when approaching the ground thereby frustrating attempts at segregation and
 creating a risk of disorder. In 1989, when the same plan was proposed, Liverpool again challenged it. The
 police, however, m aintained their view, adding that those who had attended in 1988 would be familiar with the
 arrangements and that any change would lead to confusion.
 Access from Leppings Lane
    37. As the plan Appendix 1 shows, the approach to the west turnstiles is across a narrow neck or forecourt at
 a bend in Leppings Lane where, coming from the north, it turns to the south-west and crosses a bridge over the
 river Don. Parking areas for the Liverpool supporters had been arranged north and west of the ground. They
 were therefore expected to arrive on foot along both limbs of Leppings Lane and would converge on the
 forecourt at the bend. In an arc across that forecourt is a line of railings with six sets of double gates. Inside
 those perimeter gates is the short approach to the turnstiles. As shown in the photographs Appendix 2, the
 latter are in two sections divided by a fence. The northern section consists of turnstiles 1 to 16. Numbers 1 to
  10 gave access to the north stand. Thus there were 10 turnstiles for the 9,700 with north stand seats. Their
 tickets were marked Entrance A’ and were colour-coded brown. Turnstiles 1 to 10 correspondingly had the
 letter A above them and brown boards on the wall.

    38. Turnstiles 11 to 16 were for those with seats in the west stand. Thus 4,456 were served by six turnstiles.
 They were the next block to the right of those marked A. However, instead of these turnstiles and the west stand
 tickets being marked B as might alphabetically have been expected, they were marked C. Their colour-code on
 tickets and boards was red.

   39. On the other side of the dividing fence in the approach area, there were only seven turnstiles to serve
 10,100 with tickets for the west terracing. Those seven turnstiles were labelled A to G. This was because there
had originally been 18 turnstiles at Leppings Lane and the sequential numbering continued from 19 upwards
on the south side of the ground. When the num ber at Leppings Lane was brought up to 23 the present
arrangements of 1 to 1-6, A to G and then 19 upwards was adopted to avoid re-numbering all round the ground.
However, above the lettering A to G was a large letter B. “Entrance B” also appeared on tickets for the west
terrace. Thus, the three blocks of turnstiles encountered by a ticket holder at the Leppings Lane end read from
left to right A, C, B. The colour-code for west terrace tickets and the boards beside turnstiles A to G was mauve.
To the right of turnstile G is a tubular steel barrier to divide the queue for that turnstile from the roadwav to the
south stand.

Inside the Leppings Lane Turnstiles
  40. Turnstiles 1 to 10 gave access to a passageway leading to the north stand. There is an exit gate (marked A
on Appendix 1) between turnstile 1 and the adjacent housing.

  41. Inside turnstiles 1 to 16 is a concourse leading to pens 6 and 7 and the steps to the west stand. There is a
wall dividing this area from that inside turnstiles A to G. It had been built to segregate home and away fans at a
time when the Club intended they should share the west terrace. That idea was not pursued but the wall
remained. There was, however, a gateway in the wall which did permit access between the two areas. An exit
gate (marked B on Appendix 1) was provided from the area inside turnstiles 11 to 16.

  42. Finally, anyone using turnstiles A to G entered a concourse bounded on the left by the wall just
mentioned and on the right by the wall of the private roadway coming from the south stand to Leppings Lane.
There was an exit gate in the latter wall (marked C on Appendix 1) just inside turnstile G.

  43. All three exit gates, A, B and C, were of concertina design. They could be opened only from the inside
and were not intended for entry of spectators into the ground.

   44. Those entering through turnstiles A to G had three options once inside the ground. They could by
moving to the right go round the south end of the west stand and gain entry into pens 1 and 2. They could go
through the gap in the dividing wall towards the concourse behind turnstiles 11 to 16 and then round the north
end of the west stand into pens 6 or 7. However, there were no conspicuous signs inviting them to take either of
those courses. The obvious way in was straight ahead of the turnstiles where a tunnel under the middle o f the
west stand gave access to pens 3 and 4. Above its entrance in large letters was the word “Standing” and a large
letter “B”. Thus B ticket holders were drawn towards the tunnel.

  45 The length of the tunnel is some 23 metres. It rises slightly at first then levels off but finally descends
towards the terraces at a gradient o f 1 in 6. As it emerges onto the terrace, the way ahead is bisected by the radial
fence between pen 3 on the right and pen 4 on the left. A short spur of brick wall projects forward from each side
of the tunnel at its mouth. Those emerging are thus guided straight forward rather than to either side. The
photograph at Appendix 3 shows the west stand and terraces.

  46.    As with the layout on the terraces, the configuration of the Leppings Lane turnstiles and the areas inside
them was effected by a series of piecemeal changes. Again, it will be necessary to analyse their resultant effect.
Policing Arrangements
   47. At the 1988 semi-final, policing had been under the control o f Chief Superintendent Mole, then
Com m ander o f F Division within whose area Hillsborough lies. He was still in post on 20 March 1989 when
the FA broached the 1989 semi-final, but he was due to hand over command o f F Division on 27 March to
Superintendent Duckenfield on the latter’s promotion to Chief Superintendent. Both were present at an initial
meeting on 22 March, but on 27 March M r Mole bowed out and Mr Duckenfield took over. U nder him were
Sector Commanders, all Superintendents with much experience o f policing football matches at Hillsborough
and elsewhere. In particular, Superintendent Marshall was in charge o f the area outside the Leppings Lane
entrance and the approaches to it. Superintendent Greenwood was in com m and inside the ground, but this
included the area between the turnstiles and the perimeter fence. They thereby swapped roles from the
previous year. U nder Mr Duckenfield’s overall command were some 801 officers and men on duty at the
ground plus traffic officers and others from D Division to deal with the influx of supporters into the city centre.
In all, therefore, some 1,122 police were deployed for this match amounting to about 38 per cent of the total
South Yorkshire force. Included in the m ounted section o f 34 were officers from Liverpool and Nottingham to
assist respectively in marshalling their home supporters. The total at the ground was divided into serials
consisting usually of eight to ten Constables plus a Sergeant and an Inspector. The serials were posted to duties
at various stations in and around the ground in three phases: before, during and after the match. All o f this
was provided for in an Operational O rder which followed closely the Order drawn up for the 1988 semi-final
and took into account the force’s “Standing Instructions for the Policing of Football G rounds”. The Order
described the duties o f each serial at each phase. It was supplemented by oral briefings before and on the day of
the match.

Sheffield Wednesday’s Arrangements
  48. The Club provided 376 stewards, gatemen and turnstile operators for duty on 15 April. The stewards
were briefed as to their duties on the morning o f the match by police Inspectors and were allocated round the
ground. They wore yellow tabards. The Club’s control room, situated below the south stand, could
communicate by VHF radio with the stewards. Closed circuit television was installed by the Club with
screens in their control room showing all the turnstiles round the ground. A computerised counting system was
incorporated in the turnstiles. This flashed onto a screen in the Club control room the running total of
spectators passing through the turnstiles section by section. Thus, at the Leppings Lane end, there would be
separate running totals for turnstiles 1 to 10 (north stand), turnstiles 11 to 16 (west stand), and turnstiles A to G
(west terraces). When the total for any section was within 15 per cent of its permitted capacity a warning pulse
showed on the screen. For the west terracing that warning would occur when the numbers were within 15 per
cent o f the total terrace capacity o f 10,100. What the system could not do was m onitor the distribution of fans
on the terracing, pen by pen. It could give np warning therefore if one pen was full beyond its safe capacity.

Police Communications
   49. The nerve centre for police control is the control room or box situated at the south-west corner o f the
ground between the south stand and pen 1 o f the west terracing. The box is elevated and reached by a num ber
o f steps. It has windows commanding views across the pitch and straight along the line of the west perimeter
fence. The box is very small and has seats for only three officers. Superintendent Murray was in control of it
and was advisor to M r Duckenfield as he had been to Mr Mole the year before. Next to him sat Sergeant
G oddard who operated the radios. The third seat was for Police Constable Ryan who operated the telephone
and public address systems. At the back o f the box stood Police Constable Bichard who was in control o f the
police closed circuit television system operated by a row of consoles on a bench in front o f him and behind the
three seated officers.

   50. There were five television screens showing views o f five roving cameras fixed at high points on the
stands and directed both inside and outside the ground. There was also a master screen which flicked in
rotation from one camera view to another and which made a video recording. The cameras have a zoom
facility to close in on any point of interest. Specifically, there were good camera views o f the west terracing, of
the Leppings Lane turnstiles and beyond them o f Leppings Lane itself.

  51. The Tannoy public address system was relayed through speakers fixed at vantage points inside the
ground and outside the turnstiles. It was used by a disc jockey, housed under the police control box, to relay
music before the match, but it could be overridden by the police. Messages could be relayed through all
speakers or if appropriate to one area only.
   53.   Radio contact at Hillsborough from control to serials operating both inside and outside the ground was
U H F on channel 25. There was a W1 FU portable base station in the control box and if it failed there was a
stand-by station under the operator’s bench. Hand sets were issued to all ranks of Sergeant and above.
Com munity Constables on duty would already have their own. Other Constables had no radio.
Communication was on “talk through” i.e. any message from any source would be heard by everyone tuned in
and if more than one source spoke messages could become garbled. Ear pieces were issued to some officers in
an attem pt to overcome the loud crowd noise which made receipt of signals very difficult. There were other
radio channels open to Sergeant Goddard: VHF to police Headquarters at Snig Hill, channel 35 to FI

Early Arrivals
  54. 15 April 1989 was a warm sunny spring Saturday. The match was a sell-out, so 54,000 ticket holders
were expected. Others would come without tickets hoping to acquire them or even to gain access otherwise.
The following account concentrates, as did the evidence, on the western approaches and the Liverpool
supporters since the disaster occurred at their end. They began to arrive in the Hillsborough area quite early in
small numbers. Some brought cans of beer with them and were seen drinking as they walked; others took
advantage of the weather and sat about on walls and open spaces. When the public houses opened, many
resorted there, drinking inside or spilling out into the sunshine. Leppings Lane and its environs comprise a
mixed shopping and residential area. Local residents saw groups o f Liverpool supporters keen to find a public
house or off-licence. Many were asking for tickets or “spares”. There were a few touts selling them at inflated
prices. From an early stage, some of the fans were using private gardens and yards to urinate. As the morning
wore on, numbers increased. Requests for tickets and trespass to urinate also increased. Still the prevailing
mood was one o f carnival, good hum our and expectation.

Public Houses
  55. There were some 74 shops with off-licences in and around Sheffield. In general, they opened at 8 am.
Liverpool supporters did visit them but the evidence did not suggest a great am ount of alcoholic drink was
bought there.

  56. Opening time at public houses was in general 11 am. Some remained closed all day. O f the others, some
72, mostly in the city, were frequented by local patrons only. Some 23 public houses, however, served over a
hundred Liverpool supporters each. Another 51 served more than 20 each. Little trouble was reported, but
many supporters drank enough to affect their mood. At first excitement: later frustration.

The Gathering Crowd
   57. Towards the end o f the morning, fans gathered on and around the bridge near the Leppings Lane
entrance. They seemed reluctant to enter the ground early. All turnstiles were open at 12 noon and one or two
as early as 11.30 am. Some 53 police had been deployed to operate outside the turnstiles and in the Leppings
Lane area. They enquired at random whether fans had tickets. Those who had not were advised to go away;
nevertheless, many returned more than once. Those who had tickets were guided in the right direction. The
police tried to persuade them to enter the ground early. Officers, male and female, had been posted outside
each turnstile with the duty o f searching entrants for weapons, drink or drugs. Once through the turnstile, an
entrant was liable to be searched again by one o f a serial of officers positioned just inside.

   58. At about 12 noon Chief Inspector Creaser asked Superintendent Murray whether the pens on the west
terrace were to be filled one by one successively, but was told that they should all be available from the start and
the fans should find their own level.

  59. By 2 pm it was apparent to those inside the ground and those monitoring events in the police and Club
control rooms that the num ber o f Nottingham fans in their places greatly outnum bered those from Liverpool.
The Kop and the south stand were filling up steadily, but the north and west stands were half empty. It was
noted about that time that the turnstile figures showed only 12,000 had entered as against 20,000 at the same
time the previous year. On the west terraces, although pens 3 and 4 were filling, the wing pens 1,2,6 and 7 were
nearly empty. At 2.15 pm a Tannoy message asked fans in pens 3 and 4 to move forward and make room for
others.

  60. There had been three special trains from Liverpool in 1988. This time, there was only one. It arrived
early, just before 2 pm, at Wadsley Bridge station. The 350 passengers were met by both m ounted and foot
police officers who escorted them in a crocodile down Leppings Lane. They were orderly and passed through
the turnstiles into the ground by about 2.20 pm without incident.

  61. By this time the police Traffic Division reported that the Liverpool routes were clear, so the majority of
Liverpool fans were in the Sheffield area. The numbers converging on the Leppings Lane entrance were
increasing rapidly. Between the perimeter gates and the turnstiles the crowd became congested. There was no
longer a separate queue at each turnstile but a single phalanx filling the whole approach area. The foot officers
outside the turnstiles were no longer able to search everyone and had difficulty in searching even selectively.
M ounted officers in and outside the turnstile area were having difficulty manoeuvring in such a dense crowd.
The police were beset by fans bemused by the ticket and turnstile labelling asking for directions. Many had
been drinking but up to and just after 2.30 pm the mood remained good.

   62.     Superintendent Marshall was on foot amongst the crowd. He became anxious about the numbers
coming down Leppings Lane and spilling out onto the roadway where buses and cars were moving. At 2.17
pm he radioed to control to have m otor traffic in Leppings Lane stopped. This was eventually done at about
2.30 pm. U p to this time, despite the large mass outside the turnstiles and the numbers still approaching, there
was still no panic in the crowd; no perception o f crisis by the police. In the control room Mr Murray, who could
see Leppings Lane on the video, advised Mr Duckenfield that they would get everyone in by 3 pm. Mr
Duckenfield reaffirmed to him the policy about a delayed kick-off. It would be ordered only if there was some
m ajor external factor such as fog on the Pennines or delay on the motorway: not if spectators merely turned up
late even in large numbers.




                                                      10

        63. In the 20 minutes from 2.30 pm to 2.50 pm there were crucial developments both inside and outside
    the ground. In pens 3 and 4 there was a steady increase in pressure as more fans came through the tunnel to the
    favoured area behind the goal. By 2.50 pm these pens were already full to a degree which caused serious
    discomfort to many well used to enduring pressure on terraces. The numbers at that time were clearly in excess
    o f the maximum density stated by the Home Office Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (1986 Edn) (the Green
    Guide) i.e. 54 persons per 10 square metres. (Although the Green Guide has no statutory or legal force, it is the
    only official advice available about safety at sports grounds.) In the wing pens 1, 2, 6 and 7, there was still
    ample room and bare patches o f concrete were visible.

       64. Meanwhile, the crowd grew at the Leppings Lane entrance. As more arrived at the back the crush at the
    front grew worse. Entry to the turnstiles became more difficult. Their efficiency was impaired and their rate
    reduced. Arrivals at the back exceeded deliveries through the turnstiles, so the build-up increased. The foot
    officers outside were unable to function and in danger themselves so they went through the turnstiles and out
    again through gate C where they did what they could to relieve pressure by the tubular barrier. The m ounted
    officers were surrounded by the dense mass o f people and became ineffective. Superintendent Marshall was in
    the midst of the turmoil. He extricated himself and stood on a parapet o f the bridge to get a clear view. A
    drunken fan tried to push him off: a beer can was thrown at a mounted officer. But these were isolated acts by


•
    individuals; the menace came from the massive numbers single-mindedly determined to be in for the kick-off
    with time running out. At the back o f the crowd fans were frustrated by the lack o f progress as 3 o’clock
    approached. Some, mostly young men who had been drinking, tried to push and force their way forward. At
    the front, people were jam m ed together and against the turnstile walls. Some panicked as the pressure
    intensified. Some youngsters and women were fainting and in distress. They were helped out through the
    tubular barrier by turnstile G or were passed over the turnstiles elsewhere. Fans climbed up and over the
    turnstile building or on to the dividing fence. This was to escape the crush rather than to gain free entry since
    most of them had tickets.

       65. At 2.44 pm Mr Marshall radioed for reinforcements, for the Tannoy to request the crowd to stop
    pushing and for a vehicle with loudspeaker equipm ent to come and request the same. Unhappily, at about 2.40
    pm, radio com munication on channel 25 became defective. For a period of two or three minutes the control
    room lost contact. A communications officer came promptly and switched to the standby station. With the use
    of a handset at control, contact was restored. Despite this hiatus, two o f M r Marshall’s requests were received.
    The Tannoy was used but with little effect. Reinforcements, including mounted officers from Penistone Road,
    were sent. The third request, for a Landrover, was received direct by its driver PC Buxton who arrived at 2.46
    pm and urged the crowd by loudspeaker not to push. This was no more effective than the Tannoy. The
    mounted officers besieged near the turnstiles came outside the perimeter gates. An attem pt was made to shut
    them against the crowd outside, to enable the throng inside to be dispersed or at least thinned through the
    turnstiles. The pressure from without, however, opened the gates again. M ounted officers, now reinforced to
    greater numbers, formed a cordon across the elbow o f Leppings Lane from the sweet shop to the bridge, again


*
    with the object of reducing pressure inside the gates. They were successful in this for some minutes despite
    desperate individuals forcing their way under or between the horses. However, this exercise was overtaken by a
    more dramatic relief o f the pressure.

    “Open the Gates”
      66. Between 2.40 pm and 2.45 pm the crowd inside and outside the turnstile approach had swelled to
    over 5,000. At the head o f the phalanx conditions had become intolerable. Those who got through were short
    of breath and sweating profusely. Many complained to police officers on the concourse inside the turnstiles
    and asked them in forceful terms to do something. Exit gates A and B were being shaken. It was clear the crowd
    could not pass through the turnstiles by 3 pm. Police Constable Buxton radioed from the Landrover to control
    asking that kick-off be postponed. The suggestion was acknowledged but rejected.

      67. Superintendent Marshall realised the crowd had become unmanageable. Although loth to do so, since it
    was contrary to basic police strategy, he decided to request the exit gates be opened to relieve the pressure.
    Otherwise, he feared fatalities would occur. Other senior officers outside the ground agreed. At 2.47 pm he
    radioed control to permit the gates to be opened. At 2.48 pm, whilst Mr Duckenfield was considering the
    request, gate C opened to eject a youth who had climbed in with no ticket. Immediately, fans outside took
    advantage and about 150 managed to get in before a mounted officer enabled the gate to be closed again. Mr
    Marshall repeated his request. Still no response from control. He repeated it a third time, adding that if the


                                                            11
gates were not opened someone was going to be killed. In the control room, M r Duckenfield had not made a
decision. M r Murray asked him “Are you going to open the gates?”. Mr Duckenfield gave the order and Sgt
Goddard radioed to Mr Marshall “Open the gates”. N either the Club control room nor any police officers
inside the turnstiles were told o f this order before or after it was given or o f any action it would require.

  68. At 2.52 pm, gate C was opened wide. Fans behind turnstiles A to G and from the concourse beyond
came round to flow through it in large numbers.

   69. About two minutes later the pressure outside gate A led Sgt Higgins to radio, despite the gateman’s
objection, for it to be opened. If it was not, he said, “It’ll go and someone will get killed”. Permission was given,
but this time reserve serials were alerted to m onitor the inrush towards the north stand. Gate B was also briefly
opened against the gateman’s wishes and about 200 o f those pressed at turnstiles A to G gained entry to their
left.

  70. The largest entry, however, was through gate C. In the five minutes it was open about 2,000 fans passed
through it steadily at a fast walk. Some may have had tickets for the stands. No doubt some had no tickets at all.
The majority had tickets for the terraces. O f these, some found their way either right to pens 1 and 2 or left
through the dividing wall to 6 and 7. But a large proportion headed straight for the tunnel in front of them.

   71. I h e initial influx through gate C, augmented by entrants via the turnstiles, came through the tunnel
with great momentum. Fans spoke o f being swept through, feet off the ground. The 1 in 6 gradient accelerated
their progress. Upon reaching the crowded pens, some wished to go back but were unable to do so. The new
arrivals found themselves pushed forward and the pressure became intense. At 2.54 pm, shortly after this
influx began, the teams came onto the pitch. As usual, this was greeted by a surge forward. Many were now
acutely uncomfortable and some were in distress. The mass seethed about but voluntary movement by any
individual was difficult; hands down could not be raised and some fans found it hard to breathe. Still the flow
continued through the tunnel causing further surges forward. There were shouts for help and for the gates to be
opened to the pitch. Police officers on the perimeter track did not immediately react. In the deafening noise
from chanting and shouting they did not at first recognise the problem. Realisation came at different moments
to different officers in different places.

   72. Gate 3 sprang open under the intense pressure from within. An officer quickly closed it. Shortly
afterwards, it sprang again; officers tried to shut it. Those seeking to escape were urged and pushed back. Gate
4 was opened by a policeman who noticed the crushing. People began to spill out through it and were directed
to the wing pens where there was still ample room. Meanwhile, gate 4 was closed again and then re-opened. At
gate 3, a Constable, now alive to the crisis, followed strictly his written orders and radioed for permission to
open that gate. Receiving no reply, he took it upon himself to open it.

  73. Just before 3 pm, the match kicked off. At the same time, gate C, which had been closed at 2.57 pm,
was reopened and a steady trickle continued to enter through the tunnel.

   74. To escape the crush, fans began climbing the radial fences out of pens 3 and 4 into pens 2 and 5. Others
tried to get over the front perimeter fence but were at first turned back by police who feared a pitch invasion.
Near the front, fans, mostly youngsters, were weakened to the point of collapse and in some instances death but
they were held upright by pressure all round. Further back, most were so preoccupied with the pain o f being
pressed against barriers and with breathing problems that they saw nothing o f the game. But at the rear there
were many who, although cramped, were watching the football unaware o f the distress at the front.

  75. At 3.04 pm, Beardsley for Liverpool struck the crossbar at the Kop end. There was a roar from the
Liverpool fans and at the same time a powerful surge forwards in pen 3. The several surges which occurred after
the influx from gate C carried the pressure down the pens towards the pitch. The force became such as to twist
and break two spans o f a crush barrier towards the front o f pen 3. The evidence does not establish with
certainty when this happened. Probably it was triggered by the surge at 3.04 pm. But I am sure it occurred after
the influx from gate C so greatly increased the pressure in the pen. When the barrier broke those whom it had
supported were projected towards the perimeter fence. Many fell and the involuntary rush o f those behind
pressed them down. The crushing force was transm itted and dispersed so that all along the front o f pen 3 fans
were pressed hard up against the low wall and the wire mesh of the fence above it.

  76. In pen 4 no barrier broke. Nevertheless those at the front were crushed against wall and fence. Further
back, two barriers were bowed and some individuals succumbed to the pressure around them.

   77. Surges on terraces are common. Usually, they go forward, then recede. Here, with the weight of
numbers, there was no receding. The pressure stayed and for those crushed breathless by it, standing or prone,
life was ebbing away. If no relief came in four minutes there would be irreversible brain damage; if longer,
death.

  78. In the control room no-one noticed the overcrowding or anything amiss in pens 3 and 4 until the first
fans spilt out onto the perimeter track just before kick-off. Then, the officers in command assumed that there
was an attem pted pitch invasion. They called up reserve serials waiting in the gymnasium and all available
officers elsewhere to go to the pitch. A request was made to HQ for dog handlers.

   79. Superintendent Greenwood, the Ground Commander, was by the players’ tunnel at the kick-off. He
noticed fans on the track and went to the west end behind the goal. As he approached, he did not think the pens
overcrowded until he was very close and saw those pressed against the fence. Even then, he thought the
situation “retrievable” if those higher up the pen relieved the pressure. He climbed on the wall below the fence
and signalled with both hands to those behind to move back. Other officers joined him. It was impossible.
Those fans who would have wished to comply were powerless to do so. Behind them, there were still many
unaware o f the crisis, watching the game. The football continued to joyous shouting and singing round the rest
o f the ground while those crushed and trapped slowly expired.

   80.   When Mr Greenwood’s signals to move back proved fruitless, he tried to radio for the match to be
stopped. At first, his message was not received by control, so he signalled with his arms towards the control
box. Mr Duckenfield sent M r Murray down from the box to have the match stopped via the linesman, the
agreed emergency drill. Before he could do so, M r Greenwood ran over the pitch to the referee who stopped the
game. It was 5'k minutes past 3.

Rescue Attempts
   81. From 3 o ’clock, gates 3 and 4 had been open and remained so. At first, fans had walked or staggered out
winded and faint. But the final surge at 3.04 pm, and the struggle to reach the open gates, caused a horrendous
blockage o f bodies. The dead, the dying and the desperate became interwoven in the sump at the front o f the
pens, especially by the gates. Those with strength left clambered over others submerged in the hum an heap and
tried to climb out over the fence. They were now helped by police and other fans who hauled them up and over.
Numbers o f fans were climbing over the radial fences into adjacent pens. At the back, many were hauled up
into the west stand to relieve the pressure.

   82. The steps from the sump at gateways 3 and 4 were so congested with bodies live and dead that each had
to be prised from the pile by the police. Initially, no officer took effective charge. A num ber o f individual
officers and fans worked frantically to free those trapped but the gateways were so narrow that only two or three
could get at the entwined bodies Willing hands got in one another’s way. More officers arrived from the
gymnasium and elsewhere in the ground. Many used their own initiative to help those laid out on the pitch, to
assist in getting others over the fencing and to comfort the distressed. But some stood in groups near the
perimeter fence not knowing what to do. They had been summoned in response to what was thought to be a
threat to public order. What they found was a horrific scene o f carnage and some young officers were shocked
into impotence by what they saw.

   83. It was truly gruesome. The victims were blue, cyanotic, incontinent; their mouths open, vomiting; their
eyes staring. A pile o f dead bodies lay and grew outside gate 3. Extending further and further on to the pitch, the
injured were laid down and attempts made to revive them. More and more walking survivors flooded out on to
the pitch as the players left. The scene was emotive and chaotic as well as gruesome. As the enormity o f the
disaster was realised, many of the fans milling about were bitter and hostile to the police, blaming them for
what had happened. Officers were confronted, abused, spat upon and even assaulted. A small num ber of
hysterical fans had to be subdued.

   84. Adding to the chaos, a num ber o f press photographers dodged about among rescue workers apparently
avid to secure photographs at point blank range o f those dying through the wire mesh and those laid on the
pitch. Angry fans sought to assault them. Police had to intervene.

   85. At about 3.12 pm, Chief Superintendent Nesbit, Com mander o f the Traffic Division, arrived on the
pitch. He took charge at gate 3 and organised a chain o f officers to simplify and expedite the extraction of
casualties from the pen. In the absence o f any mechanical means, police and fans together pulled and worked
at the wire mesh with their bare hands and their feet to breach the fencing. They succeeded in both pens,
enabling officers to get in and fans to be got out.

   86. By now, some officers o f their own initiative went round from the pitch to the tunnel where they met
other officers from the turnstiles and the west stand. Together, they tried to persuade fans at the rear o f the pens
to go back through the tunnel. Some complied, but many resisted, wishing to stand their ground. Casualties
were brought out through the tunnel, and as the pressure in the pens was relieved, officers were able to get
further in and bring out more casualties, dead and alive. They were laid on the ground in the concourse outside
the tunnel and attempts were made to revive them.

First Aid
  87. The St John Ambulance Brigade had some 30 personnel posted round the ground for the match - 25
adults and 5 junior cadets, They were quickly on the scene when the first casualties emerged and sought to
revive them. Their Divisional Superintendent, Mr Wells, tried unsuccessfully to help those pressed against the
fencing by feeding oxygen to them through the mesh until they could be got out.

  88. Dr Purcell, Sheffield Wednesday’s doctor, came from his seat in the south stand and attempted
resuscitation. Assisted by a male nurse from the crowd, he moved from patient to patient doing what he could,
but in most cases it was too late.

  89. At 3.13 pm a St John’s ambulance came onto the pitch at the north-east corner and drove to the
perimeter fence close to gate 3. There was no call for doctors and nurses on the public address system until
nearly 3.30 pm. Nevertheless, as the minutes ticked past, some o f them came onto the pitch to help o f their
own accord when they saw the casualties and the ambulance and realised the gravity o f the situation. Many
fans also worked prodigiously in attempts to revive the dead and the dying, in some cases their own relatives
and friends. Artificial respiration, mouth to mouth respiration and cardiac massage were applied by the skilled
and the unskilled but usually in vain. Those capable o f survival mostly came round o f their own accord. The
rest were mostly doomed before they could be brought out and treated.

   90. There was an urgent need to get casualties off the pitch and to hospital. There were six stretchers in the
first aid room and three in the St John’s ambulance. They were quickly brought into use. Then the fans
improvised by tearing down the hoardings around the edge of the pitch and against the stands so that lengths of
board could be used as stretchers. Improvising in this way, parties of fans and police ran repeatedly the length
of the pitch bearing casualties to the north-east corner. A num ber were dead on arrival there.

In the Control Room
  91. M r Duckenfield stayed in the control room. Chief Inspector McRobbie was there in civilian clothes as
an observer. Mr Duckenfield sent him down to the track to tell a policewoman at gate 1 to adm it those
displaced from the centre pens. M r Duckenfield did not realise there were injuries until he saw someone laid
on the pitch. Even then, he did not realise the nature o f the problem or its scale.

  92. M r Murray returned from his attem pt to stop the match and Mr Duckenfield sent him down again to
clear the pitch and assess the situation. A message was broadcast requesting fans to clear the pitch. This was
because Mr Duckenfield could not from the control room see clearly what was happening for the milling and
increasing numbers.

   93. The Assistant Chief Constable (Operations), Mr Jackson, had attended the match in civilian clothes as
a guest of the Club. He came from his seat in the south stand to ask what had happened. Mr Duckenfield was
unable to say; he did not tell M r Jackson that the exit gates had been opened on his authority. Mr Jackson went
down to the pitch to discover the situation.

   94. At 3.06 pm M r Duckenfield, still primarily concerned about public order, caused a message to be sent
to Headquarters asking for Operation Support. That was a call for all available additional police resources to
come to the ground to strengthen the police presence.

   95. M r Jackson was told by M r Greenwood that there were casualties and returned immediately to control
to make sure emergency services were alerted. Meanwhile, M r Murray had seen the plight of those behind the
fence. He radioed to control that a fleet o f ambulances was required. He also asked for a Tannoy broadcast to
those in the pens to move back but there is no clear evidence that it was made.

  96. Only when Mr Duckenfield received the request for a fleet of ambulances did he realise the nature and
gravity o f the situation. Then, supported by Mr Jackson, he caused messages to be sent converting Operation
Support into calls for the M ajor Disaster Plan.

No Information
   97. Apart from the message to clear the pitch and the belated call for medical assistance about 3.30 pm, no
inform ation or advice was broadcast on the public address system. M r Duckenfield feared that the crowd
might turn hostile or might all attem pt to leave together thereby hampering the emergency services if they were
given information about what had happened. The result was that apart from those close enough at the west end
to see the terrible truth for themselves, the majority of the crowd were left in ignorance. Many, especially
Nottingham supporters in the Kop, still thought there had been a pitch invasion or other misbehaviour by
Liverpool fans. They continued singing and chanting incongruously. This infuriated some Liverpool fans who
were already distraught. A few began to run towards the Kop end. The police feared violence might result on
top o f the existing disaster. Accordingly, they deployed a large number of officers to form a line across the
width of the pitch at the Kop end and advance up to the halfway line sweeping any Liverpool fans back as they
moved. There the line stood as an insurance against disorder but doing nothing. O ther officers were posted to
the perimeter track facing the north stand for the same purpose. To those distressed and distraught who
wanted urgent action, this large contingent of passive officers was seen as an affront. Feelings against the police
intensified.

M isinform ation
  98. At about 3.15 pm, M r G raham Kelly, Chief Executive of the FA, Mr Kirton also of the FA and Mr
G raham Mackrell, Secretary of Sheffield Wednesday, went to the control room for information. Mr
Duckenfield told them he thought there were fatalities and the game was likely to be abandoned. He also said a
gate had been forced and there had been an inrush o f Liverpool supporters. He pointed to one of the television
screens focussed on gate C by the Leppings Lane turnstiles and said “That’s the gate that’s been forced: there’s
been an inrush”. Inevitably M r Kelly was interviewed a little later live on television. He spoke o f the two stories
concerning the gate - the fans’ account that the police had opened it, the police assertion that the fans had
forced their way in.

  99. About 3.30 pm there was a further meeting in the Club’s boardroom. M r Duckenfield went there and
met M r Kelly, the referee and representatives of the three clubs. ACC Jackson was also there. Mr
Duckenfield indicated the match was likely to be abandoned although no firm ruling was given. He added that
he did not want people to know it was to be abandoned lest the dispersing crowd ham per the emergency
operations.

Public Announcements
   100. Later the managers o f the two teams were asked to go to the control room. They were invited there to
make a public announcem ent to calm the crowd. M r Kenny Dalglish agreed to do so. He told the crowd that
there were problems and asked them to assist the police and those rendering first aid. He asked for calm and his
message was well received. It was then 3.56 pm. At 4.10 pm it was announced that the match was abandoned
for that day. Again that message was received calmly by the crowd most o f whom behaved responsibly as they
dispersed.

Fire Brigade
   101. Meanwhile the emergency services had been in action. At about 3.10 pm a request came from the
perimeter fence to control for bolt croppers to cut the wire mesh. Sergeant Goddard contacted the police garage
close by without success. At 3.13 pm, PC Bichard requested Headquarters to call the fire service to bring
hydraulic cutting equipm ent to the Leppings Lane entrance.

   102. There was no arrangement for a fire officer to be present during the match. However, the M ajor
Disaster Plan required all emergency services to be alerted. After ’phone messages which m ust be described
later, fire appliances arrived at both Leppings Lane and Penistone Road at 3.22 pm. At both entrances their
arrival surprised police who were uninformed as to why they had been called or where they should go.

  103. At Leppings Lane a police Inspector told Station Officer Swain “I don’t really think we need you” .
Another police officer then asked for more resuscitators as people were dying so M r Swain radioed for ten fire
appliances. Each carries oxygen and resuscitation equipment.

   104. At the Kop end, Leading Fireman Housley arrived with an emergency tender and Station Officer
Fletcher in another appliance, each with a crew. The emergency tender came along the roadway by the south
stand but owing to its height was unable to proceed further. It therefore backed out and went to the Leppings
Lane entrance losing some eight minutes. From there, M r Housley and his crew went onto the pitch with
resuscitation equipment. They rendered help there and later at the gymnasium. M r Fletcher and his men ran
along behind the south stand carrying cutting equipm ent and oxygen cylinders. When they arrived at the
fence, the cutting equipm ent was not required as by then the last o f the dead and injured were being removed
from the pens. M r Fletcher set up a casualty clearing area under the police box and firemen assisted in carrying
victims as well as rendering first aid on the pitch.

South Yorkshire M etropolitan Ambulance Service (S Y M A S )
   105. Before 1986 there had been no SYMAS representative routinely present at Hillsborough matches. The
Club was content, as indeed are many other clubs, to rely upon the St John’s Ambulance Brigade and a 999 call
if necessary. From 1986 onwards, after representations, the Club provided two seats in the south stand for
SYMAS staff at League matches. At one stage it was suggested they would be best placed in the north stand
close to the gymnasium which had been designated as the casualty centre in the event of a major incident. The
south stand seats were allotted as they placed the SYMAS staff closer to the players’ tunnel should a player be
injured. These seats were, however, not available at Cup semi-finals. SYMAS representatives nevertheless
attended at the semi-finals by arrangement with the police in 1988 and again in 1989. The SYMAS officers
stood on the ramp leading to the pitch at the north-east corner. They had one ambulance outside the ground
and one on standby.

   106. On 15 April 1989, Officers Higgins and Eason were at the ground with an ambulance and crew. They
noticed fans on the track and went to the Leppings Lane end whilst the game was still in progress. They began
to attend to casualties. Meanwhile, at 2.59 pm, there had been a call from Police Constable Waugh at police
Headquarters to the Hillsborough police control asking if ambulances were required. This was on the
instruction of Chief Inspector Edmundson who had heard over the radio, as had Police Constable Waugh
himself, crowd noise and snatches o f speech from Hillsborough suggesting distress and possible injuries. The
reply from the control box was: no reports of injuries but keep standing by. At 3.07 pm after hearing from the
ground that there might be injuries, police Headquarters notified SYMAS that ambulances might be required.
Then, seconds later, M r M urray’s request for a fleet o f ambulances was relayed to SYMAS. They reacted at
once. Ambulances began to arrive at the Leppings Lane entrance at 3.13 pm and at the Penistone Road
entrance at 3.17 pm. In all, some 42 ambulances attended, 31 of them from SYMAS and 11 from
neighbouring authorities. By 4.30 pm, they had conveyed some 172 casualties to the Northern General
Hospital and the Royal Hallamshire Hospital.

Gymnasium
   107. The gymnasium had been in use for serving meals to the police. When the M ajor Disaster Plan was
ordered, it was cleared and divided into two. One end became a temporary mortuary; the other was used as a
casualty clearing area for the injured. As the stretchers, designed and improvised, brought in more and more
casualties, the scene was initially and inevitably chaotic and harrowing. There was intense distress amongst
the injured and bereaved; relatives were reluctant to be parted from the dead and sought to revive them. There
were people looking for missing friends and relations; there were recriminations, there were scuffles. Some of
those involved were the worse for drink. Doctors and nurses had followed the casualties in from the pitch and
sought to attend the injured as best they could in the adverse circumstances. Those in most urgent need of
hospital treatm ent were taken to ambulances as they arrived, triage being employed to determine priorities.
Doctors were requested by the police to examine each person thought to be deceased to confirm and certify
death. A police Constable was detailed to attend and guard each of the dead and a photograph of each was
taken by a police photographer so that relatives coming to identify bodies could be spared the ordeal of
searching amongst all who had died.

The Dead and the Injured
  108. O fth e 9 5 who died, the evidence suggests that at least 16 and probably 21 came through gate C after it
opened at 2.52 pm. That is established by the statements of relatives and friends who came through with them
but survived.

   109. By commendable hard work, a team of pathologists headed by Professor Usher completed
post-mortem examinations on all the deceased within 48 hours. They found that 88 of the victims were male
and seven female. Thirty-eight were under 20 years of age, 39 were between 20 and 29 years and only three were
over 50. In virtually every case the cause of death was crush asphyxia due to compression of the chest wall
against other bodies or fixed structures so as to prevent inhalation. In all but nine cases that was the sole cause.
In one, pressure on the chest had been so great as to rupture the aorta; in six cases there were also injuries to the
head, neck or chest; in the remaining two cases, natural disease was a contributory factor. In 18 cases bones
were fractured. Thirteen of those were rib fractures. However, one was a fractured femur, one a fractured
radius and the remaining three involved fractures of bones or cartilages round the voice box. These injuries
suggest the victims may have been trodden while on the ground.

  110. Blood samples were taken from the dead. No alcohol was found in any of the females. O f the males, 51
had no more than 10 milligrams per cent in their blood which is negligible; 15 had over 80 milligrams per cent
and six over 120 milligrams per cent.

  111. Although the great majority of those who died were in pen 3, at least five were in pen 4. Most deaths
occurred at the front of the pens but there were a few fatalities further back.

  112. In all, some 730 people complained of being injured inside the ground and 36 outside it. O f the 730,
about 30% are thought to have entered through gate C after 2.52 pm. The largest category of injury was
bruising, especially to the ribs and chest.

   113. I have given my findings as to the basic factual background and the main sequence of events in
narrat.veform . There was very little conflict as to the principal events save as to some timings and numbers.
Indeed, the consistency o f the evidence has been a remarkable feature of this Inquiry. The experiences of most
witnesses were unforgettable and no doubt the early hearing helped to preserve accurate memory. Also, the
existence o f tim ed videos and photographs and of logged and taped messages provided reliable checks by
which to prom pt and test witness recollection. Accordingly, I have not for the most part burdened the narrative
with citations from the evidence of individual witnesses.

   114. However, there were several instances of detailed evidence and assertions being highlighted by the
media in dramatic and emotive terms during the hearing. Since some of those much-publicised incidents gave
rise to unfair criticism, they ought to be the subject of specific findings. I have therefore dealt with them
individually at Appendix 6.

                                 PART II - WHY DID IT HAPPEN?


                  "Events o f the magnitude o f Hillsborough don’t usually happen ju st for one
               single reason, nor is it usually possible to pin the blame on one single scapegoat. . .
               . . . Disasters happen because a whole series o f mistakes, misjudgments and
               mischances happen to come together in a deadly combination. ”
                                                              Dr John Habgood, Archbishop of York, preaching at
                                                             the Hillsborough Memorial Service on 23 April 1989.

   115. This disaster was the worst in the history of British football. It happened because pens 3 and 4 became
grossly overcrowded. They were uncomfortably overcrowded by 2.50 pm at least to a degree which required
that they should be closed to further arrivals. Even the numbers coming through the turnstiles in the last 10
m inutes would have increased the pressure beyond danger point and there would have been injuries if not
fatalities. As it was, the influx through gate C after 2.52 pm so increased the pressure in the two pens as to
cause fatal crushing.

  116. The overcrowding up to 2.52 pm was due to a num ber o f factors which can be considered broadly
under three heads.
   (i) The layout at the Leppings Lane end.
  (ii) Lack of fixed capacities for the pens.
 (iii) Lack of effective monitoring o f the terraces.

    117. The crushing and fatalities after 2.52 pm must be considered under a num ber o f headings.
  (iv) The build-up at the turnstiles.
   (v) The blunder on opening the gates.
  (vi) The barriers in pen 3.
 (vii) The crushing not recognised.
(viii) The response o f the police.
 (ix)   The perim eter gates were too small.

  118. I have already observed that the layout of the turnstile area, o f the terraces and o f the concourse
between them was the result of piecemeal changes. A brief history of these changes is now necessary.

The History
   119. Before 1965, the Leppings Lane end consisted entirely of terracing like the Kop. In that year, the west
stand was built and the terraces remaining in front o f it were truncated to their present depth, front to back. As
to width, they consisted of a single standing area with no dividing fences. During the early 1970’s, hooliganism
and pitch invasions made it necessary to prevent access to the playing area and the perim eter fences were
therefore erected in 1977.


   120. Section 1 of the Safety o f Sports Grounds Act 1975 empowered the Secretary of State to designate a
sports stadium having, in his opinion, accommodation for more than 10,000 as a stadium requiring a
certificate from the local authority. Hillsborough was so designated with effect from 1 January 1979 by SI
1978/1091. In anticipation of that date, Sheffield Wednesday instructed Eastwood and Partners, a firm of
consulting engineers, to act on their behalf especially in their dealings with the local authority. D r Eastwood,
the principal of the firm, is a highly experienced civil and structural engineer and has advised several major
football clubs. He recommended that a num ber of additional crush barriers should be added since those
already in place were insufficient to comply with the Green Guide (1976 edition). That work was approved
and carried out during 1979.


  121. The relevant local authority at the time was the South Yorkshire County Council. It set up an Officer
Working Party consisting o f representatives o f the police, the fire service, its own building surveyor’s division
and its own legal and adm inistration department. The Working Party made inspections and consulted with the
Club and D r Eastwood. A Safety Certificate was issued on 21 December 1979 for an indefinite period. It has
remained in force ever since and has not been amended.


   122. Schedule 3 o f the certificate sets out the maximum crowd capacity for various areas in the ground. The
figure for the west terrace is 7,200 and for the north-west terrace 2,900. These figures were intended to be in
accordance with the Green Guide (1976). Paragraph 15.4 provided for a maximum “packing density” of
between 54 and 27 persons per 10 square metres depending on the condition of the terrace. D r Eastwood had
calculated 8,000 for the west terrace on the basis o f 54 per 10 square metres. He thought this a justified starting
figure in view of his improved system of barriers. However, he reduced it to 7,200 because there were no
gangways on the terrace and he did not think it feasible to provide any. So, the total figure for the Leppings Lane
terraces was and is 10,100.

The 1981 Semi-Final
  123. As already mentioned, there was crushing at the Cup semi-final in 1981. The match was between
Tottenham Hotspur and Wolverhampton Wanderers. The police debriefing minutes after the incident
prophetically refer,


   to the late arrival of a large num ber of spectators who were still waiting to enter the Leppings Lane
  enclosure when the match started. The flash point occurred when Tottenham scored” (at the Kop end) “after
  only three minutes. The spectators just entering pushed forward to see what was happening and caused a
  crush, which resulted in the injuries”.


   124. Those being crushed called for the perimeter gates to be opened onto the track. There was no
immediate reaction, according to M r Vaux who was there, but fortunately a police Inspector gave instructions
and the gates were then opened. About 250 came out onto the track. There were broken arms, legs and ribs and
38 were treated either in hospital or by the St John Ambulance Brigade. It is clear from the documents (a) that
the turnstile readings showed the capacity figure of 10,100 had been exceeded by over 400 (b) that the police
shut off further access to the terraces because of crushing, and (c) the police view after the event was that the
capacity figure of 10,100 in the Safety Certificate was too high. This latter view was communicated to the Club
by the Chief Superintendent then in com m and of F Division but it was not pursued.
Three Pens
  125. After this incident in April 1981 the police requested that the terrace should be divided into sections.
The object was to improve crowd control by reducing sideways movement. Division would enable more even
distribution to be effected when there was a capacity crowd. It would also enable the west end to be used for
both home and away supporters who could be segregated in separate pens, if necessary with an empty pen
between them.

   126. This proposal was agreed by the Club and the Officer Working Party and was approved by the local
authority. Two radial fences were accordingly fitted in November 1981. They are the fence now separating pens
2 and 3 and that now separating 5 and 6. The result was to divide the whole terrace into three pens. Access from
the concourse to the middle pen was through the tunnel and to the wing pens round the sides o f the west stand.
D r Eastwood suggested and illustrated an altered layout which would have provided separate access through
separate banks o f turnstiles to the north stand, to each end o f the west stand, and to each o f the three pens.
Whilst the main object of this was segregation, such a layout would have enabled each of those areas to be
monitored numerically via the turnstiles so as to ensure its maximum capacity was not exceeded. The plan was
not adopted. The maximum capacity for the new centre pen was calculated at 2,200, but no alteration was
made to the Safety Certificate so to limit it nor was there any means mechanically of counting the numbers
going into that pen.

The 1985 Changes
   127. By 1985, Sheffield Wednesday had been prom oted to the First Division and was drawing larger
crowds. The improvement of the Leppings Lane end was raised again by the Club and D r Eastwood prepared a
num ber of drawings. These illustrated various schemes for achieving segregation by providing more turnstiles
in separate banks and divisions o f the concourse. The police wanted further divisions o f the terrace itself,
again to improve control and segregation. There was much discussion of these schemes which included
suggestions o f 29 and even 34 turnstiles in total. In the result, the following alterations were carried out in
1985.

New Radial Fences
  128. On the terraces, two more radial fences were fitted. One divided the existing central pen into the
present pens 3 and 4. Gates were fitted at the mouth o f the tunnel to enable each of those pens to be closed off.
The second fence was placed in the new pen 4 so as to create the narrow pen 5 intended to be a sterile area. Until
those two fences were added there existed only perimeter gates 1,2,4, 5 and 6. The creation of pen 3 required a
new gate 3 to be fitted which was done.

Barriers
   129. The lines of the new radial fences ran across existing crush barriers so that without modification those
barriers would have run through the fencing. The police considered the barriers would be used by fans as
convenient mounting points to scale the new fences, thereby defeating their object. They therefore wished
spans to be removed from the barriers. Had their wishes been met in full the result would have been an
unim peded run in pen 3 from the mouth of the tunnel down the south side o f the new fence to the perimeter. D r
Eastwood dug his heels in against that proposal which he rightly regarded as dangerous. He did however agree
to some modification to the middle row of barriers in the newly created pen 3, chiefly to facilitate access.
Likewise in the new pen 5. The 1985 modifications to the pens are shown on the plan Appendix 4.

The Turnstiles and Concourse
   130. At the entrance, modification but no increase in num ber was made at the turnstiles. The bank 1 to 16
was divided from A to G by the metal fence now in place and that division was projected across the concourse
inside the turnstiles in the form of a brick wall. A personnel gate was provided for access through that wall but
was enlarged to its present size at the request of the police. Those alterations were made in the interests of
segregation. The more elaborate divisions which D r Eastwood had suggested, giving separate access to each
sub-division of the accommodation, were not pursued for financial reasons. In May 1985 the Bradford
disaster occurred. The south stand at Hillsborough had wooden decking and the Club realised it would have to
undertake expensive remedial works there. The cantilever roof o f the same stand was also discovered to
require expensive repairs.

   131. In fact, shortly after the new dividing fence and wall had been built at the Leppings Lane entrance and
concourse, the Club, by agreement with Chief Superintendent Mole, ceased to accommodate home supporters
at the Leppings Lane end. There was therefore no longer any need for segregation at that end, but the wall
remained.
   132. Also in 1985, electronic counting equipm ent was installed at all turnstiles. This conveyed the running
count for each bank of turnstiles, for example A to G, to a television screen in the Club control room where the
figures were displayed. In 1986, an electronic eye was installed in each turnstile booth to catch and record
anyone who climbed over the turnstile.

B arrier 144
   133. In June 1986, the police requested that the crush barrier nearest to the tunnel at the entrance to pens 3
and 4 should be removed to assist the flow of fans into the pens. They found it caused obstruction because it
was in a good viewing position and spectators liked to stand against it in numbers thereby blocking access by
others further into the pens. The police also suggested it might ham per effective evacuation through the tunnel
especially in an emergency. D r Eastwood considered the pros and cons of this proposal and accepted the police
view. The Officer Working Party approved the proposal at a meeting on 7 August 1986 on site. Authority was
given then and there by M r Bownes on behalf o f the Sheffield City Council which had taken over responsibility
for the Safety Certificate from South Yorkshire County Council on 1 April 1986. Two spans o f the barrier were
therefore removed, leaving only one span in pen 4 as shown on Appendix 4.

Effects of the Layout
   134. The result of these changes was to divide the terrace into a num ber of small areas without providing
any computerised or mechanical means of limiting entry numerically into any one area if all areas were open
for choice. Before the fences and pens had divided the terrace, the overall figure o f 10,100 could be monitored
via the turnstiles and in theory the crowd could even itself out laterally. Even then, it was not possible strictly to
ensure compliance with Schedule 3 Part 1 of the Safety Certificate which prescribed a maximum of 2,900 for
the north-west terrace and 7,200 for the west terrace. Paragraph 3 of Schedule 2 of the Safety Certificate
provides:

  “The num ber of spectators adm itted to the Stadium and to the several areas of spectator accommodation
  within the Stadium shall not exceed the figures specified in Part 1 o f Schedule 3” .

  The Club had to rely upon visual monitoring.

   135. The situation became worse however with the division of the west terrace into pens. Not only were
there more and smaller discrete areas but some were likely to attract more than their appropriate share of the
10,100 total. It is well recognised that the area behind the goal is very popular. Moreover, the position of the
tunnel vis-a-vis the turnstiles A to G, its labelling and the absence o f signposts advertising the wing pens would
draw to it those with terrace tickets. It was therefore highly likely that pens 3 and 4 would fill to capacity and
indeed exceed it unless preventive steps were taken. H ad D r Eastwood’s plan for separate turnstile access to
separate sections with separate toilet and refreshment facilities been implemented, total computerised control
could have been kept.




                                                          23
                                                   CHAPTER8
                              LA C K O F F IX E D C A P A C IT IE S FO R T H E PE N S

  136. In 1981, when the terrace was divided into three areas, D r Eastwood gave the Club the figure of 2,200
capacity for the centre pen. He based this on the Green Guide, making such allowances as he thought right. No
doubt the numbers could have been counted in via the turnstiles if only that pen was in use or if such pens as
were in use were filled sequentially, but not otherwise.

   137. After the 1985 changes, D r Eastwood did not himself give any figures for the new pens 3 and 4.
Someone on his staff however split the figure 2,200 into 1,200 for pen 3 and 1,000 for pen 4. Those figures did
not even take account o f the fact that pen 5 had been carved out of pen 4 which was bound to have a reducing
effect on capacity. Nevertheless, the figures of 1,200 and 1,000 were put on a drawing emanating from
Eastwood and Partners and the figures have been notionally regarded since as applicable by the Club and the
police. They are in fact too high.

  138. D r Nicholson, at the Research and Laboratory Services Division of the Health and Safety Executive,
has calculated that the figures for pens 3 and 4 respectively would be 1,015 and 1,036 if the strength and
spacing o f the crush barriers had complied with the Green Guide. But they did not.
Departures from the Green Guide
   139. In pen 3, four out of five gaps in the lines of crush barriers do not conform with paragraph 115 o f the
Green Guide (1986). In pen 4, nine out o f ten do not conform. In particular, the spans taken out of the barriers
in pen 3 in 1985 left gaps well in excess of the m aximum of 1.4 metres prescribed. One gap was 57% wider than
the Green Guide maximum. Moreover, that gap was in direct diagonal line from the mouth o f the tunnel to the
barrier which collapsed. D r Eastwood justified these larger gaps by the absence of gangways. Fans had to be
able to get in and out and standard gaps tended to get blocked up. The effect of his reasoning was that the
absence o f gangways, recognised as having a safety function, led to the sacrifice of a second safety feature,
namely gaps o f strictly limited width.

  140. Again, the removal o f barrier 144 was bound, as D r Eastwood conceded, to affect capacity. In fact it
did more, as I shall indicate later.

  141. Capacity should also have taken account of two further departures from the Green Guide. If, as was
the case, the perim eter gates were not regarded as exits, some 40% o f those in pens 3 and 4 were more than 12
metres from an exit (and there was no gangway) contrary to the aim of paragraph 96. Four out of five of the
crush barriers in pen 3 and six out of nine in pen 4 were below the height prescribed in paragraph 110. These
were the old barriers which had been repaired and plated where their bases had corroded and fresh concrete
had been applied, raising the level of the steps. The point is not academic since, in the event, many fans were
bent painfully over barriers under great pressure.

  142. D r Nicholson calculated that when all relevant factors regarding the configuration and the Green
Guide are taken into account, the maximum capacity for pen 3 should have been 822 and for pen 4, 871.
Safety Certificate
   143. Whatever should have been the m aximum capacities for pens 3 and 4, the fact is that no figures at all in
respect o f them were put into the Safety Certificate. Despite all the changes in layout of the fences and barriers,
the two figures, 2,900 for the north-west terrace and 7,200 for the west terrace, have remained as the only
m axima with which the Club has to comply.

  144. Section 2(1) of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 provides (so far as is relevant):

  “A Safety Certificate shall contain such terms and conditions as the local authority consider necessary or
  expedient to secure reasonable safety at the stadium when it is in u s e . . . ”
  Section 2(2) provided (so far as is relevant):

  “W ithout prejudice to sub-section (1) above, a Safety Certificate-
  (a) shall specify the m aximum num ber o f spectators to be adm itted to the stadium;
  (b) may specify the maximum num ber to be adm itted to different parts of it;
  (c) shall include term s and conditions-
  ... (iii) as to the number, strength and situation of any crush barriers.”
Section 2(2) was repealed by the Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987, section 19, which
gave power to the Secretary of State to lay down, by order, terms and conditions. No order has yet been
made and guidance from the Home Office has recommended local authorities to approach their
function under section 2(1) in accordance with the criteria in the repealed section 2(2). (See Home
Office Circular 71/1987 dated 25 November 1987, Annex A, paragraph 6.)

  145. It is clear that when the certificate was first issued the South Yorkshire County Council went
further than simply to fix the m aximum numbers for the whole Stadium. They prescribed figures for
each part of the ground not merely by the four points of the compass but by specified sections.

   146. Section 8(1) of the 1975 Act requires the holder o f the certificate before carrying out any
proposals to alter or extend the stadium or any o f its installations while a Safety Certificate is in
operation to give notice of those proposals to the local authority. That obligation is specifically
repeated in Sheffield Wednesday’s certificate at Schedule 2 Paragraph 5(2). The Club complied with
the requirement. Having received notice of the alterations to the pens and the barriers, the local
authority ought, in my view, to have amended the Safety Certificate accordingly. They did not do so.

W hy was the Safety Certificate not Amended?
   147. Although D r Eastwood acknowledged that the various changes to the layout would have had
an effect on capacity, he did not take active steps to see that appropriate amendments were made. He
says he m entioned from time to time that the alterations would have an effect on capacity and that he
did not realise the Safety Certificate was not regularly updated. However, I find two mem oranda in
early 1987 highly significant. D r Eastwood’s assistant M r Strange was concerned with queries from
the FA as to Hillsborough’s capacity for a semi-final. M r Strange recorded these questions in a
memorandum:-

  “Has any account been taken for alterations done on Leppings Lane over the last few seasons? Is the 10,200
  or so figure still correct? I said that in my opinion it needs to be adjusted, better do it now than later.”

  148. M r Strange’s next memo (a few days later) records as follows:-

  “D r Eastwood says leave the capacity at Leppings Lane end as it is, providing police have gates under West
  stand open so that people can distribute throughout the terrace evenly.”

Although he says the last nine words do not report him accurately, D r Eastwood accepts the rest of that
message.

   149. In my view the provisions as to capacity in the Safety Certificate ought to have been reviewed and
altered. The unhappy situation is that the police believed even the overall figure of 10,100 to be too high as far
back as 1981. That was reported to the Club but apparently not to D r Eastwood. Meanwhile, that global figure
had been rendered academic by the sub-division of the terrace which was not reflected in the Safety Certificate
at all. If proper m aximum figures had been inserted in the certificate for each of the pens, the Club and the
police might well have been prom pted to find some means of limiting the numbers entering those pens other
than by visual monitoring. This could have been done by implementing one of D r Eastwood’s plans for totally
separate sections, turnstile to viewing area. It could have been done by insisting on sequential filling of pens at
all matches; alternatively, by counting fans into each viewing area.

The City Council
   150. That the Safety Certificate was not am ended and individual capacities not reviewed cannot be laid
solely at D r Eastwood’s door. He was, after all, consultant engineer to the Club and responsibility for the
certificate was that of the local authority. When the South Yorkshire County Council handed over to the
Sheffield City Council, the latter delegated all its powers and duties under the 1975 Act to its General Purposes
Panel. Apparently, therefore, the decision-making body on behalf of the Council was that Panel, although two
specific functions were delegated to the Head of Adm inistration and Legal D epartm ent - the power to issue a
prohibition under section 10 of the 1975 Act and the power of entry and search under section 11 of the Act.

  151. In practice, M r Bownes, the Council’s Chief Licensing Officer in the Administration and Legal
Departm ent, bore the brunt o f the Council’s duties under the Act.



                                                        25
   152. The Officer Working Party was superseded by a Safety o f Sports Grounds Advisory Group, but
apart from the change o f the name the system continued as before. M r Bownes attended the inspections
and meetings of the Advisory Group together with the representatives of the police, the fire service, the
departm ent of health and consumer services, and the building engineer’s division of the Council. The
latter was an engineer and ought therefore to have been alive to the same issues as D r Eastwood.

  153. The Advisory Group seems to have worked in a very informal manner. A short passage from M r
Bownes’ evidence gives the flavour of it:-

    “Q     Who was taking the lead in the working party as you understood it?

     A     That is a good question, sir. Leads were coming from several different directions really.

     Q     Who chaired it, if anyone?

     A     Nobody as such, sir. It was an inspection rather than a meeting as I understand it.

     Q     Who decided what should be inspected?

     A     Effectively the group itself, sir, it seemed to me. There was also some input from the Club
            representative as to, if you like, an element of direction as to what should be looked at.

     Q     Apart from the inspections the working party met, presumably, or did they only meet on
           inspections?

     A     No, sir, I have referred to three previous meetings.

     Q     Who took the chair when it met?

     A     I suppose it could be said that I did, to some extent.

     Q     There is no point in having inspections unless you form conclusions as a result of that inspection, is
           there?

     A     That is correct.

     Q     There must presumably have been some meeting following the inspection at which you all sat down
           together and decided what, if anything, should be done.

     A     There was not, to my recollection, no.

     Q     How did you decide what should be done, if anything needed to be done?

     A     There were discussions on the site, particularly in relation to barrier 144, which took place at the
            time.

     Q     Nothing more than that and no record anywhere o f any decisions that were made?

     A     No, sir.”

The decision to remove barrier 144 was assented to on behalf o f the City Council by M r Bownes. It was not
referred to the General Purposes Panel. W hether M r Bownes strictly had any power to assent to it is to say the
least very doubtful. But he himself admits that he was ill-equipped to do so. He knew very little about football
grounds. He had read the file passed on from South Yorkshire County Council and assumed all had been run
satisfactorily by them.

  154. It was recorded, however, in a report which M r Bownes drafted that “the conditions (in the Safety
Certificate) give some cause for concern as they appear to be inadequate or inappropriate in some areas”. The
report to the General Purposes Panel suggested that new Safety Certificate conditions should be drafted.

   155. The task of revising the Safety Certificate was begun in June 1986.InJuly 1987, a draft was sent to the
fire service to which they replied in August. In September 1987, the Panel was informed that the redrafting was
“progressing steadily” and should be subm itted to the Panel in October. The final draft was not circulated until
30 March 1989, 16 days before this disaster.

   156. Meanwhile, the Safety Certificate has remained unam ended since 1979. The enlargement of the Kop
in 1986 increased its capacity to 21,000. Although this was known and agreed by the Council it had not been
the subject of any change in the certificate which still showed the capacity o f the Kop as 16,850. M r Mackrell,
Sheffield Wednesday’s Secretary, raised the question o f am endments to the Safety Certificate and in particular
with regard to the Kop in April 1987 with Eastwood and Partners but nothing resulted.

  157. Sheffield United Football Club was designated under the 1975 Act on 3 July 1984. A Safety Certificate
was about to be issued by South Yorkshire County Council at the time it handed over to the Sheffield City
Council on 1 April 1986. No certificate has yet been issued to Sheffield United.

   158. The explanation given for these delays was pressure o f work. M r Bownes as C hief Licensing Officer
was responsible for 32 other licensing systems when this one was added to his burden. He had a staff o f only
five. I fully accept that the addition o f further statutory responsibilities to the already heavy workload o f a local
authority with curbs on its expenditure creates problems. But it is clear that the attention given to this
im portant licensing function was woefully inadequate.

Summary
   159. The Safety Certificate contained no maximum figures for individual pens. There was therefore no
sanction or provision focussing attention as to the need to limit entry to the pens by numbers. The layout at
Leppings Lane as it evolved m ade electronic or mechanical control over numbers entering individual pens
impracticable if all pens were to be available. Given an im portant match and a capacity attendance, fans were
likely to crowd into popular sections like pens 3 and 4. Those pens were likely to become overfull well before
warning came from the turnstiles that numbers were approaching the terrace maximum o f 10,100. Control
over numbers and the avoidance o f overcrowding therefore depended entirely on visual monitoring o f the
crowd.




                                                         27

                       LA C K O F E F F E C T IV E M O N IT O R IN G O F T H E TER R AC ES

  160. M onitoring the spectators on the terraces so as to avoid overcrowding involves observing the numbers
and their distribution in each area, making decisions as to when an area is “full”, taking steps to close it off
and moving spectators from one area to another, if necessary. It is a function beset by three problems. 1) Who
should carry it out? 2) When is an area “full”? 3) Fear o f hooliganism.

Who should M onitor the Terraces?
   161. Should it be the host club via its stewards? Should it be the police? Should it be both? Or should it be by
arrangement, depending upon the ground or section o f the ground in question?

   162. In principle, a football club which invites the public to a match on its premises for reward is
responsible for securing safety at that event. The Green Guide (1986) provides:

         23. The safety o f the public inside the ground is the responsibility o f those who stage the event and
             adm inister the ground in which it is held, ie the “management”. This responsibility applies in
             both normal and emergency situations...

        195. ...there are five basic duties which stewards are called upon to carry out. These are:

              (a)   controlling or directing members o f the public who are entering or leaving the ground, to
                    help achieve an even flow o f people to the viewing areas and safe dispersal o f spectators on
                    the terraces or viewing slopes;

              (b)   patrolling the ground to deal with any emergencies, eg raising alarms or extinguishing
                    fires;

              (c)   manning entrances, exits and other strategic points, especially exit doors and gates which
                    are continuously open whilst the ground is in use;

              (d)   assisting police as appropriate or as requested with crowd control; and

              (e)   undertaking specific duties in an emergency.”

The Interim Popplewell Report
   163. There was considerable controversy in the course o f the public inquiry held by M r Justice Popplewell
in 1985 as to the responsibility o f the club and the police. In paragraph 3.6 o f his interim report, M r Justice
Popplewell quoted from a report produced for the M inister o f Housing and Local Government in 1969 as
follows:-

  “The responsibility for controlling crowd behaviour is divided between the police and the club operating the
  ground. The broad line o f division being that police are responsible for movement o f spectators in public
  thoroughfares and from public thoroughfares into the ground, while the club is responsible for the control of
  spectators once they are on the club’s premises . . .”

M r Justice Popplewell said he did not quarrel with that view and went on to observe that in practice the police
have to take charge and be responsible for controlling crowd behaviour. He then said (paragraph 3.8):

  “It follows, therefore, that as a m atter o f practice, while the physical safety o f the building and the
  m aintenance and good housekeeping o f the ground must always be the responsibility of the club, the police
  have to take the de facto responsibility o f organising the crowd, with all that entails, during the game . . .”

M r Justice Popplewell went on to instance evacuation o f the ground as a procedure in which only the police
could bear the responsibility of supervising the organisation of the crowd.

The Final Popplewell Report
  164. He harked back to this subject in chapter 4 o f his Final Report. There, he came down more firmly in
favour o f holding the club responsible for crowd safety. At paragraph 4.13 he said “Because, as a m atter of
practice, police officers have regularly attended in large numbers at football grounds, it has somehow been
assumed by the clubs that the responsibility for control o f what goes on inside the ground has passed from
them to the police. A police presence is there to assist in the enforcement of law and order. Those responsible
for organising a private function, however, have the primary and continuing obligation and responsibility to
ensure reasonable safety for those who are invited on to their premises.” M r Justice Popplewell ended that
section as follows: “It cannot be too strongly emphasised that it is upon the club, or the occupier o f the ground
who is putting on the function, that the primary and continuing obligation rests.”

    165. There remains, however, the question whether there are some grounds or parts o f grounds where the
club may need to rely upon the police (whom they pay to attend) to control filling o f pens and monitoring them
for overcrowding. In other words, whilst the duty in law to ensure safety rests upon the club, they may need,
and by agreement be entitled, to employ the police to act as their agents in certain circumstances. This very
difficult and grey area as to club and police responsibility will need to be reviewed in greater depth at stage two
o f this Inquiry.

Arrangements at Hillsborough
  166. W hat is clear, however, is that de facto the police at Hillsborough had accepted responsibility for
control o f the pens at the Leppings Lane end. The evidence o f the senior officers who had been concerned with
policing at Hillsborough over the years was all one way on this point. Only M r Duckenfield, who had not
policed at Hillsborough for some 10 years prior to 15 April, took a different view.

   167. M r Lock is now security officer at Sheffield Wednesday and was formerly a police Superintendent at
Hillsborough matches occupying M r M urray’s role. He claimed there had been a formal although unwritten
agreement between the Club and the police in about 1982, whereby the police agreed to steward the Leppings
Lane end o f the ground. Such a formal agreement is denied by other senior officers and I do not accept that any
formal agreement was reached. Nevertheless, a practice or arrangement did develop which was known and
accepted by both Club and police. Its effect was that throughout the ground the stewards were responsible for
manning exits and entrances, for controlling entry into the stands, for assisting spectators to their seats in the
stands and for helping to control the exits after the match. They were also responsible at the Kop end on the
terraces for keeping gangways clear and helping to control the crowd which usually consisted o f home
supporters. At the Leppings Lane end, however, there were no gangways on the terraces and the crowd
consisted usually (and always since 1987) o f away supporters. M r Mole and other senior officers accepted that
it would have been unreal and unreasonable to expect stewards to go onto those Leppings Lane terraces. They
would not have been effective there; moreover, they could well have been in some danger from hostile away
supporters. The police accepted, therefore, that the proper filling o f the pens and monitoring them for
overcrowding could and would not be carried out by stewards. Many stewards have tended to be either
extremely young or somewhat elderly. They are paid only a modest sum (£9 at Hillsborough) and they are not
suitable either by physique or by training to cope on a crowded terrace with no gangways.

Case for the South Yorkshire Police
  168. Notwithstanding the overwhelming evidence from senior police as already mentioned and from the
Club, Counsel for the South Yorkshire Police continued throughout the hearing to contend that the Club and
not the police were responsible for filling and monitoring the pens and that this was well known to both parties.
He m aintained that the police were there essentially to secure and preserve law and order. Quite apart from the
police evidence to the contrary at this Inquiry, the official stance o f the South Yorkshire Police has not always
been to that effect.

H arris -v- Sheffield United Football Club Lim ited
   169. In March 1986, the South Yorkshire Police Authority obtained a judgem ent against Sheffield United
Football Club for money due for police services provided at Sheffield U nited’s matches. The defence had been,
inter aha, that the police were not providing “special police services”. They were doing no more than
performing their normal police duties o f securing and preserving law and order amongst a crowd. The police
argument was that they had additional duties. In his judgement, Boreham J summarised the instructions for
policing as providing for:-

 “(a) the m aintenance o f enforcement o f law and order;

  (b) the enforcement o f the Club’s ground regulations, many o f which are concerned with law and order;

  (c) the safety and comfort of the spectators, officials and players.”
He referred to the argument o f Counsel for the South Yorkshire Police as follows:-

  “Thirdly, here the police were not discharging their own duty to the public; they were in fact discharging the
  Club’s duties to the spectators whom the Club invited to the ground. The Club chose to invite large numbers
  to their private premises; it was the Club’s duty to provide for their safety, health and comfort. They could
  have employed a security firm as banks and others have to do to protect their interests; they chose to request
  the police to perform those duties knowing that the police expected payment. Fourthly, the police within the
  ground provided services which it was not within the scope o f their public duty to perform. For instance,
  they assisted in crowd management and in the enforcement o f such ground regulations as refused entry to
  those who tried to enter without paying or prohibited spectators encroaching on parts o f the ground which
  their entry fee did not entitle them to enter. It may be, submits Mr Bentley, that the maintenance o f law and
  order was the predom inant aim but there were other services performed.”

The learned Judge found:-

  “In addition to what may be called their law and order role the police were expected and did take part in
  crowd management, ensuring the safety o f spectators, the enforcement o f the Club’s regulations and to be on
  hand to assist in the event o f some emergencies such as fire or accidental injury.”

Police Practice at the Leppings Lane End
   170. At League matches at Hillsborough, the police practice was to decide in advance how many and which
pens would be used. If a modest crowd was anticipated only one or two pens might be needed. It was better to
confine the fans to limited spaces (a) to prevent them running about and (b) to reduce the num ber o f police
required. The practice was then to fill the pens one by one. This involved making a judgem ent as to when a pen
was full. There would then be a police decision to close that pen and fill another. It was regarded as impractical
and unsafe for police officers (just like stewards) to go onto the Leppings Lane terraces with away supporters.
This meant that monitoring the numbers in any pen had to be done from vantage points outside it. Here, the
police were much better placed than the stewards. There was a good view from the control box and the
television screens there. There were officers on the perim eter track. No stewards were placed there becausc
having both police and stewards interfered with the viewing. There were also police in the west stand who
could look down on the pens. Intelligence from all these sources could give the police a good appreciation of
the state o f the terraces. When it was necessary to shut off access to the pens officers on the concourse could be
informed by radio and could take the necessary steps.

“Find Their Own Level”
   171. At Cup semi-finals, a different approach was adopted. All the pens were opened from the start and the
policy was “to let the fans find their own level”. This phrase was repeated again and again by police officers at
the Inquiry. W hat it meant was that no specific direction was given to fans entering through the turnstiles.
They were free to go wherever they wished on the terraces. If they became uncomfortable or wished for any
other reason to move their position, then theoretically they could move elsewhere. In this way it was hoped that
the fans on the terraces would level themselves out and that distribution would be achieved without police
intervention. On these occasions, the gates at the top o f the radial fences were locked in the open position. It
was sought to argue, therefore, that there was freedom o f movement from one pen to another enabling fans to
“find their level”.

   172. This argument was bad both in theory and in practice. In theory, the whole object o f the radial fences
had been to achieve even distribution by directing fans into desired positions. To say then that they could move
freely from one pen to another would defeat the object and enable fans to go from a less popular to a more
popular area without inhibition. In practice this did not happen because the position and size o f the gates was
such that once a substantial num ber o f spectators were in, the gates were unnoticeable and inaccessible
especially to those towards the front who might have most need o f them.

  173. The same argument was deployed to suggest that individual maximum capacities for individual pens
need not be assessed since the presence o f the open radial gates still meant that the terrace was one area. In
practice this simply was not so. The photograph at Appendix 5 taken from the north stand at 2.59 pm shows
very clearly the congestion in pens 3 and 4 contrasted with the sparseness in pen 6. This gives the lie to the
suggestion that the fans could, if uncomfortable, “find their own level”.

  174. The effect o f this policy was that whereas at League matches the police had to make a positive decision
when to close one pen and open another, at semi-finals, where overcrowding was much more likely, the police
left it to the fans themselves to “find their own level”. Effectively, they were left to monitor their own comfort
and safety so as to avoid overcrowding. The police would only intervene when there was some overt sign that an
area was “full”.

When is an Area “F u ll”?
   175. Over the years, spectators on terraces have come to accept conditions which are often very
uncomfortable and not infrequently downright dangerous. They are subjected to buffeting and squeezing to
get in and out o f the terraces. They are packed tightly and exposed to surging and swaying during the match.
They put up with these conditions because they are devoted to the game and because there is little they can do
about them. They believe the discomfort will pass and nothing very untoward will happen. Usually that is the
case and they are reassured by it. M ost clubs have not, until very recently, consulted their supporters as to their
grievances or suggestions. The practice has been to pack them in on the assumption that if they are prepared to
put up with it the conditions must be tolerable. Although crowd figures at football grounds have been reduced
in recent years, this has been due principally to the increased proportion o f seating as against standing
accommodation. Terraces have still been packed.

   176. It is said that many fans enjoy these features o f terrace viewing. Clearly close proximity, shared
discomfort, weathering sways and surges together and chanting the same songs and slogans en masse do evoke
good hum our and have produced a spirit or cult o f the terraces which many enjoy. Equally there are many who
simply endure these things for the football, for a cheap ticket or indeed for the chance of getting in at all. And
before Hillsborough most fans on the terraces, even if they enjoy the hurly-burly, had not realised the narrow
margin of safety between an uncomfortable crush and a fatal one.

   177. The Green Guide sought to improve safety and comfort by laying down criteria for maximum
capacity, ie defining what is “full”. The standard set was 54 persons per 10 square metres in favourable
conditions but fewer, down to 27, in less favourable conditions. The tendency may have been to aim off too
little from the higher figure for shortcomings in the layout. Certainly the figures considered appropriate in
pens 3 and 4 at Hillsborough were too high, as already indicated.

   178. Even taking the highest figure suggested in the Green Guide, the problem remained that those
supposed to be monitoring pens visually had and have little idea o f what 54 persons per 10 square metres look
like. M r Duckenfield’s opinion was that when a pen was full to capacity, the spectators would be “shoulder to
shoulder and chest to back”. That view may derive from seeing the sort o f density crowds regularly endure
without injury resulting. But it is much more dense than the Green Guide maximum.

   179. The South Yorkshire Fire Brigade provided the Inquiry with photographs of people standing in an area
o f 10 square metres at various densities of packing. Together with my Assessors and others, I took part in a
similar experiment at the Health and Safety Executive’s Sheffield laboratory. We stood in a room o f measured
area at densities o f 54, 80 and 100 per 10 square metres. It was clear from the photographs and from our
experiment that the m aximum density set out in the Green Guide left considerably more room than those
monitoring the terraces would have left before declaring an area “full”.

   180. The tendency has been to allow the pens to fill until the fans complain or show signs of discomfort. If
the density at the front appeared less than at the back, the Tannoy would invite the fans to move forward to
make room for more. The evidence before the Inquiry and many anecdotal letters I have received clearly show
there have been frequent occasions when the packing on terraces, not only at Hillsborough, has caused
discomfort and sometimes, for brief periods, fear. Usually the surge recedes, the sway returns, the pressure
eases and the incident passes unrecorded.

  181. After the crushing at the 1981 semi-final, Hillsborough was not chosen again by the FA until 1987.
There was evidence that the central pens were uncomfortably overcrowded on that occasion and again at the
1988 Cup semi-final, although entry to the tunnel was blocked off by police shortly before kick-off in 1988
because the pens were deemed to be “full”.

Fear of Hooliganism
   182. Over the last few years, hooliganism at and associated with football matches has strongly influenced
the strategy o f the police. In their plans and management they have concentrated on averting or containing
threats to public order. This is understandable and indeed commendable. But it has led to an imbalance
between the need to quell a minority o f troublemakers and the need to secure the safety and comfort o f the
majority. In the police Operational Order, the emphasis was upon prevention o f disorder and in particular
prevention o f access to the field of play. There was no express requirement that officers on the perimeter track
or in the west stand should keep watch for any possible overcrowding on the terraces. Indeed, the view was
expressed in evidence that packing fans close together on the terraces assisted in controlling the unruly since
the less room they had the less scope there was for misbehaviour.

Summary
   183. Although the police had accepted de facto responsibility for monitoring the pens, their policy on the
day was to leave fans to “find their own level” and to concentrate their own attention on possible disorder.
Whilst in theory the police would intervene if a pen became “full”, in practice they perm itted the test of
fullness to be what the fans would tolerate.

  184. By 2.52 pm when gate C was opened, pens 3 and 4 were over-full even by this test. Many were
uncomfortable. To allow any more into those pens was likely to cause injuries; to allow in a large stream was
courting disaster.




                                                      32

   185. The decision to open gate C, and subsequently gates A and B too, was forced on to the police by the
crowd conditions which developed outside the turnstiles. The crush was so severe that injuries were being
suffered and deaths were feared unless the pressure could be swiftly relieved. Why the crowd pressure had built
to such intensity was one o f the principal issues during the hearing. The suggested causes must be considered in
turn.

The Physical Layout
   186. I have already described and illustrated the approach to the turnstiles (Appendices 1 and 2). At
Penistone Road and at many other grounds, turnstiles are in a straight line, adequately spaced and with a
sufficient waiting area for queues to form. Not so at Leppings Lane. The building line, the bridge over the Don
and the bend in the road, left a wedge-shaped approach to perim eter gates set in an arc, and across a short
forecourt, to turnstiles also set in an arc. The pairs o f turnstiles were close together and the forecourt, especially
as divided by the metal fence, provided little space for a waiting crowd.

The Number of Turnstiles
   187. The decision to fill the whole o f the north stand from the Leppings Lane end required the 23 turnstiles
there to adm it 24,256 spectators. O f those, the seven turnstiles (A to G) serving the terraces had to adm it
10,100, ie an average o f just under 1,450 through each turnstile. At the Penistone Road end, 29,800 were
served by 60 turnstiles, or just under 500 per turnstile.

   188. The Green Guide recognises (paragraph 47) that the rate at which spectators can pass through
turnstiles depends on a variety o f local circumstances but states “in general based on observation and
experience, it is unlikely that the m aximum notional rate per turnstile would exceed 750 per hour”. Since the
semi-final was an all ticket match requiring no cash transactions, the Club considered that a higher rate o f
about 1,000 per hour per turnstile could be expected. Even at this higher rate, which assumes the turnstiles
working at m axim um efficiency non-stop, it would have taken nearly 1h hours to adm it all those with terrace
tickets. At 750 per hour, it would have taken nearly two hours.

  189. The Green Guide provides (paragraph 44):-

  “Turnstiles should be o f such numbers as to adm it spectators at a rate whereby no unduly large crowds are
  kept waiting for adm ission. . . ”.

   190. The Officer Working Party had discussed in 1985 the need, and D r Eastwood’s various schemes, for
improvement o f the turnstile arrangements. The mathematics are elementary. Both the police and the Club
should have realised that the Leppings Lane turnstiles and the waiting area outside them would be under strain
to adm it all the Liverpool supporters in time. Success depended on the spectators arriving at a steady rate from
an early hour and upon the m aximum turnstile rate being maintained. In fact neither of these requirements,
which are inter-linked, was fulfilled. That they might not be so was in my view foreseeable.

The “Late” arrival of Liverpool Fans
   191. Between 2.30 pm and 2.40 pm the crowd waiting for the turnstiles swelled to over 5,000 and became
unmanageable. The case made for the police was that large numbers o f Liverpool supporters arrived late; a
high proportion o f them were drunk and unco-operative; a high proportion had no tickets; all o f them were
hell-bent on getting in on time. They say this was unforeseeable and explains why they lost control.

   192. W hether those who arrived between 2.30 pm and 2.40 pm were “late” was much debated. The ticket
simply requested its holder “to take up [his] position 15 minutes before kick-off” . That may have been
intended to persuade those with stand tickets to take their seats, but it would not be unreasonable for a
standing spectator to arrive at the turnstiles between 2.30 pm and 2.40 pm. W hether they were “late” or not,
however, there was certainly a large concentration o f Liverpool fans arriving at about 2.30 pm and after.

Traffic Delays
  193. It is unlikely that traffic conditions had any significant effect on this. True, there were delays on the
Liverpool traffic routes. There were roadworks on the M62 which was the recommended route. At various
points the carriageway was reduced from four lanes or three lanes to two, but no serious delays were reported.
On the M63 there were longer delays due to a contraflow and at its junction with the A560 there was heavy
congestion due to volume o f traffic. However, the Liverpool routes were clear by 2.20 pm and those witnesses
who complained o f delays en route had nevertheless managed to be in range o f the ground in ample time.

Fine Weather and Drinking
   194. The likeliest explanations for the sparse Liverpool attendance in the ground before 2.30 pm were four­
fold - the warm weather, drinking, disinclination to enter the ground early and prolong the standing, and a
tendency o f Liverpool supporters to cut it fine.

   195. The police emphasised that at the 1988 semi-final there was no comparable build-up o f “late” arrivals.
They claim, therefore, that they had no reason to foresee it in 1989. However, in 1988, although the weather
was fine, it was 11 °F cooler than in 1989. 15 April was the sort o f fine spring day which tem pted fans to sit or
stand about in the sun with a drink. If you had a ticket it would seem more pleasant and sensible to relax in that
way than to enter the ground early and stand on the terrace for an extra hour. Pre-match entertainm ent in the
ground had been advertised but did not take place. Even if it had, it may not have been an encouragement to
many fans to enter so early.

Was Drunkenness a M ajo r Factor in the Crisis at the Turnstiles?
    196. O f those who arrived at 2.30 pm or after, very many had been drinking at public houses or had
brought drink from home or an off-licence. I am satisfied on the evidence, however, that the great majority
were not drunk nor even the worse for drink. The police witnesses varied on this. Some described a high
proportion as drunk, as “lager-louts” or even as “anim als”. Others described a generally normal crowd with an
unco-operative minority who had drunk too much. In my view some officers, seeking to rationalise their loss
o f control, overestimated the drunken element in the crowd. There certainly was such an element. There were
youngsters influenced by drink and bravado pushing impatiently at the rear o f the crowd thereby exacerbating
the crush. But the more convincing police witnesses, including especially Detective Superintendent McKay
and C hief Inspector Creaser as well as a num ber o f responsible civilian witnesses, were in my view right in
describing this element as a minority. Those witnesses attributed the crush to the sheer numbers o f fans all
anxious to gain entry. There was no criticism o f the crowd by any of the witnesses in the period up to 2.30 pm
or even 2.35 pm. W hat happened then was not a sudden deterioration in the mood or sobriety o f those
assembled there. No doubt those coming behind would have had more to drink and would have included the
unruly minority. But the crisis developed because this very large crowd became packed into a confined
turnstile area and its very density hampered its passage through the turnstiles.

    197. Superintendent Marshall and other officers criticised the crowd as unco-operative because police
exhortations to stop pushing and to ease back were not heeded. How could they be? In that crush most people
had no control over their movements at all. Two incidents involving police horses illustrate the point. One
horse was found afterwards to have cigarette burns on its rump. Clearly that was the despicable work o f a
hooligan whether in drink or not. However, there were also eyewitness accounts o f a horse being physically
lifted off its feet by the crowd. That occurred, as the police accepted, without malice or intent but as an
involuntary consequence o f crowd pressure which those by the horse’s flanks could not resist any more than the
horse itself.

Reduced Efficiency of the Turnstiles
   198. The labelling o f the turnstiles in the order A, C, B was confusing. A fan with a B ticket who went by
mistake to the wrong side o f the metal fence would have had the greatest difficulty in getting back and round to
the correct side. The colour coding was inefficient because the coloured wooden panels were affixed to the
turnstile walls so low that they were not easily visible through a crowd. The information on the ticket printed by
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club was misleading and its layout unhelpful, as MrMackrell frankly conceded.

   199. The result was that in the early stages, police officers were pestered by fans for help as to where they
should go. Later, as the crowd became more dense, fans were presenting their tickets at the wrong turnstiles.
There were also Liverpool supporters who had acquired tickets for the Kop end but sought entry at Leppings
Lane. They caused delays in the turnstile operation when entry was refused and after a while the police
instructed the operators to let them through. There was further delay because the crush made it difficult for
fans to get into the turnstile entrances. Once there, the pressure from behind was such as, on occasions, to jam
them in the doorway or against the paddle o f the turnstile. Finally, there were fans without tickets who sought
to enter by offering payment, by seeking to go over or under the paddle or by sliding through with a ticket
holder. All o f these activities slowed down the turnstile rate which at the worst period was only about 600 per
hour per turnstile. The waiting crowd therefore expanded and as the minutes passed frustration grew. Visitors
who had paid for tickets and travelled from afar realised they were making little forward progress. Frustration
increased pressure and induced panic at the front. Determ ination to get into the match was intensified by
determ ination to get out o f the crush.

Were Fans W ithout Tickets a M ajo r Factor in the Build-Up?
  200. It has become a fact o f football life that fans do turn up at all-ticket matches without tickets. It is not
possible to give an accurate figure or even a reliable estimate o f the num ber without tickets on 15 April. Police
estimates varied from about 200 to about 2,000. There were certainly frequent requests for tickets or “spares”
during the hours before the build-up. Many o f those warned off by the police were seen to return to the area.
Some were hanging about on the bridge. Again, however, the police witnesses who most impressed me did not
consider the num ber o f ticketless fans to be inordinately large. This accords with two other sources of
evidence.

   201. First, there was a wide range o f witnesses who observed inside the ground that the Liverpool end was at
a late stage well below capacity save for pens 3 and 4. The north stand still had many empty seats and the wing
pens were sparse. The match being a sell-out, there were clearly many ticket holders to come and they could
account for the large crowd still outside the turnstiles. H ad the Liverpool accommodation been full by 2.40
pm, one could have inferred that most or much of the large crowd outside lacked tickets.

  202. Secondly, such figures as are available from the Club’s electronic monitoring system and from analyses
by the HSE suggest that no great num ber entered without tickets. They show that the num ber who passed
through turnstiles A to G plus those who entered through gate C roughly equalled the terrace capacity figure of
10,100 for which tickets had been sold. The Club’s record showed 7,038 passed through turnstiles A to G.
However, the counting mechanism on turnstile G was defective, so the HSE did a study using the video film
and projecting figures from the other turnstiles. This gave an assessment o f 7,494, with a maximum o f 7,644
passing through A to G. Again, using the video, the HSE assessed the num ber who entered the ground whilst
gate C was open at 2,240 with a maximum of 2,480. Accordingly, the HSE’s best estimate o f the total entering
through gate C and turnstiles A to G was 9,734 with a maximum o f 10,124.1 recognise that these can only be
rough checks because, for example, some with terrace tickets were allowed through turnstiles 1 to 16 and there
would be other similar factors which have not formed part o f the assessment. Nevertheless, the figures do
suggest that there was not a very significant body o f ticketless fans in the crowd which built up.

The “Conspiracy” Theory
  203. On behalf o f South Yorkshire police, the theory was advanced that the “late” arrival o f so many
Liverpool supporters was planned to buck the system. The suggestion was that fans without tickets conspired
to arrive late and create such trouble as would force the police to adm it them to the match. The slender
evidence upon which this theory rested came from two sources: overheard conversations in public houses and
the antecedent history o f Liverpool supporters at away matches.

   204. One witness said he heard three Liverpool supporters saying, in effect, that they would manage to get
in without tickets by causing trouble so that police would open a gate, and that they had done this before.
Another witness heard two o f a group o f Liverpool supporters say they had no tickets, that they would go to the
ground ju st before kick-off, that no-one would stop them getting in and that they had not been stopped yet.
Statements were put in relating to two other small groups talking in similar terms.

Liverpool Supporters at Away Matches
  205. The South Yorkshire police prepared a dossier of reports on the behaviour of Liverpool fans at away
matches with the object o f showing a pattern o f troublesome behaviour by large numbers either without tickets
or with forged tickets. Without setting out the whole history, it can be summarised as follows.

  206. On three occasions Liverpool fans without tickets were allowed into all-ticket matches upon payment.
(At Watford on 13 February 1988, 1,500 were admitted; at Southampton on 24 September 1988, 150 were
admitted; at Southam pton again on 12 December 1988, 750 were admitted.) At Norwich on 1 April 1989,
Liverpool supporters arrived without tickets but 1,272 tickets had been returned and fans from both Liverpool
and Norwich were allowed to buy them for cash. A similar situation occurred at Wimbledon on 13 May 1989.
There were six other occasions from 1986 to date, including the Cup finals o f 1986 and 1989, when numbers o f
Liverpool supporters turned up without tickets or otherwise behaved badly.

  207. Four points must be noted, however. On none of the occasions when ticketless fans were adm itted for
payment was the match a sell-out. There was therefore room in the ground on each occasion. At a sell-out fans
might not expect to be allowed in, even for payment. Secondly, no trouble o f the kind alleged was encountered
at the 1988 semi-final when Liverpool visited Hillsborough. Thirdly, Liverpool visited Hillsborough again in
January 1989 without any trouble. Finally, no forged tickets were in use on 15 April apart from three crude
photocopies.

No Conspiracy
   208. I have already found that there was not an abnormally large num ber o f fans without tickets on this
occasion. With one or two exceptions, the police witnesses themselves did not subscribe to the “conspiracy”
theory. I am satisfied that the large concentration at Leppings Lane from 2.30 pm to 2.50 pm did not arrive
as a result o f any concerted plan. There were, I accept, small groups without tickets who were willing to exploit
any adventitious chance o f getting into the ground. They, together with the minority who had drunk too much,
certainly aggravated the problem faced by the police. But that main problem was simply one o f large numbers
packed into the small area outside the turnstiles.

The Police Operation at Leppings Lane
  209. The Operational Order for 15 April followed closely that laid down for the 1988 semi-final. The
emphasis was on maintaining law and order. Side roads were to be blocked off to prevent damage in residential
areas. Pairs o f officers were to patrol streets to prevent “clash o f rival supporters”. Officers were to watch public
houses, shops and supermarkets “where looting could take place”. Outside the turnstiles, officers were to ensure
supporters entering did not have banners, weapons, missiles or alcohol.

  210. Unfortunately, hooligan behaviour has made all these steps necessary. But the only written provision
aim ed at effecting controlled entry to the turnstiles was one enjoining officers “to ensure orderly queues are
formed”. There was no provision for controlling the entry o f the crowd into the turnstile area.

   211. As long ago as 1924, the Departm ental Committee on Crowds stated:-

  “The control o f crowds should begin at a point some considerable distance from the entrance to the ground.
  The advantages o f an arrangement o f this kind a r e ... in preventing congestion at the entrances to grounds.”

This was particularly im portant at Leppings Lane where the turnstile area was so small and awkwardly laid
out. If a large crowd was perm itted uncontrolled entry through the perim eter gates, the forming o f queues at the
turnstiles and control by officers, whether on foot or mounted, would become impracticable. Those waiting at
the turnstiles would become a single growing mass. Once that happened, it would be difficult to retrieve the
situation.

  212. W hether steps were taken and what steps to avoid this happening was left to oral briefing and ad hoc
instructions on the day.

Previous Experience
  213. The senior police officers said it had never happened before so there was no reason to foresee it. In fact,
the only two previous occasions when the Leppings Lane terraces had been used to fill the whole of the north
and west sides o f the ground were at the two semi-finals, in 1987 and 1988. In 1987, the match was on a Sunday,
scheduled for 12 noon, and kick-off was postponed for a quarter o f an hour because o f late arrivals.

Policing in 1988
   214. As to 1988, there was a very large and consistent body o f evidence that, on the day, the police in
Leppings Lane conducted an efficient filtering exercise designed to keep away those without tickets and
control the flow o f fans towards the ground. I do not believe that so many witnesses without either opportunity
or reason to put their heads together could be mistaken about what they experienced on that occasion. Yet, the
police m aintain that no filtering exercise other than on a random basis was conducted in 1988 and that their
policy and practice then were no different from those o f 1989.

  215. The answer to this conflict must, I think, be that whilst the policy may have been no different, in
practice the policing in 198 8 was more efficient and was not put to the same test and strain as a year later. There
was not so large a swell in numbers approaching the ground from 2.30 pm to 2.50 pm as in 1989.
Nevertheless, there had been warning signs in 1988. Detective Superintendent McKay gave the following
evidence:
  “Q Were you aware of a build-up o f numbers last year towards the latter stages at the turnstiles?

  A   Yes. . . There was a huge build-up around 10 minutes to 3 when many, many Liverpool supporters
       came at that time. They had been drinking, the ones that I saw and there was quite a sizeable crush
      built-up - sizeable queue.

  Q   Queue or crush?

  A    Compacted queue, built-up in the area by the turnstiles which I believe are marked A to G. That crowd
       reached back almost to the gates. It never got any bigger than that and the turnstiles operated relatively
       freely and they dealt with that crowd. Fans were still arriving at about 10 past 3 but by then t h e . . .

  Q   This crowd that you have described of the late arrivals at about 10 to - was it an orderly crowd?

  A   Oh no. No. The orderly crowd had gone in, and when I say they were not an orderly crowd, obviously
      mixed amongst those people w ere. . .

  Q   O f course, but taking it generally?

  A   But by and large they had taken a lot of drink on board and they were in such numbers that excluding
      them from the ground was completely out o f the question.

  Q    Were they standing in an orderly queue or was there some pushing and shoving?

  A   There was a lot o f pushing and shoving. There was an urgency to get into the ground.

  Q   But fortunately it does not appear to have been in nearly such numbers as this year.

  A   It wasn’t.”

Police Intelligence in Advance
  216. Apart from that experience in 1988, the tendency o f Liverpool supporters to arrive late was not
unknown. Witnesses said that they get through the turnstiles at their home ground, Anfield, quite quickly and
tend therefore not to arrive early. Indeed, a general recent tendency to postpone arrival was noted by the
Sheffield City Council Advisory Group, with police present, on 23 March 1988. The m inute reads:-

  “As far as the turnstile question was concerned, a pattern has developed o f people arriving some 15 minutes
  before the start o f the game hoping to gain admission. This trend may be due to the banning of alcohol at
  sports grounds which could lead to people going elsewhere for refreshment prior to the football match. As
  the available turnstiles operated quite effectively for the majority of the time, and that the late arrival
  problem could perhaps only be dealt with by education of the spectators” (sic).

  217. In so far as Liverpool supporters’ behaviour at away matches may have been indicative o f what police
problems might arise on 15 April, most of the facts should have been available at the planning stage. As in other
forces, South Yorkshire Police had a liaison officer whose job was to seek, receive and collate relevant
inform ation as to the visiting supporters. The Association o f Chief Police Officers’ Guide to Policing Football
highlights the importance o f such liaison:-

  “It is im portant that the officer responsible for policing the match determines the pre-match planning in the
  light o f the intelligence at hand. Whilst that intelligence can be obtained from a variety o f sources, the prim e
  source for football intelligence is the Police National Intelligence System which is based on the network of
  police liaison officers. Summaries completed by police officers o f the home club force are forwarded to the
  visiting club’s liaison officer making available intelligence about fans’ behaviour at both home and away
  fixtures. This inform ation will be collated and made available for future matches involving that club”.

  218. The FA had also laid down in a mem orandum issued in the 19 8 5/6 season measures to be adopted by
the away club which included the following: -

  “ It is the responsibility of the away club to advise the home club o f the recent behaviour o f their supporters
  at away matches, irrespective of whether the behaviour has resulted in disciplinary action by the Football
  Association or not” .

  219. It does not seem that inform ation of this kind was passed to the Sheffield Wednesday Club or played
any part in the South Yorkshire Police plans. H ad the latter been informed o f the history contained in the
dossier and sum m arised above it may well have influenced police strategy in Leppings Lane.

  220. There is presently a proposal that a national computer-based police football intelligence system should
be set up to make the necessary inform ation readily available.

Police Intelligence on the Day
  221. The unfilled space in the Liverpool areas inside the ground, the figures for entry available from the
Club’s com puter and observations on the video screen should have enabled those in the control room to
m onitor the numbers arriving and still to arrive at Leppings Lane. Radio contact with mobile (Tango) patrols
detailed to m onitor licensed premises in the district could have indicated the numbers still to come. But at 2.30
pm when M r M urray told M r Duckenfield they would “get them all in by 3 o’clock” he seems not to have
appreciated that in addition to those visible at the turnstiles there were many more still to come. Certainly, M r
Marshall outside the turnstiles was not told and could not otherwise have known that there were still many
Liverpool ticket holders to arrive.

M r M arshall and M r Greenwood
  222. The division of com m and between these two officers did not help. M r Marshall was in charge of the
serials outside the perim eter gates in the Leppings Lane area and in the roads beyond. In practice he operated
inside and ju st outside the turnstile area. M r Greenwood’s area as G round Com m ander extended from the
pitch to the perim eter gates. He in fact stationed him self near the players’ tunnel. He was wholly unaware o f the
growing problems at the turnstiles and was in no position to exercise control over his officers who were under
pressure there. No-one in the control room thought to tell him.

Control Lost
  223. In the result, the large concentration o f arrivals from 2.30 pm to 2.40 pm pressed unrestrained into
the turnstile area through the perim eter gates which were fully open. When that area was full, later arrivals
swelled the crowd out to the forecourt and even into the road. As already recounted, the foot officers at the
turnstiles became trapped and endangered and retired through the turnstiles. The mounted officers could not
operate am idst such a dense crowd in a confined space. They came out of the turnstile area. There were then
the belated attem pts to close the perim eter gates and prevent more fans joining the mass until it had a chance to
dim inish through the turnstiles; still later the attem pt to put a cordon o f horses across the entrance.

  224. Despite knowledge of the difficult layout, the very large num ber o f fans to be got through so few
turnstiles and the tendency o f fans to arrive in the last half hour, no contingency plans were made to avoid a
crush such as occurred. Even on the day, the need to close Leppings Lane to traffic before 2.30 pm and the
other available intelligence already summarised, should have prom pted those in com m and to take precautions
against such a crush. If some of the perim eter gates had been closed and cordons o f m ounted and foot officers
had been placed a little distance from those gates, the flow o f fans into the turnstile area could have been
controlled before that area became engulfed. It was the crush itself which produced the frustration and the
panic and brought out the worst in those who had drunk too much. Earlier control o f entry would have
prevented the crush and maintained the good mood which had prevailed until 2.30 pm.

  225. It should moreover have been obvious by 2.40 pm, if not earlier, that a large part o f the crowd could
not be adm itted until well after 3 pm. Had a decision to postpone kick-off been made and announced much of
the frustration and with it the impetus crushing the crowd would have been reduced. A com bination of
controlled filtering and a postponed kick-off would probably have obviated the need to open the gates.

Postponement of Kick-off
    226. At various stages in his evidence, M r Duckenfield gave three accounts of why he thought it too late to
postpone kick-off. Once it was that one o f the teams had already come onto the pitch. Then it was that a group
o f photographers at the tunnel had wrongly led him to think that the teams were coming out. Finally, he did not
know why he thought the teams were coming out. They did not in fact come onto the pitch until 2.54 pm, two
minutes after gate C was opened. Police Constable Buxton had asked for a postponem ent o f kick-off before
gate C was opened. It should not, however, have needed a police Constable in the thick o f the crowd (and there
were others o f like m ind) to think o f postponing the kick-off. The need should have been clear in the control
room.

  227. The truth was that M r Duckenfield applied inflexibly the policy he had discussed with M r Murray.
Kick-off would not be postponed unless there were some m ajor cause for delayed arrivals eg a jam on the
motorway or fog. I accept that the thinking behind this policy was not callous or punitive. If kick-off is
postponed whenever a proportion o f fans choose to leave the public houses late, the practice may grow and
kick-off times would become meaningless. But, a com m ander must deal with the problem o f the day. Faced
with a situation which was becoming dangerous, crowd safety should have been his param ount consideration.
Kick-off should have been delayed.

Summary
   228.    The layout o f the turnstiles and the num ber they were required to serve left no margin of safety against
an uneven flow o f fans. Because police strategy in advance and on the day did not cater for it, the arrival o f a
large num ber of supporters between 2.30 pm and 2.40 pm created an unmanageable crush. The presence of
a substantial minority of fans who had drunk too much aggravated that problem. Having lost control and
rejected the option o f postponing kick-off, the police were faced with a serious danger of deaths or injuries.
They were left therefore with no alternative but to open the gates. Superintendent Marshall was right at that
stage to ask for it and M r Duckenfield was right to agree. But the possible effects o f so dramatic a step required
other action.




                                                        39

                               TH E BLUNDER ON O PE N IN G TH E GATES

  229. The decision to order the opening of the gates was not accompanied or followed by any other order to
deal with the consequences. When gate C was opened, a steady stream o f about 2,000 fans poured through it
over some five minutes. Clearly they were going to go into the ground somewhere and unless they were diverted
their likeliest route was through the tunnel for reasons already given. No warning was issued from the control
room that the gate was to be opened. Serials on the concourse were not alerted. Neither the Club control room
nor the Chief Steward at the Leppings Lane end was warned. Not even M r Greenwood, the Ground
Commander, was informed. From 2.47 pm when M r Marshall made his first request until 2.52 pm when Mr
Duckenfield acceded to it, there were five m inutes in which orders could have been given as to how the influx
was to be absorbed. It was not done. In evidence, M r Duckenfield began by saying that no officer made any
wrong decision but he later conceded he had erred in this regard. He said he did not consider where the people
would go when the gate opened. Even after it opened, when he could see the influx on the television screen, no
order was given to steer the fans to the wing pens. M r Duckenfield said it did not cross his m ind to detail
officers on the concourse to shut off the tunnel. Those officers could not have known from their position how
full pens 3 and 4 were. That was a m atter for the control room to monitor from its own observations and using
intelligence from around the ground.

  230. Since pens 3 and 4 were full by 2.50 pm, the tunnel should have been closed off whether gate C was to
be opened or not. The exercise was a simple one and had been carried out in 1988. All that was necessary was
for a few officers to act as a cordon at the entrance to the tunnel and divert fans elsewhere. Unfortunately, the
1988 closure seems to have been unknown to the senior officers on duty at the time. It did not figure in the
debriefing notes. It therefore had no influence on the planning for 19 89.

  231. Planning apart, however, it should have been clear in the control room where there was a view of the
pens and of the crowd at the turnstiles that the tunnel had to be closed. If orders had been given to that effect
when gate C was opened, the fans could have been directed to the empty areas o f the wings and this disaster
could still have been avoided. Failure to give that order was a blunder o f the first magnitude.

  232. Significantly, when permission was given to open gate A, M r Duckenfield did order serials to go to that
part of the concourse to m onitor the influx towards the north stand. He did this because he feared that if fans
went to the north stand without tickets, they would not get seats and, there being no perim eter fences at the
north side, they might invade the pitch. This illustrates again the preoccupation with avoiding pitch invasion
as against safety and the risks o f overcrowding. Because those entering through gate C could not get onto the
pitch, it was not thought necessary to alert officers to m onitor them. The possibility of overcrowding simply
was not considered.

Barrier 144
   233. The removal of barrier 144 in 1986 should have reduced the notional capacity of pen 3 as already
mentioned. But it did more. In the absence o f barrier 144, the influx o f fans after 2.52 pm met no retarding
structure as it came into pen 3. The pressure created was free to push fans straight down by the radial fence to
the lowest line o f barriers. The pressure diagonally from the tunnel mouth down to barrier num ber 124a which
collapsed was unbroken by any intervening barrier. 124a was also vulnerable to pressure straight down the pen
through the gap in the barrier above it created in 1985.

  234. Inspector Bullas, positioned in the west stand, described what he saw looking down on the pens
around 3 pm.

  “...I saw from the direction of the tunnel a kind of movement down the terracing... the type o f thing that you
  see on the nature programmes, the molten lead flowing down the side o f the mountainside, the molten lav a...
  a “river o f people” ... going directly towards the pitch but there again spreading... out.”

   235. D r Eastwood conceded in evidence that the removal o f barrier 144 was likely to have contributed to
the collapse o f 124a. Later, he sought to resile from that answer, but I think his earlier admission was correct. It
was argued that if barrier 144 had remained, the influx from gate C would have built up further back and the
tragedy might have occurred in the tunnel or might have broken barrier 144 itself. This is speculative and I
think unlikely. W hat remained o f barrier 144 in pen 4 did not cause a build-up; nor did it collapse. But its
remaining in position may well have accounted for no barrier further down pen 4 collapsing and for the lesser
carnage in that pen.

W hen did B arrier 124a Fail?
  236. Counsel for the South Yorkshire Police sought to argue that this barrier collapsed or may have
collapsed at about 2.47 pm. His purpose was to suggest that the opening o f gate C was not causally linked with
the crushing and fatalities resulting from that collapse. I have already found that whilst the evidence does not
perm it the time of collapse to be fixed with certainty, it was after 2.52 pm. I now give my reasons:

  (a) I have several times watched the BBC video tape on which Counsel relied. I do not find the incident he
      identifies at 2.47 pm suggestive o f a collapse at that time;

  (b) the evidence of fans who were near or at the barrier was overwhelmingly to the effect that the collapse
      occurred at or after 3 pm;

  (c) the biggest group o f witnesses was that which related the collapse to the surge following Beardsley’s
      “near-miss” at the Kop end at 3.04 pm;

  (d) the appearance on video and photographs o f fans in the area o f barrier 124a after the incident at 2.47 pm
      and before the final crush is not consistent with it having collapsed so early;

  (e) it is highly unlikely that if so catastrophic an event had occurred as early as 2.47 pm, the police on the
      track and elsewhere would have taken until nearly 3 o ’clock to realise something was seriously wrong.
      Indeed, if Counsel for the South Yorkshire Police were correct in his timing of the collapse, the failure of
      the police to respond for so long would expose them to even graver criticism than that made in this
      Report.

D r Eastwood’s Testing of the Barriers
  237. Two sections o f barrier 124a in pen 3 collapsed as a result o f the overcrowding. That collapse caused a
num ber o f deaths. D r Eastwood and his staff had undertaken the periodical testing o f crush barriers required
by the Green Guide and by the Safety Certificate. Barrier 124a had been tested in July 1988 and passed.

 238. The test had been carried out in accordance with D r Eastwood’s interpretation o f Annex C to the
Green Guide. That requires an evenly distributed force of 6.0kN/metre width to be applied for 3 five minute



                                                         41
periods, the interval between applications to be as short as possible. A record has to be kept of the am ount of
deformation during each loading and of the percentage o f recovery. If the recovery is less than 50% after the
third application of force, the barrier has failed the test. If recovery is between 50% and 7 5%, there must be a
re-test. The question is: 50% or 75% o f what? Is the recovery to be in relation to the position o f the barrier
before the first application o f force or before the third? If the former, a span o f 124a recorded 53% at the 1988
test and should have been re-tested. If the latter, it recorded 100% and passed. Unfortunately the Green Guide
is unclear as to the correct interpretation. D r Eastwood took the latter view and so passed the barrier. He
justified his interpretation in evidence. He said failure to recover to the original position could be due to a
“shake-down” effect related to some giving in the ashes under the concrete or to some other extraneous factor
rather than to any defect in the material o f the barrier itself.

  239. I think, after consulting Professor Maunder, that safety ought to have dictated recovery should be by
reference to the position o f the barrier before the first application of force. I accept, however, that the Green
Guide is ambiguous and D r Eastwood’s interpretation is tenable. It has some support from the British
Standards tests on steel structures. Clearly, however, for the future, the Green Guide should be clarified on this
point.

Corrosion
  240. Inspection o f barrier 124a, and indeed other barriers at Hillsborough, by the HSE showed
considerable corrosion of the metal at vulnerable points where water could accumulate. D r Eastwood agreed
that if a significant degree o f corrosion was observed on visual inspection, a barrier should be condemned.

  241. The Green Guide does not specifically refer to corrosion. Paragraph 39 provides, inter alia:

  “Crush barriers and balustrades should be examined for deformation or any other overt signs of weakness”.

Paragraph 6 of Annex C provides:

  “If during any test, even though the b a rrie r... satisfies the above loading requirements, doubt should arise
  for any reason (including such matters as cracking o f the terracing or distortion o f connections) as to the
  safety of the b a rrie r... a detailed investigation should be carried out. Unless the results o f this investigation
  remove the doubt as to safety o f the b a rrie r... (it) should be deemed to have failed the test” .

  242. Since corrosion is a likely cause o f deterioration, a revision of the Green Guide should make specific
reference to it.

Causation
  243. Tests done by the HSE suggest that although barrier 124a passed the loading test in 1988 and probably
would have been able to sustain a force which did not exceed the test load, it was unable to resist the load
imposed upon it by reason of the numbers in pen 3, the excessive gap in the barrier higher up the pen and the
absence o f barrier 144. Corrosion probably played a part, but the effective cause o f the collapse was the
excessive and unanticipated pressure to which the barrier was exposed.

Observation from Control Room
   244. As the stream from gate C flowed through the tunnel, the officers in the control room could be expected
to keep a close watch on pens 3 and 4. They had a direct view o f them from an elevated position through their
window. Although they had no field-glasses, there was the zoom facility on the TV camera. The radio was by
then working again and although reception was difficult due to crowd noise and possibly excessive air traffic
on channel 25, attem pts could have been made to alert officers on the perim eter track to watch for
overcrowding and report their observations. In the event, pens 3 and 4 became more and more crowded, surges
took place, fans were showing and signalling distress. None o f this was seen or recognised in the control room.

Officers on the Track
  245. The 20 officers detailed to the perim eter track were distributed round the pitch so that some five
officers were at the west end. Their written instructions made no reference to the avoidance or detection of
overcrowding. The same applied to the officers in the west stand. M r Greenwood adm itted that his oral
briefings also contained no mention of monitoring the pens for overcrowding.

   246. The Operational Order for 1988 had instructed officers to forbid anyone “access to the track from the
terraces without the consent of a senior officer (except to receive medical attention)”. At the end o f the 1988
semi-final, there was a m inor pitch invasion. Accordingly, that prohibition was emphasised in the 1989
Operational Order by being put into capital letters. The combination of no instructions as to overcrowding and
a strong prohibition on opening the gates was likely to make police recognition of crushing slow and their
response reluctant. Small wonder that the growing pressure and congestion between 2.50 pm and 2.59 pm
went unheeded or certainly unremedied. Even when officers recognised there was a problem, the rule required
consent of a senior officer before a gate could be opened.

  247. “Senior officer” meant an officer of Inspector rank or higher. The Inspector in charge o f the 20 officers
on the track was M r Darling. He stationed himself by the players’ tunnel, the most central position for
supervising his men. In evidence he said:

  “I would only take action if I thought crowding had got to such a stage that the fans were in danger. I’d then
  inform ground control and I would expect someone deployed to the back o f the stand.”

  That underlines the inhibition against opening perim eter gates. So did the evidence of one Constable who
said it had been so drum m ed into officers not to open the gates that when he saw distress in pen 4, he “debated”
with himself before opening the gate, thinking: “If I’m wrong, I’m going to get a right bollocking for this.”
Naturally, one would hope that common sense and hum anity would make some officers cut through the rules
and open a gate if fans were clearly in distress.

  248. This is what happened, but not until officers recognised the distress and even then not immediately.
Hence, gates 3 and 4, having been opened, were shut again before they were finally opened and at first those
seeking to climb out over the fence were pushed back. This reaction of the police did not go on for as long as
some witnesses believed. They probably misinterpreted the hand movements from M r Greenwood and others
aim ed at persuading fans to move back and relieve the pressure as attem pts to stop those climbing out at the
front.

  249. Nevertheless, there was a period during which the failure to recognise the problem and the inhibition
against tackling it caused vital tim e to be lost.

The Officers in Command
   250. Even when realisation of the problem came to officers on the track, it was some minutes before it
reached the control room. When spectators first appeared on the track, the im mediate assumption in the
control room was that a pitch invasion was threatened. This was unlikely at the beginning of a match. It
became still less likely when those on the track made no move towards the pitch. M r Motson, the BBC
commentator, recognised and said, well before the match was stopped, that the trouble seemed to be
overcrowding and not misbehaviour. Still, the assumption to the contrary persisted in the control room. Until
M r Murray radioed for a fleet o f ambulances, about 3.06 pm, M r Duckenfield continued to treat the incident
as a threat to the pitch and to public order. The message calling up all available officers mentioned a pitch
invasion. Operation Support was initiated and dog handlers were requested.
   251. Until Chief Superintendent Nesbit arrived, there was no effective leadership either from control or on
the pitch to harness and organise rescue efforts. No orders were given for officers to enter the tunnel and relieve
pressure. Some officers did this on their own initiative. Apart from the Tannoy request to clear the pitch, no
attem pt was m ade to clear and mark off a casualty area where first-aid could be given without hindrance by
fans and photographers milling about between the bodies. There was no co-ordination o f the early provision of
first-aid or of stretcher parties or of the rescue effort through gates 3 and 4. No request for help was broadcast to
doctors and nurses in the crowd until about 3.29 pm when it was too late. Probably, there was little that could
have been achieved in most cases however soon doctors had been summoned, but there were marginal cases
where earlier attention might have made a difference.
  252. The plight o f those behind the fencing and the existence o f injuries were known to officers at the scene
from 3 pm. But the M ajor Disaster Plan was not started until 3.06 pm at earliest when the ambulance service
was called. No request for cutting gear or for the fire brigade was made until 3.13 p.m. Again, it is unlikely that
these services could have saved lives if they had been called promptly, but it is possible.
Police on the Pitch
   253. Despite the initial lack o f leadership, many officers did all they humanly could to rescue and revive the
victims. Many supporters who gave evidence paid tribute to these efforts. It is also fair to say that the num ber
of officers who could at first be usefully involved at the two open gates was necessarily limited.
   254. Chief Superintendent Nesbit’s action in deploying a line of officers across the middle of the pitch has
already been mentioned. I can well understand the resentment it caused. However, the police assertion that a
rush by some fans towards the Kop end raised fears of conflict are well borne out by the video tape. In my
judgement, Chief Superintendent Nesbit was well justified in using some of the many officers called up
pursuant to Operation Support to prevent possible violence. To have had open fighting in a ground where
some 90 spectators already lay dead would have been an unthinkable and obscene development.
Fans on the Pitch
   255. Many fans who escaped onto the pitch alive were in a state of collapse or close to it. Most o f those who
retained their strength strove magnificently to assist the victims. They helped pull them clear; they helped with
first-aid; they helped carry the improvised stretchers.
  256. There were fans, however, who were distraught, angry, drunk, or all three. Their conduct in abusing,
assaulting and spitting at the police was disgraceful, the more so since earlier police failures had little to do
with those officers now doing their best for the injured. In addition, there were abuse and assaults on
am bulance men and firemen in the course of their rescue work. This was probably because their similar
uniforms caused them to be mistaken for police. However, although the abuse was widespread, the num ber of
assaults and spittings was on the evidence comparatively small. In deploring them, one must recognise the
uniquely horrifying experience which those responsible had just suffered and were still suffering.
False Reports
   257. Before this Inquiry began, there were stories reported in the press, and said to have emanated from
police officers present at the match, of “mass drunkenness” . It was said that drunken fans urinated on the
police while they were pulling the dead and injured out, that others had even urinated on the bodies o f the dead
and stolen their belongings. Not a single witness was called before the Inquiry to support any o f those
allegations although every opportunity was afforded for any of the represented parties to have any witness
called whom they wished. As soon as the allegations I have mentioned were made in the press, M r Peter
Wright, Chief Constable o f South Yorkshire, made a dignified statement dissociating himself from such grave
and emotive calumnies. Those who made them, and those who disseminated them, would have done better to
hold their peace.

  258. The perim eter gates in the pens were not designed as exits. They were intended to afford access by the
police to cope with any local disorder or with an emergency. The kind o f emergency contemplated was not
massive crushing but, for example, the collapse or illness o f an individual. Emergency evacuation of the pens
had been considered by the Officer Working Party. Although fire risk was minimal since the terraces, west
stand and tunnel were o f concrete construction, the fire brigade were the principal arbiters of evacuation
procedure. They aim ed to be able to empty the pens in six minutes. The plan was to evacuate spectators via the
tunnel. If for any reason that option became impracticable, eg due to a bomb threat, then the alternative route
would be along the back of the terraces, through the gates in the radial fences and round the sides of the west
stand. The fire brigade were satisfied that each o f these routes would enable the pens to be evacuated in less
than six minutes, without relying on the gates to the pitch. Those gates would also be available, but their use
was excluded from the calculation o f evacuation time.

  259. The need to provide for speedy and large scale evacuation from the front o f the pens to the pitch was
not anticipated. The Green Guide (1986) provides as follows:

  “209. Access to the pitch must be m ade as difficult as possible in normal circumstances while at the same
  time ensuring that the police have effective access to the terraces for the purpose o f crowd control and
  enabling the pitch to be used (where appropriate) in the event o f serious emergency . . .

  214. . . . at some m ajor soccer stadia, where restriction on crowd movement forms a necessary part of the
  safety measures, it may be necessary to have a fence which prevents access to the pitch in normal
  circumstances . . . but allows for access in emergency.

  215. For most m ajor stadia, whether used for association football or other sports, the pitch perim eter fence
  will be required either to prevent access to the pitch as mentioned above, or at least to discourage attempts
  by spectators to enter the playing area. Gates or other access points (m inim um width 1.1 metres) should
  nonetheless be provided for use in an emergency . . . Provision o f such gates or access points is particularly
  im portant to allow full access to the playing area (or track) where it is likely to be used as a place o f safety in
  an emergency.        Such gates or access points should be properly stewarded and                            clearly
  marked so that im mediate access to the playing area or perim eter track can be ensured” .

  260. Gate 3 was .82 metres in width; gate 4 was .79 metres in width. There were therefore clear departures
from the Green Guide standard.

  261. The Safety Certificate provided (by Schedule 2 Paragraph 24) as follows:

  The (club) shall arrange for the Stadium to be inspected by a suitably qualified Chartered Engineer . . . at
  least once each period o f 12 m onths . . . and . . . shall as soon as possible after each inspection supply to
  the . . . Council a Certificate by the said Chartered Engineer as to the current compliance or non-compliance
  with . . . the appropriate provisions and recommendations o f the (Green) Guide o f all structural parts o f the
  Stadium . . .

  262. It was argued that there was no breach o f the Safety Certificate since the Green Guide specifically
provides for flexibility. However, in my view the Safety Certificate cannot and certainly should not be
interpreted so liberally as in effect to leave such basic requirements as the size o f exit gates to the total
discretion o f the club and its advisers. One o f the matters for consideration at stage two of this inquiry will be
whether, and in what respects, the Green Guide needs to be clarified and toughened.

   263. D r Eastwood explained the small width o f the gates by reference to the dilemma facing the police. They
wanted a gate sufficient for its intended purpose ie police access and small scale emergencies. On the other
hand, they did not want a flood gate of such size as to endanger the prim e principle o f preventing pitch
invasions. In the light of Hillsborough, this is perhaps the most poignant example of the difficulty of achieving
a balance between stopping hooliganism and ensuring crowd safety.

  264. Even if the width o f gates 3 and 4 had complied with the present Green Guide standard, they would
have been wholly inadequate to relieve pressure and release spectators swiftly on 15 April. Moreover, the
Green Guide says nothing about the num ber o f gates required for a pen o f given size. Whilst the Club,
D r Eastwood, the Officer Working Party and the local authority can be criticised for failing strictly to conform
to the Guide, the real failure was common to all those who have been responsible for considering safety on the
terraces. The anxiety to protect the sanctity of the pitch has caused insufficient attention to be paid to the risk
of a crush due to overcrowding. Certain it was, that once the crush occurred on 15 April gates 3 and 4 were
wholly inadequate for rescue purposes.

  265. The immediate cause of the gross overcrowding and hence the disaster was the failure, when gate C was
opened, to cut off access to the central pens which were already overfull.

  266. They were already overfull because no safe m aximum capacities had been laid down, no attem pt was
made to control entry to individual pens numerically and there was no effective visual monitoring of crowd
density.

   267. When the influx from gate C entered pen 3, the layout of the barriers there afforded less protection
than it should and a barrier collapsed. Again, the lack of vigilant monitoring caused a sluggish reaction and
response when the crush occurred. The small size and num ber of gates to the track retarded rescue efforts. So,
in the initial stages, did lack of leadership.

  268. The need to open gate C was due to dangerous congestion at the turnstiles. That occurred because, as
both Club and police should have realised, the turnstile area could not easily cope with the large numbers
dem anded of it unless they arrived steadily over a lengthy period. The Operational Order and police tactics on
the day failed to provide for controlling a concentrated arrival of large numbers should that occur in a short
period. That it might so occur was foreseeable and it did. The presence of an unruly minority who had drunk
too much aggravated the problem. So did the Club’s confused and inadequate signs and ticketing.

                                     THE FA’sCHOICE OF GROUND
   269. The FA were strongly criticised by the Football Supporters’ Association and others for having
imposed the Hillsborough venue on Liverpool for a second year running. The Liverpool supporters had to
travel much further to Sheffield than their Nottingham rivals. The police required that if the match was to be at
Hillsborough at all, Liverpool would have to have the west and north side accommodation. The disadvantages
of that and the disparate numbers of home supporters of the two clubs have already been set out. Liverpool had
had to knuckle under to the arrangement in 1988. They resented having it imposed in 1989. To hold the match
at Old Trafford would have been a perfectly good and acceptable alternative. Indeed, the FA nom inated Old
Trafford as the venue for the replay should there be a draw at Hillsborough.

   270. M r Kelly, the FA’s Chief Executive, sought to give reasons for preferring Hillsborough, but the only one
which seemed to have any validity was that the 1988 match had been considered a successfully managed event.
He adm itted that a telephone call from the Chief Executive of the Liverpool Club protesting and putting
Liverpool’s case had not been mentioned to the FA committee which finally decided the venue. M r Kelly
frankly conceded that “there was an element of unfairness” to Liverpool in choosing Hillsborough for a second
time. I think the decision was ill-considered. No doubt in future the FA will be more sensitive and responsive
to reasonable representations.

  271. However, it was not suggested that the choice of venue was causative of this disaster. The only basis on
which that could be said would be that, because of its layout, the Leppings Lane end was incapable of being
successfully policed for this semi-final. I do not believe that to be so.
                                               CHAPTER 18
                                                  P O L IC E

Choice of Ends by the Police
   272. There was much bitterness amongst Liverpool supporters that they had to make do again for the
second year with the Leppings Lane end. But, cogent as their complaints were, they am ounted to reasons for
choosing a different ground altogether. Given Hillsborough as the venue, I think the police were right to
allocate the sections of the ground as they did. The direction of arrival and the need for segregation made it
sensible and to reverse the 1988 arrangements would have made for confusion. As with choice of venue, I do
not consider choice of ends was causative of the disaster. Had it been reversed, the disaster could well have
occurred in a similar m anner but to Nottingham supporters.

Police Planning
  273. The Operational Order for 1989 left much unsaid. Apart from the lack of any provision for late or
congested arrivals, or any provision for the avoidance of overcrowding on the terraces, there was a num ber of
other omissions. For example, there was no specific deployment of officers to m an the perimeter gates. The
Order did not detail the duties of the m ounted officers deployed at the Leppings Lane entrance, who included
Liverpool officers to assist in marshalling their own fans. The duties of Superintendents (especially Mr
Greenwood and M r Marshall) were not defined so as to achieve clarity and efficiency. By an oversight, the
provision requiring mobile (Tango) patrols to assist the emergency services was om itted from the text.

  274. The 1988 Order was never substantially reviewed save to reduce the num ber of officers deployed in
shopping areas and to emphasise in capital letters the embargo on fans having access to the pitch. Satisfaction
with the 1988 event led to complacency. That some thought the pens overfull in 1988 and that the tunnel was
closed off on that occasion did not figure in or influence the plan for 1989.

  275. M r Duckenfield was prom oted and put in charge of F Division only 21 days before this semi-final. The
pre-planning was already in progress under M r Mole who had been in com m and both in 1987 and in 1988. It
might have been wiser to have left M r Mole in charge of this operation. On the other hand, it is quite
understandable that M r Duckenfield should have been expected to take com m and of events in his Division
from the date of his promotion. In view of his lack of experience at Hillsborough and of a semi-final match,
however, it was im perative that he be fully briefed and that he should also brief himself.

   276. He was not informed of the crushing incident in 1981 nor did he make inquiries which would have
revealed it. He did not know the arrangement as between Club and police for monitoring the Leppings Lane
terraces. He did not visit and tour the ground before approving the Operational Order. Although he attended a
match on 2 April, there was only a small crowd present and he left control of the game to the Superintendents.

Policing on the Day
  277. One of the regrettable features of the football scene as it has developed is the enormous expenditure of
money, time and effort in employing large numbers of police all over the country to guard against the sort of
disorder and misbehaviour which have become endemic. Police management of a game of football has become
a military operation. The problems faced and the responses received must be disheartening and may have
tended to harden police attitudes to supporters in general.

  278. It is fair to state that over many years the South Yorkshire Police have given excellent service to the
public. They have handled crowd problems sensitively and successfully at a large num ber of football games
including m ajor matches, during strikes in the coal industry and the steel industry, and in other contexts.
Unfortunately, their policing on 15 April broke down in the ways already described and, although there were
other causes, the main reason for the disaster was the failure of police control.

  279. In all some 65 police officers gave oral evidence at the Inquiry. Sadly I must report that for the most
part the quality of their evidence was in inverse proportion to their rank. There were many young Constables
who as witnesses were alert, intelligent and open. On the day, they and many others strove heroically in ghastly
circumstances aggravated by hostility to rescue and succour victims. They inspired confidence and hope.

  280. By contrast, with some notable exceptions, the senior officers in command were defensive and evasive
witnesses. Their feelings of grief and sorrow were obvious and genuine. No doubt those feelings were
intensified by the knowledge that such a disaster had occurred under their management. But, neither their
handling of problems on the day nor their account of it in evidence showed the qualities of leadership to be
expected of their rank.
   281. M r Duckenfield leant heavily on M r M urray’s experience. Between them they misjudged the build-up
at the turnstiles and did little about it until they received Mr Marshall’s request to open the gate. They did not,
for example, check the turnstile figures available from Club control or check with Tango units as to the
numbers still to come. They did not alert M r Greenwood to the situation at the fringe of his area of command.
They gave no instructions as to the management of the crowd at Leppings Lane. Inflexibly they declined to
postpone kick-off.

  282. When M r Marshall’s request came, M r Duckenfield’s capacity to take decisions and give orders
seemed to collapse. Having sanctioned, at last, the opening of the gates, he failed to give necessary
consequential orders or to exert any control when the disaster occurred. He misinterpreted the emergence of
fans from pens 3 and 4. When he was unsure of the problem, he sent others down to “assess the situation”
rather than descend to see for himself. He gave no inform ation to the crowd.

   283. Most surprisingly, he gave M r Kelly and others to think that there had been an inrush due to Liverpool
fans forcing open a gate. This was not only untruthful. It set off a widely reported allegation against the
supporters which caused grave offence and distress. It revived against football fans, and especially those from
Liverpool, accusations of hooliganism which caused reaction not only nationwide but from Europe too. I can
only assume that M r Duckenfield’s lack of candour on this occasion was out of character. He said his reason for
not telling the truth was that if the crowd became aware of it there might be a very hostile reaction and this
might impede rescue work. He did not wish to divulge what had happened until he had spoken to a senior
officer. However, reluctance to tell M r Kelly the truth did not require that he be told a falsehood. Moreover,
although Assistant Chief Constable Jackson was at hand, M r Duckenfield did not disclose the truth to him
until much later.

  284. The likeliest explanation of M r Duckenfield’s conduct is that he simply could not face the enormity of
the decision to open the gates and all that flowed therefrom. That would explain what he said to M r Kelly, what
he did not say to M r Jackson, his aversion to addressing the crowd and his failure to take effective control of the
disaster situation. He froze.

The Police Case at the Inquiry
  285. It is a m atter of regret that at the hearing, and in their submissions, the South Yorkshire Police were not
prepared to concede they were in any respect at fault in what occurred. M r Duckenfield, under pressure of
cross-examination, apologised for blaming the Liverpool fans for causing the deaths. But, that apart, the police
case was to blame the fans for being late and drunk, and to blame the Club for failing to m onitor the pens. It was
argued that the fatal crush was not caused by the influx through gate C but was due to barrier 124a being
defective. Such an unrealistic approach gives cause for anxiety as to whether lessons have been learnt. It would
have been more seemly and encouraging for the future if responsibility had been faced.

   286. The performance by the City Council of its duties in regard to the Safety Certificate was inefficient and
dilatory. The failure to revise or am end the certificate over the period of three years preceding this disaster,
despite im portant changes in the layout of the ground, was a serious breach of duty. There were, as a result, no
fixed capacities for the pens. The certificate took no account of the 1981 and 1985 alterations to the ground.

  287. A num ber of breaches of Green Guide standards were perm itted and persisted eg the spacing of the
crush barriers, the width of perim eter gates and the gradient in the tunnel (1 in 6 as against the Green Guide
maximum of 1 in 10).

  288. The Advisory Group lacked a proper structure; its procedure was casual and unbusinesslike. Its
accountability to the General Purposes Panel was ill-defined. Decisions were taken informally and too much
was left to M r Bownes. In particular, the decision to remove barrier 144 was not referred to the Panel and ought
not to have been made.

  289. It should be recorded that in general the Club has over the years adopted a responsible and
conscientious approach to its responsibilities. It retained the services of D r Eastwood as consultant engineer
and abided by his advice. For his part, D r Eastwood is skilled and experienced in this field, as already
indicated, and he sought I have no doubt to act efficiently and professionally in his advice and practical work.
The Club also retained Mr Lock who had acquired great experience and knowledge of Hillsborough during his
police service. A num ber of witnesses described Hillsborough as a very good ground, “one of the best in the
country . The police agreed that relations between them and the Club were good. Over the last four years, the
Club had spent some £ 1/2 million on ground improvements.

   290. Nevertheless, there are a num ber of respects in which failure by the Club contributed to this disaster.
They were responsible as occupiers and invitors for the layout and structure of the ground. The Leppings Lane
end was unsatisfactory and ill-suited to adm it the numbers invited, for reasons already spelt out. The Club was
aware of these problems and discussed solving them in various ways between 1981 and 1986. In the result,
there remained the same num ber of turnstiles, and the same problems outside and inside them. The plan for
this semi-final, involving as it did the loss of 12 turnstiles for the north stand and large numbers to be fed in
from Leppings Lane, was one agreed between the Club and the police. The Club knew best what rate of
admission the turnstiles could manage and ought to have alerted the police to the risks of the turnstiles being
swamped.

   291. The alterations inside the turnstiles and on the terraces clearly affected capacity, but no specific
allowance was m ade for them. In that respect, both D r Eastwood and the Club should have taken a more
positive approach. Either a scheme such as one of those D r Eastwood put forward should have been adopted
giving more turnstiles and total separation of areas or at the very least the capacity of the new pens and of the
terraces as a whole should have been treated more cautiously. The police view in 1981 that 10,100 was too high
a figure was known to the Club (although D r Eastwood says not to him). Yet, despite that and the sub-division
into pens, the figure remained.

   292. Although the police had assumed responsibility for monitoring the pens, the Club had a duty to its
visitors and the Club s officials ought to have alerted the police to the grossly uneven distribution of fans on the
terraces. The Club operated and read the closed circuit television and the com puter totaliser. Liaison between
Club and police on the day failed to alert the latter to the num ber of Liverpool supporters still to come The
onus here was on the Club as well as on the police.

  293. The removal of barrier 144 was the responsibility of the Club although it clearly acted on the advice of
D r bastwood and the Advisory Group which in this instance was misguided.

  294 Likewise, the breaches of the Green Guide were matters which the Club should have appreciated and
remedied.

   295.     Lastly, as already indicated, the poor signposting on the concourse tended to produce under-filling of
the wing pens and over-filling of pens 3 and 4. Poor signposting outside the turnstiles and the unhelpful format
of the tickets also led to confusion aggravating the build-up in the turnstile area.
                                                 CHAPTER 21
                                F IR S T A ID A N D E M E R G E N C Y S E R V IC E S

No Fault by the Emergency Services
   296. I say at the outset of this chapter that no valid criticism can be made of the response by the St John
Ambulance Brigade, by SYMAS or by the fire brigade on 15 April. Indeed, no represented party ventured any
criticism of them. The only attack on SYMAS came from two Liverpool doctors. One claimed that ambulances
did not arrive swiftly or with sufficient equipm ent and that there was a lack of triage. He was proved to be
wrong in all three respects. Unfortunately he had seen fit to go on television on 15 April when he said more
lives could have been saved if staff and equipm ent had arrived earlier. Apart from being proved wrong in fact
as to the times of arrival of ambulances, he conceded in evidence that it was not possible to say whether lives
could have been saved. His comments on television were irresponsible. The other doctor complained of the
absence of defibrillators. I am satisfied on overwhelming evidence that to attem pt to use a defibrillator on the
pitch with people milling about would have been highly dangerous owing to the risk of injury from the electric
charge.

  297. I find that all three of the emergency services nam ed above responded promptly when alerted, that
they brought appropriate equipm ent and that their personnel operated efficiently.

  298. It would be unreasonable to expect, at any sports stadium, medical facilities capable of dealing with a
m ajor disaster such as occurred. To have in advance at the ground, oxygen, resuscitators, stretchers, other
equipm ent and medical staff sufficient to deal with over 100 casualties is not practicable.

  299. W hat is required is a basic level of provision for first aid, for professional medical attention and for
ambulance attendance, together with a system of co-ordination with the emergency services which will bring
them to the scene swiftly in whatever numbers are required. What will am ount to an appropriate basic
provision for the future ^gthe equipm ent in a first aid room, requires expert evaluation and advice.

   300. On the day, there was no clear understanding between the Club and D r Purcell as to his role. He
believed he was primarily there to attend to the players. The Club regarded him also as the “physician available
to attend at the first aid room if required”, as laid down in the Safety Certificate.

  301. There was insufficiently close co-operation between the police and the emergency services. It is clear
that SYMAS and the fire brigade should have been called earlier than they were. However, in view of the nature
and extent o f the crushing, the time when police rescue began and the pathetically short period for which those
unable to breathe could survive, it is improbable that quicker recourse to the emergency services would have
saved more lives.

  302. Finally, there was evidence that an advertising board had to be knocked down at the north-east corner
of the ground to allow an ambulance onto the pitch and that at the top of the ramp leading to the pitch the
access for ambulances was inadequate. There was also evidence that the pre-match arrangement for
ambulances to use the two gates from Penistone Road at the north-east end of the ground as in and out routes
was frustrated by the presence of vehicles just inside the ground. In the event, none of these matters affected
operations. The hoarding was quickly knocked down. The difficult access to the ramp was negotiated and
ambulances used one entrance satisfactorily by backing out when loaded.
                                              CHAPTER 22
                                         COM M UNICATIONS

   303.      One problem which impeded police control and the gathering of intelligence was the interm ittent
failure of com m unication by radio. There was the period of two or three minutes when the control room was
  “ ° / I ° co" taf • E^ n when that was remedied, it was only by using a hand set in the control room. This
m eant that control could not override any other messages. No effective radio com m unication seems to have
reached control from the perim eter track at the relevant time. M r Greenwood’s request for the match to be
stopped and various messages from Constables reporting the distress in the pens did not register. Likewise
                         Lcppmf Lane t0 control was unreliable. Undoubtedly these breakdowns made it more
difficult for those in com m and to make proper assessments and exercise effective command.

                            PART IV - INTERIM RECOMMENDATIONS
                                         C H A P T E R 23 - IN T R O D U C T IO N

    Lim ited Objectives
      304. It is im portant to stress the limited objectives of the interim recommendations I can make in this
    Report. My purpose is to propose instant measures capable of being implemented forthwith and where
    possible before the commencement of the 1989/1990 season. They are designed to prevent overcrowding and
    crushing on terraces in the short term and to improve safety procedures. They do not and cannot meet all the
    problems or address all the issues of post-Hillsborough football. Wider issues such as membership schemes,
    identity cards, all-seater stadia, super-stadia and long term recommendations fall to be considered in my Final
    Report. So do a num ber of other specific matters such as a comprehensive review of the Green Guide, the
    problem of excessive pre-match drinking, fans without tickets and ticket touts. I m ention these matters lest it
    be thought I have decided no recommendations need be made concerning them. I have not. But before
    deciding what if any recommendations to make about these and other matters, more evidence and study is
    required.

      305. Accordingly, the m ain thrust of these interim recommendations, as a holding exercise, is to reduce
    numbers on the terraces, to increase vigilance and to achieve a proper balance in crowd control between


•
    prevention of disorder and maintenance of safety.


    Perimeter Fences
      306. It would be impractical and unwise to recommend works of construction or radical structural changes
    now, before completing the extensive study and consultation which will form stage two o f this Inquiry. Hasty
    interim recommendations of that kind might well prove to be ill-judged after further study and require to be
    changed in a m atter of months.

       307. In particular, I do not at this stage make any recommendation as to removing perimeter fences or
    replacing them with structures of different design. Understandably, there was a wave of popular feeling against
    such fences in the im m ediate afterm ath of Hillsborough. The horrifying spectacle of people being crushed
    against the fencing focussed blame for the disaster on the fences themselves. There were pleas to dismantle
    them and emotive references to the fans being treated like “caged animals” . Some clubs removed their fencing
    straightaway. It was therefore very tempting to consider at an early stage making a recommendation that the
    fences should be removed. I confess to being so tempted.

      308. Regrettably, only a m onth after Hillsborough, there were incidents which showed that violence and
    hooliganism are still liable to erupt at football grounds. On 13 May at Selhurst Park, Birmingham City
    supporters invaded the pitch and fought with supporters of the home club, Crystal Palace. Five police officers
    and 16 supporters were injured and required treatm ent at a local hospital. On the same day at a match between
    Bristol City and Sheffield United, spectators spilt onto the pitch and there was fighting on the terraces. At the
    Cup Final between Liverpool and Everton on 20 May, there was a pitch invasion, albeit a comparatively
    benign one.

      309. Even the Football Supporters’ Association (FSA) felt it necessary to say in their final submission,

           “With some reservations, the FSA accept that perim eter fences are necessary for crowd control.”

       310. Bearing in m ind those matters, and the need to consider further expert evidence, I have decided that it
    would be unwise and premature for me to make any recommendations now either to remove or to preserve or
    to alter the structure of perim eter fences. I shall make recommendations about them in my Final Report.

       311. For the present, I would emphasise that, although the fencing prevented escape, the real cause of the
    Hillsborough disaster was overcrowding and it is against that danger that my interim recommendations are
    primarily directed. Whilst declining to recommend the removal o f the fences, I do consider that the gates to the
    pitch should be kept open whilst the terraces are occupied. This will have, I hope, three beneficial effects.
    Obviously, an open gate is a more ready escape route than one which has to be locked. Secondly, the sight of
    open gates will be reassuring to spectators on the terraces. Thirdly, the existence of gaps in the fencing by
    reason of the open gates will concentrate the minds of police officers or stewards on the track to the need for
    careful monitoring of those on the terraces.


                                                           55
  312. It will of course be necessary to have a police presence sufficient to prevent pitch invasion for im proper
reasons through the open gates. However, I am encouraged to think that this is not an insuperable problem by
the fact that, for example at Anfield, Liverpool’s ground, there were no gates in the perimeter fencing before it
was taken down. There were instead gaps or “ access points” as they are called in the Green Guide (paragraph
215). Their existence did not, so far as I am aware, prevent the authorities from maintaining order. Also, the
gates were open throughout the replay of this ill-fated semi-final at Old Trafford on 7 May 1989.


Reduced Numbers
   313. In the assessment of figures for capacity, the criteria in Chapter 16 of the Green Guide were not at
Hillsborough, and may not elsewhere, have been applied with sufficient rigour. Therefore, in addition to
reminding and enjoining local authorities and clubs to make all necessary deductions when assessing the
figure for maximum capacity in accordance with the Green Guide, I recommend reducing that figure by a
further 15% as an interim measure.


Safety Certificate
  314. The Safety Certificate procedure should, if it is properly adm inistered and enforced, go far towards
achieving crowd safety. W hether it succeeds depends upon the vigilance and com m itment of the local
authority issuing the Certificate. I do not know whether the poor performance of the local authority at
Hillsborough was typical. Arguments have been put to me suggesting the need for some national oversight or
inspection of local authority certification procedures. This raises complex issues which I shall want to consider
further at stage two of the Inquiry. For the present, I make recommendations as to the content of Safety
Certificates and arrangements for issuing, monitoring, enforcing, reviewing, amending and renewing them.
                               CHAPTER 24-THE RECOMMENDATIONS
   315. The recommendations which follow are the m inim um necessary to ensure that existing football
grounds can for the present be safely used, based upon the evidence which I have heard at Sheffield and other
inform ation I have received. They complement the recommendations which M r Justice Popplewell set out
after his inquiry at Bradford.

   316. Those which are asterisked should be carried out before the 1989/90 season starts. The rest should be
started forthwith and completed as soon as possible.

Maximum Capacities for Terraces
★     1. Where a viewing terrace is divided into pens or areas which are self-contained, the Safety Certificate
    should specify the maximum number of spectators to be admitted to each such pen or area.

    A pen or area is to be deemed “ self-contained” notwithstanding that it has a gate or gates affording access to
    another pen or area and whether such gate or gates be open or shut.

★    2. Each figure for maximum capacity should be assessed in accordance with Chapter 16 of the Green
    Guide (“the Green Guide figure”) subject to the following qualifications:-

    (a) in arriving at “the Green Guide figure”, proper and realistic allowance must be made for all factors
        which should reduce the permissible density in accordance with the range of maximum figures specified
        in paragraphs 221 and 222 of the Green Guide;

    (b) after assessing “the Green Guide figure”, a deduction of 15% should be made to improve the safety
        margin.

★     3. Arrangements should be made:-

    (a) to lim it the number of spectators entering each self-contained pen or area to the maximum capacity
        figure assessed in accordance with Recommendation 2 above either electronically, mechanically, by a
        ticketing arrangement, by counting or otherwise, and

    (b) to close off further access to such pen or area when its maximum capacity is about to be reached.


Filling and Monitoring Terraces
★     4. There should be a written agreement between the club and the police setting out their respective
    responsibilities for crowd safety and control and in particular for the filling of each self-contained pen or
    other terraced area and the monitoring of spectators in each such pen or area to avoid overcrowding. Any
    variation of the agreement in respect of an individual match should be agreed in writing in advance.

★     5. A t each match, there should be on the perimeter track, for each self-contained pen or other terraced
    area, a steward (if the club is monitoring that area) or a police officer (if the police are monitoring it) whose
    sole duty is to check crowd conditions in that area for possible overcrowding or distress throughout the
    period the area is occupied by spectators. Whoever is so appointed should be in addition to any other steward
    or police presence. H e should have ready access to the police officer authorised under Recommendation 9
    below, and by radio to the control room.


Fences and Gates
       6.   A ll police officers and stewards with duties in relation to the terraced areas and especially those with
    duties under Recommendation 5 above, should be fully briefed and trained with regard to the recognition of
    crowd densities, to the recognition of signs of distress and to crowd dynamics. Training should include
    demonstrations at the ground and photographs, designed to enable stewards and officers to recognise
    different crowd densities.

★     7. A ll gates in radial or perimeter fences of pens or other self-contained areas should be painted in a
    different colour from the rest of the fence and marked “Emergency E x it” .



                                                        57
★    8. W here there are perimeter fences, all gates to the pitch should be kept fully open during the period
    when spectators are on the terrace.

★     9. There should be in respect of each gate in a perimeter fence (or group of gates if they are close together)
    a police officer authorised to decide whether or not to allow spectators through a gate to relieve overcrowding.
    The officer so authorised in respect of each gate should be identified for each match and known to be so by all
    stewards and police officers in that vicinity. H e should be able to make radio contact with the control room
    either himself or via an officer close at hand.

★     10. Suitable and sufficient cutting equipment should be provided by the club at each ground where there
    are perimeter fences to permit the immediate removal of enough fencing to release numbers of spectators if
    necessary. Agreement should be reached as to whether the equipment should be used by police, the fire
    brigade or stewards. Whoever is to use it should be trained to do so. W hether to use it should be a decision of a
    nominated senior police officer at the ground.


Crush Barriers
★     11. A ll crush barriers should be visually inspected immediately for signs of corrosion. Any barrier found
    to be affected by a significant degree of corrosion should be repaired or replaced.

★      12. The layout of barriers in each pen or terraced area should be reviewed immediately to ensure that it
    complies with the criteria contained in Chapter 9 of the Green Guide. I f it does not, the assessment of the
    maximum capacity figure for that pen or terraced area, in accordance with Recommendation 2 above, should
    reflect the fact.


Safety Certificates
      13. There should be an immediate review of each Safety Certificate by the responsible local authority,
    which should consult the club in respect of which the Certificate is issued, the police, the fire service, the
    ambulance service and the building authority. Such a review should include an inspection of the stadium. Its
    object should be to ensure that the operative conditions of the Certificate are complied with and to add or
    substitute any condition shown to be necessary as a matter of urgency following the findings and
    recommendations in this report.

      14. Any local authority within whose area there exists a sports stadium designated under the 1975 Act for
    which no Safety Certificate has yet been issued should proceed forthwith to remedy the situation.

      15. Every Safety Certificate should be reviewed by the local authority at least once annually and each
    Certificate should require to be renewed annually.


       16. Each local authority should review its arrangements for issuing, monitoring, enforcing, reviewing,
    amending and renewing Safety Certificates. Such review should require that there exists or is provided an
    accountable administrative structure whereby the functions of the local authority are regularly and
    effectively supervised by senior officers and elected members and decisions are properly taken in accordance
    with the local authority’s rules.

       17. To assist the local authority in exercising its functions, it should set up an Advisory Group consisting
    of appropriate members of its own staff, representatives of the police, of the fire and ambulance services, of
    the building authority, of the club and of a recognised supporters’ club. The Advisory Group’s terms of
    reference should encompass a ll matters concerned with crowd safety and should require regular visits to the
    ground and attendance at matches. The Advisory Group should have a chairman from the local authority,
    and an effective procedure. Its resolutions should be recorded and it should be required to produce regular
    written reports for consideration by the local authority.


Duties of each Football Club
★      18. Each turnstile should be inspected and its potential rate of flow measured. Thereafter, regular
    inspections should be made to ensure that each turnstile remains capable of admitting spectators at the rate
    anticipated.



                                                         58
★     19. The correlation between each viewing area in the stadium and the turnstiles serving it should be such
    as to ensure that all the spectators intended to be admitted to that viewing area can pass through the
    turnstiles within one hour. I f that cannot be done, the capacity of that viewing area should be reduced
    accordingly.

★     20. Turnstiles should be closed when the permitted capacity of the area served by them is about to be
    reached and arrangements should be made to ensure quick and effective communication with turnstile
    operators for this purpose.

      21.    Closed circuit television should be so installed as to enable crowd densities outside the ground, within
    concourse areas and in pens and other standing areas, to be monitored before and throughout a match.

★     22. A ll signposting for spectators both outside and inside the ground should be comprehensively
    reviewed. It should, in relation to the arrangements for each match, be unambiguous, eye-catching, simple
    and clear and should be designed to ensure the rapid movement of spectators to their appropriate viewing
    area.

★     23. Information on tickets should be unambiguous, simple and clear and should correlate absolutely with
    the information provided in respect of each match both outside and inside the ground. Retained ticket stubs
    should contain information necessary to guide spectators once inside the ground.

★    24. Information on tickets requesting spectators to be in position by a particular time should be reviewed
    by clubs in conjunction with the police to ensure that it corresponds with the planned arrangements for
    admitting spectators to the ground.

      25.    Each club should consult with a recognised supporters’ club as to the provision of pre-match
    entertainment aimed at attracting spectators to the ground in good time.


Police Planning
★    26. The C hief Constable of each police force in whose area there is one designated stadium or more
    should nominate a chief officer to liaise with the management of each football club and local authority
    concerned in respect of the safety and control of crowds.

★     27. The Operational Order for each match at a designated stadium and the pre-match briefing of all
    officers on duty there should alert such officers to the importance of preventing any overcrowding and, if any
    is detected, of taking appropriate steps to remedy it.

★    28. The Operational Order for each match at a designated stadium should enable the police to cope with
    any foreseeable pattern in the arrival of spectators at a match and in their departure. It should provide for
    sufficient reserves to enable rapid deployment of officers to be made at any point inside or outside the ground.

★     29. The option to postpone kick-off should be in the discretion of the officer in command at the ground.
    Crowd safety should be the paramount consideration in deciding whether to exercise it.

       30. There should be available in the police control room the results of all closed circuit television
    monitoring outside and inside the ground and the record of any electronic or mechanical counting of numbers
    at turnstiles or of numbers admitted to any area of the ground. Officers in the control room should be skilled
    in the interpretation and use of these data.


Communications
      31. There should be sufficient operators in the police control room to enable all radio transmissions to be
    received, evaluated and answered. The radio system should be such as to give operators in the control room
    priority over, and the capacity to override, others using the same channel. Additional channels should be
    used, where necessary, to prevent overcrowding of the airwaves. Consideration should be given to
    sound-proofing the control room against excessive crowd noise.




                                                        59
      32. To complement radio communications, there should be a completely separate system of land lines
    with telephone links between the control room and key points at the ground.

      33. W ithin the control room, there should be a public address system to communicate with individual
    areas outside and inside the ground, with groups of areas or with the whole ground. Important
    announcements should be preceded by a loud signal to catch the attention of the crowd despite a high level of
    noise in the ground. This arrangement should be prominently advertised on every programme sold for every
    match.

      34. Use should be made where possible of illuminated advertising boards to address the crowd.
    Consideration should also be given to the use by police officers of a simple code of hand signals to indicate to
    the control room the existence of certain emergencies or requirements.


Co-ordination of Emergency Services
★      35. The police, fire and ambulance services should maintain through senior nominated officers regular
    liaison concerning crowd safety at each stadium.

★     36. Before each match at a designated stadium, the police should ensure that the fire service and
    ambulance service are given full details about the event, including its venue, its timing, the number of
    spectators expected, their likely routes of entry and exit, and any anticipated or potential difficulties
    concerning the control or movement of the crowd. Such details should be readily available in the control
    rooms of each of the emergency services.

★     37. Contingency plans for the arrival at each designated stadium of emergency vehicles from all three
    services should be reviewed. They should include routes of access, rendezvous points, and accessibility
    within the ground itself.

★     38. Police officers posted at the entrances to the ground should be briefed as to the contingency plans for
    the arrival of emergency services and should be informed when such services are called as to where and why
    they are required.


First Aid, Medical Facilities and Ambulances
★     39. There should be at each stadium at each match at least one trained first aider per 1,000 spectators. The
    club should have the responsibility for securing such attendance.

      40. There should be at each stadium one or more first aid rooms. The number of such rooms and the
    equipment to be maintained within them should be specified by the local authority after taking professional
    medical advice and should be made a requirement of any Safety Certificate.

★     41. The club should employ a medical practitioner to be present at each match and available to deal with
    any medical exigency at the ground. H e should be trained and competent in advanced first aid. H e should be
    present at the ground at least an hour before kick-off and should remain until half an hour after the end of the
    match. H is whereabouts should be known to those in the police control room and he should be immediately
    contactable.

★      42. A t least one fully equipped ambulance from the appropriate ambulance authority should be in
    attendance at all matches with an expected crowd of 5,000 or more.

      43. The number of ambulances to be in attendance for matches where larger crowds are expected should
    be specified by the local authority after consultation with the ambulance service and should be made a
    requirement of the Safety Certificate.

Appendix 5   The west terraces at 2.59 p.m.

    M r Hicks’ Evidence
       1. M r and Mrs Hicks’ two daughters died in the disaster. They had arrived early en famille but had tickets
    for different sections. The two daughters had standing tickets; they went into pen 3. Mrs Hicks had a seat in the
    north stand. M r Hicks took up a standing position in pen 1just below and to the west of the police box at about
    2.15 pm From there, he had a view of the centre pens. He kept an eye on them as they filled up since he knew his
    daughters to be there.

      2. His evidence was that by 2.50 pm he could see people were in distress. At about 2.55 pm he and others
    called to a senior police officer at the top of the steps to the control box to draw his attention to the crushing. Mr
    Hicks was only about 10 feet from the officer. He described him as wearing a flat cap with gold or silver braid
    and a light coloured anorak. M r Hicks believed he was the officer who stopped the match. M r Greenwood, who
    did stop the match, was certainly not wearing a light coloured anorak, as can clearly be seen on the video.

      3. M r Hicks says that he and others shouted several times to this officer in attempts to alert him to the
    distress in the pens. There was no reaction although M r Hicks believes the officer must have been in earshot.

       4. That officer descended from the steps and two cameramen whom M r Hicks believed were from

•
    television came and appeared to direct their cameras towards the pens. Another senior officer appeared two
    steps down from the platform. He was a stocky figure; he also wore a flat cap but with black braid. M r Hicks
    says that he and two or three others tried several times to capture this officer’s attention without success. Then
    M r Hicks says he shouted “For Christ’s sake! Can’t you see what’s going on? We can, and you have cameras”. The
    officer is said to have replied dismissively “Shut your fucking prattle”.

      5. When the disaster occurred the two Hicks girls were crushed. Victoria was put in an ambulance and Mr
    Hicks accompanied her to hospital where she was found to be dead. Sarah died at the ground.

      6. M r Hicks was an impressive witness and, despite his grievous loss, remarkably stoical. He gave his
    evidence clearly and without rancour. He was certainly mistaken about M r Greenwood being one of those on
    the steps and it has not been possible to identify either officer from M r Hicks’ descriptions. He may well also
    have been imprecise as to timings. Nevertheless, I see no reason to doubt that what he described did occur in
    relation to two officers. As M r Hicks generously said himself, the dismissive abuse from the second officer
    (although reprehensible) may have been due to his being preoccupied with trying to see what was happening at
    pens 3 and 4 around kick-off time.

      7. M r Barnbrock, a Liverpool supporter, said he went through the tunnel. He would have liked to have
    turned back when he saw how crowded the pens were. He went with his father and 13 year old brother Stephen
    towards the front of pen 4. He saw the teams come onto the pitch. Conditions at the front were, he said, alright

•
    until about 2 minutes to 3. Then the pressure in the pen increased and he and his father became separated. His
    feet came off the ground. He shouted to police officers through the fence to get them out and help them. The
    police did not react. The Liverpool goalkeeper, Bruce Grobbelaar, spoke to a policeman on the track. The gate
    was then opened by a blonde policewoman and about 25 to 30 people went through it. They included the
    witness’s father and his brother Stephen who had a broken arm. A police Constable shut the gate. It was then
    reopened by the same policewoman, the witness thought, and he got out.

      8. M r Eccleston, a male nurse and an impressive witness, was sitting in the north stand. He noticed pens 3
    and 4 were full and realised something was wrong when fans started coming over the perim eter fence but did
    not invade the pitch. He said the Liverpool goalkeeper appeared to notice this too.

     9. M r Grobbelaar was out of the country during the Inquiry and was therefore not called. However, he
    made a statem ent which was put in as his evidence. In the course o f it he said:-

      “Kick-off happened and we got into our stride pretty quickly - we forced a com er pretty early on and the ball
      came down to my end - I rolled it out to the full back once and play went on until Peter Beardsley hit the
      crossbar of the Nottingham Forest goal from a corner and came back into play. I remember just after that
      there were shouts and screams from the crowd just behind me, it was different; not the ordinary crowd noise
      and I turned around to look. W hat amazed me first was the concentration and squash of fans in the centre



                                                              63
section, the end areas still had plenty o f space. It was only then I became conscious that the crowd was
squashing forward and wasn’t able to go sideways and that’s when I noticed the fencing alongside them
holding them in. I saw fans being pulled up into the stand above the terraces, I saw fans climbing over into the
empty areas at the side and I saw fans climbing out over the front onto the pitch which was particularly
difficult because of the spikes on the top of the fencing but they were getting out.
   “Play was still going on and I was in a terrible position trying to concentrate on play and having my
attention taken by what was happening behind me. The ball came down to our end and Nottingham Forest
won a corner, it was taken and we cleared our box area and as play was going forward over the centre line I
heard a shout, ‘Bruce - please help’ - a desperate shout from a fan squashed up against the fencing to the
right of my goal as I looked at Leppings Lane terraces. He screamed, ‘Please get the fucking gate open - Help,
help’. All the people who could speak were pleading for help. There were two policemen near the gate right
alongside the fan who had shouted to me and so I shouted to them, ‘Get the gate open’. I was still trying to
concentrate on play and was still having my attention taken by what was happening behind me - there were
lots o f fans on the pitch behind the goal area by them too. I called again to the policemen, ‘Open the fucking
gate’ and one just turned away from me and looked back at the crowd but the other went to the gate and
opened it and it was like taking the top off a shaken coke bottle - people were everywhere on the play area
around my goal. Play was still going on and it came down towards me again for the left hand corner. It was
a Nottingham Forest throw-in, away to my left, the ball was out o f play and a fan came up to me on the
pitch and said, ‘Bruce, they’re killing us’. I said ‘W ho’s killing you?’, and he said ‘They’re crushing us-our
fans’. I said ‘Go and get some help’, and then a policeman came on and spoke to this fan. I don’t know
who the fan was, and then he led him off. It was about this time I saw a policeman running onto the pitch
from my right across my box and to the referee who blew up, recovered the ball and told all players to clear
the pitch.”
   10. It is clear from the video that M r Grobbelaar’s recollection of the sequence of events, even with regard
to the game, is inaccurate in a num ber o f respects. For example, the two Nottingham Forest corner kicks
occurred minutes before Beardsley struck the bar. Further, it seems highly probable from other evidence that
gates 3 and 4 were open continuously well before M r Grobbelaar says the fan asked him to get the gate open. It
seems surprising too that with all the noise M r Grobbelaar would hear the precise words of an individual fan,
let alone respond twice to them, whilst the game was in progress.
  11. As to M r Bam brock’s account, the evidence of PC Fiona Richardson was that she was the only
policewoman on the track in the early stages although others came from the seated area as the incident
developed. PC Richardson began at gate 1 and, although she did go and help people out through gate 3, she
did not go to gate 4, and did not open it twice or even once. The two officers who spoke of opening gate 4 were
both male.
   12. I think M r Grobbelaar did become conscious of distress in the crowd behind him and did speak to a
police officer at some stage, probably earlier than he now thinks. Not to reach that broad conclusion would
involve attributing his whole account to invention or fantasy and I see no grounds for doing so. However, his
detailed account was not tested in cross-examination and its inconsistencies and errors when compared with
other incontrovertible evidence would make it unsafe to derive more than the broad conclusion stated above.
The incident shows how honest witnesses can become confused and their evidence flawed when recollecting
events experienced under tension or emotion.
   13. As to the opening of gate 4 there was an apparent conflict of evidence. PC Illingworth said that about
five minutes to 3 he opened it and guided fans emerging through it to gate 5. PC Hooson said that it was he
who opened gate 4 just before kick-off. I am satisfied from the evidence o f a num ber of fans that, like gate 3,
gate 4 was opened more than once. The probability is, therefore, that whilst PC Illingworth was shepherding
fans to gate 5, gate 4 had been closed again until it was re-opened by PC Hooson two or three minutes later.
Oxygen
   14. It was alleged by a doctor that an oxygen cylinder provided to him on the pitch was empty. D r Phillips, a
Liverpool supporter, had been in pen 3 with his brother and others. He came under pressure and climbed into
pen 2. When the disaster occurred and gate 2 was opened, he went through it, injuring his head as he did so. He
came onto the pitch sometime after 3.10 pm and started resuscitation procedures. He was given an oxygen
cylinder. He believes this was from St John Ambulance. It was, he thought, too early to be the fire service. The
cylinder was switched on but D r Phillips says it gave no oxygen since it was empty. There was one oxygen
cylinder on the St John’s ambulance which came to the scene. M r Wells, the Divisional Superintendent o f St
John, took that cylinder onto the pitch. He said it was effective. In particular, he recalls going to a patient being
treated by D r Phillips and says that oxygen was flowing into that patient. Moreover, M r Wells tested the
cylinder afterwards and found it was still half full. It has a capacity that will last for 5 hours 40 minutes on a
high setting.
       15. There was evidence from Assistant Chief Fire Officer Hornsby that a Maxaman resuscitator had failed
    to work properly. It was delivering an oxygen flow appropriate to a “child” setting rather than a full “adult”
    flow. On examination, it was found that a retaining nut in the control knob had worked loose, possibly due to
    vibration in transit, and this had affected the flow of oxygen. The device had last been tested on 10 April 1989.
      16. I accept the evidence o f M r Wells that the St John Ambulance cylinder was charged with oxygen and
    working properly. In my view, D r Phillips may have been mistaken as to the cylinder o f which he complains
    being empty. He agreed he was under great pressure, in an awkward situation; his head was injured and he
    became very angry at what he regarded then as wholly the fault of the police. He conceded that if the cylinder
    was not empty there was a possible alternative - that the master tank top valve was shut. It seems unlikely that
    he could have been referring to the fire service resuscitator as he was clear that the bottle he received was a
    simple piece o f equipm ent not designed to breathe for the patient but merely to supply oxygen.
      17. I conclude that on a balance of probabilities the evidence does not justify a finding that an empty
    cylinder was brought to the scene.
    Calling the Fire Service
       18. PC Bichard’s call to police Headquarters at 3.13 pm for the fire service to bring hydraulic cutting
    equipm ent to cut metal fences (see paragraph 101 supra) was heard by Chief Inspector Edmundson. He went
    into the adjacent operations room to give instructions for the message to be passed to the fire service. There, a
    temporary control room assistant was already speaking to the fire service about a house fire. M r Edmundson
    interrupted the call and asked the assistant to tell the fire service that cutting equipm ent was wanted at

•
    Hillsborough. There followed a conversation between the assistant and Miss Davies at the fire service in the
    following term s:-
      Police         Can we have cutting gear for Hillsborough, please - straight away?
      Fire Control   Just a minute. Right - what’s the address?
      Police          Cutting equipm ent for Hillsborough football ground - straight away.
      Fire Control    Hillsborough football ground?
      Police         Yes, Hillsborough football ground.
      Fire Control    W hat road is that on? Do you know?
      Police         There has been a major accident, all the ambulances are up there.
      Fire Control    W hat road is it on?
      Police          I have no idea; Hillsborough football ground.
      Fire Control    W hat road is it on? Do you know?
      Police          “Hillsborough football ground - what road is it on?” (this was said to someone in Police
                      Force Control) - “Penistone R oad” (to Fire Control).
      Fire Control    Penistone Road.
      Police          Penistone Road, OK.
      Fire Control    Penistone Road, just a m inute - what’s exactly involved?
      Police          It’s football, a big match, Liverpool v Notts Forest.
      Fire Control    Yes, but why do you want us; you said it was an RTA [Road Traffic Accident].
      Police          No, no, no; m ajor incident inside the ground.
      Fire Control    M ajor incident inside - do you know exactly what it is?
      Police          No, I don’t; they want all the cutting gear.
      Fire Control    For what - do you know?
      Police          Hang on a sec.
      At that point Chief Inspector Edmundson intervened and spoke for the police. The conversation
     oncluded:-
      Police          (Male voice) - Hello!


                                                            65
  Fire Control    Hello! Now you wnt some cutting gear - what exactly is it for?

  Police          There has been a m ajor accident at Hillsborough football ground where the semi-final is;
                  the crowds have forced their way in, they have broken fences and gates down. I don’t know
                  exactly what it is but there are people trapped.

  Fire Control    Right! OK - leave it with us.

  That conversation took 1 m inute 13 seconds. It was published in a num ber of newspapers with strong
critical com m ent mostly against the fire service. The thrust of the criticism was that valuable time was wasted
by the fire service asking unnecessary questions as to where and why cutting equipm ent was required.

   19. There was a meeting of the emergency services in August 1988 to discuss procedure in the event of a
major disaster at Sheffield Wednesday’s ground. It was pointed out and minuted that “It was imperative that
the Police Control give the exact location of any fire or incident and as much detail as possible. No senior fire
officer is on duty at the m a tc h .. . Fire service will attend via Penistone Road or Leppings Lane as directed by
the police.”

   20. The message from PC Bichard contained all the necessary information - Leppings Lane end, hydraulic
cutting equipment, to cut metal fences. Regrettably, it was not passed on by Headquarters in those terms. Miss
Davies had rightly been trained to require a precise location and needed to know the problem which would face
the fire service so that the appropriate response could be made. In fact, there are several football grounds in the
Hillsborough district although clearly Sheffield Wednesday’s ground is the principal one. In the result,
although Chief Inspector Edmundson clarified, to an extent, the nature of the problem, the locus which
emerged in the course o f the conversation (Penistone Road) was not that contained in the original message
from ground control (ie “Leppings Lane end.”) Whilst on the face of the conversation the fire service may seem
to have been slow in the uptake or perhaps pedantic, in my view the police ought to have been more specific.
They had the necessary inform ation to be so.

  21. I am satisfied, however, that the delay of 1 m inute 13 seconds over the call, and even the delay
occasioned by the cutting equipm ent going to Penistone Road rather than Leppings Lane, did not affect the
outcome. Even had those with cutting equipm ent gone directly after a briefer ’phone call they would not have
arrived at a stage early enough to make cutting the fencing a helpful exercise.

M r Kenny Dalglish
  22. When the Liverpool manager went to the control room and agreed to make the announcement
broadcast at 3.56 pm, he says in a statement that he could not get the Tannoy to work. Spectators could see
him trying to address them and indicated to him manually that nothing could be heard. An officer pressed
buttons on the machine and M r Dalglish says he tried again with similar lack of success. He was then taken
under the police box to the room used by the disc jockey to broadcast pre-match music. There, the microphone
worked and he broadcast his message.

   23. M r Dalglish was not called. There was no other evidence about this incident. I accept it occurred as he
described. Why the Tannoy could not at that time be successfully operated from the police box is, however,
strange and unexplained. Unlike the radio, it had operated satisfactorily from the police box at the critical
times save that its messages may not always have been heard above the prevailing noise. It had worked at about
3.30 pm when it called for medical staff. I can see no grounds for criticising the police in regard to this incident
and certain it is that the brief delay in relaying M r Dalglish’s message can have had no significant effect.

BRIEFING NOTE FOR THE DEPUTY CHIEF CONSTABLE RELATIVE TO THE RECOMMENDATIONS

INCLUDED IN THE AGREEMENTS WITH THE CLUBS




1.    Recommendation 4 - States there should be an agreement between the Club

       and Police setting out their respective responsibilities on crowd safety

       a gate to relieve overcrowding.



7.    Recommendation 10 - The Club will provide cutting equipment which will be

       operated by employees of the Club who will be trained in its use.                       The

The Deputy Chief Constable said that the first requirement on team members
will be to gain a detailed grasp of their specific functions in order to lead
or act as an information resource on these subjects at future meetings and, as
the team progresses it is expected that whenever aspects arise relating to a
particular function, the necessary research will be carried out by the team
member allocated that responsibility. Others with expert knowledge in a
particular field will be seconded to the group whenever necessary.

                               ANALYSIS OF THE TAYLOR REPORT


The tone of the interim report arising from Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry is
strident.

The Force is roundly criticised, it may be felt a little too harshly in places.

These facts are, however, immutable.

This analysis concentrates on just four features of the report.

i)         Questionable assumptions reached   by Lord Justice Taylor.

ii)        Praise for the South Yorkshire Police.

iii)       The criticisms which are thought   to be most telling on the Force or
            individual officers.

     )     Matters raised for consideration   in the Final Report.


i)       Questionable assumptions

         Paragraph 55 -      "Evidence did not suggest a great amount of alcohol was
                              bought from off-licences."

         On the contrary the Gateway supermarket, for example, sold its entire stock of
         canned beers and lagers. Similar evidence is available from other off-
         licenes.

         Paragraph 75 -      Lord Justice Taylor begs the question of when the crush
                             barrier (124A) failed. "Probably it was triggered by the
                             surge at 3.04 pm."

         This is in advance of firm evidence from the Health and Safety Executive.

         It may be felt, however, that there is little mileage in our, equally
         speculative, proposition that the barrier collapsed earlier. We should await
         official word from the H.S.E.

         Paragraphs   82     "Initially, no officer took effective charge".
         and 251 -

         The evidence of Superintendent Greenwood is that he arranged, by use of loud
         hailer, for officers to go into the pen. Those officers were individually
         instructed to lift bodies/casualties to the threshold of the gate and a second
         contingent of officers were directed to take those casualties onto the pitch.

         This evidence appeared to be accepted by the Inquiry.

         Paragraphs   91     "Mr Duckenfield sent others down (to the pitch)rather
         and 282 -           than descend to see for himself."

         Implied criticism which is unwarranted. Police strategy e.g. 'Gold Command
         demands, for sound reasons, that overall commander does not become involved in
         rescue attempts.
Paragraph 167 -     "The police accepted that the proper filling of the pens
                    and monitoring them for overcrowding could and would not
                    be carried out by stewards."

It was accepted by many that stewards would not be expected to be on the
terraces, but monitoring the pens did not necessarily entail being upon the
terrace. Lord Justice Taylor has consistently ignored the argument that the
club might have carried out its legal responsibility (for the safety of their
customers) by positioning stewards so they had a view of the terraced
enclosures

Paragraphs 190 -   "The police.... should have realised that the Leppings
                   Lane turnstiles       would be under strain to admit all
                    the Liverpool supporters in time."

The turnstiling arrangements was a matter for the club. (That of course
raises the question of whether the police ought to have considered such
arrangements). Evidence of the club's authority in making these arrangements
was provided by senior officers who were unaware until after the event that
the club had reached a unilateral decision to use turnstiles 9 and 10 at
Leppings Lane (usually serving the West Stand) to feed the North Stand.

Club primacy in determining turnstile flow is conceded, however, at pargraph
290.

Paragraph 213 -    Implies similarity in the arrival pattern of    supporters at
                    the semi-final matches in 1987 and 1989.

In fact, the late arrivals in 1987 were due to police search procedures at the
motorway intersections. The match commander at that tie was informed of a
coach backlog and he took an early decision to postpone the game for 15
minutes.

This 'late arrival1 was not comparable with the 1989 phenomenon.

Paragraph 217 -    "Most of the facts (about the behaviour of Liverpool
                    supporters) should have been known ....South Yorkshire
                    Police had a liaison officer whose job was to seek,
                    receive and collate information as to the visiting
                    supporters."

This view ignores the fact that when DS Charlesworth sought information from
the Merseyside Police he received no help whatsoever.

We expressed this fact to the Inquiry in a diplomatic fashion (DS Charlesworth
was at first reluctant to remove a reference in his statement which likened
Merseyside Football Intelligence to a 'music hall joke') but it seems to have
been ignored.

Paragraph 228 -    Lord Justice Taylor refers to "a substantial minority
                    of drunken fans" which does not fit happily with other
                    inferences, e.g. paragraph 64 line 9, that drunkeness
                    was isolated.
  Paragraph 252 -      "The ambulance service was not called until 3.06 pm....
                       it is unlikely that these services could have saved lives,
                       if they had been called promptly, but it is possible", (my
                       underlining).

   As this 'possibility' is likely to feature in any civil claim (and any demand
   for criminal litigation) we must not lose sight of the fact (not mentioned in
   the Taylor Report) that two ambulance liaison officers were at the scene
   itself at 3.03 pm. They reported back to their control that everything was
   'under control'.


i) Praise for the South Yorkshire Police (restricted, mainly, to junior officers
   involved in rescue)

   Paragraph 82 -      "Individual officers .... worked frantically to free
                       those who were trapped but the gateways were so narrow
                       that only two or three could get at the entwined bodies
                       .—    Many assisted in getting (those trapped) from over
                       the fencing and comforting the distressed."

   Paragraph 85 -     "Police and fans pulled together and worked at the wire
                      mesh with their bare hands and feet to breach the fencing.
                      They succeeded in both pens, enabling officers to get in
                      and fans to be got out."

   Paragraph 90 -      "Parties of fans and police ran repeatedly the length of
                       the pitch bearing casualties to the north east corner."

   Paragraph 253 -     "....many officers did all they humanly could to rescue
                       and revive the victims. Many supporters who gave evidence
                       paid tribute to their efforts."

   Paragraph 254 -     "In my judgement, Chief Superintendent Nesbit was well
                       justified in using some of the many officers called up
                       pursuant to Operation Support to prevent possible
                       violence. To have had open fighting in a ground where
                       some 90 spectators already lay dead would have been an
                     unthinkable and obscene development."

   Paragraph 278 -     "Over many years the South Yorkshire Police have given
                       excellent service to the public. They have handled crowd
                       problems sensitively and successfully.

   Paragraph 279 -     "On the day many (officers) strove heroically in ghastly
                       circumstances aggravated by hostility to rescue and
                       succour victims. They inspired confidence and hope."
)Telling criticisms

Criticism                            Most relevant paragraph references

a)   Lack of control at              190, 224, 228, 268
     turnstiles

b)   Failure to monitor filling      171, 172
     of pens

c)   Failure to delay kick off       225, 226, 227, 281

d)   Inaction upon opening Gate C    67, 184, 231, 265, 282

e)   Slow reaction to tragedy        246, 249, 251, 252

f)   No leadership                   82, 251, 280

g)   Misinformation                  98, 283

The most directly damaging criticisms are those at (d) and (e) above. Lord
Justice Taylor's views on these 'failures' will form the basis of civil claims
and calls for criminal litigation.

It may be thought, therefore, that some of the expressions employed in the
report are unfortunate to say the least.

Inaction upon opening Gate C

"The immediate cause of the gross overcrowding and hence the disaster was the
failure, when Gate C was opened, to cut off access to the central pens which
were already overfull".    Paragraph 265

"....a blunder of the first magnitude"   Paragraph 231

"To allow more into those pens was likely to cause injuries; to allow in a
large stream was courting disaster".     Paragraph 184

The first comment is descriptive, the second is judgemental, the third comes
close to implying negligence.

Slow reaction to tragedy

"The combination of no instructions as to overcrowding and a strong
prohibition on opening the gate is likely to have made police recognition of
crushing slow and their response reluctant" Paragraph 246 - DESCRIPTIVE.

"There was a period during which the failure to recognise the problem and the
inhibition against tackling it caused vital time to be lost" Paragraph 249 -
JUDGEMENTAL.

"Probably, there was little that could have been achieved in most cases
however soon doctors had been summoned, but there were marginal cases where
earlier atttention might have made a difference......

It is unlikely that (emergency) services could have saved lives if they had been
called promptly, but it is possible."   Paragraphs 251-2 IMPLYING NEGLIGENCE??

Paradoxically, elsewhere in the report, Lord Justice Taylor clears up the ambiguity
he has created with regard to the delay in calling for medical assistance.

        "It is improbable that quicker recourse to the emergency services
         would have saved more lives."   Paragraph 301.

STATEMENT OF PETER WRIGHT, CHIEF CONSTABLE, SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE,
IN RESPONSE TO THE HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY REPORT

The report of the Inquiry by Lord Justice Taylor has been received by
me and I have noted the criticisms that have been directed against
members of the South Yorkshire Police both individually and collectively.

To make it clear to all concerned I would say at the outset that I
accept the findings and the conclusions of the Inquiry insofar as they
relate to the South Yorkshire Police.

The fact that we are held to have contributed to the terrible tragedy
of Hillsborough is a matter of profound sadness to all members of the
Force, and both personally and on their behalf I once again extend my
heartfelt regret to those who have lost loved ones or suffered injury.

Lord Justice Taylor and all concerned may be assured that the South
Yorkshire Police will pursue every action available to them to ensure
that such an event could not occur again.    I am grateful for the
comments he has made regarding the manner   in which the Force has
handled crowd control and public order events generally and for his
recognition of the heroic efforts of many   of myofficers on the day.

The Home Secretary has asked me for a report on the action I propose
to take in the light of the Inquiry and this will be pursued. Before
responding to the Home Secretary it will be necessary for me to consult
with members of my Police Authority, the Director of Public Prosecutions,
the Police Complaints Authority, and others.

I accepted full responsibility for police action in connection with
this event. In putsuance of this responsibility, and in the light of
Lord Justice Taylor's findings, I have written to my Chairman and
offered my resignation to the Police Authority so that members will
have the opportunity to consider my continuance as Chief Constable,
and my Office is now at their disposal.

       Dear Sir/Madam

       HOME OFFICE CIRCULAR 68/1989

       INTERIM REPORT OF THE HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY
       Introduct ion
       The Interim Report of the Inquiry set up by the Home Secretary
       into the tragic events at Hillsborough football ground Sheffield
       on 15 April has now been published. A copy of the Report i s
       attached.  Further copies are available from HMSO bookshops„

       2.   The purpose of this circular is to inform recipients of the
       contents of the Report and to urge them to take required action
       without delay in order to implement, as necessary, the InquirySs
       recommendations to improve safety arrangements at sports grounds.

       Government response

       3.  ’The Home Secretary has welcomed the thoroughness of the
       Report and its recommendations which he believes should be dealt
       with without delay pending the longer term findings of the
       Inquiry which will«be published in its Final Report.
E.R



      Scope of the T-enQ-mweiidations

      4.   Although the scope of recommendations is wide they are aimed
      primarily at football league grounds and the international
      stadiums used for soccer and rugby where there are liable to be
      large, densely packed crowds on terraces.  Recipients should
      nonetheless consider their application to other designated sports
      grounds and sports grounds at which large crowds are in
      attendance.

      5.   The 43 recommendations are in paragraph 316. They are in
      two categories: the 28 asterisked are those requiring
      implementation before the start of the new football season or
      immediately thereafter; the remaining 15 are those which,
      although requiring immediate action are likely to take longer to 4
      put into effect.  The Home Secretary nevertheless urges
      recipients to take urgent action on both categories so as to put
      into effect as many of the recommendations as possible before the
      start of the season.

      The guide to safety at sports grounds

      6.   It is anticipated that the Guide will be amended to reflect
      the Inquiry's findings in due course after consultation with
      appropriate bodies. Any changes will take account of the Final
      Report's recommendations.  If there is any doubt as to the
      nature of crush barrier testing described in Annex C of the Guide
      advice can be obtained from the Home Office 01-217 5352.

      The Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975

      7.   Consideration is also being given to any necessary
      enforcement of the Report's recommendations by means of a
      Statutory Instrument under section 15A of the Safety of Sports   |
      Grounds Act 1975 (the 1975 Act) requiring safety certificates to
      include mandatory terms and conditions.  Consultation as required
      under section 18 of the 1975 Act will first be carried out before
      any such Order is made.

      Football clubs

      8.   A copy of this circular together with the Report has been
      sent to all 92 football league clubs and the international
      stadiums in the expectation that they will co-operate fully.
      Should co-operation not be forthcoming local authorities are
      reminded of their powers under s.10 of the 1975 Act for use if
      there is judged to be a serious risk to spectators in any part of
      the ground.

      Resource implications

      9.   Whilst acknowledging that local authorities will need to
      examine current priorities in order to action the Inquiry's
E.R.



       reccrozsndaticns, it is not envisaged that there should be
       significant long-term resource implications for them.   The cost
       of any additional policing and/or provision of ambulance
       services at football grounds is expected to be met by the clubs
       or ground operators themselves.

       Other

       10. Any enquiries about this circular except barrier testing
       (see paragraph 6 above) should be addressed to Mr A Brown
       (01-273 2765).

       11.     Copies also go to those bodies on the attached list.

                                   Yours faithfully

    5. Consideration should be given to making it a criminal offence in England and Wales to have a smoke

anyone in an emergency.” (Now see paragraph 4.23 and Appendix E, paragraph E21)

    12. The Green Guide should be amended to contain a specific provision, in relation to stewards,

                                               9
which should be given a high priority w hen deciding upon the
design, layout, materials and loading of n ew buildings, or
alterations in a ground. Close attention should be paid to n ew and
existing exits and exit routes, slip-resistant surfaces, lighting and
ease of maintenance. All parts of viewing areas should always
have a clear unobstructed view of the playing area and designs
should take account of the need for effective stewarding, which
can play an important role in controlling crowd movement (see
Chapter 13).

21.    Although controlling crowd numbers may serve to reduce
some risks to an acceptable level, remedial work is likely to be
necessary to overcome others. Obvious defects such as trip
hazards (especially at the head of stairs or steps), loose or weak
handrails on stairs, and obstructed exits or exit routes, should be
rectified as part of the general care and maintenance of a ground.
Structures should be sound (see Chapter 3) and inspected by
suitably qualified persons (see Chapter 4). Design, layout and
signposting of exits and exit routes require particular attention to
ensure that they can safely cope with the number of spectators
w ho will use them at the end of an event or in an emergency (see
Chapter 6). Similarly, the condition of terraces or viewing slopes
(see Chapter 8) and presence or otherwise of crush barriers,
correctly sited and meeting the strength tests of this Guide (see
Chapter 9), are important factors. Broken, uneven terracing causes
stumbling. Barriers not only serve to break up crowd pressures but
also assist in controlling movement off the terraces by regulating
the rate of arrival at exits to suit their capacity, and encouraging
the formation of queues so that spectators arrive at exits in an
orderly fashion.


22.   Proper precautions against the risk of fire are vital (see
Chapter 11). Good ground managem ent is crucial in reducing or
eliminating the risk. Accumulation of litter is a prime potential
source of fire but can be eliminated by regular and frequent
inspections, good housekeeping, ground maintenance and by
taking particular care over the storage of flam mable materials. The
nature and type of materials used in the construction of covered
areas and stands will strongly influence the safety measures


                               10
required in them; for example, in some circumstances consideration
may have to be given to restricting the number of spectators
a n d /o r to the provision of additional exits from the building if it is
to continue in use.

2. M A N A G E M E N T RESPONSIBILITY

E ffe c tiv e g r o u n d m a n a g e m e n t is an im p o rta n t fa c to r in
a c h ie v in g p ro p er s a f e t y a n d m a n a g e m e n t s h o u ld c o n s ta n tly
lo o k to im p r o v e s a f e t y s ta n d a r d s w h e r e v e r p o s sib le .


23.   The safety of the public inside the ground is the
responsibility of those who stage the event and administer the                                jffc
ground in which it is held, ie the "management". This responsibility
applies in both normal and emergency situations. Local authority
safety officers, fire and police officers will help managem ent to
discharge this responsibility and in certain circumstances may
require measures to be taken in order to achieve reasonable safety
standards, but the management is not thereby absolved of its
responsibility for the safety of its customers.

24. M anagem ent should draw up a programme of checks,
inspections, tests, personnel training and remedial work pro­
grammes so as to elim inate or reduce risks to spectators.
M anagem ent is responsible for ensuring that such inspections are
carried out on structures and installations so that they are safe for
the purpose for which they w ere intended. The results of any
remedial action, as and w hen taken, should be recorded. W here
restrictions on crowd numbers to parts of the ground are required
for safety reasons they must be imposed and enforced. Similarly, if
a part of the ground is required to be closed because it is
potentially unsafe for spectators this must be done, and it must
not be opened up as a result of an "attractive" fixture or event,
unless measures have been taken beforehand to remove the
dangers which led to its closure in the first place.

25.   The ground managem ent should ensure that structural fire
protection of buildings is adequate, and that fire warning systems
are correctly installed and properly maintained in accordance with
manufacturers' instructions or British Standards. Similarly,
suitable fire-fighting equipment must be provided and maintained
to the standards specified in this Guide (see Chapter 11).


                                       12
2 6 . Staff training, particularly for stewards, in carrying out both
their normal duties and ensuring that they are aw are of their role
in an emergency situation, should be given high priority.
M anagem ent should not only inform all staff in writing w h at their
duties are, how to effect them and from w hom to seek advice if in
doubt, but also carry out active supervision and organise
emergency drills to maintain standards (see Chapter 13).

27.   General repair and maintenance should be undertaken with
spectator safety in mind; litter should not be allowed to
accumulate and managem ent should see that minor repairs are
quickly and properly carried out.

2 8 . There should be an appointed safety officer w ho should be
of sufficient status and authority effectively to take responsibility
for safety at the ground and to be able to authorise and supervise
safety measures. He or an appointed deputy should be in
attendance at a central control point w h en an event takes place.
All staff should know the location of this control point and w ho is
in charge of safety on the day in question.

29.   A summary of managem ent responsibilities is contained
below.

         i.     To appoint a safety officer.

       ii.      To ensure compliance w ith the terms and conditions
                of a safety certificate or other notice covering the
                safety of spectators.

         iii.   To d raw up and keep up to date records and plans of
                the ground; to m aintain the general fabric of the
                ground, and arrange an annual detailed inspection of
                the ground and regular testing of a representative
                sample of any barriers or rails, keeping a record of
                their location and results of the tests.

         iv.    To maintain and test all electrical installations and, in
                accordance w ith the relevant British Standards, the
                systems for emergency lighting, communications and
                fire w arning/detection, and fire-fighting equipment.

30.    The design and construction of buildings and installations
should be in accordance w ith good engineering and building
practice, especially as set out in all relevant British Standard
specifications and codes of practice. They should be properly
maintained and repaired by appropriately qualified persons.
Specialist advice from an appropriately qualified engineer
belonging to a recognised Institution should be sought to assess
the safety and strength of load-bearing elements in buildings and
installations such as crush barriers (see Chapter 9) and brick/block
walls (see Chapter 8, paragraph 103).

31. W h en walls, including perimeter walls, and fences are to
withstand crowd pressures, they should be designed to withstand
such pressures safely and allowance should be made for forces
simultaneously and independently induced by other factors eg
wind forces or attached installations.

32. All parts of the ground used by the general public, and
especially the exit routes, should have minimum headroom of not
less than 2 metres. Exit routes should wherever possible have a
headroom of 2.4 metres.

33. Precautions should be taken to prevent people from climbing
on to roofs, pylons, hoardings and other structures. W here
possible such structures should be fitted with unclimbable
devices eg stout barriers or close-boarded enclosures. Spikes,
barbed w ire etc should only be installed above the minimum
headroom specified in paragraph 3 2 above and preferably at a
m inimum height of 2.4 metres from the base.

                                            16
3 4 . All electrical installations should comply w ith the current
edition of the Regulations of the Institution of Electrical Engineers,
or have been awarded a certificate of satisfaction from a chartered
electrical engineer. Emergency lighting equipment should conform
to BS 5 26 6. Part 1.

3 5 . W h ere the natural lighting in any section of the ground
accessible to the public is deficient, adequate artificial lighting
should be provided. If the ground is to be used after dark, all parts
accessible to the public should be provided w ith means for lighting
adequate to enable them to see their w ay into, w ithin and out of
the ground. These provisions are particularly important in relation
to exit routes and stairways used by the public. Advice on
emergency lighting is offered in Chapter 11, paragraphs 1 6 6 -1 6 9 .

3 6 . A detailed inspection of the ground, including all components
and installations, should be arranged annually by the management.
It should be carried out by a person w ith a relevant and recognised
professional qualification, and experience of inspecting existing
structures.

3 7 . Engineers commissioned to assess structural safety of
buildings may find the appraisal techniques recommended by the
Institution of Structural Engineers (ISE) in the "Appraisal of
Existing Structures'', published in 1980, of assistance. Hard and
fast rules on the extent to which a structural appraisal is
necessary for individual buildings are difficult to lay down: much
will depend upon the type of installation, its size, condition,
materials used in construction and standard of maintenance. A full
appraisal is however unlikely to be necessary unless defects are
identified or in evidence from the analysis of information on the
structure and visual inspection.

38. Testing of crush barriers (see also Chapter 9) should be
carried out in accordance w ith Annex C of this Guide. W hen the
guidelines are first applied to a particular ground, a representative
sample of barriers of all types from all areas of the ground should
be selected for testing. Thereafter testing of barriers should take
place every 4 years unless from visual inspection doubts are
raised as to their strength/integrity, in which case they should be
retested. Testing should be carried out by or under the supervision
of a suitably qualified engineer, ie a structural or civil engineer.

39.   Following each event, a general visual inspection of the
ground should be made for signs of damage which might create a
potential danger to the public. Particular attention should be paid
to the condition of terraces, viewing slopes and stairways. Crush


                                          18
barriers and balustrades should be examined for deformation or
any other overt signs of weakness. The fire precautions measures
should also be inspected for damage, and alarm and other
electrical installations should be checked to ensure compliance
with the relevant British Standards.

4 0 . Warning, detection, lighting and public address systems are
vulnerable to vandalism, and this should be borne in mind when
installing them. All automatic fire detection and fire warning,
emergency lighting and public address systems should be tested
2 4 hours before an event, in accordance w ith the methods laid
down in BS 5839: Part 1 and BS 526 6: Part 1 respectively. There
is currently no British Standard for public address systems. In case
any of these systems is not operating properly and cannot be fixed
before the event, contingency plans should be formulated, in
consultation with the emergency services, for the use of acceptable
 substitute measures or (if necessary) the closure of any areas of
 spectator accommodation until the fault is remedied.

4 1 . Before an event, and at major soccer grounds in particular,
steps should be taken to ensure that the ground does not contain
any accessible items which could be used as missiles (eg piles of
 bricks, stones etc).

 42.   The ground should be inspected before and after each event
 to ensure there are no accumulations of combustible waste and
 that any hazardous materials (if essential to be stored) are safely
 stored well away from public areas.

 43.   Records should be kept and maintained of all inspections
 and tests together with a record of remedial actions taken.

48     It is generally recognised that a period of great risk to crowd
safety is at the time of leaving. Pressures can be set up w ithin a
departing crowd by impatient people; such incipient pressures can
and must be contained and controlled by careful attention to the
detailed design of barriers, stairways, gangways and exits.

4 9 . Recommendations relating particularly to egress from stands
are given in Chapter 10. Advice on the calculation of the capacity
of exit systems is contained in Chapter 16.

5 0 . A smooth free flow through an exit route to the outside is
best achieved by controlling the crowd flow at the entrance to the
exit route, so that departing spectators are held back in a relatively
safe place eg on the terrace and gain access to the exit route at a
calculated rate. That is to say, the first part of the exit route
leading from the terrace (or other enclosure) should have a lower
capacity than any subsequent element. The exit route will then be
able to discharge people at a rate compatible w ith that at which
they enter into the route.

5 1 . W h e re the system is not free flowing, the width of any
restricting elem ent should be increased a n d /o r the width of the
exit from the stand or terrace reduced to regulate the flow.

5 2 . W h ere deviations in design or construction from the
recommended guidelines are such as to create a manifest danger,
that section of the exit system should be closed until remedial
action has been taken, and a reduction made accordingly in the
spectator capacity of the section of the ground it serves, ie the exit
route should be excluded from the capacity calculations.

 5 3 . Care should be taken in the planning of exit systems to
 ensure that in the event of an emergency which blocks the usual
 exit route spectators will be able to use an alternative exit route
(including, w here appropriate, forward evacuation on to the pitch,
see Chapter 11, paragraph 186).

5 4 . There should be no "funnelling" effect causing people to
converge on a narrower means of access or egress. This will slow
down the rate at which people can pass through the entire exit
system and pack them more closely together. However, a
narrowing in the exit route is acceptable w h en it is preceded by an
open space or "reservoir area" w here the holding capacity is
sufficient to contain safely the spectators held up because of the
difference in the flow rate into and out of the reservoir area. The
 capacity of reservoir areas should be calculated using the
 appropriate flow rate given in Chapter 17 and the recommended
 exit time given in paragraph 56 below; a packing density of 54
 persons per 10 square metres of the area available for standing
 within the reservoir area is the maximum for safety. Arrangem ents
 should be such as to prevent this being exceeded.

 55.   Reservoir areas should be avoided wherever possible and
 should not be permitted within 4 5 metres of any combustible
 building w ithin the ground eg a timber stand, or within 15 metres
 of any non-combustible building within the ground.


 E g r e ss tim e
 5 6 . Some research has indicated that w hen it takes more than
 about 7 minutes to vacate an area of terraced spectator
 accommodation, the crowd flow tends to become turbulent. In
 these conditions the rate of flow may be reduced and individuals
 can lose control over their own movements; there is thus higher
 potential for accidents. Exits from each area of spectator
 accommodation should be so designed that all spectators can
 leave that area and if desired pass into a free flowing exit route
 system in 8 minutes or less. The capacity of an exit route is the
 number of people w ho could pass through restricting parts of it as
 calculated in Chapter 16, paragraphs 2 2 9 -2 3 2 .


 Note: This time is not necessarily the same as emergency
 evacuation time, which is dealt with in Chapter 11, paragraphs
 1 8 3 -1 8 8 , and which involves other considerations.

6 2 . All doors on an exit route should always be capable of
opening outwards so that crowds can escape in an emergency.
This is particularly important for doors w ithin covered stands and
at the foot of stairways.

6 3 . All doors on an exit route should be secured in the fully open
position before the end of play. W hen open, no door should
obstruct any gangway passage, stairway or landing.

6 4 . All exit gates from the ground should also open outwards.
W h e re this is impracticable for existing doors, eg because it would
cause an obstruction on a public highway, the gates should be
resited (ie put further back) within the exit route they serve, or
provision made for tw o-w ay opening. W h ere practicable exit gates
should be sited adjacent to entrances. There should be no
obstructions eg no changes in level etc at exit doors.

6 5 . Sliding or roller-shutter gates should not be used because
they are incapable of being opened w hen pressure is exerted in
the direction of crowd flow and have mechanisms or runways
which are vulnerable to jamming.

 6 £ . W here exit gates have to be secured against outside intruders
 they should be fitted with panic-type bolts, but all exit gates,
 unless secured in an open position, should be manned at all times
 while the ground is used by the public and be capable of being
 opened immediately from inside by anyone in an emergency.

 67.    Facilities should be provided to enable people to leave the
 ground at any time. For this purpose a number of reversible tu rn ­
 stiles or, preferably, pass doors, so operated as to limit the opening
 to the passage to one person at a time, should be considered.
 However, reversible turnstiles are not acceptable as a means of
 escape from a ground and should not form any part of, or be
 installed into, the normal or emergency exit system of the ground.

68 .  The aim should be to provide stairways which minimise
hazards by such features as uniform going and rise, secure
footing, not too steep a gradient, and a width sufficient to allow
free movement but narrow enough to provide everyone w ith
access to a handrail. The head of the stairway should be so
designed that flow is uniform across its width and crowd
pressures cannot easily be generated. In addition flights should
not provide long, unrestricted paths down which crowd pressures
and surges can be created. Adequate separation should be
provided between channels and multi-channel stairway arrange­
ments so that there is no overspill from one channel to another.


D is p o sitio n o f s ta ir w a y s
6 9 . Stairways should be carefully positioned to take advantage
of natural light and ventilation. W here the natural lighting is
deficient the stairway should be adequately lit by artificial light
(see Chapter 3, paragraph 35).


C o n s tr u c tio n o f s ta ir w a y s
7 0 . The width, rise and going  of the steps should be uniform
w ithin each stairway, and should ideally be uniform throughout
the entire exit system.

71.  Stair treads should be provided w ith slip-resistant surfaces
and durable edgings. Adequate drainage should be provided.

72.     Open risers should not be used.

73.    On any stairway the preferred going of treads should be
3 0 5 mm but not less than 2 8 0 mm; and preferred height of risers
should be 150 mm but not more than 190 mm.
74.    Stairways should:

       i.      be w ithout winders;

       ii.     be in flights of not more than 16 or few e r than 3
               steps; and
       iii.    not have more than 2 successive flights in a turn, and,
               if there are more than 12 steps in a flight, should have
               not more than one flight w ithout a turn.


75.    The going of the landing between flights should not be less
than the width of the section or channel of the flight.

7 6 . Every person on a stairway should have access to a handrail.
Accordingly the minimum width of a stairway should be 1.1 metres,
stairways wider than 1.8 metres being divided as far as possible
into channels having a width of between 1.1 metres and 1.8
metres. The strength of the handrails (including supports) used to
divide a stairway into channels should be as described in Chapter 9.

7 7 . Handrails projecting not more than 100 mm should be
provided on both sides of all stairways, steps and landings at a
height of not less than 8 4 0 mm (measured vertically from the
centre of the step, or the surface of the landing).

7 8 . Protection should be provided on both sides of all stairs and
landings. W h e re next to open wells, or spaces, such protection
should be enclosed and should be not less than 1.1 metres in
height (measured vertically from the centre of the step, or the
surface of the landing). The protection should have a strength
equivalent to that of the crush barriers of the weaker type,
described in Chapter 9.


 A c c e s s to sta ir w a y s
 7 9 . Access to the head of the stairways should be controlled
 along the following lines to ensure a free flow of spectators.

 8 0 . W h ere a stairway is divided into channels the access should
 be designed to secure a uniform flow down each channel.


                                        27
8 1 . The approach to the head of the stairs should be level and
should be so arranged that the spectators converge on the
stairway from the front a n d /o r the sides only. There should be no
approach from behind, involving movement around the ends of the
balustrades or side walls of the stairway, except w h ere this
approach is already controlled by physical means such as by the
gangways in the seated areas of the stand.

8 2 . The extent of the approach in the direction of the stairway
should not be less than 1.1 metres and preferably not more than
3 metres.

8 3 . W here restrictive elem ents such as barriers or gateways are
installed in the approach to a stairway in order to meet the
foregoing provisions, the total width of the passage formed by
these elements should not be more than two-thirds the minimum
width of the stairway. This is to accommodate the slower flow rate
down a staircase as compared with the flow rate on flat areas and
through portals (see Chapter 17).

8 4 . For an application of these principles to a multiple stairway
leading direct from a terrace, see Figures 1 and 2 .

              the open air; or
        ii.       on to walkways or concourses of adequate dimensions

    89.   In addition to the incidental dangers of standing for long
    periods on steep terraced slopes, crowds are subject to excessive
    pressures generated by spectators straining to see the event, by
    excitement, or by surging deliberately induced by a certain type
     of spectator.

     90.   Failure to provide spectators with an unobstructed view
     invites them to stretch and strain, and so generates dangerous
     pressures within the crowd.

     91.   Terraces are recognised as presenting a special safety
     problem especially at football grounds. The following guidance is
     therefore aimed mainly at football stadia but can be applied to any
     ground w h ere standing terraces or viewing slopes are used for
     accommodating spectators.



      T errace ste p s
      92.    A terrace step should not be less than 2 8 0 mm or more than
      3 8 0 mm wide. The preferred dimension is between 3 5 5 mm and
      3 8 0 mm.

      93.  The height of risers should be between 75 mm and 1 80 mm.
      7 5 mm is related to the m inim um width of 2 8 0 mm. If the riser
      height is greater than 180 mm, a crush barrier should be provided
      at the top of the riser.


                                                        31
94. Excessive variations in the gradient of a terrace should be
avoided. Gradients steeper than 1 in 2 could be dangerous.

95.   The surface of terrace steps should be even and of a slip-
resistant material. Adequate drainage should be provided to
prevent rainwater causing deterioration.



G angw ays   (see Annex A)
96.   The aim should be to ensure that every spectator on the
terraces is within 12 metres of a gangway or exit, so that 0%
spectators can move quickly on to exit routes at the end of an
event or in the event of emergency. This may be achieved by a
pattern of gangways (not less than 1.1 metres wide) linked to the
exit system.


97. Spectators should be discouraged from standing in lateral
gangways because this disrupts free movement about the ground
(or w ithin sections of it). Also, spectators on the terrace steps
behind the gangway may have their view obstructed, which will
cause them to stretch and strain, and so generate dangerous
pressures within the crowd. Spectators would be discouraged
from standing in these gangways if they w ere sunk from 100 mm
to 2 0 0 mm and if crush barriers w ere provided behind but not
immediately in front of them.


98.    Similarly, spectators should be discouraged from standing in
radial gangways. These are relatively long and uncontrolled
dow nw ard paths through terraces, and are difficult to keep clear, ^
especially w hen sited in popular viewing areas, eg behind the goal
area at a football ground. It is helpful to sink them 1 50 mm to
2 0 0 mm and to interrupt an otherwise continuously descending
gangway by turns along, say, lateral gangways.


99.   W h ere sinking gangways, lateral or radial, is not thought to
be practical, their boundaries should be highlighted w ith paint and
spectators advised by signs not to stand there. Stewards may be
needed to enforce this instruction.


                             32
1 0 0 . As w ith other forms of stairways, the going in radial
gangways should be uniform, the step dimension as defined in
paragraph 92 and the surfaces slip-resistant.

D i v is i o n o f s p e c t a t o r a c c o m m o d a t i o n
1 0 1 . A ground should be divided into sections to prevent
potentially hazardous migrations by spectators. Each section of a
ground has its own limit of safe capacity (see Chapter 16), and a
major migration can cause dangerous overcrowding. Each section
of the ground, for example, each end or side, should be self
contained w ith its own entrances, exits and toilet/refreshm ent
facilities. For soccer grounds in particular there should be no
access from one such major section to another except in an
emergency. At other sporting events such as greyhound racing
spectators may need to move freely between different parts of the
ground and this should be borne in mind w hen considering access
to and from the sections of the ground and w hen considering the
need for subdivisions of sections in paragraph 103 below.

1 0 2 . Each of the major sections should be subdivided by such
means as gangways and crush barriers, arranged so as to
minimise the sway and surge of spectators.

1 0 3 . Railings, fences etc dividing sections of the ground should
be of the strength of the crush barriers, as should handrails
dividing stairways into channels as appropriate, described in
Chapter 9. Brick/block and similar solid structures lacking
sufficient mass or tensile strength are poorly suited to withstand
horizontal pressures, and where used to divide spectator accommo­
dation, should be subject to regular structural appraisal by
appropriately qualified persons (see Chapter 3).

 C r u s h b a r r ie r s
 1 0 4 . Detailed advice on crush barriers is given in Chapter 9.

 V i e w i n g s l o p e s ( ie n o n - s t e p p e d s l o p i n g a r e a s p r o v i d i n g
 s ta n d in g a c c o m m o d a tio n fo r s p e c ta to r s)
 1 0 5 . The surface of this form of terrace should be covered w ith a
 slip-resistant material, eg packed ash, and should be even and
 properly drained.


                                                      33
1 0 6 . The desirable maxim um gradient for a viewing slope is 1 in
6 (ie 9.5°). [Note: this is different to the stepped terrace gradient
quoted in paragraph 94). Viewing slopes w ith any steeper gradient
should have continuous crush barriers between gangways.

107.   The spacing of crush barriers should be the same as for
those on normal terracing (see Chapter 9).

T erra ce t o to u c h lin e d is ta n c e
1 0 8 . To prevent undue crowd pressures generated by spectators
stretching and straining for an unobstructed view, it is desirable to
provide a m inim um distance between the front of the terrace and
the playing area of the pitch.

1 0 9 . The m inim um recommended distance between the two is 3
metres w h ere the terrace gradient is 3 0 ° or steeper. W h ere the
gradient is shallower than this, it may be advisable to increase this
distance so as to enable spectators to obtain a clear view.

110. In order to locate the top rail against that part of the body
most able to tolerate pressure the height of crush barriers should
be between 1.02 metres and 1.12 metres above the nosing of the
step immediately behind the barrier, with a preferred height of
1.1 metres.

1 1 1 . Crush barriers should be designed so that there are no sharp
projections or edges. Although a barrier w ith a top rail of 5 0 mm
internal diameter tube has been favoured at many sports grounds,
research has shown that there would be advantage in the use of a
flat rail of 1 00 mm vertical depth.




 S p a c i n g o f c r u s h b a r r ie r s
 112. The maxim um spacing of crush barriers will be dependent
 on the gradient of the terrace or view ing slope. Paragraphs
 1 1 3 -1 1 9 below give recommendations for the spacing and
 strength of crush barriers.

 113. Ideally, crush barriers should be provided along the full
 width of a terrace, w ith gaps only at the radial gangways.

 1 1 4 . W here barriers are not continuous between radial gangways,
 the alignment of gaps in successive rows of barriers on a terrace
 should form an angle of less than 6 0 ° to the barriers. There should
 be no more than 2 consecutive gaps in any line of gaps. (See
 Figure 3 overleaf).

1 1 5 . W h e re there are gaps in the line of crush barriers these
should be at least 1.1 metres and not more than 1.4 metres
in width.

1 1 6 . Column A in Table 1 opposite provides the maximum
distances between barriers conforming to the greater strength
requirements of crush barriers as described above; column B
provides the maximum distances between barriers conforming to
the lesser strength requirements. Interpolation may be made
between these figures.

117.  A distinction is made between barrier intervals required in
"peak" viewing areas. The term "peak" viewing areas describes
the most popular parts of the terraces w h ere there is a tendency
for spectators to crowd together and become so emotionally
involved in the occasion that their reactions can cause additional
pressures to be set up in those sections of the ground. The peak
viewing areas are particularly associated with football grounds and
are typically behind the goal areas, although other parts of the
terraces known locally may come w ithin this category.

 1 1 8 . Existing crush barriers and handrails should   be capable of
 resisting the forces indicated in the existing test load columns of
 Table 2 overleaf w hen applied in a test as described in Annex C.
 W h ere existing crush barriers and handrails fail to meet these test
 conditions, they should be replaced or strengthened in such a way
 as to do so. Barriers and handrails so strengthened should be
 retested in accordance w ith Annex C.

 1 1 9 . N ew crush barriers or handrails should be designed to resist
 safely a horizontal force as indicated in the "new design force’
 column in Table 2 applied as a static load acting on the top rail of
 the barrier or handrail at right angles to the longitudinal axis. The
 foundations of new barriers or handrails should be designed to
 resist the overturning movements and sliding forces, induced by
 the forces described in the "new design force'' column overleaf,
  w ith a factor of safety of 2.

      1 2 0 . Stands may consist of seated accommodation only or> may
      contain a mixture of both seated and standing areas. The following
      advice can be applied to all sports grounds where spectators are
      so accommodated.                                              1<

      1 2 1 . There is generally a less hurried departure from th e t^ a te d
      accommodation in stands at the end of an event. Mpreover,
      spectators are induced by the layout of the seats to form orderly
      queues. Even so, attention should be paid to the points below &s well
      as the other structural considerations in respect of stairwaysSftxits,
      egress and, where appropriate, density levels and crush barriers.

      1 2 2 . Fire safety is particularly important and is dealt,.,y$th in
      Chapter 11. Every stand should be provided w ith sufficient exits to
      allow for the orderly evacuation of all the s p e c t a to r ^ 0 be
      accommodated. Evacuation time will depend to a large e^ji&nt on
      the fire hazard present in the stand (see Chapter 11, paragraphs
      1 8 3 -1 8 8 ). Egress time (see Chapter 6, paragraph 56) shouldbe no
      longer than 8 minutes using the calculations in C h a p t e r b u t
      the emergency evacuation time is an overriding criterion w hen
      calculating the allowable capacity of a stand (see Chapter 11,
      paragraph 183).


      1 2 3 . Seats and gangways should be so positioned as to,provide
      ready access to exits. No person in any part of a stand shpyjtf have
      to travel more than 3 0 metres to the nearest exit from a stand.

      1 2 4 . All seats should be securely fixed in position. The use of
      tip-up seats allows more circulation space, the automatic type
      being preferable.


                                                            39
1 2 5 . The m inim um area allotted to each seated person should be
4 6 0 mm wide and 6 1 0 mm deep; but for comfort these
m easurements should be 5 5 0 mm and 7 6 0 mm respectively. To
enable people to move freely between rows of seats, there should
be at least 3 0 5 mm between perpendiculars from the foremost
projection of one seat and the back of the seat in front of it. (The
m inim um of 3 0 5 mm is included in the 6 1 0 mm or 7 6 0 mm depth             ^
measurement of the seating area.)

1 2 6 , The number of seats in a row should not normally exceed:           ,

1 2 9 . The nature of temporary stands and other temporary
structures, w hether or not covered, used to accommodate
spectators at a sports ground is likely to vary considerably as will
the materials used in their construction. Some may be erected for
a single event only. Even so there is no justification for accepting a         4 (
lower standard of safety in such structures than elsewhere w ithin
the sports ground, and the design and construction of temporary                . ,

 1 3 1 . All temporary stands should be capable of withstanding any
load or force to which they may be subjected and account should
be taken of any external factors such as wind forces. Failure of any
one support member or connection should not render the
structure unstable. As far as practicable the area around supporting
frames should be secured to prevent unauthorised access, and
fram es should be so designed that they are firmly lo c k ^ i n t o
position and cannot be tampered with by unauthorised persons.

1 3 2 . Consultation w ith the local authority and building atiffiority
(if different) should take place at an early stage p*ribr to the eYkfction
of any temporary stand.                             H!             5!*

need to be considered include: load-bearing capability B P th e
ground, its slope or unevenness, drainage, availability of'Plains
services, access/egress for spectators and for emergency vehicles,
overhead power lines, and the proximity of surrounding buildings
in relation to the risk of fire. The condition of the site should be
regularly checked to ensure its load-bearing capabilities have not
deteriorated; settlement of ground may cause instability and so
require repacking and re-levelling. The site should be prepared and
maintained so as to provide an even surface for those parts to
which the public have access.                                 ;w

stands should be carried out by or under the supervision of
persons experienced and trained in the proper performance of
such work and in accordance with the manufacturers' instructions
w henever available, or in accordance with drawings and plans
made by a competent engineer.

1 3 5 . Work should be carried out only w here lighting is sufficient
to allow it to be safely and properly performed and checked. No
assembly or dismantling work should be carried out to the danger
of members of the public in the vicinity.
   XI
1 3 6 . The work should be carried out in a proper manner, using
correct parts, and tools of a proper size and design. Care should be
taken with the handling of components to avoid damage or distortion.


1 3 7 . All components should be closely examined during assembly
and dismantling for signs of wear, deformation or other damage,
and^Where necessary replaced by sound components of matching
material properties and dimensions. Temporary repairs using
makeshift components should be avoided.

1 3 8 . Care should also be given to ensure all components are
correctly aligned; they should not be bent, distorted or otherwise
altered to force a fit.

1 3 9 : On completion, assembly work should be checked with
particular attention given to fastenings and connections.

structures can present special fire safety problems and guidance
will be contained in the Home Office/Scottish Office publication
"Guide to Fire Precautions in Existing Places of Entertainment"*.

1 4 1 . All tents should be capable of withstanding any forces,
particularly w ind (including uplift so caused) and those caused by
the.build up of snow or heavy rain, to which they may be subjected.
Emergency arrangements should be made for the dismantling,
either partial or total, of a tent should conditions arise that could
lead to any collapse or distortion. W here such work in any way
affects the stability of the tent or the safety of members of the
public, the work should not commence until the immediate area
has been cleared of all but essential staff.

1 4 2 . Supporting poles, guy ropes and stays should be used as
necessary and correctly formed, and secure anchorages made to
the ground to ensure that the tent is stable and maintains its
correct shape.

      1 4 3 . The stability of the main tent poles and supporting structure
      should be independent of the sheeting fabric, ie any tearing or
      defect occurring in the fabric should not result in the collapse of all
      or any part of the main structure.                            o‘.<.

      144.  Particular attention should be paid to the main supporting
      poles and top braces of large tents w here they have to be raised to a
      considerable height. Damage or distortion to these members could
      considerably weaken the structure. W h ere such damage does
      occur, the members should be replaced or repairs or modifications
      carried out so as to bring them up to full working s tr e n g th ^ 1

      1 4 5 . W h ere solid frames or units, eg doors, are linked tf& a tent
      structure they should be rigidly formed and adequately braced, and
      care should be taken that they do not overstress local a'reas of
      the tent.

hazsjrd in the event of fire is the covered stand w h ere spectators
s i t ^ . stand. N ew structures will conform to Building Regulations
requiring them to have a reasonable degree of structural fire
prflt^ption. Existing structures will vary considerably in age and
m a t^ ia ls used in construction. The qualities of combustibility and
ability to propagate and spread fire of the materials used in
cbi"|S|ruction have an important effect on the standard of fire
precautions required to ensure reasonable safety. It may be
dif||fcult in some cases to improve the fire resistance of an existing
stnjpture to any significant extent but it should be done wherever
practicable even though in some cases substantial alterations may
be needed to provide reasonable protection from fire.


1 4 8 . W ith new stands there is much more opportunity to
incorporate from the start comprehensive measures for fire safety,
considering properly the impact of each measure on the others.
Design features for new stands should include the following:

            a.   internal finishes which have low flammability;

            b.   seating, partitioning and any other fixed or removable
                  contents including seat cushions which possess low
                  flammability characteristics and fire risk potential and
                  are limited in amount;

            c.   contents which         are    not capable        of being        easily
                 dismantled;

           d.    no inaccessible places w here litter can collect;

         M i n i m i s in g f ir e r is k
         1 4 9 . One potential cause of fire arises from the accumulation of
         waste paper, programmes, food and drink cartons etc dropped by
         spectators. Such waste can be easily set alight by srtjokers'
         materials and the resulting fire may then spread to the £fr^Hiture,
         especially the ones that are constructed of more combustible
         materials. Every effort should be made to reduce this hazard.
         Accumulations of fitter, for example near catering facilities,^Bould
         be cleared from the ground as quickly as possible or kept in '^ safe,
         fire resistant container or room pending clearance.             .

         1 5 0 . All parts of buildings should be inspected before and after an
         event (see also Chapter 4, paragraph 4 2 ) and any accumulation of
         litter cleared away as described above. It is particularly important
         to ensure that litter does not accumulate in escape routes or
         understands.


                                                  45

1 5 1 . Smoking should be discouraged in stands containing
combustible or flam mable products, either loose (eg cushions) or
fixed (eg seating), or in the fabric of the building.

1 5 2 . A common feature in construction of stands which is a fire
risk is the existence of voids under the seating and under the
flooring itself. These voids can become a resting place for paper,
cartons and other combustible materials which can be ignited,
unnoticed, by carelessly discarded cigarette ends etc. Seating
arfahgements should, w herever possible, be such that floor
surfaces are accessible for the removal of litter. W h ere voids
belbw flooring exist they should if practicable be excluded; for
example, w h ere a stand is built into a natural slope the
 underneath area can be filled in with concrete. W here this is not
 practicable they should be completely sealed off to stop litter
 accumulating in them, or be entirely open to allow easy access for
 inspection and removal of combustible waste.

1 5 3 . Other items, such as cushions filled with cellular foams or
otj^er synthetic materials are a fire risk because they are
combustible, and w hen set alight can give off large quantities of
smoke and fumes. Also, the use of large quantities of plastics in
seating should be reviewed carefully, particularly where cellular
polymers may be proposed. The fire authority should be consulted
about the fire risk in stands.


1 5 4 . Cushions and other flam mable materials represent in bulk a
risk of a swiftly developing fire. They should be stored in a fire-
resistant container or room well away from spectator accommodation
as should paper items such as programmes. Similarly, hazardous
materials, for example fuels (whether in containers or within fuel
tanks and machinery) fertilizers, weed killers and paints should be
kept (if at all) well away from public areas and stored in a room
which has fire resistance of at least 1 hour. Other high fire risk
areas, eg enclosed or underground car parks situated under stands,
should also have fire resistance of at least 1 hour.

1 5 5 . W here catering facilities are provided, special care should be
taken to ensure that any fuel or power supply used for cooking, for


                              46
example LPG cylinders, is safely stored and used, in accordance
with the advice of the authority responsible for enforcement of the
Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974. Useful guidance is given in
Health and Safety Executive Guidance Notes CS4, "The Keeping of
LPG in Cylinders and Similar Containers" and CS8, "Small £cale
Storage and Display of LPG at Retail Premises".

Prevention or retardation o f fire g ro w th /s p rea d             ,«&!■
1 5 6 . W here, despite all precautions, a fire has started, it is^/tal to
ensure that the rate of growth in its early stages is restri^ed to
proportions which will not overwhelm the arrangements provided
for safe escape. This is best achieved by controlling the amount and
nature of the materials (especially the combustibles) in a ,stand,
both in terms of the contents (loose and fixed) and in those parts of
the fabric of the stand to which a fire would have access (especially
internal linings). An important additional line of defence is prompt
action by ground staff using the fire-fighting equipment available at
the ground to tackle the fire and keep it in check ("first-aid" fire­
fighting) until the fire brigade arrives. These measures arei^ u cial
because the quicker a fire develops, the less time there is a,pliable
to escape from it. A fire should not be able to develop unrjqticed
anyw here underneath or adjacent to the spectator area of the
stand, so that its spread would be likely to break through into the
spectator accommodation.

1 5 7 . The spectator area in the stand should be separated from any
other adjacent circulation space or void by a^ constructionj||gying
fire resistance of not less than half an hour.                til

1 5 8 . W alls and ceiling Mnings within stands and ceiling linings
beneath the stand seats should have a flame spread classification
of not less than Class 1 w hen tested in accordance with BS 476:
Part 7.
                                                                      • ' it.
                                                                ^   vXS!'
1 5 9 . Restricting the extent and speed of the spread of fire in its
later stages is also important in order to reduce the possibility of
escape time being further threatened. Most measures which
reduce the rate of fire growth in the early stages will also serve to
restrict the fire spread in the later stages. The following    measures
would mainly affect the later spread. For some roof configurations
venting systems may offer a means of reducing the spread of fire
(including movement of flames along the roof) and hot smoky
gases. The science of fire and smoke venting is however complex
and advice from the fire authority should be sought on w hether
this would be advantageous in a particular case.

1 6 0 . W h ere the roofs of buildings are so connected that smoke
a n d fla m e could travel essentially two or more sides of the playing
area, a wide break in the roof should be made of sufficient width to
prevent spread from one side to the other, unless the flame travel
could be eliminated by the prevention measures mentioned above.

1 6 1 . Use of flam mable roof materials should be avoided. W here
they do exist they should be replaced w here practicable by non-
conabustible materials or should be underdrawn with non­
combustible board.



F ir e w a r n i n g s y s t e m s
1 6 2 . All buildings in the
                           ground (including stands) to which public
or staff have access should be provided with an electrical fire
warning system to alert staff. An indication of the warning and its
location should be given to a central control point (see Chapter 12,
paragraph 193). The system should conform w ith BS 5839: Part 1
in terms of its components, installation and maintenance. The
cen tral control point and, w h e re necessary, o th er selected
positions in the ground should have facilities to call the fire
brigade and other emergency services. Stewards and other
officials should be trained in w hat they should do if they discover a
fire (see paragraphs 176 -1 77 ).

1 6 3 . The area underneath the spectator accommodation should
have a system for detecting a developing fire. In order to give an
early warning in an unoccupied area an automatic fire detection
(AFD) system should be considered, conforming to BS 5839: Part 1
in terms of its components, installation and maintenance. It should
be connected so that any alarm will be communicated to the
central control point.


                                     48
      1 6 4 . Any fire detection equipment should be tested regularly in
      accordance with the advice given in the British Standard
      specification.


     1 6 5 . W here areas of high fire risk such as large storerooms and
     enclosed or underground car parks are situated under stands,
     consideration should be given to the installation of an automatic
     fire extinguishing system, eg sprinklers, instead of an AFDsystem .
     Here again any such system should be connected so that warning
     of fire is communicated to the central control point.        'Vi.
                                                                   ‘

     1 6 6 . Emergency lighting, for use in the event of failure>;oft the
     general lighting, should be provided in all parts of the premises
     accessible to the public and along all exit routes, with exit signs
     clearly illuminated. Installation should be in accordance' With
     BS 526 6: Part 1. The system should be completely separate'.from
     the general lighting system, although a one-circuit s ^ te m
     incorporating staggered sub-circuits would be an acceptable
     alternative. Unless exceptionally two entirely independent supplies
     can be obtained from outside sources, the emergency,,g|rcuit
     should be connected to a source of power located on the premises,
     for example storage batteries or a diesel generator, with a delay of
     not more than 5 seconds.                                      :f,

     1 6 7 . The system should be capable of maintaining the necessary

1%   1 6 8 . The emergency lighting should operate automatically on the
     failure of the main lighting.

                                   from the local fire authority on the
     type, the amount and siting of fire-fighting equipment. The
     succeeding paragraphs give general guidelines.

1 7 1 . In major grounds it may be necessary to provide a suitable
w ater supply for fire fighting in the form of hydrants.

1 7 2 . For "first aid" fire fighting by members of the staff, hydraulic
hose-reels should be provided to BS 5306: Part 1. These should be
sufficient to provide adequate protection to the whole floor area,
and should be installed in a suitable position by entrances, exits
a riff stairways.'

1 7 3 . W here hose-reels are not provided, portable fire extinguishers
should be installed in sufficient numbers to give adequate cover.
The number and type will depend upon the size, layout, fire
separation and risk in each structure. Fire extinguishers should
conform to BS 5 4 2 3 and be sited and maintained according to
BS 5306: Part 3.

1 7 4 . Fire blankets and fire extinguishers of a type appropriate to
the cooking facilities used should be kept in all catering facilities.

1 7 5 . It should be borne in mind w hen considering location of fire­
fighting equipment that it may need to be sited so that it cannot be
vandalised but yet is readily accessible to staff in the event of fire.



E m e r g e n c y p r o c e d u r e s a n d s t a f f t r a in in g
17 )6 . It is essential that plans should be made for dealing with
emergencies, including fire. The onus to do this lies with ground
management. Joint consultation between management, police,
fire, ambulance and other emergency services should take place in
order to produce agreed plans of action for all foreseeable types of
emergency. W h ile the public are in the ground the number of staff
on duty should be sufficient to cover entrances, exits and other
strategic points and to fulfil other essential duties (see Chapter 13).

1 7 7 . All such staff should be trained in the use of the fire-fighting
equipment provided, and in the action they should take in the
e\/§nt of fire. This is managem ent's responsibility but the local fire
authority's advice should be sought on w hether the content of the
proposed training programme is adequate.


                                          50
M eans of esca p e
1 7 8 . "M ean s of escape" is the structural means whereby a safe
route is provided for people to travel from any point in a structure
to a place of safety without outside assistance. In a sports ground,
the means of escape in the event of an emergency will usually be
the same as the normal egress routes plus any additional "route"
of forward escape on to the playing area. The kind of emergency
most likely to occur at a sports ground is fire but other types of
emergency, such as bomb threat, may arise which might
necessitate the evacuation of spectators from all or part of the
spectator accommodation It is the management's responsibility to
ensure that all exit routes for use in an emergency are capable of
being safely and effectively used at all times when the ground
is occupied.
                                                                           iT it
1 7 9 . It is vital that the emergency exit routes are sited s>& that
people using them will be least affected by the fire or its products,
for example smoke, toxic gases, heat etc. Initial travel should if
possible be downwards. This is because in the event of fire, its
dangerous products will travel upwards and accumulate densely at
the highest points. Further stages of the exit routes should be so
arranged as to take people progressively further away frohi the
fire, along a route w here they cannot be significantly affected by
the fire or its products. There should be more than one emergency
exit route from a stand or a terrace in case one becomes blocked.
The emergency exits w ithin any one structure should be as widely
separated as practical planning considerations will allow, to
minimise the risk of them all being blocked by the same caus&!

F ir e p r o t e c t i o n f o r s t a i r w a y s a n d p a s s a g e s
1 8 0 . W h e re a stairway, passage or any other part of an
emergency exit route passes up, down or through a stand or other
building used by spectators, it should be in a fire resistant
enclosure separated from the remainder of the stand by a
structure having fire resistance of not less than one hour;* Such
exit routes should discharge to a place of safety in the open air
(which may be inside or outside the ground)

1 8 1 . The surface finish of walls and ceilings of all emergency exit


                                                     51
stairways should be of a standard corresponding to Class 0 (as
defined in the guidance issued in connection with the Building
Regulations 1 9 8 5 for England and W ales and the Building
Standards (Scotland) Regulations 1 9 8 1 -8 4 ).

1 8 2 . Any door forming part of the enclosure to a stairway should
be self closing and have a fire resistance of not less than half an hour.


E m e r g e n c y e v a c u a tio n tim e
183,.jThe emergency evacuation time is the notional time it would
take spectators to leave their viewing positions and reach a place of
safety in the open air or a protected stairway or emergency exit
route w ith fire resistance in accordance w ith paragraph 180. It is
calculated from the spectator capacity of the accommodation (see
Chapter 16) and the flow rate (see Chapter 17) through restricting
parts of the exit system used for evacuation purposes.

1 8 4 . The emergency evacuation time should not be confused with
the egress time of 8 minutes (referred to in Chapter 6, paragraph 56)
which is the maximum tim e it should take spectators to enter into
the normal exit system from their viewing positions at the end
of play.

1 8 5 . The emergency evacuation time will depend largely on the
fire hazard present in the accommodation in question. Any stand
which has a potential for rapid fire spread because of its interior
use and contents a n d /o r the nature of its internal surfaces which
would be exposed to fire should have an emergency evacuation
time of no more than 2 ’/2 minutes. An increase in this time may
however be acceptable w here the interior use and contents, and
the nature of the internal linings, are such as to elim inate the
possibility of rapid fire spread, and the emergency exit routes are
not vulnerable to a fire occurring within the accommodation. In
setting an emergency evacuation time longer than 2'/2 minutes the
advice of the fire authority should be sought.

1 8 6 . W here the playing area or perimeter track is accessible to
spectators and is considered suitable as a place of safety,
evacuation onto it can be taken into account in calculating the

1 9 2 . Precise requirements for communications will depend on the
sorttQif ground and the numbers of people that attend there. In
general the communications system should be determined after
consultation with the police and emergency services. It should be
available for use and capable of coping w ith all emergencies.

1 9 3 . A central control point, preferably a room, should be set
aside for the use of the supervising police officer and the ground
safety officer.


1 9 4 . A t larger grounds the following arrangements are likely to
be needed:

        i.      There should be inter-communication between the
                central control and all turnstiles or banks of turnstiles
                and all entry and exit gates used by the public.

        ii.     M etering systems to record all admissions should be
                installed at turnstiles and, to ensure that ground
v               capacities are not exceeded in any section, arrange­
                ments should be made for central control to be
                informed immediately a predetermined number of
                spectators has been admitted through each turnstile.

        iii.    Public address equipment should be installed so that
                broadcast messages can be heard under reasonable
                conditions (including emergencies) by all persons of
                normal hearing in any part of the ground to which the
                public has access. The system should be capable of
                being controlled from the central control point and
                should ideally be capable of addressing messages to
                each major section of the ground. The power supply to
                the system should be such as to enable it to continue


                                       54
to operate in an emergency such as fire or a failure of
the mains supply.

Loud hailers should be available for the use of
stewards and police in directing or instructing
spectators.

Any police radio facilities available for the maintenance
of law and order should augment and not supersede
the ground communications system.                 v^y

Installation of closed circuit television is considered
likely to be of significant value in assisting emergency
evacuation.

1 9 5 ' M anning levels and stewarding requirements will vary
depending upon the size and configuration of the ground, the
nature of the event and crowd levels, but there are five basic
duties which stewards are called upon to carry out. These are:
       'y
            a.   controlling or directing members of the public w ho are
                 entering or leaving the ground, to help achieve an even
                 flow of people to the viewing areas and safe dispersal
                 of spectators on the terraces or viewing slopes.

            b.   patrolling the ground to deal with any emergencies eg
                 raising alarms or extinguishing fires;

            c.   manning entrances, exits and other strategic points,
                 especially exit doors and gates which are not
                 continuously open w hilst the ground is in use;

   !        d.   assisting police as appropriate or as requested with
                 crowd control; and

            e.    undertaking specific duties in an emergency.

 1 9 6 A more detailed check list of the kind of duties which
 stewards are liable to undertake is at Annex B. It should be borne
 in mind that this is only an example and not necessarily an
 exhaustive list of duties.

1 9 7 . Stewards should be fully capable of carrying out the duties
allocated to them. Every steward should be fully appraised in
writing of his duties and responsibilities and should carry on him a
general check list of them. W here a ground such as one used by
an association football league club has a high police presence,

2 0 2 y A lth o u g h the problem of crowd disorder at sporting events is
one which affects primarily professional association football, other
sports, are not immune from it. Therefore, whilst the following
advice, is directed mainly at those grounds w here professional
association football is played, the general principles should also be
borne; in mind by management at other grounds where major
spectator sports are played.

2 0 3 i The 'European Convention on Spectator Violence and M is ­
behaviour at Sporting Events and in particular at Football Matches'
(HMjSQ, Cmnd 9649), which came into force on 1 November 1985,
sets out in general terms the measures to be taken to prevent and
control violence by spectators. Additionally, some sports' governing
bodies have issued their own guidance on crowd control. For
example, the Football Association has issued a "Memorandum to
Football League Clubs On Crowd M anagem ent' which sets out the
measures that must be taken at all League grounds, and UEFA has
issued binding instructions in their document 'Order and Security
in the Stadia' (Third Edition, 1985) which apply to matches in their
competitions. The following paragraphs cover some of the main
areas that require the attention of ground management. The
advice they contain is not comprehensive and is intended to
supplement rather than replace existing instructions, codes of
practice etc.

 P o lic in g
 2 0 4 . As in other areas of safety, managem ent is responsible for
 the crowd control arrangements and ground conditions. They
 should ensure that spectators are safe bearing in mind that a game



                                           58
can lead to a build-up of tension or excitement. The safety
measures described elsewhere in this Guide will help to achieve
reasonable spectator safety, but for management to discharge its
responsibility properly a special police presence inside the ground
may be necessary to deal with any problem of disorder which may
arise, as w ell as to provide support and leadership in an emergency.
The number and disposition of the police must be determined by
Chief Constables who have the sole responsibility for the diFefction
of police operations. To aid the police in their duties, a police control
room should be provided within the ground.

2 0 5 . Proper advance planning w ith the police is essential to
counter potential crowd disorder. There must be an effective
liaison between club and police for this purpose to including not
just the arrangements inside the ground but also the escort of
visiting supporters, their likely numbers, their separate entry to the
ground and their departure at the end of the match. There should
be debriefing meetings as necessary to evaluate existing
arrangements and provide the flexibility necessary to deaj^with
different circumstances.

Crow d m ovem ent                                             111 -
2 0 6 . Crowd movement on terraces should be strictly contf&lted in
order to give the police the fullest opportunity for crowd Control.
Less problems occur w hen terraces are subdivided as far as
possible into sections by use of both radial and lateral barriers or
railings which should comply with the strength requirements set
out in Chapter 9. Each section should ideally be self contained and
should be serviced by its own entrance/exits, refreshment facilities
and toilets (in keeping with the principles of general ground
division described in Chapter 8, paragraph 101). Special care is
needed to ensure that sections and subdivisions are provided with
sufficient exits for use in an emergency.

2 0 7 . Home and visiting supporters at professional soccer matches
should normally be segregated but segregation is not advocated
for other sports w here crowd disorder is not a problem. This
should be borne in mind when considering barriers at grounds
used for other sports as welt as association football.
2 0 8 . W h ere possible a neutral or sterile zone should be provided
within a ground so that home and visiting supporters are not
physically close to each other. The arrangements for admitting
spectators into the ground, w h e th e r by tickets purchased in
advance or through payment at the turnstiles, should be drawn up
in consultation w ith the police, and must be carefully controlled to
ensure as far as possible that segregation is effective and known
troublemakers are excluded.

   \l ■!•;



209.,-Access to the pitch must be made as difficult as possible in
normal circumstances w hile at the same time ensuring that the
police have effective access to the terraces for the purpose of crowd
control and enabling the pitch to be used (where appropriate) in the
event of serious emergency (see also Chapter 11, paragraph 186).
W h ere a pitch perimeter barrier fence is installed to keep spectators
off the pitch, care is needed to ensure that it does not impair the
visibility of the playing area from the terraces. If spikes or barbed
wir;e are installed they should if possible be at a height of no less
than 2.4 metres (see Chapter 3, paragraph 33). One alternative to
fencing is the construction around the pitch of a wall w ith a smooth
 surface which should not be less than 1.22 metres in height on the
 terrace side. This boundary wall should have gates or access points
 to the pitch which could be manned by the police or stewards. A
 w alkway between the boundary wall and the terraces, which would
 be solely occupied by the police, first aid and official club personnel,
 has been found to be effective as regards safety and security. In
 order to achieve this it might be necessary to remove one or two
 rows of terracing and to protect the w alkw ay from the terrace by a
 continuous line of barriers, so designed as to discourage access to
 the walkway except at authorised points. The access points from
 terrace to walkway should be directly linked with the access points
 from the w alkw ay to the pitch. W h ere a w alkw ay system is in use,
 sliding gates may be installed at the access points from the
 w alkw ay to the pitch, ie w here there can be no crowd pressure
 against them (see Chapter 6, paragraph 6 5 regarding the use of
 sliding gates elsewhere). A barrier to the pitch is usually
 unnecessary w here seating extends to the level of the playing area.

D etention and rem oval o f trouble m akers
210.  At larger soccer grounds, particularly where there has been
a record of frequent crowd trouble, secure detention rooms may be
necessary for use by the police.


211.   There should be adequate vehicular access for the
unobtrusive removal of detainees (see also Chapter 11, paragraphs
189 -1 91 on access for emergency vehicles).

Refreshm ents
2 1 2 . Hard containers such as glasses, bottles or cans can make
dangerous missiles and should not be used for the sale of refresh­
ments. All refreshments should be served in soft containers.

2 1 3 . Alcohol should not be on sale for consumption On the
terraces or in the stands.

Note: The Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol etc) Act 198 5
applies to any ground in England and W ales used for an inter­
national association football match or a match involving a football
league club. In Scotland the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act .1 9 8 0
applies to grounds used by clubs in the Scottish Football League,
Highland League and to the international stadia used for
association football and Rugby Union.

214.   The type, strength and height of a pitch perimeter fence or
wall will vary according to its location and required function. At one
extreme, at a certain type of ground or small stadium used by very
fe w spectators, there may be no need for a perimeter fence or wall
at all; or if such a wall or fence exists it may need to consist of little
more than a rail to mark the playing area. At the other extreme, at
some major soccer stadia, w here restriction on crowd movement
forms a necessary part of the safety measures, it may be necessary
to have a fence which prevents access to the pitch in normal
circumstances (see also Chapter 14, paragraph 2 09 ) but allows for
acpess in emergency. Even at these grounds however specification
of the pitch fence may vary for different parts of the ground.

 2 1 5 . For most major stadia, whether used for association football
 or other sports, the pitch perimeter fence will be required either to
 prevent access to the pitch as mentioned above, or at least to
 discourage attempts by spectators to enter the playing area. Gates
 or other access points (minimum width 1.1 metres) should
 nonetheless be provided for use in an emergency and, at those
 grounds w here a perimeter track is used as part of the exit system,
 for the departure of spectators at the end of an event. Provision of
 such gates or access points is particularly important to allow full
 access to the playing area (or track) where it is likely to be used as a
 place of safety in an emergency. Such gates or access points should
 be properly stewarded and clearly marked so that immediate access
 to the playing area or perimeter track can be ensured.


 2 1 6 . If spectators can lean on the perimeter fence it should be
 deemed a crush barrier and fulfil the conditions of height and


                                         62
strength specified in Chapter 9 although if the fence is of solid
construction its height may be more than 1.12 metres. This is
because the pressures acting on a person forced against such a
fence are distributed over a large area of the body, unlike the
situation with a normal crush barrier, where the pressures
are localized.

    GROUND CAPACITY

217.  The previous sections of the Guide give guidelines and
safety considerations for individual features of a ground. This
section suggests a method of calculating the number of people
that can be safely accommodated w h en taking into account
interactions between these individual features and w here there
are deviations from the guidelines. The following paragraphs
contain as of necessity generalised guidelines in view of the wide
variety of types, sizes, configurations of sports grounds, their use
and general condition.


2 1 8 . To facilitate the calculations a plan of the ground should be
available with such details as exits, stands, terraces, stairways,
passages, kiosks, seats and barriers. A scale of 1:200 is
appropriate for this purpose.


 219.    The method assesses:

         a.    the holding capacity of a terrace or viewing slope (that
               of a seated area generally being determined by the
               number of seats w hen it conforms to guidelines); and

         b.     the capacity of a given exit route from a terrace or stand.


 2 2 0 . The number of people that can be safely accommodated on a
 terrace or in a stand (or other covered accommodation) is either its
 holding capacity, or the capacity of the exit system to be used in
 normal circumstances at the end of an event (assessed in
 accordance with paragraphs 2 2 9 -2 3 2 below) or the emergency
 exit system whichever is the smallest.

T erra ces a n d v ie w in g s lo p e s
2 2 1 . W h ere crush barriers meet the strength and spacing guide­
lines of Chapter 9 the capacity of a terrace or viewing slope should
be assessed from the area available for standing by allowing a
packing density of between 5 4 and 2 7 persons per 10 square
metres depending upon the condition of the terrace or slope. Only
those parts of the terrace or viewing slope from which the whole
of the playing area can be seen, excluding gangways, should be
included in this calculation.


2 2 2 . The extreme allowances for packing density are as follows:

       a.   5 4 persons per 10 square metres w hen the terrace or
            viewing slope is in good condition (as set out in Chapter 8);
            and

       b.   2 7 persons per 10 square metres w hen it materially
            deviates from the recommended guidelines, so as to
            constitute a possible hazard to individuals closely p ^ k e d .
                                                                   ■.ttU
2 2 3 . It may be necessary to interpolate between these figures
w h ere conditions fall between the two extremes. W h en the
positioning and length of gangways do not m eet with the
recommendations of Chapter 8, paragraphs 9 6 -1 0 0 , an appropri­
ate reduction should be made in the area available for standing.


2 2 4 . Even distribution of spectators on the terrace may be difficult
to overcome notwithstanding the measures in this guide because
spectators may prefer to gather in a certain part or parts of a
terrace. Ground managem ent should therefore take such factors
into account w hen assessing safe capacity levels.

2 2 5 . The capacity of the terrace is calculated by multiplying the
area available for standing by the appropriate packing density. The
following formula may be used:

       Capacity (Number of persons) _A_ x (27 to 54)
                                          10
w here 'A' is the area available for standing in square metres.

Example A

the terrace.

   h   .-          1Q


226.  W hen the strength of crush barriers conforms with the
guidelines but the spacing of such barriers does not, the capacity
is calculated from the provision of crush barriers in the area
available for standing (as defined in paragraph 221) as follows:

         a.     W h ere a terrace contains either "peak viewing areas
              only or "other viewing areas” by multiplying the total
     n        length of the crush barriers by the appropriate distance
              between barriers (as given in Chapter 9, paragraphs
              1 1 6 -1 1 7 ) or the existing distance, whichever is less,
              and multiplying by the appropriate packing density.

 Example B

 Barriers and pitch perimeter wall comply with greater strength
 requirements (see Chapter 9, paragraph 119, Table 2) but not the
 spacing requirements of the Guide.

       b.   W h ere a terrace contains both "peak viewing areas"
            and "other viewing areas", by multiplying the total
            length of barriers by the appropriate distance between
            barriers in a "peak viewing area" or the existing
            distance, whichever is less, and multiplying them by the
            appropriate packing density.

Calculations as in Example B.




227.  Crush barriers which do not meet the guidelines on the
strength set out in Chapter 9 should in general be discounted for
calculation purposes, although w here crush barriers are well
constructed consideration may be given to allowing a lower
packing density figure for the purpose of the calculation.

228.   Note: In small grounds attracting fe w spectators and low
density crowds, and w here a terrace contains no crush barriers or
w h ere most or all of those installed have to be discounted for
calculation purposes the restrictions on the crowd capacity may be
unrealistic. A more flexible approach may be appropriate taking
account of the recommendations of the Guide to assess the
terrace holding capacity. In such cases the permissible packing
density is however likely to be much lower than the 2 7 persons
 per 10 square metres referred to in paragraph 2 2 2 and the overall
 terrace capacity will be severely limited.

    2 2 9 . General considerations to be taken into account w hen
    assessing the adequacy of exit systems are set out in Chapter 6.

    2 3 0 . The capacity of an exit system can be calculated by
    assessing for each elem ent in the system (ie each gangway,
    doorway, stairway, exit etc) the number of persons who can pass
    in 8 minutes (ie egress time, see Chapter 6, paragraph 56) or, the
    emergency evacuation time appropriate to the accommodation
^   (see Chapter 11, paragraphs 1 8 3 -1 8 5 ), whichever is the shorter
    time. This calculation is made by multiplying the width of the
    elem ent by the appropriate flow rate in Chapter 17.

    2 3 1 . W h ere an elem ent in the exit system is less than 1 metre
    wide that element should be omitted from the calculation.     twc

    2 3 2 . Flow restricting elements of the kind described in Chapter 6
    should be ignored for the purpose of these calculations.       c<

17. RECOMMENDED FLOW RATES

2 3 3 . From stands and stairways a flow rate of 4 0 persons per
minute per unit of exit width (ie 5 5 0 mm) should be used.

2 3 4 . From terraces (including covered terraces) and the ground
generally a flow rate of 6 0 persons per minute per unit of exit
width should be used.

1.   All stewards should be capable of carrying out their duties
and should be properly trained to do so (see Chapter 13).

2.    Stewards must be informed in writing of all that they are
expected to know and do. The following list gives examples of
typical tasks and duties which stewards should be expected to
carry out and for which they should be prepared. Stewards should:

     ,(*;      Prevent overcrowding by ensuring the crowd limits in
               various parts of the ground are complied with.

       ii.     Prevent spectators, as far as possible, from climbing
               fences and other structures eg floodlight pylons, and
               from standing on seats. W here by virtue of the scale of
               the incident stewards are unable to prevent this, they
               should immediately report the matter to the nearest
               police officer or, if no police officer is present, to the
               chief steward or the safety officer.

       iii.    Ensure that gangways and exits are kept clear.

       iv.     Identify and investigate any incident or occurrence
               among spectators, reporting their findings to the police
               or to management.

      y.       Know the location of and be able to operate effectively
               the fire-firefighting equipment at the ground.

      ,vi.     Know the location of the first aid room and any first
               aid equipment kept elsewhere.
      S.<..
       vii.    Be fully conversant with any methods or signals used
               to alert staff that an emergency has arisen.

       viii.   Be capable of recognising potential fire hazards and
               suspect packages, reporting such findings immediately
               to the nearest police officer or, if no police officer is in
               the immediate vicinity, the chief steward or the safety

Annex C
TESTING OF CRUSH BARRIERS AND HANDRAILS

1.       For crush barriers the test is to consist of the application of
an     evenly distributed force of either 6 .0 K N /m e tre width
(4 0 0 lbs f/fo o t width) or 4 .3 K N /m etre width (29 0 lbs f/fo o t width)
of barrier as mentioned in Chapter 9.

2.    For handrails the test is to consist of the application of an
evenly distributed force of either 4.3 K N /m e tre width (2 9 0 lbs f /
foot width) or 2 .7 4 K N /m e tre width (18 8 lbs f/fo o t width) of
handrail as mentioned in Chapter 9.

3.     The force is to be in the form of a static load acting on the
top rail of the barrier or handrail at right angles to the longitudinal
axis and applied in about ten equal increments.

4.    The force to be applied for three consecutive periods, the full
force being maintained for 5 minutes each period. The interval
between applications to be as short as possible, ie to enable
complete unloading and reloading only. A record should be kept of
any deformation during the loading periods, during the periods of
maintained loading, or during the recovery period.

5.    If on the removal of the force for the third time the recovery
of deformation is at least 75% the barrier or handrail may be
deemed to have satisfied the loading requirements.

If this requirement is not met but the recovery is more than 50%
then the test should be repeated and if on retest the recovery is at
least 75% the barrier or handrail may be deemed to have satisfied
the loading requirements.

If the recovery is less than 50% on the first test or less than 75%
on the retest, the barrier or handrail shall be deemed to have
failed to meet the loading requirements.




                                  74
6.     If during any test, even though the barrier or handrail
satisfies the above loading requirements, doubt should arise for
any reason (including such matters as cracking of the terracing or
distortion of connections) as to the safety of the barrier or handrail,
a detailed investigation should be carried out. Unless the results of
this investigation remove the doubt as to the safety of the barrier
or handrail, the barrier or handrail, as the case may be, should be
deemed to have failed the test.

7.    A record should be kept of all the barriers and handrails
tested and of their performances during the tests.

           Briefing
    1.11   Officers should receive a full briefing prior to taking up their
           H n f t p c                                                    2 r* r+ z *1 ^ c r r c i * ^   C   -a H d      — 2 •’*■

           should be carried out on site. In large scale police operations
           the operational commander should brief all officers not below the
           rank of Inspector, and Inspectors should be responsible for
           briefing officers of the rank of Sergeant and Constable.
    1.12   In accordance with the 'Popplewel1' recommendations the briefing
            must include evacuation procedures and the duties and
            responsibilities of stewards should be brought to the attention
            of police officers (see Duties of Stewards - paragraph 3.1 et.
            seq.).
    1.13   Briefing cards may prove advantageous, particularly when officers
            are unfamiliar with the routines of policing football. Where
            officers are unfamiliar they should be provided with a map of the
            ground and ixs "liiiirieuia'ce environs iGen'dtying ncnie' ano away
            sections of the ground and the numbers or letters used by the
            club, so that they can answer questions for supporters.
    1.14   Briefing should pay particular attention to policy and practice
            as to searching, arrest and ejection and officers must know where
            to take prisoners.     Intelligence as to likely offenders and
            common practices of disturbance should be carefully outlined.
            Supervisors in particular need to know the ground commanders
            'public order strategy'.

    1.16   Ground regulations, which have national application, should be
            brought to notice as follows:-

        reasonably be construed as constituti ng a source ot
        danger, nuisance or annoyance to other spectators.
Away Supporters
Intelligence officers should provide clear instructions to coach
operators as to routes and parking facilities. Car and coach
parks should be clearly signed and a police presence maintained
toensure security and prevent interference.       The presence of
police at such locations may also enable the early gathering of
intelligence on the numbers and behaviour of visiting supporters.
It may be prudent for police to escort supporters from coach
parks to the sports stadium in order to ensure that they do not
become the subject of, nor engage in, hooliganism. Similarly,
railway stations snould be monitored oy police and supporters
escorted to the stadium where the match is to be played. Close
liaison with British Transport Police is recommended. Most fans
are familiar with escort arrangements and where possible police
should stick to routines which become familiar.
After a match coaches leaving the area may require a police
escort until they are away from trouble.
Flashpoints
Special attention should be aiven to *ny public house or other
unofficial assembly point, anc to the routes taken in general by
supporters where confrontation between rival fans may occur.
Also attention should be given to waste ground and derelict
property along any such routes where missiles or offensive
weapons may be gathered by hooligans. Bridges have often been
used by hooligans and should be monitored.
Stadium Searches
          s
Before spectators are admitted into the stadium a physical_ search
should be made of the ground and terraces by the officer in
charge of policing the game to ensure that all fences and gates
are sufficiently secure and that no objects which may be used as
offensive weapons or missiles are to hand. There should be an
arrangement with the club for an official to be available when
the inspection is carried out to put right anything which is
amiss.
Entry Into the Ground
Approaches to the ground are themselves flashpoints and need to
be well monitored. Careful planning to co-ordinate as far as
possible the routes taken by different groups of supporters to
relevant turnstiles may reduce the opportunity of conflict.
Clear marking of turnstiles is essential and all officers on
footDall duties should be briefed as to the segregation
arrangements.

only where there are grounds to suspect an offence is being
committed, and the suspicion must relate directly to the person
searched. The Codes of Practice, however, exempt the need to
make customary records if in the circumstances it is not
practicable to do so. Ground regulations reserve the right of
the club to decline admission to any person who refuses to be
searched by a police officer, and this may allow for routine
searching on entry to grounds, but police officers need to know
the limits of this provision. Refusal to be searched may entail
a refusal to allow entry.
Within the limitations officers should seek to prevent supporters
entering the ground with weapons, missiles, flag poles etc.
Drunkenness is reccgnisec as a major cause of hooliganism ana
supporters may attempt to enter sports grounds whilst in a
drunken condition or carrying alcohol. Where the conditions of
the Sporting Events1 (Control of Alcohol Etc.) Act, 1985, apply
the provisions should be enforced. The main conditions are as
follows:-
(a)      Section 2(1a) and (lb) - It is an offence for any

         (ii) is of a kind which, when empty, is normally
              discarded, or returned to, or left to be recovered
              by, the supplier, or
(b)      part of an article falling within (a) above.
It does not apply to anything that is for holding any medicinal
product (Medicines' Act, 1968).

                                  (1)                 involved the use of threat of violence
                                                       by the accused to another person;
                                  (2)                 involved the use of threat of violence

              sentence, probation order or discharge, following
              conviction, i.e. it does not apply to person brought
              before the court to be bound over under Section 115,
              Magistrates' Court Act, 1980.
              If these conditions are satisfied, the court may make an
              order "prohibiting him from entering any premises for the
              purpose of attending any prescribed football match,
              there."
A crucial factor in the enforcement of orders is the availability
of photographs of those subject to them. Section 35 of the Act,
makes provision for the court, on application of the prosecution,
toorder a photograph to be taken.        However, where possible,
persons arrested for any offence which might result in the
imposition of an order should be photographed at the time of
charging. Photographs taker, at this time are likely to be of
m r s- vslise fcr subsequent identification purposes than those
taken at or following a court appearance.

Circulation of information relating to Exclusion Orders is
incorporated into the football match intelligence system.
Footoall Liaison Officers will maintain scneaules, togetner witn
photographs of those subject to orders who are known to support
their club. Prior to each match, complete schedules should be
forwarced to tne away team liaison officer. Scneaules should oe
returned after each match, together with the completed football
match summary form.
These schedules and photographs will be of particular importance
to those officers operating C.C.T.Y. equipment. When scanning
crowds during the course of the game or when viewing videos of
disorder after the event, operators will be able to check the
crowd against the photographs.
Where weight of numbers of those subject to orders makes the
supplying of full schedules impracticable, circulation should be
restricted to targetted hard core offenders.
Liaison officers will need to maintain several schedules of
orders to cater for midweek games, late returns, etc.,
Where an individual first came to notice after 31.12.80, as
indicated by his C.R.O. number, suffix information relating to
exclusion orders will be maintained on the P.N.C. within the

In certain circumstances, offences which might lead to the
imposition of exclusion orders are not reportable to the N.I.B.

Entrance to the Ground
1.40      Stadium entrances must be signed to indicate clearly the stands
          and terraces to be used by home and visiting supporters.
1.41      Officers with local knowledge should be posted to turnstiles to
          prevent supporters entering a section of the stadium allocated to
          supporters of the opposing team. When possible, the same
          officers should be regularly used at locations considered to-be
          of particular importance, e.g. main entrance, points of potential
          trouble etc.

         frustration at turnstiles if aueues remain after the game has
         started. OrderTy control will minimise the risks.
].44      All ticket matches also need turnstile control as supporters in
          possession of tickets for a particular section cf the ground may
          seek to gain entry to another section of the ground, which could
          result in some sections of the ground exceeding the limit
          specified in the safety certificate. Where limits are critical
          police should make arrangements to monitor turnstile counts.
1.45     High interest ‘all ticket1 fixtures have the effect of generating
         a black market in tickets and touting1. This will likely
         undermine .segregation. It is therefore recommended that some
         section of the ground be set apart to accommodate identified fans
         who support one side and have tickets for opposing(supporters1
         area.    If circumstances warrant it ‘ticket touts1 should be
         arrested, and efforts made to discover where the tickets came
         from. For all ticket games every effort must be made to tighten
         up the sales procedure to assist segregation policy, preferably
         by restricting sale of tickets to those attending home fixtures
         and selling tickets within the ‘home’ enclosures.
          Team Managers, Referees and Linesmen
1.46      All officials concerned in controlling the game should be aware
          of the police action that will be taken if there is any invasion
          of the playing pitch, or serious disorder occurring within the
          crowd. All officials concerned in controlling the game should be
          aware of any planned emergency procedure that may be taken in the
          event of an emergency or bomb threat.
 The conduct of players on the field can have a marked impact on
■crowd behaviour.    Particularly where the fixture is judged
 volatile the club should be encouraged to arrange for players to
 leave the tunnel together and to shake hands at the end of the

take up with the club any misbehaviour by players.
Entertainment
The club should be encouraged to provide some form of
entertainment to take place during the half hour preceding kick
off, for example bands, displays and recorded music. A good
'announcer' using the public address system can establish a
rapport with the crowd and influence behaviour. Thought should
be given to liaising with 'announcers! to make suitable
interventions if appropriate. This means may be used to advise
'away' supporters as to arrangements for their leaving the
ground, changed travel instructions etc.
Crowd Distributions
It is emphasised that stewards should ensure that all sections of
terraces ana stanas are fillea to capacity before allowing access
to further sections where possible. This will require monitoring
turnstile totalisers and the use of public address systems in
some instances.    This operation is greatly assisted by the
compartmentalisation of grounds, each compartment being filled in
seouence.
Segregation
Home and visiting supporters should be segregated inside the
stadium by means of segregation fencing and/or sterile zones, and
steps should be taken to impose segregation before they enter and
after they leave the stadium.       Each section of the stadium
designated for the use of particular supporters should have its
own toilet and refreshment facilities. Barriers and doors should
be provided so as to segregate home and visiting supporters and
thus avoid confrontation at entrances/exits.       Experience has
shown that, policing segregated areas is best achieved by placing
officers 'inside' the segregation if this is possible.
Stewards
Good liaison between stewards and police should be established.
(See Duties of Stewards - paragraph 14.1 et. seq.) The officer
in charge of the match should make periodic inspections of
stewarding standards and report results to the club's management.
The police control must be able to contact the Chief Steward and
Head Fire Steward at all times.
Disposition of Manpower
Where no pitch perimeter fence exists a presence may be required
by police and stewards in order to isolate the playing area. In
such circumstances police officers should take up standing
positions away from and facing the crowd when incidents occur to
   arouse the crowd. Where fencing has been erected police officers
   ana stewards must have keys for the gates and a universal locking
   system should be used.     Pitch perimeter gates should remain
   unlocked and manned at all times the public have access to the
   ;~ v —




   All bars, refreshment and toilet areas should be policed in order
   to prevent hooliganism occurring.
   At the conclusion of the match consideration should also be given
   to deploying police in appropriate areas to minimise a sudden
   stampede or pushing within the crowd in their endeavour to leave
   the stadium quickly.
   Police Reserves
   A number of police officers should generally be held in reserve
   in order to deal with spontaneous incidents occurring inside, or
   immediately outside the stadium.
~— i^rsons Arrested or Ejected Froca the Ground
  Ejection is an option which can be used where behaviour is Door,
  but falls short of an actual offence (e.g. contravention of
  ground regulations). However, ejection should not be used as an
  alternative to arrest; where there is sufficient evidence the
  offender should be arrested and charged.
  It is recommended, where possible, that in violent situations
  police officers' in groups should enter the affected section of
  the stadium from above the incident, making arrests where
  necessarv, and then makino their way onto the perimeter of the
  pitch. Officers should net enter from the perimeter if this can
  be avoided. Arrest operations should be planned and controlled
  to avoid officers being isolated or overwhelmed.
  A standard procedure should be adopted with regard to arrests and
  ejections.   Prisoners ^should be taken to a forward reception
  point where details are recorded (including ejections), and
  prisoners photographed together with arresting officer.
  Persons ejected from the ground or supporters who are not
  admitted for whatever reason should- be carefully policed.
  Experience indicates that such persons often gain further entry
  to the ground either at half, time or immediately before the end
  of the match, and provoke confrontation.
  In the event of a football match generating a large number of
  arrests, it is worth considering bailing prisoners to special
  courts in order that Magistrates may be fully aware of ail the
  circumstances appertaining to the events of that game. Early
  liaison with the Crown. Prosecution Service is advisable to inform
  them of the intention to hold special courts, in order that they
  can be fully acquainted with the background facts.
Contingency Planning
Pre-deternrined plans should be available to control such
contingencies as serious disorder, pitch Incursion and locked out
spectators • ceouuse ct tne or t ci vercencc *a ^rwLuG ghu crcv*G
fsc^c^s these n1s.ns niust be crourc sDeciric* However, these
plans must take into consideration             the   !Popple'wel1‘
recommendations with regard to the transmission of coded messages
over the public address system, the availability of emergency
telephones and a facility for the police to intercept the public
address system.
Emergency Evacuation
Stewards must be familiar with the action to be taken in the
event o f sn evacuation of th° whole or part of the stadium.
Police should assist in the rapid evacuation of a stadium in such
circumstances. Stadia should have a universal locking system and
all stewards should be in possession of keys for the exit gates.
They should wear a distinctive tabard or other means of easy
identification.     It must be made clear to both tne cluo
management and to the individual stewards that they must not
leave their cost without being relieved. It is essential that
exit gates can be opened without delay in the event of an
emergency.    Simulated emergency evacuation exercises for the
staff employed by the club must be held at least twice each
season to test the emergency evacuation procedure. The crowd
will not be involved but depending upon circumstances it could be
an adYantaoe to ex^lai" to the crowd that an enieroency evacuation
exercise is taking place. Experience has revealed that in an
actual evacuation it is essential to monitor exit doors when the
the stadium before tne reason for the evacuation has been
completed.
Retention of Visiting Supporters
In some circunistancss the officer in charge may decide to hold
the visiting supporters in the ground until he considers it
appropriate to release them. If such a tactic is employed then
the situation will be greatly eased if the visiting fans are kept
informed.
Early Re-Deployment of Police Officers
Police officers should be deployed outside the ground, in key
positions, early enough to be seen in these positions by the
crowd as it leaves the ground. This gives an appearance of good
order and police control. At critical points the use of police
officers in groups under the command of a sergeant should be
considered.    The effective after-match deployment of police
officers is dependent on the pre-match briefing and allocation of
tasks.
Vehicular and Pedestrian Traffic
At the end of the game early dispersal of supporters is clearly
beneficial. Most Police Forces will develop a traffic control
plan to facilitate this. Particular attention should be given to
routes used by 'away! supporters. Supporters who are net local
must always be able to find coaches where they got off them and
generally it is good practice to convoy and escort coaches away
from the general area. Many grounds are in heavily built-up
areas cf old industrial towns and it is extremely difficult to
move police resources in "cne irnmeoia'ce aftennatn - i t is
therefore essential to detail traffic and public order duties
beforehand.
Bus, Railway and Main Line Stations
Foot patrol and mounted officers (in liaison with British
Transport Police) should be used to control queues and prevent
rowdyism occurring. Large groups of supporters should generally
be escorted on to the station and, where necessary, British
Transport Police may wish to consider travelling with supporters
until they are dispersed.
De-Briefing of Senior Officers
In the event of inadequacies being exposed in tne police
operation, at the conclusion of the match there should be a
de-briefing of supervisory officers.

Since Force liaison officers were appointed for each club in the
football league in 1975, the procedure for gathering and
communicating intelligence about the numbers of visiting
supporters travelling by coach and rail has been developed and
refined. In the light of experience the following procedures are
recommended to improve the quality and reliability of this
intelligence:-
Action to be Taken fay Horae Liaison Officers
At least 21 days before the match the home team Force liaison
officer should correspond with his opposite number for the

(a)          Suggested routes for supporters travelling by road.
(b)          Off street parking facilities that will be available for
             coaches/cars near to the stadium.
(c)          Areas suitable for street parking near to the stadium.
(d)          Location of railway station and distance from the ground,
             also arrangements for journeys from the station to the
             ground.
(e)          Advice to coach operators:-
            (i)        location of coach parking with route and plan;
            (ii)       arrive no earlier than one hour before scheduled
                        kick off time;
            (iii)      depart within half an hour of the final whistle;
            (iv)       do not stop          within              ten           miles             of    their
                        destination;
            (v)        avoid stopping for refreshment at any place where
                        intoxicating liquor is available.
(f)          Advice to visiting supporters:-
            (i)...     plan of the ground and its environs showing
                        visitors entrance and enclosures;
            (ii)       enter stadium only through designated visitors
                        turnstiles;
       (iii)       supporters will not be allowed on to the ground
                   carryina articles which could bs construsd as
                   offensive weapons.
(g)     Obtain from British Transport Pol ice:-


       (ii)        times of arrival and departures;
       (iii)       number of supporters expected on each train,
                   details of the actual number to beconfirmed on
                   the day;
       (iv)        a breakdown of the number expected to travel by
                   charter train, special tra-in or scheduled
                   services.

Action to be Taken by 'Away Teaml Liaison Officers
Liaison officers should establish and maintain close liaison with
the local supporters club and coach operators who carry football
supporters to away matches.
Forward to coach operators the information received from the home
club liaison - om'cers gDquw su^j^szwd reuses, pGrkinj
arrangements, plan of the ground and environs, etc., requesting
details of the number of coaches and the approximate number of
supporiers travelling to the away gams.
Forward to the supporters club the information received from the
home club liaison officers requesting information about:-
(a)     the number of coaches and supporters travelling by road;
(b)     the number of supporters travelling by chartered or
       special trains.
Confirm with the British Transport Police the number of
supporters expected to travel by charter trains, special trains
or scheduled services.
Advise the home club liaison officer in writing of            the
intelligence collated from the above sources, including:-
(a)     the name of the coach firms, the details of coaches and
       the approximate number of supporters;
(b)     any intelligence on the number of supporters travelling
       by train;

       ascertained for future intelligence purposes.
The importance of the accurate completion and prompt return of
the football match summary forms is again stressed.
Consideration should also be given to the forwarding of C.C.T.Y.
tapes containing intelligence about visiting supporters to the
Police Force concerned.
It is important that supervising officers encourage officers to
submit any relevant intelligence to Football Liaison Officers in
order to positively assist in the gathering of intelligence.
Information to Police Force Through           Whose   Area   Visiting
Supporters are Expected to Travel
It may be necessary for information to be supplied to the Force
through whose area large numbers of supporters travel or on whose
area notorious 'crossroads' or 'watering holes' are situated.
This assumes a more urgent aspect if there has been trouble at
the ground;    or if there is a history of violence between
supporters likely to meet en-route to their respective away
fixtures. Reports of such problems should be passed to the
football liaison officers of the clubs involved by the Force in
whose area the incident occurred.

DUTIES OF STEWARDS
The Effect of Safety Certificates Issued Under the Safety at

The Local Authority, before issuing a Safety Certificate, is
required to consult the Chief Officer of Police regarding the
terms and conditions to be included in the certificate.
Whilst police do not directly control the employment of stewards
at football grounds, it should be accepted that there is a
responsibility, within the wider context of public safety, to
exert influence to ensure that the arrangements made by the
management of the ground are adequate in this respect. It .is.
most important tnat stewaras a r e s u f f i c i e n t in nuniuer, s u i t a b l y
deployed, well trained and capable mentally and physically of
carrying out their routine and emergency functions.                                    It i s
recommended that the police regularly inspect stewarding
arranaements t o d e t s n r n n e t h £ v are in a c c o rd wi t h c e r t i f i c a t i o n .

Identification and Supervision
Persons employed as stewards at football grounds should be
clearly identifiable, wearing coloured tabards. They should at
all times be under the direct control of supervisors whose
identities should be made known to the police officers on duty at
the ground and who should be in contact with the Police Control.
Stewards should be distributed throughout the ground in
accordance with a detailed pre-arranged schedule, agreed between
tne yOiics ana Hianagenient c t tne g r o y n e .
Their duties may be divided into four main categories
(a)       controlling or directing members of tne public who are
           entering or leaving the football ground;
(b)       patrolling the ground to deal with any emergencies, e.g.
           raising alarms, extinguishing fire, etc.;
(c)       manning entrances, exits and other strategic points,
           particularly exit doors, and gates which are not
           continuously open whilst the ground is in use;
(d)      . undertaking specific duties relating to emergency and
           evacuation procedures.
In accordance with the 'Popplewell1recommendations allstewards
should:-
(a)       be trained and instructed to deal with any emergency
           relating to fire or evacuation;
(b)       be given written instructions about the action to be
           taken in cases of emergency;
(c)     receive practical instruction and training appropriate to
         their responsibility;
(d)     not be employed as a steward unless they have been sc
        1           £rjH

(e)     be adequate in numDer, pnysically and mentally capable of
         performing   their    duties,    effectively    deployed,
        effectively supervised and readily identifiable.
Emergency Procedures - Stewards Role
Formal emergency procedures at each ground require joint
consultation between police, the management of the ground, fire,
ambulance and other services.
It is essential that stewards and their supervisors are fully
aware of the part they have to play in the plans which are
produced.    The management of the ground should ensure that
written instructions concerning the action to be taken in the
event ot an ernerjency are msGc reaoi iy aval iaDie to ai i starr anc
stewaras ana, in particular, that all the staff and stewards
should receive practical instruction and training appropriate to
tneir responsibilities in tne event of an emergency. Exercises
for the staff and stewards should be carried out regularly to
ensure the smooth operation of the procedure for dealing with an
emergency.
A record should be kept by the club authorities containing
details of the training and instruction given and the exercises
held, and should include the following matters
(a)   date and time of the instruction or exercise;
(b)   duration;
(c)   name of the person giving the instructions;
(d)   names of the persons receiving the instructions;
(e)   nature of instruction or exercise.
Consideration should be given to the inclusion of these
conditions in any safety, or special safety certificate.
After initial practical instruction all members of staff and
stewards should receive verbal instruction, given by a competent
person, at least once in every period of three months at regular
intervals. Stewards should be given briefing cards relevant to
particular points.
 POLICING FACILITIES AT FOOTBALL GROUNDS
nrere are marked differences in the facilities provided by clubs
and it must remain a matter for local negotiation between police
and clubs as to the standard of raci nties, bean no in mind
                        ----                                                    pi
recommended that General Safety Certificates are reviewed on an
annual basis in an effort to achieve continuing improvement.
Prisoner Reception Point Within the Ground
It is considered essential that a prisoner reception point should
be available at the ground. The office should be sited, if
possible, so that there is adequate access for the unobtrusive
removal of prisoners. There should be either a G.P.O. telephone
line or a. direct line to the nearest police station. Ideally the

Parading and Briefing
it is aesiraoie tnat ponce oiricers to be deployed in tne around
are briefed on site. This can usually be done under cover in
most grounds. A standardised form of stadium grid reference used
by police and club personnel will facilitate briefing and
evacuation.
Control Room
It is desirableand in some cases essential, that 2 control room
is provided to oversee police operations in the ground.
Provision should be made for a base station to control the U.H.F.
police radio.         It should haye a direct access to t h e Ground
puolic a d d r e s s system and either a G.P.O. or d i r e c t telephone
line to the local police station, and the police office within
the ground. The room should be of adequate size to accommodate
C.C.T.V. monitors and ancillary equipment. It is desirable to be
able to operate, in addition, high intensity lighting systems
from the police controlwhich may be switched on when there is
trouble or emergency.
The control, room should be sited to give an over view of the
ground and to allow the match police commander ready access from
the 1touch line1.
The costs of the provision of the police office and control room
and facilities should be borne by the club. The police generally
provide radio communication and additional items such as loud
hailers and binoculars.
Safety at Sports Grounds1 Act, 1975, by providing for
consultation between the local authority and police (Section
3(iii)) on conditions to be included on safety certificates has
had a clear effect on improving ground facilities. Full use
should be made of these provisions to ensure adequate police
facilities.

        4.8    The guidance offered in this section is intended to assist
               Commanders having operational responsibility for policing
               football. It is not a definitive work and should be read in
               conjunction with the report of tne A.C.P.O. Working Party,

               Introduction
        4.9     The use of C.C.T.V. and still photography as an aid to the
               effective policing of football is a recent development. At the
               present time, all First and Second Division football grounds are
               provided with static video cameras and recording facilities,
               which enable the police to monitor crowd behaviour within and in
               the immediate vicinity of stadia.        It is -anticipated that
               viaecing raci nties win ds extenceo to all Third ana Fourtn
               Divsion grounds in the near future but not necessarily of the
               same type as in the two higher Divisions.

»«'iS          and^ control' and to evidence gathering.      Experience to date
               indicates the greatest value lies in developing a system for the
               use of C.C.T.V. and still photography within stadia for the
               purposes of intelligence and evidence gathering.
               All systsnis at present in use at football grounds are capable of
               being enhanced and developed. When these changes are made it
               should be ensured that the replacement equipment is of sufficient

               acceptable for use as evidence in court.
               Accepting the need for identification and evidence gathering for
               prosecution to be the primary function of the system, the
               following points are worthy of consideration in the use of
               development of existing *and anticipated facilities.
               Technical Considerations
        ^•10   (a)               At the time of installation, consideration should be given
                                 to the siting of cameras and cables so as to prevent
                                 interference or damage.
               (b)               As good video recording requires good light and as most
                                 football fixtures are played during winter months, the
                                 need for adequate lighting within and around football
                                 stadia is essential to eliminate areas of darkness which
                                 may be used as cover for disorderly, behaviour. Fans are
                                 increasingly aware that such behaviour is monitored by
                                 C.C.T.V. and they will attempt to evade detection by
                                 seeking whatever cover is available.     It is therefore
                                 important that cameras are sited in such a way as to
                                 minimise blind spots and that facilities are provided to
                                 increase lighting intensities in stands, etc. The siting
                                 of video cameras should take account of sloping roofs, to


1
enable recording at the rear of stands. This problem can
be overcome by the use of hand-held cameras.
Consideration must be given to all foreseeable problems
that may affect the performance of video equipment. A
good example that is easily overlooked is the patn of the

sun was shining directly into the lens.
Police Control Rooms contain valuable equipment and are
often vulnerable. Consideration should be given to taking
protective measures to increase security.
Control Rooms should be placed in a position which
commands a good all round view of the ground and
consideration should be given to placing the video
monitors in such a position that the, operator is not

Careful consideration to the type of lighting and the
provision of glass partitions should be given to prevent
reflection or distortion. The Control Room should have
adequate background heating to protect the electrical
equipment and for the comfort of personnel employed within
the room. Heating should remain switched on 24 hours a
day during cold weather.
The use of flash equipment in the vicinity of sensitive
video cameras may damage the tube if discharged facing the
camera. Even if this damage is not permanent, the video
camera would be unable to function for some time. As a
general rule flash equipment should not be used in the
vicinity of operating video cameras.
Police Control Rooms must be provided with multi-recording
facilities in order that the o p p o r t u n i t y exists to capture
all incidents which may occur in different areas within
the stadium.
Operational Considerations
It is important that police officers are made aware that
their actions in dealing with disorderly behaviour within
the stadium will also be recorded on C.C.T.V.
Consideration should be given to the preparation of a
ground specific video, to be used in briefing officers who
may not be familiar with the stadium.
It is important whenever possible to use the same
personnel in police ground control room operations. They
will more readily identify regular troublemakers and
Jtarget' them within the .ground. Over a period of time
they will develop similar abilities in relation to
visiting supporters._
Immediately following a fixture where arrests for
misconduct have occurred, arresting officers should be
allowed an opportunity to view any recording of the
    incidents concerned to establish (1) the evidence for
    their arrest and (2) whether the offender has committed
    any further acts not witnessed by the arresting officer.
    Intelligence Gathering
    Away fans arriving ax grounds may be videoed as they come
    through turnstiles, get off buses or leave railway
    stations. This helps with identification and the tracing
    of those responsible for causing trouble; It also makes
    the fans aware that they are on record.
    When grounds are full, the crowd may be filmed all round,
    so that if trouble starts, identification will be
    assisted. It will also make the crowd aware that they are
    on record.' To assist this procedure, it is always useful
    to have identification marks around the ground so that the
    fans! location within the stadium can be pin-pointed with
    accuracy.
    Some clubs have followings from areas of the country many
    miles from their home base.       Therefore, when it is
    necessary to identify persons from the crowd, photographs
    and video recordings should be circulated to Forces who
    have supporters! clubs of that particular football club in
    their area.
    Each Force should compile sets of photographs and/or
    videos of its own clubs hooligans and either (i) forward
    on such Compilation to each force that is likely to host
    the club during the forthcoming season, or (ii) one such
    compilation be taken to each away game by officers
    travelling with the club's supporters.
    Each host Force should supply the visiting team's home
    Force with photographs and video recordings of the
    visiting team.s supporters, if their conduct is such as to
    warrant this. This will keep Forces aware of how their
    own club's supporters behave away from home.
    Somp clubs have a section of supporters who are notorious
    for hooligan behaviour.      It would assist in future
    investigations into serious disorder at other grounds if
    the host Forces of these clubs prepared video recordings
    and photographs of their hooligan element and established
    the identity of those involved. Then by comparing _this
    recording and the photographs with those of the incident
1   under investigation, identification should be greatly
    assisted.

I   Known hooligans should be targetted- and followed in video.
    This requires local officers operating the video who can
    be .assisted by officers from the visiting team's home
    Force.

        intelligence purposes, and that tapes be retained until
        the corresponding fixture in the following season has been
        piayed,
Identification
In the event of large-scale and serious disorder at a sporting
fixture, there will be a need to develop a strategy to identify
and arrest offenders, using the evidence obtained by video
recording and still photography. Practical guidance in this
process is as follows:-
(a)     Photogranhs or stills from video recordings should be
         ais?layed ror puoiic view and icsntiri cation wherever
         possible, e.g. T.V., newspapers, match programmes,
         posters, etc.
(b)     A viewing studio should be created not only for the use of
        police officers, but for the public as well as such
        organisations as supporters1 clubs, stewards, residents'
        associations, social workers, probation officers, etc.
(c)     Immediately after the incident, all press photographs and
         other media evidence should be obtained and statements
         taken from those responsible for taking the photographs,
         video recordings, etc. Attempts should also be made to
         obtain all amateur videos and photographs, and the
         appropriate statements taken. All this material, together
        with police photographs and video recordings, should then
         form part of the viewing studio exhibits.
(d)     Officers from the host Force should visit the visiting
         team's area and other areas containing supporters' clubs
         of ^the visiting team, where they should exhibit
         photographs and video recordings for identifiation
        purposes as at (b) above.
(e)     The size of the police team working on identification is
        critical. There should be sufficient to do the work, but
        it should be kept small enough to be cohesive.
(f)     The task of viewing video recordings and photographs many
        times is tedious, therefore it is recommended that staff
        should be selected who are interested in the sport
        involved.
(g)     Once identified and traced, offenders should be invited to
        view the video recordings and if they are able, to
        identify themselves whilst in non controversial
        circumstances before being questioned about alleged
        offences on video recordings and photographs.
(h)    Where people identify themselves in photographs, they
        should be invited to indicate this on the reverse of the
        photograph over their signature.
(i)    Consideration should be given to videoing suspects whilst
        t h e y are watcmng tne recoromg o t the "incident, racial
        expressions, bodily movements and verbal exchanges may
        form vital supporting evidence.
Use of Yideo in Connection with Policing of Football Supporters
British Transport Police are provided ■with both static and
portable video equipment which is widely used for monitoring fans
passing through stations and travelling on the railway. A close
liaison should be maintained with this Force for information
exchange, intelligence gathering and assistance with the

Portable Equipoent
All British Transport Police divisions operate portable colour
video equipment, which is used extensively for videoing fans
travelling to and from sporting fixtures.
The British Transport Police also use video graphic printers in
connection with the subsequent identification of offenders from
video recordings and the circulation of intelligence gathered
from these tapes.
Forces seeking to utilise the video facilities and intelligence
gathered by British Transport Police should direct their
enquiries to the Football Liaison Unit at their Headquarters at:

                   ETHICAL AND LEGAL POSXTIOK



The legal position, however, is wider than the ethical.                    That
evidence has been obtained unethically or unfairly (i.e. contrary
to the Home Office Guidelines), does not necessarily render that
evidence inadmissible.


     'There was no ground for holding that the recordings
     (unauthorised      telephone      taps)   were   inadmissible    in
     criminal proceedings even though they had been obtained
     by interfering with a public service and the Crown was a
     party to the proceedings.’           (R. -v- Senat (1968), 112
     S.J. 252; 118 New L.J. 277, The Times, March 16, 1968).


     'The court is not concerned how evidence is obtained, but
     only how it was used by the prosecution at the trial.             A
     judge   has       no   discretion     (except    for    admissions,
     confessions, etc.) to refuse to admit relevant admissible
     evidence merely because it had been obtained by improper
     or unfair means.'       (R. -v- Sang (1979). 2 All E.R. 1222.)


At present the whole area of admissible evidence is in a dynamic
state.   The court when imposing the 'exclusion test1 under Section
78 of P.A.C.E. will first examine the way the police have applied
the Codes of Practice making its decision on the merits of each
case (see R. -v- Alladice (I988 ), Crim. L. R. 608 and R. -v-
Delaney (1988) reported in The Times, August 30, 1988 ).


It is well established that an audio tape-recording is a document,
if what was recorded was information or evidence, and a tape--
recording    of    a    conversation     can   properly     be   described   as
documentary evidence of the conversation •(Grant -v- Southwestern
and County Properties Limited (1975) 2 All E.R. 466).               Therefore,
the rules of evidence which apply to documents will apply to audio
 tape-recordings, and as there is no difference in principle between
       a video tape-recording and a photograph or an audio tape-recording
       (R. -v- Fowden and White (1982) Crim. L.R. 588), the rules of
       evidence that apply to documents will also apply to video tape-
       recordings.


       Section 72(1), Police and Criminal Evidence Act, 1984 holds that a
       'statement' has the same meaning as in Part 1 of the Civil Evidence
       Act, 1968.    Section 10 of that Act holds that 'statement' includes
       any representation of fact whether made in words or otherwise and
       document includes (a) map, plan, graph, drawing, (b) photograph,
       (c) disc, tape, sound-track or other device by which sound may be
       reproduced,   (d) film (including micro-film), negative, tape, or
       other device by which visual images may be reproduced.           Therefore,
       a video tape-recording is a document within the Police and Criminal
       Evidence Act.


1.9    It would appear that the courts have taken a broad view of video
       evidence and maintained that there is no distinction between one
       method of recording evidence, and another.         More concern seems to
       be directed to the question of whether the equipment has merely
       recorded and not created evidence (Sophocleous -v- Ringer (1987 )
       Crim. L.R. 422).      Yet in Li-Shu-Ling -v- R. (1988 ) Crim. L.R.5 8 , it
       was held that if a video recording of an accused's confession was
       made,'including a demonstration using a dummy or a person to record
       how the offence was committed, that recording would be admissable
       in evidence provided that the accused was given proper warning that
       he need not take part in the video recording, that it was made
       reasonably soon after the confession and that the accused had been
       given the opportunity to make and have recorded any comments he
       wished.


1.10   The   question   of    disputed   identification   is   really    the   most
       important issue.      When presenting video evidence should the jury be
       left to decide or should a prosecution witness be allowed to
       identify the person in the video tape-recording as the accused?
       The courts have consistently held that an identifier can testify as
       to identification made on the basis of that recording, but in
            R. -v- Fowden and White (1982) it was held that there is no reason
            in principle why the prosecution should not be able to call a
            witness who knows the accused to look at a photograph, or video
            tape-recording and give evidence to the effect that he knows the
            person, and it is the accused.      However, in the case of police
            officers giving such evidence, consideration should be given to the
            probative value being outweighed by the prejudicial effect if this
            acquaintanceship is through previous offences, as the defence may
            be deprived from testingthe accuracy of the identification.


    1.11    A further question which has occasioned some debate is to whether a
            police officer may refresh his memory from a video tape-recording,

t           as from a notebook, whilst giving evidence in court?          It would
            appear that the police officer responsible for making the video
            tape-recording, as long as he was actually watching what he was
            recording, would be allowed to use the recording for refreshing his
            memory in place of his notebook.    In R. -v- Mills, and Rose (1962)
            All E.R. 298, it was held that 'the tape-recorder was used by the
            policeman to perform the function which would otherwise have been
            performed by a pen or pencil in his own hand, and he used the
            record produced by that piece of mechanism, which he was employing
            as his tool, to refresh his memory when he was giving evidence'.


    1. 12   Whether it is     necessary    to produce   the original video     tape-
            recording (best evidence), or whether a copy is admissible was
            examined in Kajala -v- Noble (1982) Crim. L.R. 433*     At trial, the
            prosecution produced a video recording which was not the original
            transmitted by    the B.B.C.      The   witness   who made   the   copy,
            authenticated it as being a true copy of the original, the original
            cameraman being out of the country.     Another witness confirmed that
            the copy tape was the same as he had seen transmitted on the night
            of the offence.     The accused was convicted and his appeal was
            dismissed.   It was held that the old rule that a party must produce
            the best evidence as the nature of the case would allow and that
            any less good evidence was to be excluded, no longer pertained for
            the court did not confine itself to the best evidence but admitted
            all relevant evidence.   It was the view of the court that the old
            rule is limited and confined to written documents in the strict
sense of the term, and has no relevance to tapes or film.                From
this case it could be inferred that there are three ways of
authenticating a copy television video recording as a true and
accurate reproduction of the original:-


(i)     Call    the    original     cameraman   responsible     for
        recording at the time of the incident.


(ii)    Call the person responsible for making the copy
        from the original.


(iii)   Call a person who saw the original transmitted
        by the B.B.C. or I.T.V.


The question of 'best evidence' was taken one step further in
Taylor -v- Chief Constable of Cheshire (1986) reported in The
Times, October 28, where the prosecution evidence rested in part
upon what police officers had seen in a video tape-recording,
identifying the appellant and describing his actions, the recording
not being available to the court, having been inadvertently erased.
It was held in dismissing the appeal that the evidence was
admissible,    although   subject     to   comments   as   to   weight    and
persuasiveness following from the loss of the tape.             There is no
effective distinction so far as concerns admissibility between a
direct view of the action of an alleged offender (shoplifter) and a
view of those activities on the video display unit of a camera, or
a view of those activities on a recording of what the camera
recorded (R. -v- Grimer (1982), Crim. L.R. 7*0.


The preparation of notes from a video tape-recording must be
examined from both the perspective of the officer responsible for
making the recording and from that of an qfficer appearing in the
recording.     In the case of the former he appears to have two
options.      Other them recording the necessary information with
regard to his duties and the equipment, he may feel that no other
entries are required as the video can 'speak for itself' and may be
a better medium for refreshing his memory them a notebook (see
paragraph 1.11).      Alternatively, he may think that certain actions
depicted in the recording must be explained in evidence.                                                                 The use
of his notebook could then supplement the evidence on the recording
and his notes could be made in conjunction with the viewing of the
video tape.

It must be stressed that at present there are no guidelines or case
law        in relation to the use of a video tape-recording and                                                                the
preparation of notes,                       by either the recording officer,                                              or an
officer appearing in the recording.                                   However, in the interests of
producing the most accurate evidence before the court the following
two questions must be answered:-


(a)            is     it     m ore    a ccu ra te to        make        n o tes          as      soon          as
              p r a c t i c a b l e a f t e r t h e i n c i d e n t from memory?                       or


(b )           is     it     m ore    a ccu ra te to        make        n o tes         as       soon          as
              p r a c tic a b le     a fte r       th e    in c id e n t        u s in g        an y        v id e o
              ta p e -r e c o r d in g o f th e in c id e n t to a s s i s t r e c a ll?


The Working Party are strongly of the view that officers should be
entitled to view any video records of an incident as often as is
helpful when they formulate their own evidence.


It is a long established principle that police officers who have
acted in concert may make their notes and prepare their evidence
together.              There appears                to be no valid argument that                                               this
principle should be changed because of the advent of video tape-
recorded evidence.     On the contrary, the viewing of a video tape-
recording of an incident is more likely to assist the officers in
reproducing accurate notes and evidence,        and will    reduce the
likelihood of the strongest personality's view of the incident
being accepted as correct by the others.


The question of police access to unpublished video and photographs
held by media organisations was addressed at the High Court when
officers investigating complaints against the police, arising from
the Wapping dispute, sought        access   to material   held    by   two
television companies, three newspapers and a number of free-lance
photographers.      Mr.   Justice Alliott rejected claims        that the
freedom and independence of the press would be compromised, stating
that it would be in the public interest for the material to be
produced.     (Reported in the Independent, May 27th, 1 9 8 8 ) .      The
application for access was made under Section 9 .           Police and
Criminal Evidence Act, 1 9 8 4 .


Video tape-recordings and photographs provide the courts with
pictures and sounds relating to the offence(s) they are to try;
evidence of an extremely powerful nature, that would not otherwise
be available to them.         Their use in the search for truth has
enormous potential and the Working Party recommends              that the
Service take an active and progressive role in increasing this use
before the criminal courts.

                                    TECHNICAL SCOPE


          Changing Scene of Technology


    2.1   Regretfully,       a substantial amount of the technical information
          contained in this report will be out of date by publication.                   This
          is inevitable because of the pace of change and advance in the
          technology of optical recording.                 Fortunately,    the principles
          remain the same and it is only the equipment that improves,
          widening the boundaries of what is possible in photography and

9         video recording.


    2.2   General    guidelines     are given in       this     chapter,    and it       is    a
          recommendation (see Summary and Recommendations 5) of the report
          that these guidelines should be updated annually.                However, before
          any expensive commitments are entered into in the area of optical
          recording equipment, it is recommended that advice on the state of
          technology is sought.          Current information is always available from
          Technical Support Units (T.S.U.'s), the Police Requirement Support
          Unit (P.R.S.U.), the Scientific Research and Development Branch
          (S.R.D.B.) Information Service, and specifically for public order
          equipment the Advanced Planning Unit, T021, at New Scotland Yard.


•   (b)   Black and White -v- Colour Photography


    2.3   In the past, monochrome film has produced better quality images
          than those available on colour film.                This has been especially
          apparent     in     conditions    of   low   light.          However,   with        the
          Availability        of   increasingly     faster      film,     improvements        in
          processing        techniques     and   superior     camera     equipment,      these
          disadvantages are rapidly disappearing.
There are many advantages in obtaining colour photographs whenever
possible, not least of which is the benefit of identifying the
colour of clothing worn by a suspect.                               It is now generally accepted
that, for police purposes, colour photography is operationally
superior to black and white.


Video -v- Still Photography


Video and still photography are not in competition,                                                   but are
complementary.                 Good        quality video             recording will                 provide     a
comprehensive reproduction of an incident, but photographs taken
from such a recording, for identification or recognition purposes,
will lack the clarity of photographs                                     taken at the incident.
Therefore, it is advisable, whenever possible, to supplement video
cameras            with            still      photographers                  at          the        time       of
evidence/intelligence gathering.

A new development in video recording, the Gated Video Camera (see
paragraph 2.12), makes it possible to record images which can be
viewed singly, but at present this equipment requires'good lighting
to operate.               Although great advances are being made in video
technology, at present, still cameras are able to function at lower
light values than colour video cameras and the image obtained on
film is always superior to that obtained on video tape.

E Q U IP M E N T C O N FIG U R A TIO N S



The       following            are         suggestionsfor   different     equipment
configurations:


     i)      Portable colour system


             Use the following items; a, b, c, d, e, k, r 'and s.                     Add
             items h and i or j if the camera is to be mounted on a
              tripod but notconnected to a control room.                The lens   range
             can be extended using item f.
ii)      Tripod mounted colour camera with control room


         Use the following items; a, e, g, h, i or j, 1 or m, n, o
         or p, r and A1 to A4.    The lens' range can be extended
         using item   f and local recording at the camera position
         can be achieved with items b, i or j, k and s.


iii)     Tripod mounted colour camera with additional monochrome
         cameras and a control room


         All the items will be needed with the exception of c, d, f,
         i or j, one of either 1 or m, one of either o or p, and s.
         The lens' range can be extended using item       f and local
         recording at the camera position can be achieved with items
         b, i or j, k and s.


Gated Video Camera (electronic shutter) - a video camera which
takes a progression of still frames at a very high speed.        When
viewed conventionally the video appears the same as one recorded
with a normal camera, but when viewed as a still the picture
quality is many times superior.       The camera can be panned quickly
or pointed at a rapidly changing scene (e.g. through         the side
window of a moving motor vehicle) and produce a good quality still,
where a conventional camera would only produce a blur.       Available
in both colour and monochrome versions, but require good lighting
conditions.


Lens Quality - lenses used for both video and photography are
specified by two parameters: focal length and aperture.     The focal
length   of a lens is normally expressed in millimetres. The greater
the focal length of a lens the narrower will be its field of view
and the larger the subject will appear.        Whilst a 28mm -lens may
produce a picture of half a football stand from which facial
identification is not possible, a 600mm lens would allow head and
shoulders pictures of people from the same distance.        For facial
identification      fromphotographs       the   focal length of        the lens
required     can    be    chosen     on   the    basis    of   the     following
approximation:-


  Distance to subject (Metres) x 10 = focal length (millinetres)
           1.5

                               e.g. at 30 metres:-


                          30 x 10 = 200 Millimetres
                         1.5

With very fast films such as ISO 1600 or 3200, simply multiply the
distance by 10 to get the focal length in millimetres.


The aperture of a lens describes how much light the lens passes.
The maximum aperture is usually quoted when specifying a lens.
Aperture is expressed as an 'f' number.                  The 'f' number is in
inverse proportion to the diameter of the aperture.             A typical 50mm
photographic lens might have a maximum aperture of fl.8, whereas a
300mm lens would be f4.5           The 50mm lens would let in         more light
because it has the larger aperture.             The bigger the value of the
'f' number, the smaller the aperture and hence the more light
required on the subject.


Photographic Retrieval Fro* Optical Disk P.R.O.D. - the system
developed by the Home Office Scientific Research and Development
Branch is designed to replace the current collections of prisoner
photographs       used   by    the   police     with   computerised    image   of
databases.       It has definite advantages over present systems viz:


(a) ultimately the lowest cost per image of any storage medium,


(b) low manpower and floor space requirements.


(c) excellent search and retrieval facilities.
(d) excellent data control and security.


(e) excellent image and library copying facilities,


(f) excellent archiving characteristics,


(g) multiple libraries possible on one system,


(h) witness album and still frame video available,


(i) automatic back record conversation possible in the future,


(j)    computer photofit         and     facial    recognition possible       in the
      future.


The storage of images on computer requires very large amounts of
data space which is provided by the optical disk.                    Present optical
disks are 12" in diameter and can contain up to 50,000 uncompressed
small colour images.         The advantages of such a system are obvious.


The   P.R.O.D.       project    was    begun      in   1981   and    an   operational
evaluation      of    the    equipment    was     undertaken    in 1987       by the
Hertfordshire Police.


Provision       of   Power     - power     requirements       for    video   cameras/
recorders can be supplied in two ways:-


(a) Mains Supply - where a mains supply is available it can be
      used to power video cameras and recorders.                    Most systems
      will require a unit to convert the supply to 12 volts DC,
      but these are readily available.                  The following points
      should be considered


      (i) Condition of supply - is wiring dated and likely to
          break down or cause a fuse to break?
    (ii)    Is the supply switching systen.within the control of
            the video operator?
             /                        *         -   '


    (iii)   If the video installation is unmanned, is the supply
            secure from outside interference?


    (iv)    Is the supply safe from damage, either deliberately
            or inadvertently, from sources outside the control
            of the operator?


    N.B.    Mains supply must not be used in daap conditions
            unless low voltage (i.e. 110 volts) is available.


(b) Battery Supply - power supply from batteries in short
    operations present no problems;       they allow use of the
    equipment in virtually all environments, except in extremes
    of temperature when battery performance may be adversely
    affected.    The main advantage is that total control of the
    supply rests with the operator.       Long standing operations
    will require either mains supply or frequent changes of
    batteries.


Compatibility - it is very important that all the segments of a
recording system (e.g. camera, recorder, tapes, etc.) are of a
compatible standard.     For instance, third rate video tape will
produce third rate pictures even thougfc the camera and recorder are
of first-rate quality.
Low Light Photography - even without additional lighting (flash or
floodlights) photography is still possible at low light levels,
either by using fast films or image intensifiers                    (electronic
devices which amplify the available light).                     The only image
intensifier currently recommended for photography is the Davin
Modulux 130 which costs several thousand pounds.                 It is a bulky
device generating a monochrome image of lower resolution than
normal photography and is really only suitable for photography from
static OPs or vehicles.          Kodak Tmax 400 film is ideally suited to
use with the Modulux 130 although virtually any film, either colour
or monochrome, with a film speed rating from ISO 400 - 1000 can be
used.


Unaided photography at low light levels relies on using high speed
films and is possible in both colour and monochrome.               Colour print
films with speeds from ISO 1000 - 3200 are now available and the
following have all been successfully used at low light levels;
Kodak VR1000,         Fuji HR1600     and Konica SRV3200.          Good   colour
rendition is possible under a wide variety of lighting conditions
but not under low pressure sodium lighting.


For monochrome photography films such as Kodak Tmax 400 or Ilford
HP5 can be used.           Although these films are rated at ISO 400 they
can be uprated by under exposing and compensating with extended
development.     Films treated in this way can be given ISO equivalent
speeds of 1000 - 3200.          Kodak Tmax 400 will probably give the best
results under these conditions.         Kodak Tmax p3200 can also be used.
This     film   has    a    basic   speed   rating   of   ISO    3200   and    the
manufacturers claim it can be uprated to speeds equivalent to ISO
1 2 ,80 0 .


When possible lenses with low f numbers (large maximum apertures)
should be used.        These allow the maximum amount of light into the
lens which in turn yields higher shutter speeds.                  For example a
garage forecourt photographed using an ISO 3200 film with a lens
set to f2.8 might give a shutter speed of l/250th second.                     If a
         slower lens with an aperture of f5.6 were used, this would drop to
         l/60th second and lead to camera shake or subject movement blurring
         the picture.,


2 .1 9   Video Tapes - there are various different video recording formats
         available ranging from those primarily for domestic use up to those
         intended for the professional broadcaster.         The three most commonly
         encountered in police use are Betamax, VHS and U-matic low band.
         Betamax and VHS offer three hour plus recording times, both the
         tapes and recorders are cheaper than their U-matic counterparts and
         the equipment is generally less bulky.


         U-matic tapes offer maximum recording times of twenty minutes in
         portable recorders and one hour for other machines.                The U-matic
         format offers slightly increased resolution which combined with the
         improved signed to noise ratio of U-matic low band compared with
         VHS and Betamax, means hard copy and copy video recordings are of
         higfcer quality.     This is considered of paramount importance and
         despite     the   apparent     disadvantages     the   U-matic     format   is
         recommended where evidential and intelligence material is being
         recorded.     (For guidelines on handling video tapes see Appendix
         'C').


2.20     'Tamron Fotovix* - capable of transforming 35°™ negative and slide
         information into video signals which are then displayed on a
         television monitor and recorded on video tape, if required.             A zoom
         control enables small areas of the negative/slide to be expanded
         with no loss of quality and an editing facility allows unwanted
         information to be deleted.       Not only is this an excellent means of
         viewing     negatives/slides     but   it   is   an    excellent    means   of
         transferring photographic information onto video tape for storage,
         briefing and video albums.
                                 TRAINING

There are two main objectives in police use of video and still
photography (a) intelligence gathering, and (b) evidence gathering.
Obviously, if the former is only to be used for internal police
intelligence    purposes         then        the   strict     conditions       surrounding
evidence do not apply, but it is considered that this practice may
prove extremely restrictive in subsequent case preparation.                          It is,
therefore,     recommended        that,        whenever      possible,     all      visually
recorded intelligence should be obtained with a view to its possible
presentation as evidence before a court.


Because of this, a meticulous approach to intelligence and evidence
gathering is essential if successful prosecutions are to follow.
Advances in technology are providing the police with increasingly
valuable tools to further these objectives and it behoves the
Service to use them with skill and professionalism.


To this end it is essential that police operators of such equipment
are trained not only in its efficient technical operation, but in
 •technique’    -    the     knowledge         and    skills     required      to    capture
 intelligence and evidence of sufficient quality to be useful in
 investigations and to secure convictions at court.


 It is important to appreciate that the requirements for intelligence
 gathering, evidence gathering, recognition and/or identification,
 and indications of general scene or atmosphere are all different,
 requiring varying techniques and equipment.                       Many past instances
 have     revealed        that    untrained          video     camera     operators,       in
 circumstances       of    stress       or    excitement       (e.g.    public      disorder,
 football disturbances) tend to try and capture everything taking
 place,    rendering much of             the       recording valueless,          instead of
 concentrating on particular incidents with a view to obtaining
 material      of    sufficient          quality       to     assist     the     subsequent
  investigation, retrospective arrests and presentation at court.
It is, therefore, considered essential that specific training should
be provided for operators of video equipment and still photographers
in the areas of (a)      public disorder,(b) football, and (c) crime
intelligence/evidencegathering.        Because   of   the    countrywide
implications of all the above categories it is also considered
desirable that this      training shouldbe designed to       a national
pattern, thus enabling evidence gathering officers from one Force to
assist   in   another   Force   area   with a minimum   of   operational
disruption.
(b)    Football


3-11     Most Football League grounds now have available to them either
         static C.C.T.V. installations, or hand-held video cameras.                                                          As this
         equipment was obtained and installed on an ad hoc basis, no
         standardisation was introduced in either equipment or operational
          requirements.                  The majority of static systems were installed with
          command and control requirements being the major consideration and
          the operators were seen specifically as equipment controllers.                                                            Set
          against present estimates,                              by far the greatest benefit that video
         cameras within grounds can provide is an intelligence and evidence
         gathering               capacity,              most       existing            systems and               operators         are
         inadequate.
                      \




3-12     In the Spring of 1988. Mr.                               Andrew Ford of the Scientific Research
         Development Branch                          (S.R.D.B.)            was      asked      to critically examine
         existing              systems.                 His       survey            indicated a            poor         level        of
         specification, provisions which rarely achieved specifications and
         general inadequate maintenance.                                   In addition, few systems had a good
         evidence gathering capacity.                                As a result, a technical committee,
         under the auspices of the A.C.P.O. Sub-Committee, has been set up to
         offer advice and to channel additional funding from the Football
         Trust, who are graciously providing the finance.                                                         The preceding
         section (paragraph 2.11) now encompasses the best advice in respect
         of equipment provision.

BEST PRACTICE AND METHOD FOR INTELLIGENCE AND EVIDENCE GATHERING


  With the exception of some specialist departments,        the optical
  recording of intelligence and evidence by technical means is in its
  infancy within the Police Service.    However, it is anticipated that
  this area of police work will rapidly expand as the benefits of such
  evidence become evident, not only to police officers, but also to
  the courts and public.       Modern society is very much a visual
  society, rather than literal or aural as it may have been in the
  past.   Since the last war it has been shaped and developed by
  television and consequently now demands the right to see as well as
  to know.   Increasingly, juries will expect to be presented with
  visual evidence of what is alleged and verbal descriptions (already
  in disrepute in some courts) will be less sufficient.            Video
  evidence is extremely potent in that it places the jury at the
  scene, at the time of the offence and sentences following such
  evidence reflect that experience.     However, there is a price to be
  paid, and cases that are not supported by such evidence tend to be
  depreciated by the courts with a consequent lessening of conviction
  rate and severity of sentence.


  If video evidence is to be accepted by the courts and public with
  confidence, in the same way as they accept fingerprint evidence,
  then the methods of preparation and presentation of such evidence by
  the police must not only be meticulous and professional, but also
  completely open.     Video evidence is of such potential importance to
  the future success of police endeavour that it must never be seen as
  tainted, either because of poor police practice, or lack of openness
  in police methods.


  As police experience increases, expertise and clarification of what
  courts will accept will both develop, but already from the limited
  experience in this country a number of fundamental principles have
  been established which will hopefully help to lay a solid framework
  for the future.       Some of these principles may be successfully
    challenged in future court hearings, with consequent amendment, but
    until such time it is considered that the Police Service should
    maintain whatever ground                          it has       achieved       and not            succumb        to
    hypothetical legal stumbling blocks.


G eneral P r in c ip le s


    The Attorney General's guidelines on disclosure of prosecution
    evidence to the defence has serious implications for the collection
    and storage of video intelligence.                                   During covert surveillance
    operations, sensitive information may be stored on video tape which
    is not to be used in evidence against those under surveillance, but
    purely           for    intelligence          purposes.               The    declaration             of      this
    intelligence may seriously hamper future operations.                                                   In such
    circumstances the intelligence gathering operation must be seen to
    be separate from that of the evidence gathering.                                              For instance,
    different officers,                  times and equipment may be used for each
    operation.             Any obvious continuity may result in the sensitive
    intelligence becoming disclosable.

    h ad b e e n a d h e r e d t o :


    (a)       The police officer in charge .of the observations                                               to be
               conducted,           no one of lesser rank than a sergeant should
               usually be acceptable for that purpose, had to be able to
               testify that beforehand he visited all observation places to
               be used and ascertained the attitude of occupiers of premises
               not only to the use to be made of them but to the possible
               disclosure thereafter of the use made and facts which could
               lead to the identification thereafter of the premises and of
               the occupiers.
      He     might,    of     course,     in   addition      inform     the   court   of
      difficulties, if any, usually encountered in particular in the
      locality of obtaining assistance from the public.


(b)   A police officer of no lesser rank than chief inspector had to
      be able to testify that immediately before the trial he
      visited the places used for observations, the result of which
      it was proposed to give in evidence, and ascertained whether
      .the occupiers were the same as when the observations took
      place and, whether they were or not, what was the attitude of
      those     occupiers       to   the     possible      disclosure    of    the    use
      previously made of the premises and of facts which could lead
      at the trial to identification of premises and occupiers.


Before any video or photographic equipment is used in connection
with covert intelligence or evidence gathering, reference should be
made to the Home Office Guidelines on the use of surveillance
equipment     (see     Appendix      'B'),     and   the     appropriate      authority
obtained.


Consideration must be given to how long video tapes are to be
retained before erasure and re-use, especially if they are not to
form part of prosecution evidence, although evidence is to be given
in court regarding the attendant circumstances.                 For instance, it is
now general knowledge that most football games are subject to video
surveillance and recording.             If the legal representative of a person
arrested at such a game demands disclosure of the video tapes taken
at that game and they have been erased, this may be presented in
court as police mal-practice, even if there is no proof, or even
suggestion,     that    the    accused person appeared            in     the original
recording.


If the question is raised it will be easier to respond if a rule of
practice has been established.             For example, if the Force pursues a
policy whereby tapes of no evidential value to the prosecution are
routinely wiped after a given period of time (for sound economic
           reasons), then reference to this policy should remove any doubt
           concerning   the possible   ulterior    reasons   for   tapes not being
           available.


           Where evidence has been recorded on video tape and police officers
           appear in the recording who will ultimately have to give such
           evidence before court (e.g. arrests at scenes of serious crime,
           football matches, public disorder etc.), those officers should be
           given the opportunity to view the video tapes before preparing their
           notes and evidence.      If, however, the officers cannot view the
           recording as soon as practicable after the event, then notes should
           be made at the time, and further notes made when the recording is
           eventually viewed, if necessary.       Officers should be afforded the
           opportunity of viewing the recording as often as required, but each
           viewing must be recorded and declared at court, if so requested.
           The court will then be in a position to apportion the appropriate
           'weight and persuasiveness' of the evidence.


    4.10   It is essential, indeed critical, that all officers engaged at a
           location being video recorded are made aware beforehand that their
           actions will also be recorded.


    4.11   Where intelligence or evidence is to be gathered by means of video
           recording, to ensure its admissibility before court, a clean tape
           must be used.     This need not be a new tape, but when a previously
9          used tape is used, evidence will be required to prove the erasing
           process.


    4.12   It should be borne in mind that if video tapes are to be viewed by
           S.R.D.B. staff to assist in an enquiry,           they will require the
           make/model and serial number of each of the main items of equipment
           used to make      the recording   (e.g.,   camera,   recorder,   time/date
           generator etc).


    4.13   Before starting the recording,       the tape counter on the video
           recorder should be set at zero at the start of the tape.           Before
           use,   labels should be fixed to video cassettes containing the
reference number, the date and time of loading the tape and the
person responsible for making the recording.            This information
should also be recorded in the officer's pocket book.


A record of the time, date and location as well as the operator(s)
must be maintained.     This can be done by using the audio track of
the video recorder (but problems can occur when irrelevant sounds
and comments are accidentally recorded), by using graphics on the
video tape, or by attaching a label to the video cassette.


The recording of an incident should be without interruption unless
absolutely      necessary   (e.g.    changing   videotape   or    changing
batteries).     Any such interruptions, or other information pertinent
to the recording, should be noted, including the time and tape
counter reading.


The recording should be kept as short as possible, whilst still
containing all relevant evidence.        Where the timing of an event is
not known, or cannot be controlled, the recording will inevitably be
longer than the event itself.        However, it is important to remember
that everything recorded may be available to the defence.


Whilst working copies will be used for investigation purposes, the
vulnerability to damage and distortion of the original requires that
they should be sealed and secured once a copy has been obtained.
Wear and tear occurs to all video tapes each time they are played
(see Appendix 'C').


When the camera and recording equipment are installed in an unmanned
location the security of the equipment and recorded material must be
sufficient to prevent interference with the evidence.            It may be
necessary to prove this security to the satisfaction of the court.


Where   still    photographs   are   to be produced    in evidence,    the
following should be considered:-


(i)     Continuity of negatives must be maintained.
(ii)   P h o t o g r a p h s s h o u l d c o n t a i n t i m e and d a t e
       i n f o r m a tio n .



(iii) Each photograph should be marked in order to identify
      the photographer.


(iv)   The whole negative strip should be available in case
       required by the court for examination.                                With this in
       mind, care should be taken during the course of taking
       the photographs not to include irrelevant information or
       pictures that may bring harm to the prosecution case.
4.31   When originally installed at football grounds, and despite advice
       from the A.C.P.O. Sub-Committee, C.C.T.V. systems were configured
       primarily as aids to command and control the event.             Consequently,
       as all photography is a compromise, not enough consideration was
       given to the requirements of intelligence and evidence gathering.
       With the change in emphasis, within grounds,               from 'command and
       control'    to     'intelligence   and     evidence       gathering'    present
       installations have proved to be mainly inadequate, in that most are,
       incapable of producing images of either adequate size or quality to
       satisfy the new requirements.         This is not only because of poor
       equipment, but also because the original criteria for siting cameras
       was usually to get as near to 100% coverage as possible and not to
       concentrate on the potential trouble areas.


4.32   With the change in emphasis,          attention has been given to the
       intelligence     and   evidence    gathering     effectiveness     of    police
       operations.      It is now considered that the C.C.T.V. system, still
       photographs and hand-held video cameras should be regarded as a
       single> integrated     intelligence      and   evidence    gathering    system.
       Effective usage depends upon the co-ordination of the evidence
       gathering system, the intelligence operation and a declared arrest
       policy.    The combination of these three things amounts to a strategy
       designed to both focus on hard core hooligan gangs and promote
higher thresholds of acceptable behaviour by enforcement against
unruly fans in general.           This strategy is based on the following
stages


(a)   The appointment of an Intelligence Officer responsible
         for directing the optical evidence gathering team and
         co-ordinating intelligence matters (see Appendix *E*).


(b)      On match days, the appointment of a 'Director' to be
         responsible for the optical evidence gathering team and
         specifically directing them when and where to film.


(c)      The development and enhancement of equipment for optical
         evidence gathering.        Existing fixed C.C.T.V. systems
         need to be brought up to their specifications and the
         far more effective portable systems used in support.
         Likewise, still photography should also be considered as
         complementary to other systems.


(d)      An arrest strategy needs to be determined and designated
         arrest teams deployed if appropriate.       For example, if a
         dozen youths are filmed chanting obscenely for long
         periods and perhaps at several games, they should be
         identified to the team and there should be a plan to
         arrest them by say 'filter cordon' at the end of the
         game.


(e)      The Intelligence Officer needs to routinely scrutinise
         all video and film records after the game, regardless of
         the     outcome,   and    if   necessary   develop   follow-up
         enquiries.


All C.C.T.V. systems at present in use at football grounds are
capable of being enhanced and developed.             When these changes are
made it should be ensured that the replacement equipment is capable
of producing recorded      images of sufficient quality to assist in
investigations and identifications, and to be placed before the
courts as evidence.


As good video recording requires good light and as most football
fixtures are played during winter months, the need for adequate
lighting    within   and   around football   grounds   is    essential to
eliminate   areas    of darkness which may be used          as cover    for
disorderly behaviour.        Fans are   increasingly   aware that      such
behaviour is monitored by C.C.T.V. and they will attempt to evade
detection by seeking whatever cover is available.       It is therefore
important that facilities are available to increase the lighting
intensities in areas of darkness, such as the rear of stands.            It
should be ensured that the colour temperature of the supplementary
illuminant matches that in the rest of the ground and is within the
operating range of the cameras.


The siting of cameras inside football grounds requires a great deal
of care and the following points should always be taken into
consideration:-


(i)    The known areas of likely trouble to be targeted by
       cameras capable of producing good close-up pictures for
       intelligence and incident gathering, even to the expense
       of other areas in the ground, with a lesser trouble
       potential.


(ii)   Blind spots,    such as downward sloping stand roofs,
       should be avoided wherever possible, if unable to do so
       then the use of hand-held video cameras may overcome the
       problem.


(iii) Cameras and cabling should be situated so as to prevent
       interference or damage.
(a)     they be charged with each offence and the court invited to try
        the cases together on the basis that there is a sufficient
       nexus in law and fact; or


(b)     that they be charged with a single offence and the additional
       recordings made available to the prosecutor to rebut any
       defence.


The video recording of a football fixture is a valuable source of
intelligence which is often overlooked in the absence of identified
disorder.    It is strongly recommended that all video recordings be
carefully examined after each match for intelligence gathering
purposes (see paragraph 4.32).       Photographs taken at each match
should be developed,      but not printed unless required,          as the
negatives may be examined by using a Tamron Fotofix.       Consideration
should be given to retaining video tapes until the corresponding
fixture the following season has been played.


In    summary,   photographic   evidence   gathering   offers   a   unique
opportunity for a radical improvement of law enforcement against
both hard core hooligan gangs and general levels of misbehaviour at
football grounds.      To date we have achieved containment of the
problem but we have not abated its potential and we seem to be
committed to drawing in more and more men to maintain just that
containment.     More assertive enforcement based upon the foregoing is
in the view of the Working Party a real possibility, which might
change fundamentally the volatile atmosphere at football grounds
which is the seed-bed of football violence.

                           THE INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS


5.1     The investigation of an incident, or series of incidents, captured
        on video and/or still photographs has three phases:-


         (a)   Collection of relevant material.
         (b)   Establishing a prosecution policy, and
         (c)   Identifying and arresting those responsible.


        In addition, video recording should be considered in connection with
         the following functions:-


         (d)   Identification Parades.
         (e)   Replacing Photographic Identification.
         (f)   Scenes of Crime.


(a)   Collection of Relevant Material


5.2     It is important that all material which may have an intelligence or
         evidential content is traced and retained.            This may include video
         recordings and photographs not only taken by police officers, but by
         press, B.B.C., I.T.V. and amateurs.           Although it would be normal
         practice to seize such material at the end of an event                  (e.g.
         football match), in a long running incident (e.g. public disorder)
         this task should be addressed throughout.


5.3     Once seized, it is essential that statements are obtained from those
         responsible for obtaining the photographs and video recordings,
         identifying the areas in which they were operating, which direction
         they were facing etc.


5.4     Statements   should   also   be   taken,       where   necessary,   to   prove
         continuity of the material.      This is particularly important with
         regard   to video    recordings by non-police          organisations.     For
         instance, the B.B.C. and I.T.V. will not release original footage,
only copies, consequently great play has been made in court that
this evidence is not what was actually transmitted from the incident
and may, therefore, be at the best hearsay and possibly of something
other than the incident concerning the trial.     Where the original is
not available, and the B.B.C./     I.T.V. policy has been accepted as
making the original unavailable, a copy recording is admissible in
evidence (Kajala -v- Noble (1982), Criminal Law review 433)•         In
such circumstances an executive of the B.B.C./I.T.V.          should be
called to explain their policy and prove the authenticity of the
copy, and, if necessary, a police officer present at the incident
should be called to prove the relevance of the video recording to
the incident.


Many media agencies have 'house' policies, agreed with the trades'
union, that material obtained in the furtherance of their employment
will not be released to the police for investigative or prosecution
purposes, simply on the request of the police.     This, it is argued,
is to prevent their staff from becoming targets of violence or
suppression by persons intent on illegal, or dubious, activities who
may    see   the media personnel   as potential    evidence   gatherers.
Therefore, it is not unlikely that media sources may refuse to
release copies of video tapes and press agencies will be non co­
operative if press photographs are to be used in court proceedings.
Nonetheless, this evidence may be vital to a successful prosecution
and should be secured, if necessary, by recourse to the courts (see
paragraph 1.18).


It is stressed, however, that such applications made to the courts
will be strenuously opposed by the media agencies and their legal
   *

representatives.    The police are likely to be called upon to specify
the material they require and the reason why.      This will inevitably
be very difficult as by definition unpublished material will not
have been seen by the police.       It is extremely unlikely that an
application for all unpublished material of an incident, on the
basis that it may contain relevant coverage, will be successful.

          SUEJECT:    SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS - SYP STANDING INSTRUCTIONS
                      FOR THE POLICING OF FOOTBALL MATCHES -
                      'EVACUATION AND STENARDING*




          The Interim Report of the Coamittee of Inquiry into Crowd Safety
          and Control of Sports Grounds, under the Chairmanship of
          Mr Justice Popplews11, was published in July 1985 and has been
          supplemented by Home Office Circular 54/85 which urges, amongst
          other things, chief officers of police to respond quickly and
          constructively to the spirit of the recommendations. The report
          contained 24 recarmendations including the following:

          Recommendation 1          -

          'Evacuation procedures should'be a-matter cf police'training
          and form part of the briefing by- police officers before a
          football match.1                -- •

          Recommendation 10

          'Stewards in all grounds should not only be trained in fire
          precautions and fixe fighting but should also be trained
          in how best to help the police in evacuation.'

          As you are aware, evacuation plans and the training of stewards
          have been examined. A cannon framework makes reference to plans

          stadium to contribute more effectively and with greater speed
          in an evacuation situation.

          In.drawing up the suggested format it was acknowledged that
          considerable flexibility is necessary to take account of the
          many local factors that make each ground unique.

          Whilst responsibility for the training of stewards lies firmly
          with the club, the police have a vested interest in maximising
          the crowd management potential of non police resources at sports
          grounds. To this end it is felt the police should provide a
          significant input into the training of stewards and that the new
          appendix on stewarding (attached) provides a satisfactory basis
          for ensuring adequate standards are achieved and maintained.

          Appendix 'L ', page 35 of the South Yorkshire.Police Standing
          Instructions for the Policing of Football Matches, should now be
          removed and replaced with the new Appendix.'L' pages 35 - 43,
          attached hereto.        ^                             •

          Page 2 of the Index of the Standing Instructions should also.be
          amended so that the last line reads - Appendix 'L' 3 5 - 4 3
          Emergency Evacuation Procedures/Stewards.

 Following the abolition of the County Councils on 31 March 1986,
 District Council Officers will be responsible for Safety of Sports
 Ground Act matters as from 1 April 1956, together with representation
 of the Local Building Authority, Fire Service and Police. It is not
 envisaged that this will have any significant effect on established

 at paragraph 16.1, pace 11, of the Standing Instructions. Reference
 made however in that paragraph to South Yorkshire County Council
 should be amended to read 'District Council'.

NOTE FOR FILE:


HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY - RECOMMENDATIONS
- AMBULANCE SERVICE


Had a meeting this date with Mr Alan Hopkins (Deputy Chief Ambulance Officer),
regarding recommendations 35 to 38 contained in the above Interim Report.

I said the probability is that in future we will specifically include in our
Operational Orders certain of the details required by virtue of these
recommendations and supply the Ambulance Service with an Order in advance of
each football game.

After discussion it was agreed that Mr Morley (Assistant Chief Ambulance
Officer) will be the nominated officer required at recommendation 35, to
liaise regularly at each stadia. He will do this together with subordinate
officers who will be appointed in respect of each ground.

It was seen that meetings twice a year outside the Safety Certificate meetings
may well be sufficient.

It was also agreed that after receipt of an Operational Order the Ambulance
Service will notify the Divisional Commander concerned of a specific liaison
officer who, should there be any changes we feel they need to be aware of,
will be available to be contacted both in the days preceding and on the day of
the match.  In this connection I will endeavour to achieve a similar
understanding with the Fire Service.

Taylor into the     circumstances surrounding the Hillsborough
Disaster.


1.2   -This paper is restricted insofar as it relates to those
parts of the Interim Report which deal with the communications
aspects of both the policing operation on the day and the
recommendations for the future.


1.3   Furthermore the examination of these actions raises the
important policy issue of financial responsibility which requires
resolution.




2    BACKGROUND INFORMATION


2.1  The circumstances of the disaster are      well   documented
eleswhere and do not require repetition here.


2.2   Suffice it to say that the events of Saturday 15th April
1989 were of tragic and mammoth proportions and the resulting
enquiry has scrutinsed many issues, including the communications
facilities provided.


2.3   The very nature of the document is that it is an 'interim'
report.    A further report is promised and it is possible that
additional recommendations may be made concerning communications
related matters.


2.4   In the aftermath of the disaster a written report was
prepared by Superintendent Parker which fully describes the
communications used for the policing of the semi-final and
immediate post-disaster period. A copy of his report appears at
Appendix I.

4     ANALYSIS OF INTERIM REPORT


4.1   This section of this paper describes in some greater detail
the areas identified at 3 above and makes brief comments
concerning them.
4.2   Fara Ref. 43 - 53:     This aspect deals with a physical
description of the Police Control Room. Mention is made of the
seating, closed circuit television, public address (Tannoy), and
both police and club radio schemes.

Comment:   No   comment is   necessary, these   passages are   purely
descriptive.


4.3   Para 65:   This section of the report deals with the crisis
at the turnstiles. Reference is made to the failure of the W15U
radio equipment (UHF base station) and the repair effected by a
radio technician.     Reference is also made to the use of the
Tannoy system and a loudspeaker system fitted to a police
vehicle - both are described as being of little effect.

Comment:   The failure of the W15U equipment can be remedied by
replacement with more sophisticated equipment     -   action in
respect of this has already commenced. A specific recommendation
(Rec 33) also refers to Public Address Systems.


4.4  Para 244:     Mention is made (referring to a point when Gate
'C' had been opened) that 'reception was difficult due to crowd
noise and possibly excessive air traffic on channel 25'.

Comment: Crowd noise is a major factor at Football matches. The
problem has been put to the ACPO Communications sub-committee at
the request of the Chairman, Mr B Johnson, QPM, Chief Constable,
Lancashire Constabulary (who was an assessor to Lord Justice
Taylor),  and it is possible a solution may be found.      Other
recommendations go some way to reducing the effects of this
problem.


4.5   Para 303:Refers to the breakdown in the      radio resulting
in total loss of Channel 25     for a short period and the implied
assumption (incorrect) that this resulted in the inability of the
Control Room to have supremacy over other users - this state of
affairs already existed on the W15U when operated on talk thru'.

Comment: Arrangements are already in hand to implement this by a
change of the UHF base stations.


4.6   Recommendation 21:  "Closed circuit television should be so
installed as to enable crowd densities outside the ground, within
concourse areas and in pens and other standing areas, to be
monitored before and throughout a match."

Comment:   This requires little amplification.      There is   a need
for additional CCTV equipment to be purchased.
4. i  £C6CCuiiii6nG.&L.xCii jO :             AW <«•

police control room         theresults of all closedcircuit television
monitoring outside          and inside the ground and the record of any
electronic or mechanical counting of numbers at turnstiles or of
numbers admitted to any area of            the ground. Officers   in the
control room should          be skilled inthe interpretation and use of
these data."

Comment: This seems to indicate that there is a need for police
control to have:
               (i)   the ability to monitor ALL turnstile CCTV
                      cameras (engineering changes required),
               (ii)  a record (electronic?) of numbers admitted
                      to separate areas of the ground
                      (engineering changes required), and,
               (iii)  training for officers in interpretation of
                      data recorded at (ii) above.


4.8   Recommendation 31:    "There should be sufficient operators
in the police    control room to enable all radio     transmissionsto
be received, evaluated and answered. The radio        systemshouldbe
such as to give operators in the control room priority over, and
the capacity to override,       others using the same channel.
Additional channels should be used, where necessary, to prevent
overcrowding of the airwaves. Consideration should be given to
sound-proofing the control room against excessive crowd noise."

Comment: This     requires the following action:
                (i)    A review of control room staffing
                        levels and the quality of controllers.
                (ii)   A replacement programme of the W15U radio
                        equipment with 'sub-divisional' type radio
                        schemes where the controller has supremacy
                        over all other users (already actioned).
                (iii) A review is required to see if additional
                        channels are required. This will vary from
                       match to match and ground to ground.
                (iv)   A review of control room accoustics is
                        required.


4.9   Recommendation 32:   "To complement radio communications,
there should be a completely separate system of land lines with
telephone links between the control room and key points at the
ground."

Comment:   This requires:
                (i)    a survey of each ground to identify the key
                      points and some standard formula (national?)
                      to apply in such identification.
                (ii)   a specification as to the type of instrument
                       to be attached to the landlines (a vandal-
                       p2T O O ft   V caw liS ir   pZDCX   V -w ".   E.
                       flashing light perhaps).


4.10 Recommendation 33:    "Within the control room there should
be a public address system to communicate with individual areas
outside and inside the ground with groups of areas or with the
whole ground.   Important announcements should be preceded by a
loud signal to catch the attention of the crowd    despite a high
level of noise in the ground.       This arrangemernt should be
prominently advertised on every programme sold for every match."

Comments A survey of existing public address systems should be
conducted and where necessary engineering changes made.


4.11 Recommendation 34:    "Use should be made where possible of
illuminated   advertising   boards    to   address   the  crowd.
Consideration should also be given to the use by police officers
of a simple code of hand signals to indicate to the control room
the existance of certain emergencies or requirements."

Comment:   There are two aspects to this:

                 (i)   the police should have the ability to insert
                       messages on such advertising boards where
                       they exist, and,

                 (ii) training in hand signals is required - in
                      view of the use of Mutual Aid at football
                      matches, a national system of semaphore may
                      be appropriate.


4.12   The   Interim   Report    has   indicated   that  certain
recommendations should be implemented prior to the commencement
of the next football season.       None of the recommendations
described herein fit that category; the requirement is however
that they should  'be started forthwith and completed as soon as
possible' (para 316).




5     ACTION TO BE TAKEN


5.1   A 'List of Actions' should be formulated to deal with the
recommendations contained in the Interim Report and which are
identified in this paper.  A provisional list appears at Section
6 of this report.
5.2   Many of the recommendations contain considerable financial
implications.    It is a matter of policy as to where those
Z. i n 3.11 C 3-ei.x r c S p O u S i D x x l c l S S   I T S S' C..




5.3   It is suggested that the List of Actions be examined and
categorised   as to     where responsibility   for finance    and
implementation resides.    In some cases this will lie with the
police,   in others the occupier of the ground and in some
instances this may be shared.   To assist in making an assessment
as to where that onus should lie, each action on the list is
followed by an indication which permits this information to be so
indicated.


5.4   Having identified and classified responsibilities indicated
at 5.3 above the occupiers should be informed of the police
intentions and agreement reached as to the standards to which
implementations should be made.


5.5    Irrespective of areas of responsibility it would be prudent
to invite Divisional Commanders in whose areas designated sports
grounds are situated to comment on any shortfalls which presently
exist.    Technical assistance may be required from Headquarters
Communications & Computer Development Department    (or eleswhere)
to aid this exercise.




6           LIST OF ACTIONS


6.1   The section of this paper contains a                                           list of   suggested
actions which now require to be taken:


6.2         CCTV facilities to be examined to ensure that crowd
            densities can be monitored as specified, any deficiencies
            to require installation.

                Re sponsibility:                                      Police/Occupier/Joint


6.3         Assessment required of ability to monitor ALL turnstile
            CCTV cameras, any deficiencies to require installation.

                Responsibility:                                       Police/Occupier/Joint


6.4         Assessment required to establish if results from
            electronic/mechanical devices are available in police
            control rooms, any deficiences require installation.
         Responsib ility         Police/Occupier/Join t



       Training for officers in interpretation of data, this
       will no doubt be unique to the equipment installed at
       each location.

         Responsibility          Police/Occupier/Joint

       (already actioned).

         Responsibility          Police/Occupier/Joint


6.8    Review of requirement for additional channels. This must
       change from venue to venue and from match to match and
       there is a need for a mechanism to ensure additional
       channels are available when so required by match
       commanders.

         Responsibility         Police/Occupier/Joint


6.9    Review of accoustics of police control room. Need
       for any soundproofing to be identified and actioned.

   REFERENCE TO COMMUNICATIONS EXTRACTED FROM


THE INTERIM REPORT BY THE RT HON LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR


      INTO THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER


                 15th APRIL 1989
                                                                CHAPTER 3
                                                      T H E CRISIS AT T H E TURNSTILES

    63. Ir. the 20 minutes from 2.30 prr. to 2.5 0 pm there were crucial developments both inside and outside
the ground. In pens 3 and 4 there was a steady increase in pressure as more fans came through the tunnel to the
f zvc ur sd area behind the gee!. By 2.5 0 pm these pen; were already full :c a degree which caused serious
disco mfo rt to m a m well used to enduring pressure on terraces. Th e numbers at that ti me were cieariy in excess
o f the m a x i m u m density stated by the H o m e Office Gu id e to Safety at Sports Grounds (1 9S6 Edn) (the Green
Guide') i.e. 5-4 persons per 10 square metres. (Although the Green Guide has no statutory or legal force, it is the
only official advice available about safety at sports grounds.) In the wing pens 1. 2. 6 and 7. there was still
ample room and bare patches o f concrete were visible.

   6 - . Meanwhile, the crowd grew at the Leppings Lane entrance. As more arrived at the back the crush a:.the
front grew worse. Entry to the turnstiles became more difficult. Their efficiency was impaired and their rate
reduced. Arrivals at the back exceeded deliveries through the turnstiles, so the build-up increased. The foot
officers outside were unable to function and in danger themselves so they went through the turnstiles and out
again through gate C where they did what they could to relieve pressure by the tubular barrier. The mounted
officers were surrounded by the dense mass o f people and became ineffective. Superintendent Marshall was in
the midst o f the turmoil. He extricated h im s el f and stood on a parapet o f the bridge to get a clear view. A
drunken fan tried to push him off: a beer can was thrown at a mounted officer. But these were isolated acts by
individuals: the men ace came from the massive numbers single-mindedly determined to be in for the kick-off
with time running out. At the back o f the crowd fans were frustrated by the lack o f progress as 3 o'clock
approached. Some, mostly young men w ho had been drinking, tried to push and force their way forward. At
the front, people were j a m m e d together and against the turnstile walls. S o m e panicked as the pressure
intensified. S om e youngsters and w o m e n were fainting and in distress. They were helped out through the
tubular barrier by turnstile G or were passed over the turnstiles elsewhere. Fans cl imbed up and over the
turnstile building or on to the dividing fence. This was to escape the crush rather than to gain free entry since
most o f them had tickets.

    65. At 2.44 pm Mr Marshall radioed for reinforcements, for the Tannoy to request the crowd to stop
pushing and for a vehicle with loudspeaker eq ui pm en t to co m e and request the same. Unhappily, at about 2.40
pm. radio co m m u n ic a t io n on channel 25 beca me defective. For a period o f two or three minutes the control
room lost contact. A co m m un ic a ti on s officer ca m e promptly and sw-itched to the standby station. With the use
o f a handset at control, contact was restored. Desp ite this hiatus, two o f Mr Marshall's requests were received.
T h e Tannoy was used but with little effect. Reinforcements, including moun ted officers from Penistone Road,
were sent. T h e third request, for a Landrover. was received direct by its driver PC Buxton w ho arrived at 2.46
pm and urged the crowd by loudspeaker not to push. This was no more effective than the Tannoy. The
m o u n te d officers besieged near the turnstiles cam e outside the perimeter gates. An attempt was made to shut
them against the crowd outside, to enable the throng inside to be dispersed or at least thinned through the
turnstiles. The pressure from without, however, op en ed the gates again. Mounted officers, now reinforced to
greater numbers, formed a cordon across the elbow o f Leppings Lane from the sweet shop to the bridge, again
with the object o f reducing pressure inside the gates.. They were successful in this for s o m e minutes despite
desperate individuals forcing their way under or betw een the horses. How ever, this exercise was overtaken by a
m ore dramatic relief o f the pressure.

“ Open the Gates”
    66. Between 2.40 pm and 2.45 pm the crowd inside and outside the turnstile approach had swelled to
over 5.000. At the head o f the phalanx conditions had b eco m e intolerable. Those who got through were short
o f breath and sweating profusely. Many com p la in ed to police officers on the concourse inside the turnstiles
and asked them in forceful terms to do something. Exit gates A and B w ere being shaken. It was clear the crow d
could not pass through the turnstiles b> 3 pm. Police Constable Buxton radioed from the Landrov er to control

  67. Superintendent Marshall realised the crowd had b eco m e unmanageable. Although loth to do so. since it
was contrary to basic police strategy, he decided to request the exit gates be op en ed to relieve the pressure.
Otherwise, he feared fatalities would occur. Other senior officers outside the ground agreed. At 2.47 pm he
radioed control to permit the gates to be opened. At 2.48 pm. whilst Mr Duckenfield was considering the
request, gate C op ene d to eject a youth w ho had climbed in with no ticket. Immediately, fans outside took
advantage and about 150 managed to get in before a m ounted officer enabled the gate to be closed again. Mr
Marshall repeated his request. Still no response from control. He repeated it a third time, adding that if the

    w i n d o w . Although they had no field-glasses. there was the zo om facility or. the T \ camera. Tne radio was by
    then working again and although reception was difficult due to crowd noise and possibly excessive air traffic
    on channel 25. attempts could have been made to aiert officers on the perimeter track to watch for
    overcrowdine and report their observations. In the event, pens 3 and 4 became more and more crowded, surge*
    lo c k place, fans were show ;ng and signalling distress. N o n e of this was seer, or recognisec in the control room.

    Officers on the Track
      2 - 5 . The 20 officers detailed to the perimeter track were distributed round the pitch so that some live
    officers were a: the west end. Their written instructions made no reference to the av oid an ce or detection ot
    overcrow dine. The same applied to the otticers in the w est stand. Mr G re en w oo d a d m it t ec that his orui
    briefings also contained no mention of monitoring the pens tor ov ercrowding.

       246. Th e Operational Order for 1         had instructed officers 10 forbid anyone access to the track from the
    terraces without the consent o f a senior officer (except to receive medical attention) . At the end o f the 19SS


•   semi-final, there was a minor pitch invasion. A c c o r d i n g l y , that prohibition was empha sis ed in the 19Sv
    Operational Order by being put into capita! letters. The comb ination of no instructions as to overcrow ding and
    a strong prohibition on op ening the gates was likely to make police recognition oi crushing slow and their
    response reluctant. Small wond er that the growing pressure and congestion between 2.5 0 pm and 2.59 pm
    w ent unheeded or certainly unremedied. Even when officers recognised there was a problem, the rule required
    conse nt o f a senior officer before a gate could be opened.

      247. "Senior officer” meant an officer o f Inspector rank or higher. The Inspector in charge o f the 20 officers
    on the track was Mr Darling. He stationed h im s el f by the players' tunnel, the most central position for
    supervising his men. In evi dence he said:

       “ I woul d only take action if I thought crowding had got to such a stage that the fans vvere in danger. I d then
       inform ground control and I would expect s o m e o n e deployed to the back o f the stand.

      That underlines the inhibition against open ing perimeter gates. So did the evidence oi one Constable w ho
    said it had been so d ru m m ed into officers not to open the gates that when he saw distress inpen 4. he debated^
    with h im s el f before op ening the gate, thinking: “If I’m wrong. I m going to get a right bollocking for this.
    Nsturallv. one vvould hope that c o m m o n sense and humanity would make so m e officers cut through the rules
    and open a gate if fans were clearly in distress.

        248. This is what happened, but not until officers recognised the distress and even then not immediately.
    H ence, gates 3 and 4. having been opened, were shut again before they were finally o p ene d and at iirst those
    seeking to climb out cv er the fence were pushed back. This reaction o f the police d:d r.ot go on for as long a5
    s o m e witnesses believed. Thev probably misinterpreted the hand mo vem ent s from Mr Gr ee nwo od and others
    aim ed at persuading fans to m ove back and relieve the pressure as attempts to stop those climbing out at the
    front.

      249. Nev ertheless, there was a period during which the failure to recognise the problem and the inhibition
    against tackling it caused vital time to be lost.

   FIN/FEP
     7/19/1988
                             LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS


SPECIFIC POLICE A CTION R E Q UIRED :

Recommendation No. (Asterisk signifies a recommendation which must be resolved
                    before the new season 19.08.89).

*     3    Counting spectators into self-contained pens. Who is going to do it?
           Police or Stewards? How is it to be achieved? Tickets, Enumerator etc.


*     4    Written agreement between club and police setting out their respective
            responsibilities for crowd safety and control and, in particular, for the
            filling of self contained pens or terraced area and the monitoring of
            spectators therein.

           Thoughts:    i) Perhaps ask clubs for early drafts - take best policies
                           of each and negotiate amendments to drafts. (Clubs should
                           be encouraged to adopt greater responsibilities).

                        ii) Does it need legal authority?


* 5        A steward or police officer to be charged at every match with monitoring
           crowd levelsin self contained  pen or terraced area.

           Thoughts:    i) Steward role surely.    However;

                        ii) Is it politically expedient for South Yorkshire
                            Police to be seen taking an active interest in
                            crowd safety for first few games?

                       iii) If the police took on the task there is a danger
                            of an officer being fixed with other demands - e.g.
                            a necessary arrest or preventing pitch invasion etc.



      6.   Police officers and stewards to be briefed and trained in recognising crowd
           densities.

           Training to include demonstrations and photographs designed to enable that
           recognition.

           Thoughts:    i)    Photographs probably available from HSE.

                        ii) Are police to be responsible for training stewards.

                       iii) Photos are probably best medium as it might be
                            difficult to train every police officer by way of
                            physical demonstration.

*     8    All perimtere fence gates to be left open whilst spectators on terrace.
* 9    A police officer (not steward) to be responsible for each gate (group of
        gates if close together) and to decide whether to allow spectators through
        to prevent overcrowding.

       To be identified before game and his/her duty known to all other police
       officers and stewards.

       He should be in radio contact with match control.

       Thoughts:    i)   This could be the same officer referred
                          to in 5 above.

                    ii) He must be protected from other distractions.


* 10   Suitable cutting equipment to be provided by the club. Decision to use it
        lies with senior police officer. Agreement to be reached as to who is to
       use it, e.g. police, fire brigade or stewards.

       Thoughts:    i)   Recommends not police - additional training, and
                         responsibilities for maintaining and checking equipment.


* 24   Any information on tickets issued by club to be reviewed in conjunction with
        police.

       Thoughts:    i)   Only relevant to large matches.

                    ii) Particularly relevant to SWFC in respect of forthcoming
                        Everton game.


* 26   Chief Constable to appoint a chief officer to liaise with the management of
       each football club and L.A., re safety and control of crowds.

       A.C.C. (Operations) ?


* 27   Operational orders, and pre-match briefing to alert all officers to
       importance of overcrowding and appropriate steps for dealing with it.

       Thoughts:    i)   Earliest notification to ground control appears to be
       paramount.


* 28   Operational orders to incorporate contingency plans for dealing with any
       foreseeable pattern of spectator arrival/departure. Sufficient reserves to
       be on hand to enable rapid deployment to any point inside or outside the
       ground.


* 29   Option to postpone kick-off remains with officer in command at ground.
       Crowd safety should be paramount consideration in deciding whether to
       exercise it.
     Thoughts:    i) Suggest Ground Commanders meeting debate the option.    It
     does not lend itself to written instruction.


30. Police control room to have all CCTV monitoring available to it and record
    of any electronic or mechanical turnstile counts.

     Thoughts:    SWFC have already offered to provide such
                  facility.


31   Sufficient operators in police control room to enable all transmission to be
     dealt with.

     Communication system should give priority to control.

     Additional channels should be available, where necessary, to prevent
     overcrowind of airwaves.

     Consider sound-proofing control room.

     Thoughts:    i) New 'sub-divisional type' of system should facilitate
                      priority of control.

                  ii) Discussions already in hand about the inability of a
                      'command' channel to prevent overcrowding.


32   Separate system of landlines around ground.

     Thoughts:    i) Long term project?


33   P.A.S. within control room to communicate with individual areas.   Important
     announcements to be preceded with loud tone.


34. Use to be made of electronic scoreboard to address crowd.

     Police to consider semaphore signals in case of emergencies.

     Thoughts:    i) E-lectronic scorebard at SWFC only I believe.   ’F' Commander
                      to progress.

                  ii) Semaphore ought to have some rational basis.   ACPO?
Emergency services to maintain, through senior nominated
officers, regular liaison concerning crowd safety.

Thoughts i) Who is to be nominated?   Seniority?


Before each match, police to provide details - routes
taken, venue, crowd expected etc - to emergency services


Contingency plans for emergency vehicle access etc. to be
reviewed.

To include routes of access, rendezvous and accessibility
within ground.

Thought i) Officer at 35 above to pursue.


Officers at entrance to ground to be briefed as to
contingency plans for arrival of emergency services and
should be informed whenever emergency services are called
             H I L L S B O R O U G H INQUIRY - INTERIM REPORT RECOMMENDATIONS



Points still to be considered:-



 1.   Progress towards achieving agreement with the 'police stance'.


2.    How to deal with dissenting views.                                         , //_<
                                                                                 6   °

 3.   The production of a written agreement document.          Check that this
      covers all the relevant recommendations.                                       .        .
                                                                    7   '            f /J-0
                                     s                             &
4.    Consider again the impact o/i the recommendations beyond the written
      agreement requirement and further action required in every case.


5.    Consider carefully the recommendations not dealt with in terms of the
      impact on ourselves and further action required.


6.    Consider the Inquiry report of itself re. lessons to be learned outside
      these specific recommendations 1 - 4 3 and our reaction to this.


 7.   Consider the 43 recommendations against (a) the Popplewell Report and,
      (b) the Green Guide, to see the impact of these on ourselves and what S*q / £
      further action is required.


8.    Appoint someone to start drafting a 'model' Operational Order. Special
      attention must be paid to recommendation 27 which is to do with (a)
      increased awareness and (b) the need for agreement with the club
      regarding contingency action should problems arise.

      Regarding recommendation 28 which is concerned with identifying
      foreseeable patterns of spectator behaviour immediately before and after
      matches, these need to be identified.

      It may be sensible for one or more individuals on the working group to
      then consider contingency plans in broad terms sufficient to be included
      in Operational Orders before the start of the forthcoming season.
      Consider also requirements at recommendations 36/38 in terms of the need
      for Orders to reflect these.


 9.   Appoint someone to consider our football policy document in terms of its            ^   -
      necessary re-draft.


10.   Appoint someone to consider the on-costs, if any, from the above which

NOTE FOR FILE:



HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY - RECOMMENDATIONS
- FIRE BRIGADE


This date spoke with Mr Harry Wright (Chief Fire Officer) regarding
recommendations 35 to 38 contained in the above Interim Report.

After discussion we agreed that in future we (the police) will include in our
Operational Orders information in relation to those specific recommendations
concerning the involvement or possible involvement of the emergency services
at football events.

We further agreed that Mr Alan Seaman (Assistant Chief Fire Officer) will be
the nominated officer as required at recommendation 35 to liaise regularly in
respect of arrangements County wise. He will do this by way of internal
liaison with the relevant Divisional Commander.

It was further agreed that for the time being meetings at the rate of twice
per year, apart from the Safety Certificate meetings, will satisfy the
requirements for 'regularity'.

Further that on receipt of Operational Orders the Divisional Commanders in
each area, or their Deputies, will be the liaison officers in respect of any
alterations which occur after they have received our Operational Orders.

The above is precisely the same understanding arrived at with the Ambulance
Service and will form the basis of our liaison arrangements unless changed.

Enclosure
      AGREEMENT      BETWEEN


ROTHERHAM   UNITED    FOOTBALL    CLUB


            AND   THE


    SOUTH   YORKSHIRE    POLICE
This document is a written agreement between South Yorkshire Police (hereafter

referred to as 'The Police') and Rotherham United Football Club (hereafter

referred to as 'The Club').




This agreement signed on behalf of both parties is created in pursuance of

recommendation four of the Interim Report of the Inquiry held by The Rt Hon

Lord Justice Taylor into the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster of 15 April 1989.




The agreement between The Police and The Club is as follows




Maximum Capacities for Terraces

The Club will be responsible for limiting the number of spectators entering

each self-contained pen or area to the maximum capacity figure assessed in

accordance with recommendation two of the Interim Report.




The Club will do this by means of the computerised system which records the

number of persons passing through each turnstile.




The Club will inform the police control room when a particular pen or area is

approaching capacity.   The Club will be responsible for closing off further

access to a pen or area when its maximum capacity is about to be reached.      The

Police accept The Club may on occasions have difficulties in this regard,

therefore, The Police will provide assistance if necessary.




The Police accept that denial of access to any part of the ground may create

public order problems in respect of spectators so excluded and The Police will

prepare contingency plans to deal with such situations.




Filling and Monitoring Terraces

The Club will provide on the perimeter track a steward for each pen or

terraced area during such times that there are spectators in that pen or
terraced area.     The sole duty of these stewards, who will be in addition to

any other stewards employed by The Club, will be to check crowd conditions in

the pen or terraced area to which they are assigned for possible overcrowding

or distress.     The Club will provide The Police with a plan of the ground

showing where the stewards with this responsibility will be situated.




The Police will provide in respect of each gate in the perimeter fence (or

group of gates if they are close together) police officers authorised to

decide whether or not to allow spectators through a gate to relieve

overcrowding.




All police officers deployed at perimeter gates which will be kept fully open

at all times when spectators are on the terraces, will be authorised as above.

Each will be in possession of a police radio in direct contact with police

ground control and will be identifiable by a distinctive coloured tabard.




The stewards checking the crowd for overcrowding or distress will not be

issued with police radios but the police officers on the gates and perimeter

track will communicate to police ground control any relevant matter brought to

their attention by these stewards.




Cutting Equipment

The Club will provide and make readily available suitable and sufficient

cutting equipment to permit the immediate removal of enough fencing to release

numbers of spectators if necessary.     This cutting equipment will be operated

by employees of The Club who will be trained in its use.     The use of such

equipment will be at the discretion of the nominated senior police officer who

will be the officer in charge of policing the event.
Liaison

Before each match both parties to this agreement will liaise in respect of the

following matters:-

     i)   the anticipated number of spectators expected having regard

          to the separate supporter groups;




    ii)   the method of crowd segregation (if any) intended to be used;




   iii)   any information in relation to crowd problems;




    iv)   the number and location of turnstiles to be made available

          to each group;




     v)   an estimation of the time it will take each group to pass

          through the turnstiles;

                           4




    vi)   where tickets are used, that the information on those tickets

          corresponds with the planned arrangements for admitting

           spectators to the ground.




Postponement of kick-off is at the discretion of the police officer in command

at the ground.   It is therefore essential The Club provide a telephone link

between the referee's room and the police control room.




The Police have prepared contingency plans for the event of emergency services

being called to the ground.    These include routes of access, rendezvous

points, accessibility within the ground and routes of egress.    The Police will

liaise with The Club concerning these arrangements whenever these plans are

amended or as otherwise appropriate.
The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police has nominated his Deputy,

Mr Peter Hayes QPM LLB MA, as the Chief Officer with responsibility for

liaison with the management of each football club and local authority

concerned in respect of the safety and control of crowds.




Any variation of this agreement in respect of a particular match will be

agreed by the parties in advance in writing.

INTERIM REPORT OF LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR

In pursuance of recommendation 26 of the above Report, the Chief Constable,
Mr Peter Wright CBE OStJ CBIM, has nominated me as the Chief Officer who is to
liaise with the management of each of the South Yorkshire football clubs and
local authorities concerned in respect of the safety and control of crowds.

I have formed an implementation team comprising senior police officers who
regularly have the responsibility for policing football grounds in the County,
to discharge those of Lord Justice Taylor's recommendations which fall to the
police. This important task requires of the police a consistent policy across
the Force area.

The primary concern of the South Yorkshire Police in this review, is to ensure
the safety of the public who attend football matches in South Yorkshire.  I
know you share these concerns and I look forward to continued co-operation and
liaison between ourselves to this end.

In consultation with your club I have had prepared a document which proposes
an agreement between the police and the club, setting out the respective
responsibilities of both parties for crowd safety and control.  I ask please
that the Club Secretary on your behalf signs the agreement at the earliest
opportunity thus enabling us jointly to fulfil our responsibilities as set out
at recommendation four of the Report, namely, that such an agreement is
established before the start of the 1989/90 football season.

The timescale for implementing these interim recommendations has not allowed
us to meet personally.  I look forward to our meeting at the earliest
opportunity and wish your football club a safe and successful season.

Yours sincerely

Enclosure
      AGREEMENT BETWEEN

SHEFFIELD UNITED FOOTBALL CLUB

           AND THE

    SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE
This document is a written agreement between South Yorkshire Police (hereafter

referred to as   'The Police') and Sheffield United Football Club (hereafter

referred to as   'The Club').




This agreement signed on behalf of both parties is created in pursuance of

recommendation   four of the Interim Report of the Inquiry held   by The Rt Hon

Lord Justice Taylor   into the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster of   15 April 1989.




The agreement between The Police and The Club is as follows:-




Maximum Capacities for Terraces

The Club will be responsible for limiting the number of spectators entering

each self-contained pen or area to the maximum capacity figure assessed in

accordance with recommendation two of the Interim Report.




The Club will do this by means of the computerised system which records the

number of persons passing through each turnstile.     The Spion Kop is divided

into two pens.   One pen is entered via turnstiles in John Street, the other by

turnstiles in Shoreham Street.    The Club will provide stewards to prevent a

cross flow of spectators from one pen to the other.




The Club will inform the police control room when a particular pen or area is

approaching capacity.   The Club will be responsible for closing off further

access to a pen or area when its maximum capacity is about to be reached.         The

Police accept The Club may on occasions have difficulties in this regard,

therefore, The Police will provide assistance if necessary.




The Police accept that denial of access to any part of the ground may create

public order problems in respect of spectators so excluded and The Police will

prepare contingency plans to deal with such situations.
Filling and Monitoring Terraces

The Club will provide on the perimeter track a steward for each pen or

terraced area during such times that there are spectators in that pen or

terraced area.    The sole duty of these stewards, who will be in addition to

any other stewards employed by The Club, will be to check crowd conditions in

the pen or terraced area to which they are assigned for possible overcrowding

or distress.     The Club will provide The Police with a plan of the ground

showing where the stewards with this responsibility will be situated.




The Police will provide in respect of each gate in the perimeter fence (or

group of gates if they are close together) police     officers authorised to

decide whether or not to allow spectators      through a gate to      relieve

overcrowding.




All police officers deployed at perimeter gates which will be kept fully open

at all times when spectators are on the terraces, will be authorised as above.

Each will be in possession of a police radio in direct contact with police

ground control and will be identifiable by a distinctive coloured tabard.




The stewards checking the crowd for overcrowding or distress will not be

issued with police radios but the police officers on the gates and perimeter

track will communicate to police ground control any relevant matter brought to

their attention by these stewards.




Cutting Equipment

The Club will provide and make readily available suitable and sufficient

cutting equipment to permit the immediate      removal of enough fencing to release

numbers of spectators if necessary.     This   cutting equipment will be operated

by employees of The Club who will be trained in its use.      The use of such

equipment will be at the discretion of the nominated senior police officer who

will be the officer in charge of policing the event.
Liaison

Before each match both parties to this agreement will liaise in respect of the

following matters

     i)   the anticipated number of spectators expected having regard

          to the separate supporter groups;




    ii)   the method of crowd segregation (if any) intended to be used;




   iii)   any information in relation to crowd problems;




    iv)   the number and location of turnstiles to be made available

          to each group;




     v)   an estimation of the time it will take each group to pass

          through the turnstiles;




    vi)   where tickets are used, that the information on those tickets

           corresponds with the planned arrangements for admitting

           spectators to the ground.




Postponement of kick-off is at the discretion of the police officer in command

at the ground.      It is therefore essential The Club provide a telephone link

between the referee's room and the police control room.




The Police have prepared contingency plans for the event of emergency services

being called to the ground.     These include routes of access, rendezvous

points, accessibility within the ground and routes of egress.      The Police will

liaise with The Club concerning these arrangements whenever these plans are

amended or as otherwise appropriate.
The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police has nominated his Deputy,

Mr Peter Hayes QPM LLB MA, as the Chief Officer with responsibility for

liaison with the management of each football club and local authority

concerned in respect of the safety and control of crowds.




Any variation of this agreement in respect of a particular match will be

agreed by the parties in advance in writing.

        SUBJECT:   WRITTEN AGREEMENTS BETWEEN SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE
                   AND FOOTBALL CLUBS




        In order to fulfil our responsibilities as set out in the
        recommendations of the Taylor Interim Report concerning the written
        agreements referred to above, I have prepared a form of agreement in
        respect of each football club within South Yorkshire. Two copies of
        this, each signed by me, are enclosed.

        I require a member of the Implementation Team in each Division to
        personally read very carefully the form of agreement to ensure it is
        accurate in all respects.

        Once accuracy is established a further requirement is for the agreement
        to be taken by hand and delivered to the club. Both copies should be
        signed by a responsible member of the club, if possible the Club
        Secretary, and returned to my office by noon tomorrow (Wednesday
        16 August).

        Also enclosed is a letter addressed to the Chief Executive of your
        particular local authority area which contains a copy of the agreement.
        This correspondence must also be delivered by hand, preferably this
        date, and I require you to have recorded the fact the correspondence has
        been delivered.

FINANCE AND GENERAL PURPOSE

15 SEPTEMBER 1939

JOINT REPORT OF THE CHIEF CONSTABLE AND THE CLERJ. AND FINANCIAL OFFICER


RADIO INSTALLATIONS AT FOOTBALL LEAGUE GROUNDS


          Ma-ter for Cons idsration

         To obtain approval for the purchase of radio equipment to upgrade the
         police communications facility at football league grounds in the Force
         area.

         Backaround Information

         Radio communication to support the policing of games at the five
         football league grounds in the Force is provided by equipment which is
         independent of the permanent installations in Sub-Divisions. For each
         of the clubs there is a permanent aerial installation which gives radio
         cover within and around the ground and the equipment which controls the
         transmission and receipt of messages, known as the base station, is
         located in the police control room.

         As a result of recent events action has already been taken to make
         improvements to the radio facilities at the Hillsborough stadium,
         Sheffield.

3        Comments

         The base stations used at football grounds were provided by the
         Directorate of Telecommunications and have been in use for many years.
         They are designed as portable equipment and were originally intended to
         provide temporary communications for unforeseen or individual events.
         As the scale o f , police activity at football matches has increased in
         recent years the temporary base stations have been taken into permanent
         use at all the grounds.

         The temporary base stations are technically different to the permanent
         installations which support the routine policing in Sub-Divisions. The
         permanent base stations are manufactured with an automatic stand-by
         capability which gives backup support in the event of equipment
         failure. The change from one position to the other is achieved by a
         simple button operation.
     There is also a significant difference in the operation of the
     permanent equipment in connection vith the levs! of control achieved.
     One of the features of all police radio is the ability to allow
     individual officers to talk directly with others on ths sane radio
     channel without the message having to be relayed by the control room.
     Such an arrangement is known as 'talk-thro1 and is activated by the
     controller.

     At football matches it is often, desirable for operational reasons to
     run the radio system on 'talk-thro', so that officers working ir. such a
     close environment ars aware of the activity which is taking place
     around thea and which may affect their arsa of responsibility.

     On the temporary equipment used at the grounds the operational
     advantage of 'talk-thro' is minimised because technically the base
     station gives priority to the messages from officers and prevents the
     control position from transmitting. This is a weakness in the design
     of the equipment. The permanent base stations are designed to overcome
     this deficiency and whilst 'taik-thro' is in operation it is always
     possible for the controller to give directions about the police
     operation and maintain overall command of the situation.

     In addition it is possible to connect a simple tape recorder to the
     permanent base station so that all radio messages can subsequently be
     analysed if difficulties are experienced.

     To improve the communications equipment capability at the football
     grounds it is desirable that the present portable equipment is replaced
     with permanent base station installations.

     The budgetary cost of purchase and installation of permanent base
     stations is £5000 per site.       Information from the Directorate of
     Telecommunications is that sufficient sets can be obtained from
     Phillips Radio Communication System Ltd. under an existing contract
     between-the two organisations. Using the Directorate's installation
     staff it would then be possible to install permanent base stations at
     all grounds within 3 months. If the equipment were to be provided by a
     different supplier then the manufacturing timescale would be in excess
     of 12 months.

4.   Financial Implications

     A sum of £100,100 is included within the Capital Programme under the
     heading   "Communications  : Misc. Equipment 1988/89" (Item 14) of which
     only £36,100 has been approved to date as a Capital Estimate. Adequate
     provision    exists   within   the remaining sum for these proposed
     installations.
              Estimated annual revenue costs would bs £4,100     for   debt   charges     and
              £l,fCC for maintenance.

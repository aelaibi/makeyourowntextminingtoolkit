Dear


Thank you for your letter of 19 May to the Prime Minister which
has    been       passed     to   this      department             in       view      of     our
responsibilities for safety at sports grounds.                            I apologise for
the delay in replying to you.


Nr Bilbe has       explained      to you,    in his         reply        to your      earlier
letter,     why    the     Government      supports        Lord        Justice       Taylor's
recommendations concerning all seated accomodation and is urging
Football League clubs to implement them.


Under the Football Spectators Act 1989 the Football Licensing
Authority      (FLA)   has recently been established.                            This will    be
responsible for issuing licenses to all grounds designated under
the Act,       namely grounds where matches between members of                               the
Football League will be played.             Such a match will not be allowed
to take place if a license has not been issued to that ground.
One of the conditions of a license                   is    likely to be              that    the
ground    is    complying     with   the    timetable          recommended           by     Lord
Justice Taylor for providing seated accomodation only.                               Clubs in
Divisions 1 and 2 of the Football league will be required to be
all seated by August 1994 and those in Divisions 3 and 4 will
have to be so by August 1999.              Failure to meet these deadlines
may result in a license being refused.                    It is expected that the
first licenses will be issued prior to the start of the 1992/93
season.
Consequently   Arsenal   FC   will   be   required    to   provide    seated
accomodation only by August 1994.


                                                     Yours sincerely

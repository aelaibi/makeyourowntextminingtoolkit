             I am a single man residing at the above a d d r e s s ,

             On the afternoon of Saturday 15 April          1989 <150489)     I attended the

             FA Cup Semi Final      football match between Liverpool and Nottingham

             Forest at the Hi 11 sborough Footjj*all Ground in Sheffield.

             I attended as a Liverpool suapo rte r. I have supported Liverpool all

             my life.        X used to atten^/their home matches regularly at Anfield,

             but only go to a few home matches now.

             I got my match ticket from                               bought the tickets from

             somebody at the                                               My match ticket was

             for the Leppings LN terracing and the face value was six pounds.                  I

             paid seven pounds and fifty pence for the ticket.

             I. travelled te^ the game with the f o l o w i n g   people-

    All of these have recently been seen by the Police.

    We travelled to Sheffield in                            private car

    I dont remember which route we took to Sheffield but I know that we

    got very lost on the way and at one stage we were following Everton

    supporters who were travelling to Birmingham for the other Semi F i n a l >

    We made one stop at services somewhere on the motorway for something

    to eat.        I c a n ’t remember where we stopped.      There was one hold up on

    the way,       it was a traffic jam somewhere,     but I can't remember where.

    We eventually arrived in Sheffield and parked in a side s tr ee t, not

    far away from the gr ou nd .        I can ’t remember the name of the side

    street but it was only a few minutes walk to the ground.               I can’t

    remember what time it was when we parked the car.               I had been asleep

    for most of the journey between Liverpool and Sheffield and

    d o n ’t remember that much about it.        We left the car and started

    walking towards the ground,          hoping to find a pub that was open.         I

    hadn't been to Hi 1lsborough before and X w a s n ’t sure of the exact way

    to the ground.        X d o n ’t think that the other     lads had been to

    the ground before either.           It was easy enough to find the ground,           it
    %
    r
y   was just a case of following the crow d.           We soon got to Lappings LN

    without finding a pub that was open.            We decided to carry on walking

    past the ground and we found a Gateway Supermarket that was open,                    only

    a few minutes away from the ground.            There were a lot of other

    supporters around the ground at that time and they a l 1 appeared happy

    and in good spirits.            I had seen supporters drinking from cans in the

    street.        In fact it was that that made us look around to see where

    they were getting the cans of beer from.            I did not sej? any fighting

    or any other sort of disorder.

    M y s e 1f .              and               each bought         cans of beer from
                                                                                                  PAGE            3
                                                                                                  S34G9

                   the Supermarket and sat on the gra^s outside drinking them.                 There

                   were a lot of other Liverpool S u p p o r t e r s also buying cans of beer from

                   the Sup erm a rk et »                     w a s n ’t with us at the Supermarket,     he

                   had gone to find something to eat.             He joined us back at the

                   Supermarket after about ten minutes and said we should make our way

                   back to the ground.

                   As we were walking back towards the ground,             somewhere near to a

                   service station.        We were stopped by a Policeman.         We were stopped

                   because we were still drinking from a ca n.             The Policeman told us to

                   either finish the can or to 1eave them behind.               I put my can d o w n .       We

    _              then carried on walking to the ground.

            ^     We arrived at the turnstile area in Leppin#s LN at about half                  past two

I       i       > (1430).     11 was very busy in the t u r n s L O e area at that time.          The

                  area between the turnstiles and the/outer              perimeter gates was full

                  with people.       The crowd stretchers back to the road,         ending at the

                   outer gates.      There were no \*ral queues,        just a lot of people packed

                   into the area.      There was a lot of singing from the crowd.             We were

                   still all together and we were going to try to get to tha^turnstile on

                   the extreme    left as you lyok from the ga t e s .        Thereyas   one policeman
■Pauc<£-
  /y-j—  on           horseback amongst             crowd,    trying to get people into lines,        but

                   he couldn’t do a n y v m n g .    The crowd was still moving and we were

                   gett ing neare r the turnstile all the t im e.          Being in that crowd

                   outside the turnstile was like standing on the Kop at Anfield,                 it was

                   packed but not a crush.          As we got nearer the turnstiles there was

                   another Po 1 i ceman on foot standing agains^/fthe wall near to the blue

                   gates on our left.        This Policeman wa^rshouting to the crowd to get

                   into lines,    but it was impossibie/Co do that.            It took us about

                   fifteen minutes to reach the left hand turnstile.               We had all managed

                   to stay together and we all got through that turnstile at the same

                   time.    I went through the turnstile and handed my ticket to the

          turnstile operator.       He handed me the stub portion back.       I had not

          seen any unauthorised entry to the ground whilst outside the

          turnstiles.       I did not see any stewards outside the turnstiles.        We

          got into the ground at about quarter to three          (1445).

Bo d Y Once inside the ground 1 rememberXThere being Policemen on the
scenes'
CH      ur ns i *e5 w ^° were s e a r c h i n ^ e o p l e as they came through. None of

          us were searched.       I do nWT remember seeing any signs giving

          directions to the terraces and all        1 saw was the tunnel that runs

          underneath the stand.       I had not been to the ground before and I

          thought that tunnel must have been the only way onto the terraces.                We

          all made straight towards the tunnel because we had been late getting

          into the ground and wanted to get straight onto the ter races.

          From the time that I entered the ground I did not see any people

          fighting or any sort of disorder.         I <^ldn’t see any people drinking,

Ort       We all walked along the tunnel together ar,d were able to walk along it

          quite freely.       I seem to remembejr seeing two Policemen somewhere near

          really doing anything.         djfd not see any Policemen inside the tunne 1

          I did not see any stewards either at the tunnel entrance or anywhere

          inside    it.

          At the end of the tunnel      it was fairly packed on the ter races behind

          the g o a l .   We all went to the right hand jride at the end of the tunnel

          and   into what    1 now know to be pen nura^Der three.    At the time I

          thought it was one large area behind the goals.           As soon as we got

          into pen three we pushed our way through the crowd without too much

          difficulty.       It was packed,   but you could still move through the crowd

          fairly easily.       Shortly after entering the pen we found a place behind

          a crush barrier and we decided to watch the match frjtfn there.           The

          barr ier was not far away from t he tu nne l, f o rward yfown the pen and

          slightly to the right.       We got to this position yft about two forty

         had not come onto the pitch yet.             I was standing up against the

         barrier,    but I was able to hold my arms outstretched against the

         barrier.     The other     lads were behind me,        on the next step up, over my

         left sho ulder. We hadn't been in that spot very long, when I saw Gary

         CHURCH talking to the others.  Gary was standing on the same step as

         the others,      on the other side of the lads from where I was standing.

         Gary CHURCH was known to us all.            We we re all sayi ng to Gary "Alr i ght

         Gary hows it going."         That sort of thing.         After    i i w ^ f \ e r e was just

         general talk between Gary and the lads.                I was/'t rally talking to

         Gary because I was furthest away from him.                 I      r enjgaroer Gary saying

         that he had swapped his match ticket and got a ticket for the

         terracing.       During the time that we were          in that position and w h i 1e

         Gary was with us it was becoming more and more packed in the pen and

         at the same time getting tighter and tighter.                  There was also a fair

         bit of pushing and shoving during that time.                   I was being pushed

         forwards gradually nearer the barrier.                As well as the *pushi ng from

         behind there were a couple of sidewards               pushes as we i t .   After about

         four or five minutes        in position one,     there was a ^Trong sidewards

         push from my left.         I dont know what     caused it bu^ it was so strong I

         was pushed to my right across the barrier and wasX the end of the

             barrier.  After 1 went past the end of the bjfrrier 1 was carried

             forwards down the terracing by a strong pujfh from behind.  The push

         carried me down the terraces my feet did m 't touch the ground.                     1 came

         to rest further down the terracing wh^V the push stopped.                     Even though

         the push had stopped, my feet we re %£i 11 off the ground and I was now

         sidewards on to the pitch.           My riq/t side was facing towards the pitch

         and I was facing across the terracing,               towards the North S t a n d .     I

         remember having to push myself /townwards to try and get my feet back

on the ground.       I dont think that the push forwards carried me too

far,      perhaps four or five steps.     The front perimeter fence was still

a faw feet away from me.          I have marked this second position on the

separate grid plan using the figure two.            Shortly after getting to

position two I looked to my left and I could still see

and                   They were still behind the crush barrier that we were

all behind originally.          I could see that they were pinned against the

barrier and                        face was very red.     I think this was

because he was trying to push himself off the barrier.             I could not

see                 neither    could I see Gary CHURCH.     I dont know what

became of them.

In fact I did not see Gary CHURCH again aftaf that forwards push,

became aware that Gary CHURCH had died at/Hi 11sbo rough on Sunday 16

A p r i 1 1989 <160489).      The last time th/n I saw Gary CHURCH alive in

pen three he appeared fit and wel 1 ><Jmd was not in any obvious

distress.       I would estimate that I last s a w Jj/ary CHURCH alive at about

five to three      (1453),    just before that    ffrwaras push

It was while I was in position two that I felt crushed in by the

crowd.      I was stuck in this sidewards position,       looking across the

terraces towards the North S t a n d .     I could not see anything that

happened on the pitch.          It was while   I was in position two that the

players must have come out onto the pitch and the game must have

started.      There were a lot of screams from the crowd for the Police

outside the pen to open the gate in the front fence.             I think the game

started while      I was position t w o , be cause I became aware of the crowd

screaming for the game to be stopped.            For a time I was being held up

by the crowd and I started having difficulty breathing.             I became very

concerned because      I suffer from asthma.       I managed to push myself

downwards and found a bit mo re breathing space.

             After a few minutes            in position two j ^ s a w people climbing         over the

              front perimeter fence.             Their c l o n e s were being         torn and some were

^ > £ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ g e t t ing stuck,   but e ventua J l y ^ o t   over.      I was trapped in position two

              for between ten and fifteen minutes before                     I felt an ease in the

              pressure.       This was because a lot of people had got out from the pen

              by now and the re was a bit more space                 in the p e n .     It was still

              crowded in the pen, but as soon as the pressure eased                       off I pushed my

             way through the crowd,             back towards the tunnel.              I do not remember

             actually seeing bodies             in the pen.        I saw                and

             at the back of the pen, up against the stand.                      We walked back through

             the tunnel together.             As we came Jsack through the tunnel there were

             a number of bodies           lying on          ground in the area behind the

             turnstiles          A lot had           s covering the faces.            I cannot describe

             any of the bodies,           I just remember seeing a lot of bodies lying on the

             ground.       We waited around the area of the turnstiles for

             We d i d n ’t see               People were        coming back through the tunnel          into

             the yard behind the stand carrying bodies.                      I wanted to go back into

             the pens to see if 1 could help but                                said it would cause

             more mayhem if people started going back in.                      After ten or fifteen

             minutes we went outside the ground where we saw                                    standing on

             a corner,      opposite the ground.            We left the ground at about three

              thirty five       <1535)    or three forty <1540) and having found                       we

              returned to the car.

             Throughout the course of the afternoon I did not witness anything that

              I would consider to be a criminal offence.

              I now know that a crush barrier collapsed inside pen three.                         I did not

             see a barrier break whilst              I was in pen three.         The first time I

              became aware that a crush barrier had col lapsed was at about quarter

              past or twenty past three             <1515 1520) when I was just about to leave

              pen three.       Just before I went back through the tunnel                  I looked back

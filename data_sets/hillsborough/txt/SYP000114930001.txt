On Saturday 9 April 1989 my tour of duty was 8amX7pm working the FA cup semi
final at Hillsborough the match being between Liverpool and Notts Forest.
Throughout the day I was engaged       in duties at the Leppings Lane End of the groundc
%    duties were to patrol that area    on crowd control which included the serching ol
fans on entering the ground . This was done at Random but the nearer the time to th
kick off at 3pm the build up of fans was so great that this was impossible to
conduct*    During the build up to the match commencing    I was also engaged in the
checking of fans to ensure that they were in possession of tickets and I can
state that there were numerous persons who had not tickets.
Also during the build up say between 12 mid day and 3pm I saw numerous fans
in the locality of the Leppings Lane end      who had no intention of entering the
ground early. In fact numerous stated to me that they were going to find Public
Houses away from the ground in order to consume alcohol. I can state that I
warned a number of fans in that time period that it would be better for them to
enter the ground at an early stage rather than leave it to just before the kick off

At no time did police officers form a cordon across the enterance to        he      ings
Lane area of the ground.

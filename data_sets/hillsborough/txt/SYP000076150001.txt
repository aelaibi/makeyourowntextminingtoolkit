              so we        could stop at a pub just                       outside      of H i l l s b o ro u gh for a drink and

              something               to eat.     We     had no        problems       getting     there and there w e r e n ’t

                  The      pub seemed        comfor ta bl y full,            amd most    of the       people   in there were

                  people.           The whole a rea s eemed jam— packed.                      I immediately wa nt ed to

                  turn a ro un d and wait             until    the     crowd had gone           down before       going

                  inside,          but this was       impossible          d'/e to the        number    of people       behind and

                  in front          of me.     My only t h o u g h ^ was         that a few coaches             had a rr i ve d

                  Eventually          the gates were          opened;         the arear inside         between the gates

                  an d the turnstile              hadn't     seemed to ease /uch.                As the gates were

                  opened there was a surge                   forward as         ev^yone       tried to get        in.      I was

                  pushed to one side               by some     rai 1 ingss^c/osest to the               river.      There was an

                  old      chap     in front      of me,     who was white            in the face and obviously

                  suffering,          because      of the     crushed         conditions.        I was    very     concerned

                  for      him so     I had my hands on the                  person    in front       of the old man a nd

the old man himself was                inside my arms;          I was        pushing the other             fella

awa y    to keep the         pressure       off the old man.          We were there               in the    crowd

for another          few minutes.           The Police were         telling      usto ease back             but

we    couldn't,       there wasn't          enough    room.     I just kept           going backwards

and     forwards and stumbling               over my own feet.               It was      total     chaos,

nothing       seemed to be happening,                even the     people at the t urnstiles were

stood still          because       of the weight       of people       behind them.               It was     like

a static          situation.

T hen    I heard a number            of P o l i c em e n on foot      stood along the              railings

t elling      us to go under          the    railing,    round      to the far            side to a gate           on

the     right w h i c h they were           saying    had been      opened.          I    felt very

relieved and this             old    chap smiled at me;           we finally got under                the

railings and s u d d en ly a weight              of people        banind me just took me off my

feet.        I was    in a stoo pe d        position from going              under    the    railings        so I

was     easily u nb a l a nc ed and the          crowd jus/ took me through the                      side     gate

into the y ard area.                It was    outside    the Gr ou nd that               I lost    sight     of

the old       chap.        He was    there one minute          and gone the              next;    I think he

m ay have         fallen over.        He was aged about 60 or so wit h grey hair;                             he

was     short,      about 5*5 tall,          and was    clean shaven.

Once     thro u g h the gates         the    crowd was    still       pushing.            I was    in the

mi d d l e   of    it an d was      carried along.        I had my ticket                 ready to hand           in

but there wasn't a chance                   I could,    no-one did.            I didn't          notice any

Police       O f f icers    by these     gates   entering       the    crowd and           certainly no

stewards.           The    crowd    came through that          q u ic kl y    it w ou ld have been hard

to stop them.              My feet    v i rt ua ll y didn't     touch the floor and as                  I

neared the tunnel             it was     just a mass      of bodies as           people          c on verged to

get     thro u g h the tunnel.           1' didn't     see any Police           or stewards at              the

tunnel       entrance;       I only saw stewards          in the       entry by some              stairs     to

the W Stand,          about    15 or so,       w ith Police as well.                 It seemed       like they

were     there out         of the wa y of the         crowd.      I d o n ’t blame          them min d you

                 for that,       as the    crowd surged through.

                 As we got       into the yar d area             I didn't see any signs directing me to

                 the    terraces;      as soon as we went             thro ug h the gate we were             faced wit h

                 the    tunnel       straight ahead,         thro ug h wfriich I could see the              pitch,       so       it

                 seemed obvious          for everyone          to makre for that.

O V T ”          The    next   thing     I knew      I was     ins/de     the tunnel;        my   initial    reaction was

                 that    it was a b so l u t e l y     pack&d/       There were          people   on the sides          of

                 the    pressure       behind was       so great.         There was        no o p po rt un it y to

                 do a n y t hi n g    but go forward.            It was    bedlam;        people were screaming and

             i   shouting.           I thought    it w ould ease once we got onto                   the terraces

                 About     three      quarters    of the way a l on o^ th e           tunnel      I found myself         close

                 r ea lised what        I had seen       I panicked;        all     I could thipfc of was            that         I

                 wa nt e d to get out.           The    crowd     carried me further JXxt the end of the

                 tunnel;       people were       getting       pushed up against            ar barrier    that was           in

area    within          the    gates          was    partitioned               by   a     steel,       interlocked

temporary          barrier          to    split       the     North        Stand          entrance          turnstiles             from

We    were    responsible                for    the       searching            of    fans       to    ensure          that

prohibited             articles          were       not    taken       into         the      ground        and    that       fans

entering          behaved          in ari o r d e r l y       fashion.               Initially             there       were       only       a

small    number          of    fans       in    the       area    of      Leppings             Lane    who       were       betiaving

in a    peaceable             mannfer         while       waiting         for       the      turnstiles           to    be    opened.




About    1200          mid-day          the    same       day,    some         of    the       turnstiles             were    opened

and    fans       started          to    enter       the    ground.             A    short         while     later          all    of    the

turnstiles             were    opened.              Fans    entering            were         searched        where          this    was

appropriate,             as    they       entered          the    ground.               Gradually           the       number       of

fans    entering          increased,                but    there       was      still          only    a    relatively             small

number       entering          and       it    was    noticeable               that       some       fans    were       bringing

alcohol       with       them       which       they       were     then        disposing             of    in    the       bins

provided.              Many    fans       were       milling        around           on      the     pavement          outside'the

gates    before          finally          coming          into    the      turnstiles.                 The       number       of

people       entering          the       ground       gradually            increased               until     aboy^          2.00    p.m.

when    the       entire       area       from       the    front         of    the       t u r n s t i lest^ip        to    the    metal
entrance          gates       was    filled          with       fans,       but    at       this     stage    there        was

only    a    little          pushing        and      everyone          was       behaving          in a n    orderly          fashion

a s 'best     I could          sef,»




It    was    noticeable             that       many       fans       were    confused           by    the    coloured           ticket

system       in    use    a n d t h a t t h e y w e r e t r y i n g to g a i n e n t r y to t h e w r o n g

let    back       out    of    the     turnstiles               and    then       to    gain       ent/y     through          the

correct       turnstile             into       the    correct          section          of     t^re g r o u n d .




About       2.40       p.m.    the     same         day,    the       pressure          of     people       had     increased

such    that       people          were     being         pushed       forward          into       the     turnstiles           by    the

pressure          of    the    people          behind       and       they       were       four     or    more     deep      trying

to    gain    access          into     two       turnstile            entrances.               This       resulted       in     people

pushing       to       gain    entry        to      the    turnstiles             as    well.         At    this     time       I

noticed       that        there      seemed          to    be    a    large       number        of    fans,       who    had

obviously          been       drinking,             who    were       pushing          forward        regardless           of       the

people       in    front       of    them,          causing          distress          to    many     people.           Also        these

fans    were       arguing          with       whoever          they    could,          but     no    violence          was

possible          due    to    the     tightly            packed       crowd.           When       these     fans       went        down

the    wrong       turnstile           they         were    extremely             abusive          and     often     refused          to

back    out       of    the    turnstile,             forcing          their       way       through.




Others       who       had    come     to      the    wrong          turnstile          did     push       back     against          the

crowds       and       try    to    gain       entry       through          the    correct           turnstile.            However,

sometime          during       this       period          this       also    became          impossible           and    they

could       not    make       their       way       back    against          the       flow     of    the    crowd       behind

them.        This       resulted          in     their      having          to    be    l et    through       the       turnstile

into    the       wrong       section          of    the    ground,          although           they       were     being       let

into    the       North       Stand       which       was       all    seats       and       not     into    the    West        Stand

                At    several           times       during       this          period       elderly             and    young       children           were

                pushed       down        the    side       of    barrier             towards          me    and       as    best       as    I wats a b l e

                I forced        the       crowd          back    (and          in   most        cases       was       assisted          by     those       in

                the     crowd)      to       let        them    through             into    the       turnstile.             It    was       also

                necessary          to     let       a    pregnant          woman       through.                 I noticed          that        some      fans

                who    were     intoxicated                didn't           care      for       this       and     would         not    let       these

                people       through           and       I received             a    great       deal       of     abuse         from       them.


 V-
                Eventually          I was           pushed       back          against          the       wall     beside         the       turnstile

                and    up a g a i n s t        the       partitioning                barrier          by     the      pressure          of     the    crowd

                and    was    unable           to       move.        Many       people          were        complaining            regarding             the

                pushing       of    the        crowd,          but    in       view    of       my    position             and    the       fact     that       I

                had    lost     contact             with       the    other         members           of    my     serial,         I was          unable        to

                help    them.           At     this       time       it    seemed          to    me       that     things         were       getting        out

                of    hand    and       it     was       quite       frightening                to    be    penned          into       this       corner

                and    unable       to       move.         I was          very      relieved              when     the      numbers          of    people

                dropped       off       and     I was          again       able       to    move          about       freely.           The       crowd

                eventually          dwindled              away       as    all      the     fans          gained       access          to    the     ground.




                About       3.05    p.m.        the       same       day,      there        was       a    report          that    Liverpool             fans

                were    on    the       pitch        and       I therefore            went           through          the    turnstile             and    made

                my    way    onto       the     pitch       with          my   serial,          by        going       down       the    south        side      of

                the    West    Stand.




                Gn    arrival       at       the     pitch       I    could         see     that          the    crowd       in    the       central

                north       terrace       were          pushing           forward         and        that       the    pople       at       the    front       of
A r "’   &
                the    terrace          were       being        forced         up    against              the    front       fencing          to    the

                terrace.           It    was       apparent          that        those      at        the       front       were       being       crushed
 by    the    pressure             of    the       crowd       behind          them          and    that    some       of    the       people

up     apinst           that       fencing          were      at. l e a s t         unconscious,             and       possibly          that       .

 they       were    dying          if    not       already          dead.           I    could       see    Police          Officers

 climbing          the       fencing          shouting             #t    the       crowd       to    move    back.           It w a s

 obvious          that       the    fans       to       the    rear       of       the       crowd    were       unaware          initially

 of    what       was    occurring             at       the    front          of    the       terrace.




 I saw       that       the    gate          into       the    central             mouth       terrace       was       open      and     that

 officers          were       inside          lifting          people          over          the    interal       barrier          which

 separates          the       central          North          and       South       terraces.              These       people          were

 then       being       carried          onto       the       terrace          and       they       were    brought          out       through

 Gate       number       3    onto       the       pitch.           I    immediately                went    over       to    this       gate

 and    assisted             out    several             people          who    were          either    afraid          to    remain       or

 injured.           These          people          then       went       over       onto       the    pitch       where          they    sat

^o r   laid       down       and    were       attended             to    by       first       aiders       or    other          Police

 officers.              It    appeared             to    me    that       many          of    these    people          were       in    shock.




 Next       I saw       Police          constable             159       Marsh       who       was    carrying          a    young       boy

 who    I now       know       to       be    Lee       Nicol,          out    of       the    central       south          terrace.           I

 assisted          him       with       Nicol       and       we    carried             him    onto    the       pitch       where

 Police       Constable             Marsh          commenced             mouth          to    mouth    resuscitation,




 At    this       point       we    were       joined          by       two    p e o p l e "who       identified             themselves

 to    us    as    doctors          and       they       took       over       the       resuscitation             of       Nicol.

 Myself       and       Police          Constable             Marsh       then          had    to    keep    other          Liverpool

 fans       away    as       they       kept       trying          to    help       but       only    succeeded             in    hindering

 the    doctors.              Finally          a    stretcher             arrived             and    Nicol       was       taken       away    to

 an    ambulance             with       Police          Constable             Marsh          accompanying          him.

I then       went       back       to    the       terraces            where           1 saw       that       gate       number      4     was

open    and    that          bodies          were       being          removed          from       the       terrace       through            it.        ,

I went       over       to    this       gate       and       assisted                a Police          Sergeant          in    taking         a

youth    out       of t h i s       terrace.                 We t h e n          took       this       youth    onto       the       pitch

and    between          us    placed          him       in t h e        recovery             position          and       then    I    covered

him    with    my       anorak.              I then          remained                with    this       youth       to    ensure         that

he    continued          breathing             as       it w a s        difficult.                 Whilst       I was          looking

after    this       youth          I was       joined             by    two          other    officers          who       I do       not

know.        One    was       a    woman       Police             Constable             and       she    was    extremely

distressed          and       in    tears.              She       told       me       that    someone          had       just    died         who

she    was    trying          to    resuscitate.                       The       other       officer          squatted          down

watching       this          youth       with          me    and       just          could    not       believe          it.     W h i 1st

sat    there       we    counted             over       ten       bodies             just    laid       on    the    pitch       around            us.




A    short    time       later          an    ambulance                was       about       to    leave       the       ground       and

this    youth       was       placed          in       the    floor          of       this    ambulance             as    two    other

casualties          were          already          on       the    two       trolleys.                 There    was       another

                                                                             sady       in    the       ambulance.              As    the

                                                                             3       stopped       and       another       youth         who       I




                                                                                 the    youth          who    was    already          on      the

                                                                                 breathing             but    had    a    pulse       and      it

was    necessary             to    give       him       mouth          to    mouth          resuscitation                continually               on

the    journey          from       the       ground          to    the       Northern             General       Hospital.                On

arrival       at    the       hospital,                Bland       was       placed          on    a    trolley          and    he    started

to    breathe       by       himself.              I    continued                to    assist          with    Bland       at    the       the

hospital       until          he    was       taken          away       to       be    X-Rayed.




I then       assisted             hospital             staff       with          a    youth       who    was    suffering             from

             fits.     He    was    eventually             sedated            by    doctors          and    I was     released         from

             duty    with    other       paitients         as    by t h i s         time    most       had    been      dealt       with.




             Next    I assisted: w i t h         enquiries               at    the    hospital             regarding       some       of   the

             people    brought          in.




             About    5.30    p.m.       the     same day            I joined         two       nurses who          had. a t t e n d e d     at

             the    hospital       to    help        but w e r e         requested         to    go    to H a m m e r t o n    Road    Police

             Station    and      was     conveyed there                  by    them,       arriving about              5,45     p.m.




             About    6.00    p.m.       I    returned          to       the   ground       where          Iremained          until

             7.00    p.m.    when       I went       off    duty.




             I have    attended         at    many      matches           at       Hillsborough             including         the     semi

             final    last    year.           I have       served         a    variety          of    duties     on     these

             occasions.          I have        performed           the        same    duty       at    the   Leppings          Lane

POLICE CONSTABLE 602




ECCLESFIELD POLICE STATION




I    am    a     Police      Constable            in       the    South        Yorkshire      Police      Force      and    am

currently stationed at Ecclesfield.

At    9.00       a.m.    on Saturday              15 April            1989,       I started duty         at Ecclesfield

Police          Station.            At     9-30      a.m.        we   were        transported       to   the     Sheffield

Wednesday             Football        Ground,          Hillsborough,               Sheffield,       where       after      the

briefing         we     were    deployed             to turnstiles             1 to 8 of       the North Stand.              I

was       one    member        of    serial          17,    under       the       direct    supervision         of   PS    468

Whitlam (and Inspector Sykes).

For the first few hours of my duty on the stiles very few people entered

the    ground.           I noticed          that       the Mounted Police had to move                          a number of

groups          of    people        who    were        'hanging         a r o u n d 1 rather     than     entering         the

ground         straightaway.               Also      the     amount       of alcoholic         beverage         taken     from

the    fans or dumped on the Leppings Lane approach increased as the start

of the match approached.

At approximately 2.30 p.m.                           that day,         whilst carrying out my duty on one

of the turnstiles,                  the number of people entering the queue                                for entry to

the       ground       increased           so    greatly          that       it    became    impossible         to    search

everyone,             instead       we     carried         out    random          searches    and     searches       of    any

bags.

In    the       next    few minutes             the     numbers         of     the   queue    swelled      even      further

until       people were             stood       at    least       three      abreast       to enter      the turnstile.

At    this           point   it      became          impossible           to      search     people      and    instead      I
                                                            -    2    -




concentrated            my     efforts          in    turning             away     people       who     were        under   the

influence of intoxicants.                        I noted at the time                      the number of people who

were    drunk       and        trying      to    enter the                football       ground       increased as          the

start of the match approached.                             The age of the people who were affected

by    drink was          not    confined         to the          teenagers, one man who                      I turned away

informed me         that        he was     58        years old.             People who were             turned away did

not    leave      either,        one      youth who had drunk a can                         of lager whilst             in my

turnstile         queue        and   who    I        turned          away       walked     to     the    next queue         and

opened a second               can to drink whilst waiting.                               The amount of drink taken

from    the      fans     was     such     that       the       dustbin          which     we   had     for rubbish was

overflowing.

A large       number          of youths         with blue            tickets       (West Stand)             tried to enter

the North Stand and some even jumped the turnstiles having to be evicted

by    the   Police        inside.          Only        one      or        two    people     attempted          to    enter my

turnstile               without      tickets,          although, I heard                  the    turnstile          attendant

shout       to          the     Police      on       the        inside of          the     ground       on     a number      of

occasions.          At approximately this time                              I can remember seeing               a dozen or

so    youths       climbing          up    the       metal       barrier           (separating          the     West    Stand

seating          from     the     terraces)            and       onto        the     roofs      of      the    turnstiles.

Although I shouted at the youths,                               I know that any attempts to stop them

by myself were                futile.       I then saw an Inspector on                            the       turnstile roof

and my attention again returned to my turnstile.

The     number      of         people      increased even                  more    towards            the     start of      the

football match until the numbers were so great that I was hemmed against

a wall      unable        to move.          A woman was pushed next                          to me and was near to

hysteria.          She         begged me        to    help      her        but    there    was little         I could do

other than move                a few surrounding people away for a few seconds.

                                                             -   3




I could see           the Mounted Police near                         to the Leppings Lane entrance gates

and what         I   thought           would    be the back of the crowd.                              I tried to attract

the Mounted           Police's           attention           to move       some       of    the       crowd    further back

but    could         not    manage        to    do     so.       In    the next            few seconds my             left     leg

began to n u m b as it was crushed against                                   the wall by the ever increasing

crowd.      At this point I decided to enter the ground via the turnstile as

I    was    in       fear       for     my     own     safety          and      in     an     attempt         to    contact      a

supervisory            officer           and     inform          him       of     the       situation          outside         the

t u r n stile.

Once inside the ground I approached an Inspector and informed him of the

situation        outside.               I was        told    that      "We know of what                 is happening           and

are looking           into the situation".                       Upon checking myself and my equipment

I    discovered            that    my    Police        staff         was   missing.            Before         the     crush    had

started the staff was in my trouser leg pocket.                                             I reported this loss to

my Serial Sergeant PS 468 Whitlam at the first available                                                      time.     For the

next few minutes I was approached by a number of people who informed me

that they were disgusted by the situation outside the ground and that we

should     do        something          immediately.             Whilst         situated          at    the    rear     of     the

turnstiles           my    attention was              drawn to the              gate at       the side of the North

Stand      turnstiles             which        had    been opened               and     had    a      continuous        flow    of

people passing through it.                           (Previous to this I had heard banging coming

from this door and had seen two stewards holding it closed).

At    this point PS Whitlam received                                 a message         to attend on the football

pitch as a disturbance was taking place.                                        Upon entering the pitch I saw

a large body of Policemen near                               to the West Stand terrace and saw the

gates in the security fencing being opened.                                           As I approached a number of

bodies      began          to     be    passed        through          the      gates.            I    assisted       with     the
transportation of these bodies onto the football pitch for a few minutes

before myself entering the West Stand (via number 2 Gate).

Inside     the    stand        I       approached           the       front       section       near    to   the      crowd

control    barriers.           Here       I saw a large number of people                              lying on top of

each   other      on    the     floor.           I    moved        a number         of    people       who   were     stood

around, back away from the bodies on the floor.                                          I then took hold of one

of the bodies and with the assistance of a member of the crowd moved the

body further up into the stand.                            Here I checked the pulse and breathing.

Whilst    the    person        assisting loosened                     the   clothing,          I rendered mouth             to

mouth resuscitation upon the body.                               After a few seconds the person began

to breath again whereon we carried the body away from the stand, via the

tunnel    to     the    area        between          the    turnstiles            and    the     back    wall        of    the

stands.         Here     after          checking           the    pulse,      I     placed        thebody       in    the

recovery position.                 I    spoke    to a nurse who was dealing with a                            number of

persons, before returning into the stand.

I again    went        to the          front    area of          the stand near             to the      crowd    control

barriers.        By     this       time       people       had been         taken       from    the pile      of bodies

and    were     lying    on     the       terracing. I approached                       a number        of bodies but

could tell by looking at them that                               they were beyond help. My attention

was then drawn to one person who was rolling around on the floor holding

his leg.        I approached this person and spoke to him but got                                        no reply.

Upon checking the man                   he appeared to be in deep                              shock, with an injury to

his    right      leg.          I       placed       the        man's       arm     around       my     neck     and was

immediately       joined        by       a member          of     the   public       who       took    his   other        arm.

Together we       lifted        the man         and        carried him out through                    the tunnel          into

the    yard     area.          Here       I    sat the          man     against      the       wall,     loosened his

clothing and placed his head between his knees.
                                                                                                                                     i^iac
                                                             -    5   -




I    left    this man          in   the care of the person who had assisted me                                         to carry

him out and I again returned to the stand.                                         Here I assisted with a human

chain that had been formed to pass some of the bodies still lying in the

stand       out    through          the    gate        of   the       crowd      control        barrier       and      onto    the

pitch.        When all the bodies had been moved I myself went onto the pitch

where I joined the rest of my serial.

After a short time the serial was again deployed into the stand to move

the remaining crowd away from the front of the terracing.                                                        Some members

of    the    crowd       were       complaining             of    people         looting        purses,       clothing         and

loose       change       from the         front        area of            the   stand where       the people crushed

had been          lying.       I myself saw no looting and tried to pacify the crowd

as    best    I        could    for       the    next       few       minutes       was     a    time       of    talking       to

members of the crowd and keeping them from the front of the stand.                                                            Then

a    photographer          (who I now             know       to be          from Scenes         of Crime          dressed       in

plain       clothes)       entered          the        stand      and       began    taking       photographs.                 The

crowd       thinking       him      to    be     a press         photographer             was    angered by            this    and

started       throwing         objects           and    moving            towards    the    man        in    an   aggressive

nature.       The photographer was moved from the stand by the Police and the

uniformed Police in the stand were also withdrawn.

When    all       of    the Police were                out of the stand some members of the crowd

thinking       there       may      again       be     looting,            threw    all    the    clothing and money

laying      around       out onto          the pitch.                 Also at this point someone                       from the

Police       ranks       shouted          that    coins          were       being   thrown        at    us       and   that     we

should keep our heads down.

After a time of standing around waiting, our serial was deployed back to

the Leppings Lane entrance where we formed a cordon between the                                                        'G' gate

and the fence near the Don.                          When all the crowds had left the stadium we

were called back to the North Stand for a de-brief.

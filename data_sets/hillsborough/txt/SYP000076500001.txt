En    route to Sheffield,               traffic        flow was      slow and        congested but nothing

a bo u t 300 yards            from the L e p p i ng s Ln entrance.

We all        then separated;               myself and G o r d o n stuck               t o g e t h e r as he was     the

Ln^ejtytTrance.            I saw no d r ^ m k ^ q n e s s         or disorder,          just merriment.             On

arrival        at about          1425 hsmrs at the L e p p i n g s Ln entrance,                      there

appeared        to be a few Mind r e d s u p p o r t e r s m i l l i n g about                    slowly,     walk i n g

f o rw ar d    in the d i r ec ti on          of the        turnstiles.

Myself        and                joined the                  on the       pavement       outside     the first

were    both stood            in thif^r position.                 A Police      horse was         next    to me,     he

was mak ing          no    impre s s i o n    on the         crowd.       I was      getting      squashed against

this Po l i c e       horse.          The    crowd were           eager    to g el      i n and    pushing        in a
                                                                               X":

w ou ld try and get oi^:/.                   I found this           impossible          due to the        volume     of

to get back, J m t               this    had little          effect;       I was       very    concerned but at

this    time        it was an exper i e n c e            I had been           in before at other            football

matches.

The    outer        gates     yien opened;             the    crowd then         rushed forward.              1

remember        looki^ng at my watch                   at    1450 J W u r s    and me and Go r d o n were

to go through,               but    I was     forced        into a position w i t h i n the mass which

I could do nothing about.

I was     hanging          on to G o r d o n ’s        jumper      so we w o u l d n ’t get separated.                   I

saw several           young        suppo r t e r s     climbing above           the      crowd but       I c o u l d n ’t

see where           they were         climbing         to.

As    it neared 3 pm               (1500 hrs),         kick-off,          the s upporters          became more

              About      15 yards      to my        right       I could see a la£*fe blue                     c o ncertina gate;              I

               entering       the G r o un d       to taking jtftp my            p o s ition on the terraces.

               The    game had not started,                 ^though          the       players were           out on the          pitch .

               crowd was        increasing,          so too was            the    pressure.            I remember        the      intense

               heat,     the air was         very thin           and 1 had d i f f i c u l t y breathing.                    I

               knew the       crowd    in this a r ea            was still        b u i lding        up but     I could not even

               turn    round to see           if s up p o r t e r s were          in fact           still    entering      the

               ter race-:

               I felt       pressure       f r o m/the    back     intensify;             at    some times my feet                left

               the    floor.        I cornj^nt rated on keeping my head up to take                                    in air as          I

               c o u l d n ’t expand my        chest      due     to the         pressure           of the    crowd.       I c a n ’t

               recall       any number of surges                 forward,        .just constant              pressure      from the

               back    from entering           the    terrace area.

               I saw a gap next             to a barrier           in a central                position       in the terraces;                I

              made     for    this    gap.         I then       l^pst sight        of Gordon.               I was    obli vious         to

              the     players       on the     pitch;       I    believe         the     game       had kicked off         but due           to

               the    feeling       in the     crowd,       I    did not see           this.

       The    pressure was                 still     bu ilding    up and       I was        being      pushed    Forward.          I

       kept     losing my f o o t a g e .              I e ve n t u a l l y   came    to     rest      near to the       front

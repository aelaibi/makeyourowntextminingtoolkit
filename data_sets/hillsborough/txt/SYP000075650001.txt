At     about       3 . 1 0 pm10 ( 1510)          there       was      some      sort        ofN a n n o u n c e m e n t          over        the

heard      another          I^^Jeaker                  announcement.                   This       time        quite          clearly          to

I did      in f a ct         wait       the    ten m inutes            and       by t h i s     time     the      injured          had

been      removed         from      the       pitch       so    I left        the       ground.         I did      not       notice

anything           of   note      on m y w a y        from       the      ground        and     by t h i s     time      everything

appeared           to   be    under       control.

As    I walked          b ack a l o n g        Halifax         Road        I saw a        number       of    stationary

coaches         and     there       were       la r g e    groups          of s u p p o r t e r s      congregating            outside

there      and      they a pp e a r e d         to    be       unsure       of    how     long       they were          to w a i t       for

missing         passengers              before       setting          off.          \

difference            between           the     evidence             of    PC      Larkin

The     only     corroboration                  available             was       the      c lub      camera        overlooking

T he    allegation            being made              is    that D u c k e n f i e l d              neglected              his       duty

a potential             problem             for w h i c h       he    should            h av e m a d e     plans
To    summarise:                                      ^

If he     had     no t     known      about     the       arrangements          between          Mr M o l e    and

Mackrell         and     if he w a s        unaware        of    the    turnstile          allocations,             then

he    should      have       recognised         the       potential       problem          of    turnstile

flows     through          A-G.

If he     knew     of      the      arrangement           then    he   could     quite          rightly       say

that it w a s          not    a problem         because          he w o u l d   h av e     the    seven       T/Ss,

to him      by    the      SWFC      would    be g r o s s l y      innacurate.
Did     he a q u a i n t         himself with                 the d i v i s i o n          of     responsibilities

beyween           stewards            and       Police which was                      a forseeable             problem.

       ie.          'I r e c al l          asking       about          it Sir.'

He w o u l d        therefore              be    reasonably                confident            that     the      club      as on e

of     t h o se     to w h o m        the G u i d e         itself          is    primarily            addressed            a nd     the

of     Stewards.

He     should        also        have        know      that       there          should         have     existed         an       agreement

between           the      police          and    the       c lub      regarding             the      specific         duties           and

             Sir,   my      recollection            is    that      I had   n ot   seen    a detailed

             pre-arranged           schedule.                Having    said    t ha t   other    officers

             were   in     da y    to   day     contact with           footballing         and   I have

             no w i s h     to pass       the    buck,        and    that   is no t m y     intention.

             There may         have b een        one but         I do n o t    recall      having   seen

             it.

In the e v i d e n c e       given      to    LJT      the    point    is   pressed       even   further

at   pa ge    T 6- TT     of D u c k e n f i e l d s     fividpnro-
D         Q. Whose responsibility do you consider it to have been on
             the day with you in charge of the opecation to have ensured
             that there was no overcrowding of that nature in pens 3 and
             4? - A. My understanding of the situation is, from the
     J       Green Guide*, that crowd management and control is a
             responsibility or the Club.

          Q. In addition to it being in the Green Code, was it your
              understanding on the d a y , having had discussions with the.
              Club, and having drawn up a plan, or having inherited a
               plan which you accepted, that the responsibility for over­
               crowding in the pens was that of Sheffield Wednesday
               Football Club?      - A."I didn't have discussions with
             -Shef field W e d n e s d a y b u t as f ar_-as I am, concerned..from .the
           - * Green Guide.-tixerresponsibil i ty -for pens .and packing '-of-: -                           -
               pens rests with the Club.                                                                    ■

          o. So this was an assumption made by you but no liaison was
             made with the Club as to what arrangements they would make
             to ensure no overcrowding in the pens?  - A. I can't
             soeak of that because the arrangements were made by Chief
             Superintendent Mole prior to my arrival and any further
             aiscusssions were with Superintendent Hurray.

           Q. But Mr. D u c k e n f i e l d the plan may have been drawn up by
              Mr. Mole but you would want to know what had been arranged.
              Here are you in charge of the Police operation.            You are
              assuming that a very important, part of the operation
              within the ground is going to be performed by the Club.
              Was it of no interest to you to know what arrangements the
              Club had made tor supervising crowd control and over­
H             crowding in pens?            - A.   That arrangement was made
              between Mr. Mole and Mr. Murray.

         Q. And you did not take it upon yourself to find out what
            it was?   A.   No, sir.

         Q. How would you be able, as the Officer in charge, to know
            whether the Club were fulfilling their duties if you did
            not. even know what their duties were to be?               A.   Because
 B          I had advisers, S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Murray, Inspector Sewell,
            Chief Inspector Beale, Officers who had been there previously,
            Officers   who had got an excellent liaison, and the
            arrangements were, of course, that P.C. Guest, who was
            in the office at S h e f f i e l d Wednesday and monitoring
            would advise me when the crowd levels reached a certain
            level.

In     his      interim            report             para       214      LJT       refers          to    a large            volume         of

filtering               of    f ans         and       checking            of       tickets          in    Leppings            Land

and      on     the       approaches                  to    the     area.

Th e     Police           evidence               is    that no            such        specific            policy         had       b e en

L an e     Penistone               Ro ad         Roundabout.                       That       evidence            is    in    total

contradiction                     to    the        evidence              of    Inspector             Paul         Kerry GRACE                        ^

that       no      such       barriers                were       errected.

Th e     situation                in    hindsight,                 w h i c h wa s          no t     recognised               by    the       LJT

With       regard            to    the       problems              immediately                 outside            the    turnstiles

He    should          h av e     realised           that       the     half     hour       before          kick     off

was    the m o s t          vunerable            time       for      public       order         or    safety         incidents

discovered             that m e n          were       underemployed.                     Duckenfield               wa s

aware       of    this          f ac t    and    the      importance            of      the     availability

of    his m a n p o w e r e         at     s uc h     a crucial          time        should          h av e     b e en    that

much more             important            to him.



It    is    suggested              that     he      c o u ld    easily         h av e    covered           this      problem

and      explained             his       interpretation                  of    his       standing        instruction

as    follows:

                       Well     no,       because          I think            that       varies       f rom   g am e     to game.

a schedule              is     a written             document.                 T hi s     I t h i nk w o u l d      be     accepted

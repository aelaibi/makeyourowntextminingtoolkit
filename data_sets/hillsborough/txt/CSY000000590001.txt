1.   Note of Previous Meetings

The note of the previous meeting held on 15th December, 1982 (a copy of which had
been circulated previously) was considered and agreed.

Mr. J. Layden did observe that no reference was contained in the Note of the
possibility of retrospection of the revised charges for police services.  It
was agreed that this was so, but it was explained that this was a matter of
policy yet to be decided.

2 . : Chlrges for Police Services.                ■

A t .the -Witting 09-; 15th Deceatber, the C-h£e£ Constable had been requested to prepare
* * • ? • * « on the present criteria far levying charges for police services, possible
.ftifcti##- tritpri** the extent of co-operation between the Clubs and the Police, and '
                                                                                          V




the extent of community related activities already being under-taken by the
Clubs.

The Working Group considered a report (a copy of which had been circulated
previously) incorporating the information requested.•

Whilst the effect of the revised criteria could not be estimated with any
real certainty (the football clubs being charged retrospectively, based on
the actual number of spectators present), it was likely that the total annual
charges to Football League Clubs in South Yorkshire would be reduced by some
£50,000 per annum. The charges would also be more in line with the charges
made for the services of police in other areas of the country. The possible
effect of the financial penalties and loss of grant arising from the recently
announced rate support grant settlement consequent upon the reduced income
which would result were outlined.  It was accepted that, looked at on a
County wide service basis, the loss of income would not worsen the position
significantly, but it was considered to be a factor of which the Clubs should
be aware.

The Clubs acknowledged that, in the present economic situation, any assistance
which could jc given would be most welcome, and were pleased that the input which
they were making on community problems by the various schemes which they were
already undertaking or proposed to undertake was now being recognised. The
problems of the unemployed were of especial concern, and Rotherham United
announced that tin v intended to introduce on 29th January reduced admission
charges for the unemployed. The Clubs also accepted that it would be necessary
for the County Treasurer to have a sight of their accounts.

RECOMMEND!!> - That, subject to any comments of the County Treasurer after having a
sight of the Clubs* accounts, the r e v i s e d eriteriaset out in Paper B for the services of the
South Yorkshi re I’ol ire at Footbal 1 League ma tches in South Yorkshire be substituted
for those currently in force (set out in Paper "A") as from a date to be agreed
by the Police Committee after consultation with Policy Advisory Sub-Committee "A".

 3.   Meeting with Media Representatives

On 15th December, the Working Croups decided to consider further the problem
of hooliganism/vandalism at and associated with football matches, and to
invite media representatives to discuss the effect on the problem of media
reporting.

A dozen representatives of television, radio and the press had accordingly
been invited to be present, and the following persons were present for the
diseussion:-

1                1 Sheffield Star
1                 South Yorkshire Times
                Sheffield Star
               ] Morning Telegraph
                Barnsley Chronicle
               3 Radio Ha11am
                    Doncaster Evening Post.

An apology for absence was received from the Editor of the Sheffield Star,



                                                  2.
Whilst the Working Group accepted that generally the South Yorkshire based
media (and the Barnsley Chrojnicle and the Rotherham Advertiser in particular)
reported football matches in! a factual, non-sensational, manner, the same could
not be said of certain elements of the media nationally.        In the Working Group's
opinion, the inflammatory language and descriptions often used could have the
effect of inciting an admittedly small minority to engage in the type of incidents
which the media were criticizing.     It also had the effect of discouraging the
average supporter, the casual supporter and families from attending matches.
This particularly applied to pre—match publicity in some newspapers^.          Addit­
ionally, it appeared that Considerable space was taken up on reporting
 unruly incidents (which comprised only a very small amount of the total match
 time and, in some cases, occurred outside of the grounds or in town centres), rather
 than on a description of the match and, in some cases, even giving the match
 result was omitted.   In comparison, where spectators were involved in incidents,     e
media frequently gave little or no publicity to the resultant penalties imposed by
 the Courts. A pilot scheme to overcome this problem was in hand in the Rotherham
 area and, to date, was proving to be mutually advantageous.       Certainly in South
 Yorkshire, cases of hooliganism/vandalism at and associated with football matches
 were being contained and were even showing signs of declining.         In contrast,
 the media reporting of incidents appeared to be increasing.

They could .,ot speak for their editors, but the media represent­
atives present felt obliged to point out their duty and responsibility to the
public to report facts, even where these were unpleasant. This was not to say
that this ciiou1d not be done responsibly and in a balanced manner.         Certainly,
the view ■ -nki no taken that if the media had not highlighted problems such
as hooligan:stu/vand lism, rospcasibio people and bodies would not now be
working together in an effort t > overcome such problems.         If there were
occasions .'In n it w.i> felt 111 1 ! balanced reporting ...id not taken place, complaints
could be made to be Editor concerned.         The media did not live in an "ivory tower"
and we re sinsit ive to public opinion.     Action would be taken where it was justified.

 It was agreed that t h e County Council's initiative Ln arranging meetings such as
 this was welcome . nd a positive step.   It was only by the clubs, local and central
 government agencies and the media working together for the good of the community
 that the problem of hooliganism/vandalism could be contained and in time, hope
 fully overcome.  T h e portion of the South Yorkshire Police Report on Charges for
 Police Services relating to the involvement of the Football League Clubs in
 South Yorkshire with the community was circulated to the media representatives
 present.

 RECOMMENDED -

 1. That a small Sub-Group (consisting of the Chairman a n d Vice-Chairman of the
 Police Committee and two other Councillors, together with appropriate officers
 and one representative from each of the. Football League Clubs m South Yorkshire) ,
 be appointed to discuss and report on the editorial policy adopted by the media
 on incidents of hooliganism/vandalism at and associated with football matches.

 2. That the Editors of the twelve television, radio and press organisations in
 question be invited to personally meet the Sub-Group to discuss the matter.

 3. That the Chairman of the Divisional Liaison Committees be requested to consider
 inviting a representative from each of the Football League Clubs in South Yorkshire
 to the next appropriate meeting of the Committee covering the area in which the
 respective Grounds are situated.

 These charges will be at the Special Services Rate applicable at the time.

 Should a match be cancelled at short notice whereby police expenditure is
 necessarily incurred, a basic charge will not be levied but a report wi-i
 be submitted to the Assistant Chief Constable (Management Services) for
 negotiations with the Secretary of the club for reasonable reimbursement.

                                                               OF PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL ON
                                                               THE COMMUNITY
                                                               2nd JUNE, 1983

                           CHARGES FOR POLICE SERVICES

 At the meeting of the Working Group held on 28th January, 1983, the following
 recommendation was made to the Police Committee:-

         That, subject to any cojnments of the County Treasurer after having
        a sight of the Clubs' accounts, the revised criteria set out in
        Paper '.B' for the services of the South Yorkshire Police at Football
        League matches in South Yorkshire be substituted for those currently
        in force (set out in Paper rA f) as from a date to beagreed by the
        Police Committee after consultation with Policy Advisory Sub-Committee
         A. •

 The recommendation was considered by the Police Committee on 28th February, 1983
 when the following Resolution was passed:-

         That, subject to any comments of the County Treasurer after having
        a sight of the Clubs' accounts, the revised criteria set out in
        paper 'B' now submitted for the services of the South Yorkshire Police
        at Football League matches in South Yorkshire be substituted for those
        currently in force (as set out in Paper 'A' now submitted) as from
        1st January, 1983, and that the matter be referred to the Policy
        Budget Sub-Committee."

 Following consideration by the Policy Budget Sub-Committee and Policy Advisory
 Sub-Committee A , the County Council on 23rd March accepted the recommended
 scale of charges, but decided that the date of implementation should be
 1st April, 1983.

The five Football Clubs were advised of the County Council's decision by letter
the same day (23rd March) from the Chief Executive to the Club Secretaries.

This resulted in a letter dated 21st April from the Chairman of the Sheffield
Wednesday Football Club to the Chief Executive on behalf of all five Football
Clubs seeking a further meeting with the Working Group (see attached copy).

The Working Group's attention must be drawn to the fact that none of the
toflo/Q?3 Submi“ ed   the C }ubs for policing charges during the recently finished
1982/83 season have been paid to date. As will be seen from the attached
Appendices numbered 1 to 5, these total £243,682.69.   It should be added that
at the request of the Chairman of the Police Committee (County Councillor
G. H. Moores), the question of Court proceedings for recovery was deferred
pending the outcome of the discussions on the revised charges and implementation


As indicated, the Football Clubs wish to discuss with the Working Group the
question of the implementation date of the revised charges.   In turn, the
Working Group will no doubt wish to discuss with the Football Clubs the
outstanding accounts totalling £243,682.69 in respect of the whole of the 1982/83
season.

             Dear Mr. Mallett,

             CHARGES FOR POLICE SERVICES

             The football clubs in South Yorkshire had a meeting this
             morning to discuss your letter dated March 23 rd.

             I was asked to write to you to request a further meeting
             with the Liaison Subcommittee. I do hope that this can
             be arranged.

             Our purpose as always is one of trying with your council
             to come to an arrangement that would ensure our clubs in
             South Yorkshire a continuance of existence.

             Our disappointment is that the intention of retrospection
             which was referred to and seemingly agreed at our meeting
             with your subcommittee, has not been confirmed and I
             personally want you to know that the fact that the clubs
             in question have not yet made payment against police
             charges rendered, is not because in any way we wish to
             be obstructive but rather the opposite.

             Yours sincerely,




             H. E. McGee,
             Chairman.

REPORT OF THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE                  WORKING GROUP ON THE EFFECTS
                                               OF PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL ON
                                               THE COMMUNITY
                                               2ND JUNE, 1983

          OPENING OF FOOTBALL CLUB FACILITIES TO THE COMMUNITY

The use of Football Club facilities by the local community, and particularly
by the young unemployed, was considered by the 'ET (Hackenthorpe) Divisional
Liaison Committee at its meeting on 29th April, 1983, when it was suggested
that such joint use would be of benefit to both the local community and the
Football Clubs themselves.

At the request of the Chairman of the Working Group (Councillor G. H. Moores),
the Secretaries of the five South Yorkshire Football League Clubs were asked t
supply information regarding the type and extent of facilities available, the
current use made of the facilities by the community together with details of
any proposed additional use.

Replies received from Sheffield Wednesday, Doncaster Rovers and Rotherham
United Football Clubs are attached. Replies are still awaited from Barnsley
and Sheffield United Football Clubs.

The Chairman of the Working Group has suggested that progress on this front
could, perhaps, be achieved by some form of joint arrangement. A possible
means of doing so could be by utilising the relevant existing Community Action
Panel, as is now being done in the case of the Rotherham United and Sheffield
United Football Clubs.

                                               F. A. MALLETT,
                                               Chief Executive.

             Mr. M. Teasdale,
             South Yorkshire County Council,
             County Hall,
             BARNSLEY.

             Dear Sir,

                   Due to a lack of indoor training facilities or a training
             pitch adjacent to the ground full footballing use of our facilities
             "by the Community cannot be claimed. We have therefore pursued
             a Policy of Youth involvement with the Football Club, and
             outlined below are some of the ways this Policy is implemented.
             Our Manager, Coaching, Physiotherapist and Playing Staffs are all
             involved in our aims, which consist of activitiesas far apart as
             organising a team of under ten year olds to play a friendly game
             on Belle Vue against teams from Lincoln and other League Clubs,
             to having three of our own boys being selected during the last
             two years to play in full England Youth Team at an under nineteen
             level.

                    For brevity I have outlined our main activities.

              — Eaoh School holiday and half term we run Soccer coaching
                courses for all ages and all abilities. In addition to
                weekly cbaching and training sessions for older boys
                with above average ability.
              — We have invited twenty-four different youth teams to play
                games against each other on Belle Vue this year (so far).
              — Thirty— six Representative games at an Under nineteen level
                have been played against similar teams from other towns.
              — Invitation trail matches take place at least once each
                week during the Season.
              — We encourage boys to join midweek training sessions of
                the First Team,




                                                                               Contfd.

                                                                             Chairman: I. M. JONES
                                                                               Directors: H. BATES

 — Eight different Youth Penalty Competitions have taken
   place on Belle Vue.
 — Training facilities on an evening are used free of charge
   and regularly by the general public — and when our
   "Gymnasium" is completed this should increase.
 — We even allowed a Rugby League match to be played on our
   hallowed turf (which we might add we believe to "be the best
   in the land).
 — Our Junior Rovers Club meet and enjoy all our facilities
   every other Sunday, and a wide range of activities is
   arranged for them.
 — Any player injured   playing soccer in local League can use
   free of charge our   Physiotherapist and equipment - and if
   necessary the Club   Doctor (both being people who have
   specialised for us   in Footballing injuries).
 — The Car park has been used for two sponsored walks.
 — Our Sports and Social Club is hired (free of charge) to
   any organisation requiring a meeting room, and our
   involvement with the local "Handicapped in Action Group"
   and the "Stroke Club" is of particular pleasure to us.
 — We have a very active Sports and Social Club open to
   everyone (subject to Club Rules).
 — We now run our own monthly newspaper which is distributed
   free of charge.
 — Next Season subject to League Rules we hope to permit children
   under eleven who are members of our Rovers Club to see First
   team games free of charge, and similar concessions for the
   unemployed are under consideration.
 — We allow free use of Car Park i.e. South Yorkshire County
   Council - Pageant of the Horse!

     We are constantly looking for ways of increasing our community
involvement and subject to the finance to improve facilities we hope
to form a Boys Club to organise football at age levels 12 - 16 : to
organise football skill courses for the unemployed Youth, to refurbish
our gymnasium and to utilise all the "wasted space" of our Car Park
for a grass and all weather training facility. Have any cash to spare?
We could do it in Partnership.

       The Rotherham United Football Club has assisted the Rotherham Schools Football
Association over a 20 year period in a number of important ways.    The club has
provided the main ground free of charge for important representative matches and
allowed the Schools Football Association to make charges and keep the receipts.
When these matches have taken place the full facilities of the ground including
floodlights, refreshment bars, have been provided without charge.    In addition
to providing these facilities for the Rotherham Schools Football Association
similar generosity has been extended in respect of county and international matches.
Twelve county and two international matches have been played at Millmoor over recent
years.

      The club has also provided for the Rotherham Schools Football Association on
a regular weekly basis   for a number of years the training facilities in     theclub's
main gymnasium at Millmoor.   Again these facilities have been provided       freeof
charge.   On a number of occasions the training and coaching staff at the ground
have assisted teachers   in preparing school boys for important matches.

      The senior staff   have offered advice to boys on careers in football. The
club has enjoyed a considerable reputation among teachers and parents for its
integrity in encouraging boys to become professional footballers.    The staff have
never allowed the interests of Rotherham United to take priority over the long term
interests of individual boys.

      An important development which is due to start in September of this year is
a closer working relationship with the secondary schools in Rotherham.   The new
manager of the club, Mr. George Kerr, has offered to visit all the secondary schools
with players and coaching and training staff to talk to young people and to offer
coaching sessions for young players at all the schools.

      The Rotherham club has also developed very close links with primary schools,
particularly over the last two years.   Every Wednesday during the football season
children from one of the local primary schools visits the club and are given a
conducted tour of all the facilities at the ground.   They meet various personnel
including players and are provided with material which allows the children to return
to schools to do project work as part of their normal class work.   The Wednesday
visit is followed on Saturday by a number of children being given free seats in the
main stand and the children see the players preparing for the match and also visit
the board room to meet Directors of the club.

      For the last match of the 1982/83 season 1 ,0 0 0 free tickets were distributed
amongst schools to encourage youngsters to attend the match.

      It is also important to record that over the years a significant number of
schools in the Authority have benefited financially on a significant scale as a
result of the club distributing unclaimed lottery prize money.   This has been
very welcome to the schools and has helped a number of them to develop their
football facilities, particularly in providing kits for teams.

      More recently the club has put plans in hand for developing a scheme to
encourage families to attend the football matches at Millmoor.    The scheme which           ,
is based on secondary schools entails families meeting at the schools and then
travelling to the match on transport provided free of charge by the Rotherham
United Football Club.   This recent innovation which is to be developed further
by the club during the next season is of considerable value in minimising the
risk of crowd trouble and of young people getting into t'rouble.

      The club is also to be commended for undertaking the role of Managing Agent
for over 30 young people under the Youth Training Scheme recently initiated by the
Government.   Under the scheme young people will be provided with training programmes
at the club on a whole range of skills such as clerical, catering, ground maintenance
general repair work.   The trainees will, of course, be paid by central government
through the Manpower Services Commission.   None-the-less the club
will be involved in a good deal of administrative work at extra
expense.   The young people will need supervising and there is a
good deal of extra work involved for the club and its participation
in the Youth Training Scheme is of great value to the local community.
It will mean that 30 young people who might have been unemployed and
some of whom might have been at risk will be undertaking valuable and
useful training and personal development.

     V                               ‘
   The centre is situated ri, ;ht on the ground at the Railway End.. Run
   by the Unemployed, for the unemployed with full-time assistance
   provided by the joint support of local and county councils and the
   'M.S.C, the centre provides a wide range of Social, Recreational and
 ' Educational possibilities and is open daily.
         The building has been specially refurbished to meet the specific
         needs of the unemployed and also incorporates activities which provide
         vital social links on an equal footing for those in and out of work.

i)       Half-Price Admission to Matches

         Gate 18 at the Tivoli end of the ground has become a feature of the
         life of the Unemployed interested in football.   It is here that
         unemployed can obtain admission to matches for just £1 on production

 THE UNEMPLOYED. ROTHERHAM UNEMPLOYED CEHTRE & ROTHERHAM METROPOLITAN BOROUGH COUNCIL


 1)   INTRODUCTION

      This report is aimed at giving an insight into the work and help which Rotherham
      Metropolitan Borough Councfcl have given to Rotherham Unemployed Centre specifically,
      but more than that, to the unemployed within the Rotherham and Metropolitan Borough
      area. It will deal with financial, moral and practical support it has given to the
      afore-mentioned. It in no way intends to slight any of the massive support we have
      received from other organisations and individuals for which the Rotherham Unemployed
      Centre is extremely grateful, but moreover to highlight, in a concrete and practical
      fashion, the contribution one organisation can and has made, namely Rotherham
      Metropolitan Borough Council.


 2)   CREATION AMD BIRTH OF THE CENTRE

      As stated within the Centre's 6 month report, the situation within Rotherham and
      the surrounding area as regards unemployment is relatively as bad as the worst in
      the country, and it was more than obvious that a co-ordination point, such as an
      Unemployment Centre was necessary and through negotiations with the Local Council,
      Trade Unions and the unemployed themselves, the Rotherham Unemployed Centre came
      into being. The only organisation which had financial and other resources, such as
      buildings which could be used at that time, was Rotherham Metropolitan Borough
      Council, and the Imperial Buildings, Corporation Street of Rotherham was chosen as
      the sight for the new Centre. The staff of four people who were to run the Centre
      were funded by the M.S.C., but this in way covered the tremendous supporting costs
      needed for rent, rates (general and water) and additional expenses for structural
      alterationa necessary to meet safety requirements, etc. The Local Council had no
      hesitation in providing concessionary rent at £1.00 a year and a complete conces­
      sionary grant as far as all rates were concerned and making available all money
      the necessary health and safety requirements. This allowed the Centre to function
      and begin its work as a real base for the unemployed within the area.


3)    ADMINISTRATION

      As far as the Rotherham Unemployed Centre is concerned, the Local Council have
      provided an invaluable service by making available officers within their Education
      Department and use of the facilities within this department, for th&.administration
      of the M.S.C. Scheme,(CEP) by providing accurate and up-to-date records of all
      financial transactions around the scheme which involved the workers in the Centre.
      They have put at the disposal of the Centre, the use of their Personnel Department,
      Audit Department and Planning Department, to give expert advice when asked for by
      the Centre.

4)   PRACTICAL EXAMPLES   OS   H;jLP

     a) The Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council have been instrumental in introducing,
     along with the Centre, a.whole range of concessionary charges for the unemployed in
     relation to the sporting facilities available within this area. A lot of people may
     think that to the unemployed these sporting facilities should be free and there is
     no doubt in our m m d that this is t..that we, the iJnemployed Centre, are working towards^
     but it is very gratifying to see the Council taking this progressive step. We within
     the area wish to stress that this is an innovation that we could not see happening
     under the influence of the Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council alone, nor of the
     Rotherham Unemployed Centre alone, but under their joint inspiration as an example
     of working relationships built between these two bodies.

     b) The Council have equally been instrumental in giving full support around achieving
     free cinema tickets at one cinciaa in the tovjn and concessionary prices at the other
     cinema.
                                                          v
     c) Individuals on the Council have helped the Centre achieve concessionary ticket
     charges at Rotherham United football ground, enabling the unemployed to watch their
     local team at a very reasonable price (£1 .0 0 ). Thio, you will"notice later on in
     the report, led to a.far greater involvement by the Football Club in the Centre's A
     activities and equally in the future plans to help the.unemployed.

     d) xhrough the good offices o± certain Councillors, i.e. Jack Layden, Terry Sharman —
     the Planning Department has been able to provide the Centre trith up-to-date facts
     and figures around the -current local unemployment situation, which has enabled us to
     utilise this information for the benefit of the unemployed and employed within the
     area. Je ca.n now give a complete breakdovn of the percentage of people within the
     electorial wards who are unemployed, We hove details of people who are registered,
     their trades and the number of vacancies within their trades, etc. This enables us
     to use these figures for both political and economic reasons to try to obtain the
     type of jobs and work necessary to expose and alleviate the problems of the unem­
     ployed and employment.

     e) ihe South Yorkshire County Council have provided us with transport on numerous
     occasions through their Urban Action ■t'rogranune, which we have utilised to the full
     for the benefit of the unemployed by taking full advantage of the Rotherham Metro­
     politan Borough Council's premises within the ‘area, such as Sports facilities,
     Museums, Libraries, and even places of work, that has all helped to broaden the       '^
     outlook and horizons of the unemployed within the Centre as well as taking the         fP
     problems of unemployment to places and people that in their own way of life would
     never have met or even encountered them.

     f) By using the good name of the Local Council, this has enabled us to establish
     a tremendous rapport with the local constabulary, bringing about Motorcycling events,
     football, holidays, such as Outward Bound Schools, Canoing, Saling and Orienteering
     and bringing together of the unemployed and the police which has helped to create,
     to some extent, an understanding between two sections of the community who are
     often hardpressed - none of this could be possible without the backing of the Local '
     Council.

     g) Through individuals on the Council, named beforehand, we have equally established
     working relationships and an equally good level of understanding with the Community
     Relations, which involved Ethnic minorities and the Unemployed Centre in Sports Days,'
     bocials and a continual exchange of information involving not only the Council,
     the unemployed and the ethnic minorities, out the whole community. One specific
     community which the Centre, through the Council, has had great involvement with, is
     the Chileans. Such is this connection, that we have arranged numerous events, the
     National Football Festival being the latest, and possibly one of the more important,
     and it would be remiss not to give tiiis a special mention.

 It would be remiss within this short report, not to uention the outstanding involve­
 ment of certain individuals within the Work of the unemployed and its Centre in
 Rotherham. The Centre is not only successful in its application, but also has a
 'tremendous part .to rlay in the comcunity. Councillors Jack Layden and Terry Sharman,
 both of whom sit on the current Management Committee of the Centre, have been a
  tower' of strength, guidance and help. Terry bh; m a n has been the one who has always
 attended and guided the wanagement Committee through sometimes very stormy weather.
 Jack Layden (and Friend Cooper) have possibly played a more back-room role, but have
 nevertheless always been available whenever we have wanted financial and moral
 help and advice - the elder stateiuen, so to.sneak, of the Centre. Sometimes a less
 obtrusive role is an equally important one and we have always found it a strong card
  to play to quote such leading Councillors when we have been faced with bureaucracy,
 which has, at times, attempted to thwart the aspirations of the unemployed.

 FLAKS; -j^B SSSHT.AM X-ROJS.CTBD'' ;

 The success of the Rotherham Unemployed Centre at the Imperial Buildings has naturally
  brought about its..-own problems - space, facilities, too few workers * and it was
  obvious that another and larger venue and more workers were rapidly becoming
 necessary# The workers and users of Rotherham Unemployed Centre met with the Council,
 who immediately set plans into motion for alternative premises. After a long and
  detailed study# it was agreed that the most suitable premises, at this time, were to
 be found on the Rotherham United Football Club grounds at their old Social Club.
 The complete new innovation that an Unemployed Centre should utilise an established          ;
 place of entertainment such as a football ground, was seen to be of obvious advan­
  tage. The Council undertook to give even greater financial aid to establish the
 new Centre. It is our intention that this .Centre should be of such a high standard
  in, decor,' equipment ’and. atmosphere that people will -be proud to be associated with
  it*;- It is both Our thinking, the Council's and the Centre’s,' that the unemployed of-
  this town, county and country have been.tdeprived of employment,- notvOf dignity' and ;
  that their fiiwescial situation in this country shoyJLd in no Way, condemn. tlie®- to
 second class' or '.third class living. With this in mind, the'Council, as stated before*             n

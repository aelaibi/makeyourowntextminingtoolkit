            - AMBULANCEWOMAN - MIDDLEWOOD AMBULANCE STATION


Date:   19.4.89




On 15th April 1989 I was at my home when I saw the incident at Hillsborough
being reported on TV. I waited by my telephone thinking that call outs
would be made for such an incident but when no call came and I saw the
situation worsening on TV I called in myself and was told to report to
Middlewood Station immediately.

On arrival, at approximately 4.15 pm I prepared S105 for emergency duty,
including Extended Training equipment. Shortly afterwards QAM
arrived and we informed Control that we were ready. We were given a 999
call to Shenstone Road. We found great difficulty getting to this location
as it is by the Leppings Lane of S.W.F.C.

On arrival we found a Liverpool fan who had collapsed due to fitting. We
transported this patient to NGH cas and on calling clear were given another
999 call to Halifax Road for another collapse. This again was a Liverpool
supporter who has been crushed in the ground and had made his way back to
the coach, collapsing on arrival.

A few minutes later we were told by Control to take a             home from
NGH cas to Chapeltown Nursing Home. At this time ambulances were still
aririving with casualties from the match. We could not find this patient
for return home and informed control who then stood us by at NGH. Some
time later we were given a transfer, patient    from ITU, NGH to RHH Cat
scan. On calling clear at RHH we were then given a collapse case a
Bannerdale Road. This was a DOA, which was conveyed to RHH cas for
certification and left there due to MLC being full.

From there we were returned to base arriving about 8.00pm.  I there teamed
up with L/A        who had come in early for night shift and continued
normal duties until 6.00 am.

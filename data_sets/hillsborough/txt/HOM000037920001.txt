     MR.   CALLAGHAN:    Sir, you know the representation on
previous occasions and I should say it is my intention to stay
only for today and in the case of one or two witnesses.    I
will not take any major part in the Inquiry.

     THE CORONER:    I have got no particular objection to
you being here.   I thought you probably would not  be here
continuously but I wanted to be sure about that.    Perhaps
the best thing would be if we started with you really and
if we started with appropriate legal submissions.    it may
be easiest if we start with Mr.. King and then we will move
across the table, so to speak.

     MR. KING:    Sir, my primary legal submission is
directed to your preliminary ruling on the last occasion
that this Inquest should be concerned only with events up
to about 3.15 pm.    As I understand your ruling, sir, it
was designed to ensure that this Inquest would only be
concerned with events leading to the crushing on the
terraces and the first arrival of an ambulance.

     As you know, sir, the families whom I represent are
very anxious that this Inquest should deal with what to
them is a very major issue, as to how their loved ones came
by their deaths, namely how the services and the rescue
services, and those attending with the emergency, coped
with it immediately after people were brought off the
terraces because death was not certified in many, if not
most, cases until after 4 pm.    Sir, I do not know if you
have had an opportunity to read these.     I did ask those
instructing me to send to you statements from each of the
families whom I represent setting out a number of
individual questions directed to their own Inquest but also
incorporating in their individual cases why they were
anxious to learn of what happened between the time there
was a first sighting of any loved one being brought off the
terracing and the .pronouncement of death.    I do not know
if you had an opportunity to read them.

     THE CORONER:   I have briefly because these did not
arrive until Friday afternoon but I have looked at them.

     MR. KING:    What I would like to do is take you
through some individual examples in order to persuade you
that this is a question which ought to be gone into at this
particular Inquest.    I do not know whether that is a
format you want to follow or whether you want first to hear
some other representatives as to their attitude to my
submission.    I am happy to go into considerable detail
about it.

     THE CORONER:   There are several points which have
occurred to me and the first point I would like you to deal
                                                            i.




with is this;  you were not present but you will be aware
that in April/May this year we sat for two-and-a-half weeks
approximately and we dealt with the 95 deceased and we
dealt with three issues which Coroners deal with;  who the
deceased was, when he/she died and where he/she died.    I
specifically excluded from discussion at that time the
question of how he or she died because as you will
recollect the DPP was still actively considering the matter
and we did not want to trammel his investigation but, on
the other hand, I felt it was right we should allow people
to hear what we could deal with.

      I will raise the second point at the same time because
it may be easier for you to deal with the two things
together.    At those hearings we dealt in considerable
detail, in fact infinitely more detail than we would
normally deal with in an Inquest, with events after the
pathological cause of death and I did it because I realised
that the families were desperately anxious to know what had
happened immediately after the incident.    My question to
you is - and I think this is what we need to deal with and
get right - bearing in mind we have only dealt with the
question of who, when and where and that we have done it in
considerably greater detail than one would normally expect
to do, why is it necessary to review that very activity
again which I think is what you are really asking me to do?

      MR. KING:      Sir, as I understand the individual
Inquests there was not an enquiry into, in the individual
cases, the impact of the organisation rescue on the
survival or otherwise of the particular loved one.         All
that was done when       one looks at those Inquests was to
identify the time of a first sighting, that is to say,
somebody who seemed to be unconscious, and of a time when
effort was made to resuscitate in any given case and then
death was certified.        In many of the cases there was a
large gap of time after 3.15 pm when it was not
investigated at the individual Inquests the nature of the
services available to deal with those being brought off and
if I can just give       one or two examples of that, you have
examples of people       who are brought off at 1522 and it is
said that there was an effort to resuscitate by a lay
individual and then that particular lay individual is not
heard of again, or the officer is not, and it is said that
the given loved one arrives at the temporary mortuary.
There has been no investigation directed to the_ alobai.
organisation _of w hat happpnpd immediately after t.hey were
brought off _the torrscp.s._ certainly I have ueen through
the” inaj.vj.auaj. transcripts and there does not seem to be
any evidence directed to that issue and those witnesses who
were called could not deal with those issues, sir.
     THE CORONER:   Are you suggesting that the cause of
death in respect of these individuals is not in fact the
pathological cause of death which we have been given but due
to a novus actus in effect by person or persons whose
evidence you have not yet heard?

     MR. KING:    Certainly the families, and I put it as
openly as this, sir, and putting it bluntly, cards on the
table, are not convinced at all that had there been a far
more sensible, logical organisation of the rescue services,
of the major disaster team being brought in, of proper
medical equipment being available, of proper triage being    !
carried out, that those measures, had they been there, in
several cases, would not have resulted in the survival of
their loved ones.    They cannot - obviously they were not
there - produce through me concrete evidence of that at this
stage but at every stage of an Inquiry into this disaster,
and this certainly is true even in the Taylor Inquiry, that
particular aspect of the disaster has never properly been
gone into.

     Again putting it very simply to you, sir, most of the
families I represent feel there has been a complete blanket
(not a deliberate blanket) been held down over what happened
after they were brought off the terraces and before
individuals were certified dead and there has been no effort
made systematically to analyse what was the organisation at
the time for the rescue, what might have been, and what could
have made a difference.   A very simple example again is that
I am instructed there is evidence of Dr. Gumpert given  at the
Inquest that without an electrocardiogram we can never be
sure whether or not there is a pulse and when dealing with
individual loved ones taken off the terraces and simply dealt
with by lay people, the absence of such sort of equipment
means that one would never know whether or not that
individual was alive or dead at that stage.   It is a
matter - and I do not mean this pejoratively - which is swept
under the carpet as if to say, "All we are interested in is
the immediate crushing leading to those being brought off the
terraces".   I cannot put it any more firmly than that, sir.

     THE CORONER:    You have put it very plainly and I
appreciate it.    I will give a ruling on your application in
a few moments but do you want to develop it further?
Obviously I want an opportunity to hear from your colleagues.

     MR. KING:   Have you the individual statements which
were supplied?

     THE CORONER:   I do have those in front of me.   I would
not want to go through all of them but if you wish to pick
one or two as examples I am prepared to listen to you and
indeed it also makes it easier for everybody else.
     MR. KING:    Sir, if you were to turn to No. 11 to start
with, which is the submissions to you of the Jones family,
Richard Jones, I do not know whether you have been given one
or two documents.    I have two documents in relation to Mr.
Jones one headed "Dear Miss Steel" and one headed "Dear Mr
King".

      THE CORONER:      No. 11, did you say?

       MR. KING:   Yes, sir.   -I beg your pardon, sir,     it is
No.   10.   Sir, if you look ---

      THE CORONER:   Mr. King, may I just stop you for one
moment because something has occurred to me, and I have been
reminded, which I ought to say to the Press before we go
further?    The session this morning is being heard without
the Jury and the reason we have not got the Jury is because
we are dealing with legal points.    That means no doubt that
you can report we are in session but you should not actually
report what is being said.    You will no doubt be familiar
with the provisions of Subsection 2 of Section 4 of the
Contempt of Court Act and I say you must not report what we
are discussing.    If we had wanted the Jury to hear we would
have had them present but we do not wish them to hear at thi:
stage.    You may, when we have finished the Inquest, if you
still feel it is a reportable and interesting aspect then, c:
course, that is a different matter but for the moment please
do not report the content of the legal matters we are
discussing.    Mr. King, I am sorry to interrupt you, would
you continue?

     MR. KING:   Sir, the document I am looking at and I
appreciate those alongside me     are not looking at any document
but it is just to.help you is one headed to myself,  "Dear Mr.
King”.

     THE CORONER:   I have a document headed "Dear Miss
Steel" dated 22nd October.

      MR. KING:      Sir, this    is dated 7th November.

     THE CORONER:       I have    not got it I am afraid.   It is
not in front of me.

     MR. KING:   I apologise for that and I will take you
through, if I may, through five points which are raised by
Mr. and Mrs. Jones.   Sir, they make the basic point that th<
report into the death of their loved one, Richard, was
certified at 1600 hours in the temporary mortuary and,
therefore, so far as the family are concerned, so far as
evidence is concerned, they presume, as they say they must b<




                      / s i ' )
entitled to, up to that time the evidence of death is not
clear as having already occurred.

     Point No. 2, sir, is extracted from the evidence given
by Dr. Gumpert at the Inquest already held here and in fact
it was evidence given on the occasion of Kevin Tyrrell and,
sir, it is a quotation from his evidence which you may
recall:

     "I would like to observe that feeling the carotid pulse
     is quite difficult in someone who has a low blood
     pressure as would have been here.   In fact it can be so
     difficult it is impossible and you have to have an
     electrocardiogram on to know whether the heart has
     stopped or n o t ."

     Then there is the statement of Mr. Eccleston, which is
certainly a statement in the large bundle of statements given
to the West Midlands Police, and indeed Mr. Eccleston gave
evidence to the Taylor Inquiry in which he says this:


                                  /"For an extremely l o n g . ..

That is a matter which my learned friend will. I am sure, fully
understand.  I merely mention it now so it is not said that it is
mentioned with hindsight afterwards.. There may, indeed   be a
great deal of difference between the responsibility or lack of
responsibility on the part of some of those who died, and
separate representation would in normal circumstances be requirec
because it may be that one family would make an allegation
against another.  Again. I give as an example, and I am not
saying that any such person exists, but if it were shown that
someone who died had come at the very last minute with a great
deal of alcohol inside him and had made his way right down to the
front, pushing and crushing, and had caused some deaths, then
that would be a matter where he or his relatives might well
require to be separately r e p r e sented.

     THE CORONER;   Y e s , Mr. Manning, if I may say so, the issue
of representation is (a) for the families, because that is to
whom you were applying your mind, and (b) for the legal
representatives who obviously have to weigh whatever conflict of
interest there may be between their clients.     So that is really,
not a matter for me, and it is not probably even a matter for
you.  It is a matter for Mr. King and his instructing solicitors
and, of course, primarily for the parties themselves.

     Perhaps I should say one other thing.      You have mentioned a
couple of verdicts and matters like that.      I am not getting into
an argument at this stage as to what verdict if any the Jury
would bring in, or even what directions, if any, I am going to
give them, because the objective of this Inquest as far as it has
one is to hear the evidence and to enable the Jury to reach a
verdict on the evidence.   I have the advantage of having seen
loads of statements.  I do acknowledge that, but experience has
taught me in much simpler Inquests than this that it is not
infrequent that what you think is going to be the verdict does
not turn out to be because the evidence when it actually comes,
or the nuance, if you like, or the innuendoes, or any word you
care to use, is different to what I had anticipated from just
looking at the statement.   So I have made it as far as I am
able a rule not to predetermine the answer but to wait until I
have heard the evidence.  I say this not as a criticism of you
but just as a clarification for everybody.      I do intend to
listen to what is said, which is the reason why we are here
this morning. Obviously. I have read statements and I have
ideas myself, but the crucial thing is the Jury, they have got
to make up their mind, and they do it in the light of the
evidence, and I will do my best.   I c a n ’t do more than that.  I
am sorry, Mr. Payne.

     MR. PAYNE:    Sir, with regard to the submissions by Mr.
King, the position of the Chief Constable is that he is neutral.
I have 'got no submissions to make about what Mr. King is asking
you to do, but I wish it to be heard that the position cf the
Chief Constable is that he wants to do everything he car. tc
assist you in the conduct of this Inquest, and certainly dees r.c
wish to do anything to put in the way of Mr. King any obstruct!©
into any enquiry that he wants to make on behalf of the relative
of the people who died.   Sir, that is the position.
                                                             14




     As a comment on what Mr. King has said, strictly it appears
to us that he is saying that there is the possibility, to put it
in a legal term, of a novus a c t u s . i.e. something which
intervened after the crushing and before the deaths, which causec
or contributed to the deaths of at least some of the people, and
the response of the Chief Constable to that submission, if I put
it correctly, is that we can quite see that is something which
people would wish to see investigated on the question of how it
came about.  I only make that comment in an endeavour to be
helpful, but the position of the Chief Constable is that he has
ho submissions one way or the other.

      May I just say while I am on my feet with regard to what Mr.
Hale has just said, as a matter of fact it is not correct that
the Police have admitted negligence.   It is well known and has
been well publicised that what has happened is that the Police
have agreed to make payments to those people who were injured anc
to the dependents of those who died, and that such payments are
in the process of being made.   Also there has been a civil actior
in respect of apportionment of liability in respect of those
matt e r s .

     THE CORONER:   Thank you very much, indeed.  I accept
entirely what you say and in a sense I accept what Mr. Manning
says as well.  It is not really relevant to my proceedings
whether or not negligence has been admitted or not admitted.   It
is neither here nor there.  So I did not comment on it, but I
appreciate what you have said.

     MR. ISAACS:   I think, sir,   in fact, that is Mr. Hale.     Mr.
Manning sits to my left.

      THE CORONER:    I beg your pardon.   Forgive me, please,    both
of y o u .

     MR. ISAACS:   Sir, I have no submissions.  It is entirely a
matter for you having regard to the breadth or depth which you
consider appropriate for this particular Inquest.

     MR. MANNING:   Sir, I have exactly similar comments as far
as my client is concerned.

     MISS SINCLAIR:      I have no submissions on this matter, sir.

     MR. CATCHPOLE:   I add to that.  The matter is entirely for
you.  You are the best person, having read all the evidence, to
make that judgment, and no doubt that was the reason we had, as
you have already pointed out, sir, a fairly detailed
investigation into the earlier Inquests.

     MR. CALLAGHAN:   Sir, this is not an application of which I
have had previous notice, and which in the circumstances of the
application is some surprise to me.         All I think I should, sir,
is this is not the time and place for some sort of Public Inquiry
into the activities of the Am b u l a n c e Service and the Emergency
Services, and it is not appropriate to bring such a matter into
the arena as a sort of   side wind. Beyond that, sir, it   is
obviously a matter for   you.

     MISS ADDELMANN:    Sir, I    have no observations or submissions
about the point, and I can do no better than echo those remarks
made by my learned friend, Mr. Catchpole.

     MR. RUSSELL:   I too endorse those remarks.     None of us,
other than my learned friend, Mr. King, has seen the original
statements, and so are being invited to comment upon a course in
the dark because we have not seen the nature of an example of the
material he now seeks to rely upon.     I recognise it is a matter
for you, and if you decide I d 6 n ’t take a stance one way or the
other.

     THE CORONER:   Shall I then deal with this point? Is there
anybody else wants to say anything on this issue? Mr. King?

     MR. KING:   Sir, only to emphasise that it is not a side
wind which I am embarking on.  I am seeking to address causes,
contributory causes to the deaths, and I am concentrating on
that, and it is in that context I have invited the Court to look
beyond 3.15, and certainly we are dealing with it from the point
of view of possibilities of novus a c t u s . yes, I accept that.

     THE CORONER:   I have listened hopefully with attention, anc
perhaps I ought to say this to you, Mr. Russell, before I go on.
I know you have not had the advantage of seeing the letter, but
it is only fair to say Mr. King in his summary of the points as
far as I can see summarised the points which his clients were
making entirely fairly.  There is nothing extra in the letter, sc
to speak, except connecting words, basically.   That is for your
reassurance, if I can put it like that.

     Throughout, and in fact almost from the word "go” on the
15th April, 1989, when I first learned about this incident, one
of the underlying criteria which I tried to apply in thinking
how to set about dealing with the Inquests was to as far as
possible treat    the Inquests as if they were completely
standard, if Ican put it like that - it is     a horrible word -
but completely normal Inquests.     The fact that it was national
news, that it was 95 young people, that it created a terrible
amount of anxiety, pain and so on, in some ways is unique
because of the    numbers, but each individual death I dealt with
families are in exactly the same situation, and I tried to
think and I still try to think, what and how would I set about
if I had had a road traffic incident or a works accident as
opposed to an incident in a football stadium.     I have thought
back on many occasions to say a road traffic incident where
somebody might have suffered a serious head injury.     That
person may well have been at the road side for X number of
minutes while one was waiting for the ambulance services to
attend.   They may then have been taken by an ambulance to a
hospital.   They may have gone into the resuscitation room.
They may have been worked on by the doctors. They may have gone
into hospital and they may have then died two, three days, may
be longer after the incident.     Or alternatively, you could have
                 /
                 /here by chance the road traffic incident occurs'on
                 a doctor happens to be.   He walks up to the
                ks and says, "I am sorry, the injury is so severe
                rson is dead".   Or you could have a situation where
               has this road traffic incident and is taken into
             !hd is certified dead on arrival.
                     i

               /one of those instances would I as a matter of routine
               /dence of what happened after the incident ;itself was
             ed. and indeed, the pathologists in the example which i

     r       s e d would have given as cause of death serious head injury
             r      /stance, for multiple injuries with fracture of the skull,
             hing of jhat nature.      It seems to me that the fact that the
          ^n may sufvive an injury for a number of minutes or hours or
                                                                                 01



         i days, isnot the question which I as Coroner have to
       fiider.      M^task is to establish who the person was - I am
      f r y to repat this - where he died, when he died and how he
     fed.     It is rom my understanding of the pathological evidence.
    ,he overwheling pathological evidence is and was that the people
   iiied as a re lit of crushing or traumatic asphyxia.        Different
 f u ords were uid, but the sense was always the same.         The
/ underlying pi>blem which these poor men and women were subjected
|f to was an iroility to breathe.

 important.jecause one wants to have if possible certainty.   Tha­
is the fire thing.   Secondly, the conventional way of
establishiii a person is definite dead is that a medical man say:
so. but to draw the conclusion that until a medical man has said
so a person is alive is in my view an impossible proposition to
maintain.

Dear Dr. Popper.

At the mini inquests we attempted to ask a series of questions concerning
t h r a f t e r m a t h at Hillsborough, we were left with the impression that the
q u t ™ o n s would be dealt with at a later stage.

However since then you have ruled that it is not necessary to proceed after
15.15pm and it now appears that our questions will not be addressed, you
did say that in an ideal world everyone would have ended up in hospital and
you suggested that we were naive in thinking that the medical response was
Inadequate, that sort of answer is not conducive to the facts as shown in
the video, and reports from Medical Personnel who were trying valiantly to
assist the injured.

The video shows 1t took till at least 15.35pm before all the casualties
were removed from the pens, a fairly lengthy delay which obviously did
nothing to help their chances of survival.

Reports and recommendations from the Medical Personnel (please find
e n r j ^ e d ) certainly imply that in their opinion, the response left a lot to
be w i i r e d .

We also know of people who were removed in an unconscious state, a prime
example being Mr. Edward Spearritt who according to Mr. Spearritt was not
admitted to hospital until 17.00 hours and who subsequently recovered, that
it was possible for people in the crush who suffered severe injury to
survive with a reasonable amount of aftercare.

At the very least this raises       questions in the eyes of the families that                   |
the inefficiency of the major      incident response could have contributed to                   [
the number of deaths occurring     at Hillsborough and therefore we consider                     j
that this should have been part     of your enquiries into the reason for the
deaths.                                                   ►.

You have promised to look into individual questions of concern, therefore
1t would not take a great deal of your time to enquire into this matter.



                                                                                             i

      He would suggest the two most qualified Medical Personnel nameiy Or. John
      Ashton and Dr. Glynn Phillips be called to give evidence at your Inquests,,
      so they can be questioned as to their medical opinion of whether the
      response contributed at all to the amount of fatalities.

      He think you realise the seriousness which we place on this matter, and we
      feel that if you fall to address this situation, that this failure will
      obviously form part of a case for Judicial revidw no matter what verdict 1s
      reached.

      Trusting you will give this matter your earnest consideration.

   Dear Mr Jones
A^ T h a n k you for your letter dated 12 February 1991, the contents of
   which I have noted and have read with care.

   Whilst I would not for one moment question the seriousness with which
   you view the points raised, I do not think that it is either right
   or appropriate for me to enter into a dialogue with you regarding
   the issue which you have raised.

   However, in order to avoid any possible misunderstanding, I do have
   to say that it is not my intention to call either Dr Ashton or
   Dr Phillips.

   I have also read your penultimate paragraph. Whether or not you
   apply for a judicial review is a matter entirely for you and/or your
   advisors and I do not think that I should comment on this either.

  Yours sincerely

)ear Mr. Humphreys,

                            Re: Hillsborough Disaster, April 1989

     Thank you for sending me the relevant documents in this matter, comprising uhe
 ost-njortem examination report of Professor Alan Usher in respect of his exacina* on
 f the body of Richard Jones and the transcript of part of the medical ev en„e
 n the early part of the Inquest, at Sheffield, in April, 1990.

      I have not seen any of the video evidence of the events which took place £u
 illsborough on the day in question, although I did, like millions of others, ses
 alevi         pictures transmitted on the day of the disaster.  The comments I m=.<e .re
 i a n s w ^ t o questions raised by Mr. Leslie Jones, father of R
                                                1_____             i 'n h j a r d .T oneG . CT.S O* t h e

 Lllsborough victims, when he spoke to me by telephone last week:-

        I am fully in agreement with Professor Usher with respect to his conclus.-ns
        regarding the cause of death, in the case of Richard Jones. The post-mor.em^
        findings are exactly those one would expect-in someone who has died from sspr./xlc.
        conseausnt upon compression of the chest and Professor Usher’s conclusions are
        logical and objective. I might add that Professor Usher is a very exper-encec.
        forensic pathologist, of international high repute.

        It is quite impossible to state exactly how long it will take a healthy ycjr.g^
        adult to die if his chest is being severely crushed, thereby producing as.,r.yx.i.a
        by restriction of chest movement, but I would concur with Professor Usher
        estimate that consciousness would be lost after 30 seconds cf signiflcaju. ^
        contlnuou restriction of chest movement and that death would occur after -^u.-
                  '3


        to six minutes of significant continuous restriction of chest movement.

        If significant continuous restriction of chest movement began at 3-00 P 'r'^.r0nVAi
        the fatal day, then it would be reasonable to conclude that a person so
        would be dead by 3-06 p.m., and unquestionably so by 3-15 P.m.  However,
        well be that in a particular case, perhaps in many cases, significant rest. j.c^
        of chest movement did not begin until several minutes after 3.00 p.m. a n ^ - ^ -
        the restriction of chest movement wa3 not continuous, but^lntermittenl. i-
        were so, and there is r e a s o n to bcliair-

    testimony), death, when it occurred, may well have taken place several minutes
    after 3.15 p.m. furthermore,; in the ca/se of a person removed from the enclosure
    at, say, 3.10 p.m. and who was unconscious, but not brain dead, and was then
    placed in a position other than the correct "recovery" position, or who, having
    been placed in the correct position, such a position was not maintained, a
    feared consequence, an inadequate airway, may well havd produced a prolonged
    state of unconsciousness, with death eventually occurring at a much later-time
    than 3-15 p.m.

                              Hillsborough,            15th April 1989
                                         Dr John Ashton



I am    a medical         practitioner        and    senior    lecturer   in Community     (Public)
Health at the University of Liverpool.                        On Saturday 15th April I vent to
the FA Cup semi-final match at Sheffield with other members of my family.
This year we travelled by way of the M62 and HI because for the sacs event
last year we had travelled on the direct route through the peak district
and there had been very bad build-ups of traffic on the way home.                           we left
Liverpool at about 10.15 am and arrived in Sheffield at about 12.15 - 12.30
pm.    We had a meal at a pub some distance from the ground and afterwards
walked perhaps 2 miles to the match.                    While we were at the pub a coach-load
of Liverpool supporters came in.                    They were boisterous but well behaved and
there was good humour between them and the local people who were earing in
the dining area.


We arrived at the Leppings Lane end of the ground at around 2.30 - 2.35 pm
(myself,      sons j                                                                         j
It was immediately apparent that it was going to be difficult to get in.
We    had   four    tickets        together    for    row   2 of   the    West   Stand,   above   the
Leppings Lane           terrace.     I had been particularly relieved to obtain seats
this year because             at last year's         game   in the semi-final we were        in the
terrace itself (in the right hand corner behind the goal) and it had been
terribly crowded and unpleasant.


On Saturday we found that outside the ground there were a large number of
supporters trying to get in to a small number of turnstiles and chat there
was   very.   little_ police presence.                I saw no stewards outside the         ground.
There appeared to have been no attempt to marshal the supporters into linss
in advance of our approaching the turnstile areas.


We managed         to   get   nearer    to    the    turnstiles    but    the crush vas    becoming
unpleasant.         I heard a police officer telling the supporters that                     it was
their own fault for coming late.



                                                       1
I decided, that I did not want to go on because it was so unpleasant,
said     it would      only      get     worse    and       that he    was   going   in. '                and
             insisted on going in with                         and they stayed where they were as
I withdrew to the wrought-iron fence.


After a few minutes I thought I would try again.                             I could not see ray family
and assumed that they had managed to get through the turnstiles.                                   When I
approached again it was now much worse and again I withdrew.                                  I was aware
of an officer trying to close one of the wrought iron gates, but he had no
chance on his own.            I noticed that there was now a police landrover in the
lane just outside the gates and my instincts and experience of 30 years as
a Liverpool supporter told me that things were going badly wrong.                                  I went
to the police landrover and obtained the attention of one of the officers.
I said to him,        "you’ve got to get a grip of this situation, it is out of
control,      there    is        going    to     be    a     tragedy."        He   seemed    bemused      and
unresponsive.         People were closing in around the landrover anc I withdrew
to the other side of the road to see if it would ease off and I could try
again.      The time now must have been 2.45 - 2.50.


After a few minutes              I suddenly realised that everybody had gone in and I
was able to walk up to the turnstiles and gain admission without difficulty
after tendering my ticket.


Once inside the turnstile it was at first un,clear where I should go.                                  Ther^
were   no    stewards       in    sight, and          the    section     labelling   was     confusing.     I
realised where the entrance was to the West Stand and went to get in after
buying a programme.              At this stage I had no idea that things had actually
now deteriorated to the extent that they had done.                             It must have been just
after 3.00 pm.


When I went to the gate into the West Stand there were a few other people
in the process of getting in and two policemen were checking their tickets.
I then became         aware of a man crying and beseeching the police.                          "There are      j
kids dying in         there," he said,           "you've got to do something."                He seemed to      ;
have come out         of the terraced area.                  The police were unresponsive to him.               j
They checked my ticket and let me in.                                                                           r
Once   inside    the    stand area     I   turned    up    the    stairs,     now worried   to   check

that ____________________________ were alright.                     As I got to the top of the
stairs it was difficult to make progress because there were so many people
in the aisle.          At the top of the stairs I could begin to see why.                         Many
people were being pulled up out of the terrace and into the front of the
s tand.


I could neither         attempt to get down to row 2 nor see the boys. 1 decided
to make my        way along the adjacent row.               Everybody was helpful and            I was
able to do       this without difficulty.           It must have been about row 20.               When
I got some        way along it I looked          down to see if I could see the                  boys.
            ______________________________ |.
First I saw |                                                    I was able to make my way down
to them over the seats.


When I reached them I could see that there were a large number of people on
the pitch,      people      trying to get out of the terrace on to the pitch and
people were continuing to come up in to the stand.                          There seemed to be few
St. Johns Ambulance people attending the people who were lying around the
pitch and I could see people lying on the pitch unattended.                            There was a
large line of police officers across the pitch at the centre circle.                               The
tannoy told the supporters who were on the pitch to get off it.


The pressure was bad where we were so I made my way back some rows with
                              stayed where he was to help pull people up from the
terrace.        When   we    got    further   back    we    had     a   clear   view   of what     was
happening    on the pitch;           it seemed   incredible.            The   time must have been
about 3.15 pm.


The overwhelming impression was of a large and growing number of casualties
and not much response.             The supporters were now impatient and angry at the
slowness of the response to the emergencies.                      There appeared to be only one
or two stretchers on the pitch and one ambulance was making its way around
from the far corner.               The supporters     were chanting for assistance               to be
brought to the injured who were lying on the pitch.                             The next thing was
that many of the supporters who were on the pitch began to tear down the
advertising boards          and organise    themselves into stretcher parties.        This
all happened very quickly.


I heard      the   tannoy    appeal   for   doctors   to help.    I could see that     the
situation was really bad and could count six people who appeared to be dead
near the goal mouth.          I made sure that                           were safe with
       and that I knew where they were and made my way out down the back of
the Leppings Lane Stand.


On    the   stairs   a policeman was        attending somebody who was    injured.     The
injuries did not appear to be critical so I asked the policeman where I
should report to help.           He did not know.        I went back into the stand and
brought the boys out and down the stairs to place them somewhere safe and
in sight.      I then tried to find somebody in charge to tell me who to report
to.     I asked several officers, but none of them knew.              There were people
lying everywhere in the yard area between the Stand and the turnstiles.                  I
asked the officer who was in charge and he indicated a senior officer.                   I
approached this officer and told him that I was a doctor and asked him who
was in charge of emergencies and where I should report.               He said he did not
know and that he had just arrived.             By this stage I realised that there was
no organised response and I was angry.                I asked the officer for his number
but he did not appear to have one.              I asked for his name.     He said he was
Inspector Grace.       I left him and went to see what I could do.


All around were people either dead or unconscious, or seriously hurt.                  The
supporters were fantastic.            They were all helping each other and trying to
resuscitate people.           Individual police officers were also doing what they'
could.      At no time did I see anybody attack a police officer, nor did I see
anybody who was drunk.


I came to the conclusion that somebody needed to take an                 overview    of the
situation and began to go round all the casualties to appraise them.                  There
did not seem to be any St. Johns Ambulance workers around at all.               I became
aware that some casualties were being taken out into Leppings Lane itself
and I went out there.            There was one ambulance.        The time must have been
about 3.30 - 3.35 pm.
The police were beginning to put people into the ambulance and I realised
that a system of prioritising by triage was needed.                                 So I did this.            I vent
around      and      either    checked       people    myself       or       asked    the    person who          was
attending them.             There were two or three other health workers in evidence
who    were     assessing,          resuscitating       and    doing         what     they    could.           There
appeared to be no medical or emergency equipment.


The dead were taken to one side and I allocated the other casualties to
category one or category two.                   I told the police who should be despatched
by ambulance next and who could wait.                       The officers were mostly very good.
They    took my       instructions       and acted on          them immediately.                   By this      tine
there was a steady flow of ambulances.                        It must have been 3.45 or 3.50.                        I
became aware of a local general practitioner who had arrived at the scene.
Over    the    next    half        an hour    we    worked    together         as     a team,       sorting       the
casualties and despatching them in the ambulances.                              An anaesthetist arrived
from somewhere and fire-engines came with resuscitation equipment, but all
of this was really too late.                       By 4.25 pm it was all over.                      The serious
casualties had gone to hospital and what remained were people with miner
injuries,      shock and distress and a line of dead people.                                 I went to check
that my family was alright and when I came back a police officer asked ir.e
to certify the deaths.                A general practitioner had already started this at
one end of the row of bodies.                      I started at the other.                   I think the tine
was 4.27 or 4.29 and I think I certified five or six dead.                                          Only       one cf
whom could be          identified from documents on his                       body.


During this whole period the public were fantastic,                                   although shocked and
angry.        On one occasion           at the end a group of young men carte past the
dead,    and      one of      them expressed his             anger    at police who were                     standing
there.      I told him to "cool it", that it was not helpful and he stopped.                                          I
saw    no     other    episodes       like    this     at   all,     although         there       was    a    general
atmosphere of anger at what had been happening.                                 I remember thinking he-
restrained everybody was.


It must have           been about 4.30 - 4.35.                There did not seem to beanything
else     for    me     to     do   behind    Leppings       Lane.        I    checked       that                ~~|zr.z.
               were    alright with                   and   then made          my way        to    the   granasi-t
around th£ side of the ground to see if I could be of any help there.                                  I
had become aware that other casualties had been taken to the gymnasium.


At first I had difficulty finding it as nobody could give me directions.
When I arrived there I went in and found that it was all over.                             At one end
there were tables (I think three) which must have been used for processing
details of the injured.              There were now no casualties in this area.                  At the
near end of the gym were rows of bodies.                    On my way past I noticed a large
display    of photographs            and   information on      the wall      of    the    gym    showing
Liverpool supporters who were thought to be pickpockets, etc.


I left the gym and returned round to the Leppings Lane end to check my
family again.           They were alright.        I thought that I should go back to the
gym   to   see    if     there   would be      a debriefing        of    people    involved      in   the
emergency    response,          so   all   four   of   us   vent   round.         This   time    it was
difficult to get near the gym because there was a large cordon of police
around it.        I spoke to an officer and he let us through when he k n e v I was
a doctor and I left                                          [safely behind them and vent to
the gym.         This    time    it was very difficult to get               in.     There was tight
control on the door.             I explained why I wanted to go              in and was allowed to
enter.


I asked     about a debriefing but nobody could help.                        Those who had been
helping were being cleared out of the gym.                         Just    then a senior officer
called all        the    officers .together       at   one   end    of    the hall       for    a police
briefing.        I don't know what it was about.              I left.


On our way back to Leppings Lane we encountered a police officer who                               was in
great distress and being comforted by another.                      I put my arm around him to
comfort him as well.             He was sobbing uncontrollably and saying that now tr.e
police would get the blame.                Another officer was .angry and '-old me that he
felt that        they had been let down by             the .senior officers.             He said that
nobody tiad taken charge              and that when senior officers had come they had
been of little use and just got in the way.
We left £he ground and returned to the car to drive home.                                We must have
left the ground by about 5 o'clock.


I would like to say that I have been following Liverpool Football Club for
over 30 years and that I am familiar with the normal range of behaviour of
club supporters.          Before the match on Saturday the crowd mood was buoyant
and generally good humoured.                   I feel      that since      the Heysel disaster an
attitude of mind has been cultivated which regards all football supporters
as members     of    a    sub-human species           to be contained.           As    a result      crowd
safety has     taken      second place.             On Saturday I believe          that this belief
about     football       supporters       contributed       to    the     apparently     slow   initial
response by the police to what was happening.                       It seemed that they mistook
the tragedy for crowd trouble.


It   is   difficult       to    know   how    many    lives      might    have   been   saved     if    the
emergency    response          had been      more    effective,     but    in my      opinion   on     this
occasion it was woefully inadequate.

   • • ~j • t-CCL^ES" f ofv,®                                      Address:


 I arrived at the approach to the Leppings Hoad end of the Hillsborough
 Stadium at lLt.25 hours.          I vas accompanied by my 27 year old eon and
 a young man of 17.           *"'e all had a valid ground ticket.                                         The immediate
 approach to the turnstiles, a distance of soae                                7 0    yards, was full cf
 a jostling crowd of ticket holders trying to make their way to the
 turnstiles.       There vas no semblence of orderly queues, with some kind
 of order trying to be maintained by three mounted police officers.
 Despite the lack of organisation and frustration the mood of the fans
 remained reasonably co -operative.                       To emphasise this, one of the horses
 was very close to me and accidentally almost knocked my spectacles off.
 The officer apologised and we e.changed smiles and I stroked the horse's
 nose.


     nearer one got to the actual turnstiles the pushing and crashing
 became severe.       After approximately ten minutes all three of us were
 literally catapulted through the turnstiles.                                   Over the last ten yards
 one had no control whatsoever over our movements.


 Once through the turnstile all three of my party came together.                                                             !-y son
 attempted to remonstrate with a police officer regarding the lack of
 organisation on the approach to the turnstile.                                      He vas warned by a
 steward standing alongside the officer to keep quiet because ether far.s
 who had made similar protests had been forcibly                                     ejected from the ground.


 We then moved away and vent to use the toilet situated in front of us
 mder the stand.          As we came out of the toilet we were directly facing
^Kie rear of the turnstile area and were immediately aware of the
 opening of one of the gates alongside the turnstiles.                                               The time was now
 just after lh.UO hours.           Anticipating the ensuing rush I took                                                   my
 companions to the right, aiming to take our place high up on the terracing
 to the left of the Lepping Road Stand facing the playing area.                                                           The
 previous y e a r ’s experience had alerted me that this was a sensiole area
 to stand, both from a safety viewpoint and it also provided an excellent
 view.         I have a vivid mental picture, as we hurried past the now
 infamous tunnel leading to the ill-fated sections, of turning my head
 and noticing there was nobody to be seen, either spectator or official.
                                         2-


  The high up area we entered was very full, but with no crush.         We

  positioned'ourselves within feet of the blue boards.       Looking down from

  my high vantage spot I could see the two middle oens immediately behind

  the goal were .jammed to capacity with a seething mass of people.      To my

  surprise, the pens on the left and right were half empty.       The area on

  the far right around the electronic scoreboard was also half empty.

  The time of this observation was 14.50 hrs.



  Vfy attention then became diverted when the Liverpool team took to the

  ^ield, followed a couple of minutes later by the opposition.        At the s£~e

  time I was conscious of a few people entering cur section behind ar.i

  alongside me.     There was no large influx /just before the kick-off where

  I was standing.



  The game had been in progress for some five minutes with Liverpool pressing

  home an attack at the far endt with a c o m e r followed by a shot which hit

  the woodwork.     I believe this shot to be significant because it r.sir.t

  a tremendous surge down the oens behind the Liveroool goal to try ar.i see

  what was hapsenir.£r.   This is the normal reaction on the terracing at any

^H^ootball match.         Prom my vantage point I was then immediately avare

  of fans trying to come over the metal fence behind the goal.        Some had

  "been successful and were being led down the touchline by the police.        Others

  were being stopped climbing out of the pens despite their obvious -retests.

  At the same time a senior police officer ran fro~ behind the Liverprrl goal

  and approached the referee.      He immediately stopped the game taking both

  teams off the pitch.         By this time a few more fans had managed tr

  escape from the pens.       One fan on the field of clay appeared to be

  pleading whilst he was being forcibly led to the side of the plavir.r area.

  Behind the goal the two uens were a seething mass of people with li'tle

  or no movement either backwards or forwards.      A few people were beir.g

  passed from the back of the oens to the front.         The front of tne pens
next to the fence seemed to be flat without the usual 'bo'b'bing heads.


Within two minutes of the teams leaving the field I realised something was

very wrong.       On reflection I have come to the conclusion that my alarm was

 confirmed due to a combination of medical experience combined with an

intimate knowledge of years of attendance at football matches on the

terracing.


I quickly realised that help would "be required on the pitch.       I informed my

son what I was doing and because I was so close to the entrance to the

terracing I had entered I quickly made my way down the stairs to find a

Steward to get me to the side of the pitch.        I quickly found a Steward who

ac ^ ^ ed what I was telling him and he took me through a tunnel under the aa'

stand where a Police Officer again accepted rry explanation of being a traine

nurse and let me on to the pitch.


I raced to the area immediately behind the goal net.       The narrow gate belcr.,

to the pen "behind the net was open with oclice officers trying to pull flayir

"bodies through the narrow openinr.      Other officers appeared to be trying t:

instruct the fans to push back ir. the pens.       I helped officers pull people

through the gate.        We were null ins any part of their body we could get hoi:

of.    On reflection I realise now because their bodies were level with the

boJ   m of the gate that thev must have beer. Ivinr on too of people because

the gap between the bottom of tr.e gate to tne floor of tr.e terracing was som<

three feet.



The first casualties I helped pull through the gate were conscious, "but very

shocked.      I attended to them at the back of the goalmouth on the netting.

Their recovery was comparatively cuick and simple were moved away from the

immediate area.        Very quickly I was aware that we were pulling out

unconscious "bodies.     I can next recall working on a young man who once he

was conscious seemed to have chest injuries.       I looked around the goalmouth

for a stretcher or something to remove him to a place for him to get treatmer
                                                    —L   f-




     The scene around me remained completely chaotic \>rith everyone trying to do

     their own thing, fans and police all mingling together.            I eventually found

    ' a stretcher lying on the pitch with which I quickly returned to the injured man.

     I literally ordered three police officers to help me lift the patient on to the

     stretcher.    By this time he was complaining about the pain ir. his chest.             We

     quickly made our way to the corner of the field between the main stand and the

     Kop and took the young man behind the stand to the St. John’s Ambulance room.

     I then ran back on to the field to the goalmouth.          In that short interval of

     time a lot more bodies were lying behind the goal.           People of all descriptions

     were attempting mouth to mouth resuscitation and cardiac massage.           On. the right

(    land side of the goal net a young girl was being worked on by a man who stated

    '■'e was a surgeon.      I moved to the body next in line and worked with a your.g

    ^P^Lice officer until the patient appeared to be starting to cone round.             I

    then moved on to the next person who was lying unconscious and unattended in

    the goalmouth.        I was working alone in this instance giving both mouth to routh

    and cardiac massage, an impossible and hopeless situation.           The patient started

    vomiting to complicate the issue.       I was conscious of ar. elderly white haired

    St. John’s Ambulance man working alongside me.            I requested some swabs tc clear

    an airway, all that was forth coning was a dry sponge.           By this tir.e it was

    after 15*30 hours and we still      had no equipment of any sort to work with.       It

    *as just after that that I was      conscious of the first ambulances beginning to

    ES-^^heir way on to the pitch.        Eventual 1;/ I realised that I had lost the

    battle for this young ma n ’s life.         I looked around but I could not see arrrriore

    unattended bodies.       By that time our ranks had been swelled by ambulance crews

    and firemen with some oxygen.


    I next left the field malting my way behind the main stand to the gymnasium where

    I understood some of the injured were being taken.           Again I found another scene

    of chaos.     The only entrance     to the gym was a door of similar dimensions

    to that found in any household      room.     Directly outside this door was the

    St. John’s Ambulance Room.        The space was becoming jammed full of people

    with comparatively minor injuries.          The area was also rapidly filling with

    people presumed dead.
 I nert assisted police to make some sort of pathway to the door of the gym by
 helping and organising the movement of "both the prospectuve dead and the

 seriously injured.'       Inside the gymnasium the space was roughly divided

 into two, half for the dead and the rest for the living, with tables set up

 to interview the relatives.      I began to work with the injured in the

 gymnasium at around 15*55 hours.      I was conscious of around three doctors in

 attendance, but when I arrived there there was still no medical equipment of

any sort.        One doctor shouted across the gym for some drugs to treat an

injured fan who was in obvious pain.       There was nothing available so I

volunteered to go to the St. Johnfs Ambulance room.        I was informed that

they were not allowed to carry any drugs.        I rushed back to the gym asking

         Senior Police Officer on the way if they could obtain some equipment

for us.       Quickly three small plastic boxes arrived with medical equipment

plus an emergency case with drugs in it.        I began passing out the meagre

items of equipment to the doctors present.       There were still only roughly

a dozen injured in the area.       I prepared ten intravenous lines ready for the

Medical Officer to set up, and we commandeered police officers to hold the

I.V. packs because we had no stands to attach then to.           3v then seme

semblance of order was being maintained in the part of the gymnasium given

over to the injured.        The other side of the gymnasium was rapidly filling

vr "h the p r - 2 - C dead.      One of the doctors present had taken one of the

t.,l H   stethoscopes available to enable him to declare them clinically dead.


I next tidied up the medical equipment as most of the injured were being

rapidly removed to hospital.      I then began to realise the full extent of

the disaster for there were already over fifty bodies lying on the floor.

    final act in this carnage was to comfort and stay with the husband of the

young girl whom I had seen attended to behind the goal.      At least I knev:

sne had had the best of attention that had been available in the

circumstances.      X stayed with him whilst he gave the necessary details

to the police, and then a local vicar took over froir me.

When I left the gymnasium, to my amazement it vas still only 16.45 hours.
The longest hour and a half of my life.
PERSONAL OBSERVATIONS



1   . Comparison of the organisation with the previous year.

      The previous year I arrived at the same area of admission at 14.50 hours

      ■with my daughter.   Before we reached the turnstiles at Leppings Lane

      we had to go through a police filter system, whereby it -was ascertained

      that we did have the appropriate match tickets.

      This year no such system was set up.



2.    rth years I was delayed because of travelling difficulties.       The

     ^(^iropriate Authorities had decided to initiate roadworks on the Me 2

      to commence around a week "before each game.     Surely the matches could

      have "been taken into consideration when setting up these roadworks.



3. When we came through the turnstiles for the 19SS game we were met 'ey a

      line of stewards and police officers who gently "but firr-ly prevented us

      from entering the tunnel to the middle sections.     It had been decided

      that these sections were already full to capacity.

      This year no such precaution was in operation.



4.   I can understand the Police Officers at the turnstiles wishing to open

      the gates to relieve pressure and avoid injury to life cr limb, but

      in these days of ultra modern and sophisticated personal communications

      surely it could have been done in conjunction with their central police

      control area at the side of the electronic scoreboard.



5.    Very recent national publicity has assured us that surveillance cameras

      at football grounds means that ar.y problems can be dealt with within

      two minutes of their occurrence.

      Surely with the police central control post with all its battery of

      T.V. monitors available, they should have been able to ascertain the
                                     ■2-


n.eed to close the middle sections when they became full.


6. ' Observing from 'the outside it appears to have taken far too long

    for the authorities to decide that it was not a security problem and

    that the fans genuinely needed help.   Working with and alongside

    the individual police officers in the immediate disaster area, I

   have tremendous praise and admiration for their efforts.     Overall

    at the scene, however, there appeared to be a lack of co-ordination

    and genuine leadership.



7. For an extremely long time we were without any form of medical

   equipment of any description.      I still carrnct understand why the

   local Health Authority's Ma.jor ?*edical Disaster Tean was net called

   upon.   I understand that all Health Authorities in this country

   have a major disaster policy.    It is inpossible to accurately

   estimate the difference>this would have made ir. saving life.

   I do, however, believe that the Liverpool fans should have been

   given the chance.

Dear Dr. Popper.

At the mini inquests we attempted to ask a series of questions concerning
tlv aftermath at Hillsborough, we were left with the impression that the
qut^fcons would be dealt with at a later stage.

However since then you have ruled that it 1s not necessary to proceed after
15.15pm and it now appears that our questions will not be addressed, you
did say that in an Ideal world everyone would have ended up in hospital and
you suggested that we were naive 1n thinking that the medical response was
inadequate, that sort of answer is not conducive to the facts as shown in
the video, and reports from Medical Personnel who were trying valiantly to
assist the Injured.

The video shows 1t took till at least 15.35pm before all the casualties
were removed from the pens, a fairly lengthy delay which obviously did
nothing to help their chances of survival.

Reports and recommendations from the Medical Personnel (please find
e m 'sed) certainly imply that in their opinion, the response left a lot to
be ^ ^ i r e d .

We also know of people who were removed 1n an unconscious state, a prime
example being Mr. Edward Spearritt who according to Mr. Spearritt was not
admitted to hospital until 17.00 hours and who subsequently recovered, that
it was possible for people in the crush who suffered severe injury to
survive with a reasonable amount of aftercare.

At the very least this raises questions 1n the eyes of the families that
the Inefficiency of the major Incident response could have contributed to
the number of deaths occurring at Hillsborough and therefore we consider
that this should have been part of your enquiries into the reason for the
deaths.

You have promised to look into individual questions of concern, therefore
1t would not take a great deal of your time to enquire into this matter.



                                                                                             /

                     Page 2

                     We would suggest the two most qualified Medical Personnel namely Or. John
                     Ashton and Or. Glynn Phillips be called to give evidence at your Inquests,
                     so they can be questioned as to their medical opinion of whether the
                     response contributed at all to the amount of fatalities.

                     We think you realise the seriousness which we place on this matter, and we
                     feel that if you fail to address this situation, that this failure will
                     obviously form part of a case for judicial review no matter what verdict 1s
                     reached.

                 Trusting you will give this matter your earnest consideration.

                                                  Yours sincerely,

   Dear Mr Jones
^ ^ T h a n k you for your letter dated 12 February 1991, the contents of
     which I have noted and have read with care.
   Whilst I would not for one moment question the seriousness with which
   you view the points raised, I do not think that it is either right
   or appropriate for me to enter into a dialogue with you regarding
   the issue which you have raised.
   However, in order to avoid any possible misunderstanding, I do have
   to say that it is not my intention to call either Dr Ashton or
   Dr Phillips.
   I have also read your penultimate paragraph. Whether or not you
   apply for a judicial review is a matter entirely for you and/or your
   advisors and I do not think that I should comment on this either.
   Yours sincerely

    Dear Mr. Humphreys,

                           Re: Hillsborough Disaster, April 1989

        Thank you for sending me the relevant documents in this matter                   comprising the
    ost-cjortem examination report of Professor Alan Usher  1                                               given
    f the body of Richard Jones and the transcript of part of the m-d
    n the early part of the Inquest, at Sheffield, in April, 1990.

         I have net seen any of the video evidence of     «'cnt*                    ‘e-
     lllsborough on the day in question, although I did, like millions of ° ^ e r a ...
     alevl  on pictures transmitted on the day of the disaster.  The               ^7of                            the
     i anawj^kto questions raised by Mr. Leslie Jones, father o    c^            ,
     lllsbo^rogh victims, when he spoke to me by telephone laet week:-

         I am fully in agreement with Professor Usher with respect tc his
         regarding the cause of death, in the case of Richard Jones        ihe po.st-mo.
         findings are exactly those one would expect-in someone w jo as eonciU io-^arp           3

         c o n s e n t upon compression of the chest a n d Professor Usher a             '
         logical and objective. I might add that Professor Usher is a verj exp
         forensic pathologist, of international high repute.

         It is quite impossible to state exactly how long it will take a ^ * ^ h y
         adult to die if his chest is being severely crushed, h e r e b y Pr° ^ i n g .
         by restriction of chest movement, but I would concur with Professor Usher .
         estimate that consciousness would be lost after 3 sec°n s ^ ‘     ' afte’" 'cu**                   4

         continuous restriction of chest movement and that death would
         to six minutes of significant continuous restriction o. ch-at movera- .

         If significant continuous restriction of chest movement began at 3-00 P-^;r°"£ed
         the fatal day, then It would be. reasonable to conclude that a pe ~         --
         would be dead by 3-06 p.m., and unquestionably so by 3-15 P         ^wever_-
         well be that in a particular case, perhaps in many cases, s i g n l f i ^ ^
         of chest movement did not begin until several minutes after           p^m.«
                                                                               3   . 0 - *

         the restriction of cheat movement was not continuous Lut^inteimitlent. i.
         were so, and there is reason to be.lia.

after 3.15 p.m. Furthermore,. In the case of a person removed from the enclosure

placed in a position other than the correct ’’recovery" position, or who, having
been placed in the correct position, such a position was not maintained, a

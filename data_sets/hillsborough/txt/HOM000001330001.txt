WALTER JACKSON
ASSISTANT CHIEF CONSTABLE (OPERATIONS)
POLICE HEADQUARTERS
SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE




I was promoted to the rank of Assistant Chief Constable, Operations, in the

South Yorkshire Police on 1 May 1985 and have played a major part in the preÂ­

planning and overseeing of operational police work.



In 1988, Hillsborough Football ground staged the Semi Final between Nottingham

Forest and Liverpool and a planning team was set up under the command of the

Divisional Commander, Chief Superintendent Mole.



 Following consultations with all interested parties which included the Football

 Association, the Club, Fire and Emergency Services, Transport representatives

 and Traffic Management and the examination of available intelligence, the

 manpower level and operational plan was produced for the Semi Final and the

 manpower for policing was determined and set at 940 officers for the

 Hillsborough Operation.



 The event took place with little or no difficulty and was described as a

 successful operation.




  On 20 March 1989 South Yorkshire Police were approached by the Sheffield

  Wednesday Football Club Secretary with a view to the Semi Final being staged at

  the Hillsborough ground on 15 April 1989 with the same teams being involved.

  Bearing in mind the previous years experience, it was agreed that the event

  would be staged in the same way.   Approaches were made for the Clubs involved to

  be given alternative ends of the ground to the 1988 Semi Final.   In relation to
                                         2


this approaches to the Kop and the South Stand are from the South, the area

where the vast majority of Nottinghamshire supporters would travel, and the West

Stand and Terrace, and North Stand are approached from the North, the area from

which the vast majority of Liverpool supporters would travel.    These areas were

therefore allocated on this basis and any alteration would have resulted in

opposing fans crossing each other, therefore, increasing the likelyhood of

disorder and, in addition, excessive disruption to the residents of Sheffield

causing traffic problems before and after the event.


This decision was in accord with the recommendations of the Popplewell Report,

regarding the need for opposing fans to have a clear differentiation of spacial

separation and physical containment of opposing groups.



This decision was accepted by the FA, the Clubs and other interested parties.


Mr Duckenfield at that time was Deputy Divisional Commander on D Division and

was due to take over responsibility from Chief Superintendent Mole on 27 March

 1989.   He had considerable experience in policing major events and his division

 included Sheffield United Football ground.   I   was extremely confident regarding

 his ability to police the Semi Final.   In the initial stages Chief

 Superintendent Mole reviewed the planning arrangements with the previous years

 Police planning team and so as to ensure continuity a meeting was arranged on 22

 March 1989 similar to last years meeting with both Chief Superintendent Mole and

 Chief Superintendent Duckenfield, and the previous years planning team, present.

 The meeting also included Chief Superintendent Nesbit, Operations and Traffic,

 who was to take full responsibility for the traffic arrangements.



 The planning then continued through division by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield

 and the same Police planning team as the previous year.    Chief Superintendent

 Nesbit, Ops & Traffic, liaised with the division concerning manpower
requirements and both officers kept me updated regarding developments. During

the planning period I was informed by Chief Superintendent Nesbit that it was

necessary to look for mutual aid in respect of horses and dogs.   It was

therefore decided to utilise mounted officers from Nottinghamshire and

Merseyside as they would have a thorough working knowledge of the supporters in

their respective areas.   Arrangements were made for 12 mounted police officers

from Merseyside and 8 from Nottinghamshire to be supplied and work under the

supervision of the Inspector in charge of the South Yorkshire Mounted Police

Section.   Twelve dog handlers from West Yorkshire and 8 from Nottinghamshire

were requested and worked double manned with South Yorkshire officers, that is 2

officers in each vehicle.



 The method of raising manpower for events such as the Semi Final and all other

 operational matters within South Yorkshire is based on the policy which reflects

 that the division upon which the event is to take place should identify the

 manpower it can raise and then inform Operations Division at Force Headquarters

 of the additional manpower which is required.   The additional manpower is then

 raised from across the Force area from duty and off-duty time officers and is

 notified to the host division for an allocation of duties and in terms of the

  operational order this is submitted to me as Assistant Chief Constable

  (Operations).   This procedure took place.



  The determination of manpower levels in connection with any operational event is

  of necessity to be based on information available and the intention of any plan

  made in this connection is to ensure flexibility in the deployment of resources.

  In this respect the manpower involves that utilised in policing the actual

  events at Hillsborough under the command of the Divisional Officer, and may

   include other available resources, for example, traffic patrol officers assigned
                                       4



    to Semi Final duties and those officers from D Division who were assigned

    transportation/escort duties of fans from the city centre.


    Following previous experience it was decided two years ago that the Divisional

    Commander responsible for Hillsborough could be more effective if he did not

    have to be concerned with the logistics of directing traffic and escorting it to

    the ground.   In view of this the Chief Superintendent, Operations and Traffic

    Division, took on this task and prepared his ownplans.     These duties were

    undertaken in this way in 1988 and 1989.


    in addition the staging of the event at Hillsborough of necessity affects the

^   city centre and once again the role of the Hillsborough commander cannot be

     diverted to take control of this aspect.   As a consequence a separate plan is

     prepared for dealing with city centre problems associated with the semi final,

     and this action was embarked upon in both 1988 and in 1989.


     The three areas of command maintain contact through radio and land line

     communications and through this method flexibility for re-deployment is

     adequately catered for.



     An example of the flexibility of the plan can be drawn from the fact that in the

      D Division Order officers are allocated to escort duties of public transport

      vehicles travelling from the Midland Station to the Hillsborough ground and the

      contingency plan is that when these officers have completed their allocated task

      they remain available for re-deployment at    the ground as an additional resource

      at the ground gymnasium.   On completion of   the match the officers are again used

      for escort duties back to the railway station in the city centre.
                                   5


An examination of the 1989 requirements having regard to the Operation in 1988

revealed that a reduction in manpower on the peripheral areas could be carried

out and these are shown on Appendix A.       It will be noted that the reduction at

the ground is relatively small and absolutely minimal at the Leppings Lane

turnstiles and terraces.   Appendix B.



Taking into account the three aspects of policing - Traffic, D Division and

Hillsborough - the total manpower available for deployment was as follows



                    1988               H73

                    1989               H33


To ensure that football supporters were made aware of the arrangements.       Letters

were sent to the Chief Constables of Merseyside and Nottinghamshire requesting

 the widest possible circulation (Appendix C)



 Letters were also sent to the person responsible for preparing match programmes

 (Appendix D).



 Letters were went to the Chief Ambulance Officer and Chief Fire Brigade Officer

  (Appendix E).




  When all the planning was completed I received a copy of the F Division

  Hillsborough Order and I was satisfied with the arrangements made.
At 08.45 am on Saturday 15 April 1989 as senior officer on weekend cover I

attended at Police Headquarters and went to my office.



I updated myself about the previous nights work and dealt with the morning mail

and correspondence.



Sometime during the morning I spoke to Chief Superintendent Nesbit I/C

Operations and discussed the traffic flow to the Notts Forest/Liverpool football

match being staged at Hillsborough Football ground, kick off at 3.00 pm.

 Everything was going to plan and he agreed to pick me up about 1.00 pm to g o t o

 the football ground.



 About 1.00 pm I went into the incident room at Force Headquarters handling the

 match information and spoke to Superintendent Anderson.    Everything seemed to be

 going well - the traffic flow was busy which was to be expected on such an

 occasion.



  About half an hour after that Chief Superintendent Nesbit arrived at Police

  Headquarters and took me to Hillsborough Football Stadium via Penistone Road.

  This road was still busy at this time and we stopped so that Chief

  Superintendent Nesbit could encourage vehicles to use two lanes inwards to the

  ground. We then continued our journey and he dropped me off at the Directors car

  park entrance on Penistone Road.    I walked through the Directors car park to the

   far end of the ground and went through the gate up to the Police Control Room.

   There was nothing unusual and I took the view everything was going to plan.



   In the Control Room I met Chief Inspector McRobbie and the officers manning the

   video and radios.    There was a cordial exchange and little else when I noticed
                                   7




Chief Superintendent Duckenfield the officer in charge of the operation and

Superintendent Murray come up to the terrace to join me in the Control Room -

this would be just after 2.00 pm.      Mr Duckenfield said that he had been to see

the referee to discuss police procedures and a general discussion took place

about the operation which was progressing satisfactorily.



I recall a comment being made about the Notts Forest fans coming early and there

was still a lot of people to enter the North Stand for Liverpool Supporters.         It

was considered that there was plenty of time to get the supporters in,      I left

the Control Room and went to the Directors lobby where I saw the Club Secretary,

Mr Mackrell.     I made comment about the Liverpool fans coming later than the

 Notts Forest fans and he said that the gates had been opened at 12 midday to let

 them in. I then went to the Directors box and sat in the seat reserved for the

 police.



 The North Stand seemed to be filling up very well towards the start of play, but

 there still looked as if there was some room when the players ran out on to the

 field prior to the commencement of the game.



  Just after the game started I had occasion to look towards the West Terrace and

  saw a number of fans had come out on to the pitch.     More fans came on and I

  immediately went to the Police Control Room where I saw Chief Superintendent

  Duckenfield.    He was unable to say what had happened at that stage and I

  recollect the game had been stopped.



  I decided to go down on to the pitch to see what the problem was and on getting

   there I saw Superintendent Greenwood who informed me that he was dealing with

   the situation and he said we had injuries.     The crowd had got bigger on the

   pitch and I ran back up to the Control Room to make use of communications - a
                                   8



fleet of ambulances had been requested (3.07 pm).    Because of the seriousness of

the situation and together with Chief Superintendent Duckenfield we gave

instructions to the Control Room Staff for implementation of the major disaster

plan.   There would be considerable pressure on our controller at this time - but

I knew we were being monitored by our Force Incident Room dealing with the match

to link to the major incident and I remember being asked to confirm operation

support (3.10 pm).



In the meantime rescue operations were taking place on the pitch and I

specifically requested that Superintendent Torr be requested to take charge of

the Casualty Bureau and Detective Chief Superintendent Addis, head of CID to

attend to see me so that the cause of the incident could be investigated.     Mr

Duckenfield was continuing to deal with other matters with our radio controller

and we requested that he broadcast for people to leave the pitch and keep calm

 so that we could deal with the injured.



 A request was made later for Mr Duckenfield to attend the Board Room and

 something was mentioned about the game being abandoned - it was important not to

 make any announcement until we dealt with the casualties so that we could get

 them to hospital whilst it was clear outside.



 I went to the Board Room and Superintendent Murray was left in charge of the

  Control Room.    Mr Duckenfield spoke to them - I reinforced the need to get the

  casualties away before any announcement was made and we returned to the Police

  Control. Room.



  At about 3.35 pm Detective Chief Superintendent Addis made contact via telephone

  at the Control Room and I briefed him regarding the situation at the football

  ground and requested him to attend and see m e .
                                  9




We were made aware that there were fatalities and a temporary mortuary was

arranged in the gymnasium.


The managers of Notts Forest - Mr Clough and Liverpool - Mr Dalglish came into the

Police Control Box and asked whether the game was postponed.      They were told it

would be, but an announcement should not be made.     Mr Dalglish asked if there

was anything he cou'ld do and he was requested to make an announcement for the

Liverpool fans to keep calm so the police could deal with the situation.      He did

so and both managers left the Control Room.



 Some time after this I went to the pitch and spoke to Chief Superintendent

 Nesbit who had been i n v J p d in the rescue operation.   At that time there was a

 lot of shouting at the Leppings Lane end and restlessness creeping round the

 ground.   We deciWd tfiat it would be helpful to calm everyone by making an

 announcement that the game had been abandoned and ask the fans to remain where

 they were until all the casualties were taken away from the ground.      We then

 made a request vfa the Police Control Room for this to be done.



  I then returned to the Police Control Room.    Detective Chief Superintendent

  Addis arrived and I briefed him regarding the enquiry into the events to

  commence and tb ensure that the temporary mortuary and casualty bureau were

  functioning.



  All the casualties were cleared and then at approximately 4.45 pm Chief

  Superintendent Mole came to the Control Room.     I briefed him regarding the

   situation and requested him to control and co-ordinate remaining matters at the

   ground so that I could go to Police Headquarters to continue enquiries and brief

   the Deputy Chief and Chief Constable.
I left the Police Control Box with Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and

Superintendent Marshall who had joined us and walked across the pitch to the

Police Room.   We met Mr Barron, a Director of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

on the pitch and he said the police had done an excellent job.   He was clearly

upset and crying.



About 5.15 pm Superintendent Marshall, Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and

myself went to Police Headquarters.   I spoke to the Deputy Chief Constable and

later, because of the amount of manpower that had been used, began making

arrangements to ensure sufficient cover for the following day.



Because of the impending visit of the Minister of Sport at 9.00 pm I liaised with

our operational staff to ensure that appropriate arrangements were made and also

ensured that appropriate staffing arrangements were available for temporary

mortuary staff - casualty bureau and that relatives of deceased and injured

would be sympathetically dealt with by counselling.



 I retired from duty about 0245 am.

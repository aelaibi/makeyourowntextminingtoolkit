 DRAFT LETTER FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO:
 The Rt Hon Jack Straw MP
 Secretary of State for the Home Department
 Home Office
 50 Queen Anne's Gate
 L ^ D O N SW1H9AT

    Ju n e 1997




Thank you for your letter of 5 Ju ne 1997 outlining the considerations which
have led you to conclude that we should initiate an independent examination
of the alleged new evidence because this appears to be the only way to allay
public concern.


I have no di^ l t y in principle with your approach.          There undoubtedly
remains deep w u u S dissatisfaction amongst the relatives of those who died as
well as some of the survivors and their relatives about the m anner in which the
public authorities conducted themselves at the material time. They have
manifested themselves in calls for official action which, even if acceded to.
would in all probability not then address the concerns. For example, a further
inquest - which can only be ordered by the High Court • would have to
consider the statutory issues prescribed by the Coroners Act 1988 and could
not properly become a wide ranging or generalised enquiry.
   ,-rflEI I I -51   ATTORNEY GENERAL               T E l:0 1 -I « ’« « ? 5 1 ‘ 8 2 8 0 5 9 3   p 003




Against this background. I do have difficulty with the draft Terms of Reference.
They do not distinguish adequately between the question of a further public
enquiry which is largely a m atter of discretion and judgment and the question
of a further inquest or possible prosecution. In relation to these, we start from
( p o s itio n where there is nothing to suggest that the Director of Public
Prosecutions and my predecessor have failed properly to consider, in
accordance with the relevant tests, all the evidence which has been made
available to them. The sole issue therefore in relation to questions about
further in      quests or prosecution is whether there is any evidence which has
not already been considered. Moreover, consideration of that further evidence
would be a m atter for the DPP or myself as appropriate. It would in my view
be wrong for a public enquiry to express a view, for example, on possible
criminal charges.


In these circumstances. I enclose a suggested revised wording for the Terms
of Reference. If you are intending to proceed as envisaged. I would be content
for Lord Justice Stewart Smith to be appointed.

  SUGGESTED TERMS OF REFERENCE


  To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the
  Hillsborough Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:


  (a)         to the inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or


  (b)         to the Director of Public Prosecution or the Attorney General for the
          purpose of discharging their respective statutory responsibilities:


 (c)      to the chief officer of the South Yorkshire Police in relation to police
          discipline matter:


 and in relation to (a) above to advise whether any evidence not previously
 available is of such significance as to justify establishment of a further public
 inquiry and. in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to their attention any evidence
 not previously considered by them which may be relevant to their respective
 duties.

The Home Secretary met you yesterday to discuss your submission of 23 May.
Mr Michael, Mr Howarth, Mr O'Brien, Mr Boys Smith, Mr Middleton,
Mr Edmundson, Ms Walker, Mr Owen, Mr Warner, Mr Sutton and myself were
also present.

Terms of Reference

2.     The Home Secretary agreed that these should be re-cast to include first
the reference to examining whether there were sufficient grounds for his
establishing a further public inquiry, and, to wrap up with a reference to any
other action which needed to be taken in the public interest. Mr Middleton said
that the drafting should preserve the discretion of the Attorney General, DPP and
Chief Police Officer over the decisions for which they were responsible.

3.     You agreed to re-cast the terms of reference and provide an appropriate
draft to the Attorney General. {Secretary's note: This was done in
Mr Edmundson's subsequent submission that day and the Home Secretary wrote
to the Attorney General as drafted.)

Membership

4.    The Home Secretary noted that Mr Justice Collins had previous
involvement with the Hillsborough case and also with issues investigated by the
Scott Inquiry. You said that a QC could undertake the inquiry. Mr Howarth
stressed that whether a judge or a QC was involved they should be of sufficient
seniority. Mr Michael suggested that the Home Secretary might discuss this
privately with the Lord Chancellor and he said that he would do so if necessary.

5.    The Home Secretary said that Ian McBride, who had produced the World
In Action programme should also be approached. You raised the question of
whether the announcement^ should be by PQ or by oral statement. The
Home Secretary agreed that it would be better to make an oral statement. He
considered that he should also talk to his predecessor.

6.     I should be arateful for further advice on who should do the inquiry once
we have received a reply from the Lord Chancellor's Department. Subject to the
replies to the Home Secretary's letter to the Attorney General. I should also be
grateful for further advice on the handling of the announcement of this inquiry.

          B efo re th e s t a r t of n e x t season I w an t you to a r r a n g e a Sem inar for
stew ard s and p ro g ram m e sellers so th a t they can be inform ed e x a c tly of th e ir
duties.

             It is im p o rta n t th a t you draw up a list of stew ards and their
re s p e c tiv e d u ties, and similarly w ith p rog ram m e sellers. In th e case of
p ro g ram m e sellers th ey must be in s tr u c te d th a t this job is a selling job and
th ey m u s t go o u t to our supporters to sell and m ake some vo cal c o n trib u tio n to
it. They m u s t be stra te g ic a lly placed and th eir p erfo rm a n ce m onitored.

         Many of th e above re q u ire m e n ts apply also to s tew ard s.

            Do you think it would be rew ard ing if o th e r people such as our
tu rn s tile o p e r a to r s w ere also properly in s tru c te d along th e se lines?

After        the briefing we were               s u p plied with a light              snack.       After       this

During       this      period we e n c o u n t e r e d      no    particular         public      order

situations.             In the main the              public      in our area a t t e n d i n g       the game

were L i verpool           supp o r t e r s    and were         in good spirits.



The    flow of         incoming       traffic        from the d i r e c t i o n of the Hi m o t o r w a y wi

s teady w i t h no amount              of a p p arent       conge s t i o n    being evident.              I would

say that       by about 2-1 5           pm the        traffic      flow was        very    light     heading          in

the d i r e c t i o n of the ground.                  Whi 1 sj> on a position towards                   the    top of

Halifax R oad           1 was aware           of a          i c house       up one of the side                roads

called       I believe         the Jrassacl.          'This      pub was      open and was         being well

f re q us nt e d by      3.i v e r poatf s u p po r t e r s .     I spoke      to several        and they

s tated they had sp^mt                en j o y a b l e    time    there     the    previous       year     at the

same    fixture         so / \ a .d returned.



As    prev i o u s l y stated there was                  no trouble       seen     in theis are a at all.

The    s u pporters        by the m a j o r i t y had           left    this are a      in very good time                  t

caught a service               bus and some           set off      to walk        to the ground.              It was

m e n t i o n e d at    the    time   that      they had         left    it late      to get      to the groursi.

for    the start         of the game.            Whilst         drink    had o b v i o u s l y   been

  OPEN LETTER - IB8UED BY FAX AT 11.00 AM - 23RP"OCT,PBE

TO: HR RICHARD WELLS - CHIEF CONSTABLE, SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE
    BRIGADIER POHNALL - POLICE COMPLAINTS AUTHORITY
    KR DAVID DUCKENFIELD
    HR BERNARD MURRAY



HILtgpQRQPSg/.Â£QU;cg.-PIggIPMHB
It is now some months since the Police Complaints Authority
instructed the South Yorkshire Police to instigate disciplinary
proceedings against Messrs Duckenfield and Murray in respect of
the Hillsborough Disaster on the 15th April 1989.


Hothing has, so far, happened - allegedly due to Mr Duckenfield'a
incapacity on undisclosed sickness grounds.


Whilst we regret Mr Duckenfield's illness, the investigation of
the Hillsborough Disaster remains a matter        for deep public
concern and it is totally unacceptable for the current stalemate
to continue.   The healing process and the restoration of the
public's confidence in both the Police and the Judicial Process
can only begin when these matters are adequately dealt with.


On the 24th of October 1991 it will be 90 days since the 26th of
July, when Mr Duckenfield commenced sick leave.    He will then be
entitled to apply for early retirement on ill health grounds and
the disciplinary matters relating to hi* would automatically
lapse.
WhilBt acknowledging Mr Duckenfield'a right to take thia course

of action I implore him not to exercise thia option but to grasp
the opportunity of clearing hia name bys-


1.   Submitting himself for independent medical assessment.
2.   Allowing the disciplinary tribunals to proceed with him
     being legally represented - thus sparing him the rigours of
     the tribunal, yet ensuring his interests are protected.


Similarly I call upon the South Yorkshire Chief Constable Mr
Richard Wells and the Police Complaints Authority to immediately
begin the disciplinary proceedings involving Hr Murray.


As long ago as October 1989 the All-Party Home Affairs Committee
of MP's fully endorsed the retirement statement of the first
Chairman of the Police Authority, Sir Cecil Clothier QC, whos-
a)   Castigated some Police Forces for delaying disciplinary
     proceedings and failing to prosecute them with vigour.
b)   Expressed concern over the ever-increasing number of cases
     involving officers who were allowed to retire, whilst they
     were under investigation.
c)   He called upon the Home Office to set up a Board to review
     all applications for medical retirements under these
     circumstances.
d)   Called for tougher action to be taken even when an
     Offioer was found to be unfit and granted medical
     retirement.
e)   Called for time limits, to be introduced by the end of
     1989, to eliminate delays in disciplinary proceedings.
One can hardly expect myself, other members of theJHillsborough
families,   or indeed the general public to accept indefinite
delays and/or this matter not being brought to a satisfactory
conclusion*


X Implore all those concerned to prevent further distress and
acrimony by dealing with these outstanding matters immediately.

Before             the m a t c h          started          it was        obvious            to          that        some t h i n g        wa s

happening                 because          I could          see     one       or     twrf* p e o p l e        climbing             over     the

fencing.                  I thought              that      they were           trying            to    get       onto        the    pitch        at

first,             but     I s oon         realised           they were              hurt        in one          way     or    another,,              I

fence           had       no    intention             of    going        on     the       pitch and              some        of t h e m     climbed

back          o n to      the       fencing        and      they        tried        to     tell       people           to    get     bacK       and       it

became             obvious           t ha t      there      wa s    a    crush.             Fruiii t h e n         on    things        got       worse

and       people           were          screaming          and     climbing              out     of    the        standing           pens       below

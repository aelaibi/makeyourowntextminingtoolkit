                  We    formed    into our       serials       outside        the     ground.



At a p p r o x i ma te ly 3 , 0 7 p m     (1507)       we were       given      the    command to enter                the

ground,       upon entering           I saw a large            number      of     people      behind the          stand

wan d e r i n g    about,     I also      saw    peop 1 e c-arrying others                t h r o u q h the      c entra 1

cleared a path from the                   tunnel       to enable       a free         passage       for    the bodies

to be     carried out,            I then     took      charge    of 2 groups             carryir)^ b o d i e s they

placed them on the ground.                       I checked their              vital     sign#       both were

breathing and their                hearts were          beating.          I placed y l h e m        both    into       the

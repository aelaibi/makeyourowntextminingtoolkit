HILLSBOROUGH SCRUTINY

Issue

We have received further correspondence from relatives of the Hillsborough victims,
referring both to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s recent off-the-cuff comments in
Liverpool, and to what they perceive to be the limitations of the Judge’s terms of
reference (enclosed behind).
rp •
   •
Timing

2.       Routine.

Recommendation

3.       That you reply to the correspondence along the lines of the attached drafts.

Consideration

4.    My submission of 22 October (attached) covered the background and reaction
to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s comments. He remains committed to the scrutiny, and
has not indicated that he finds his terms of reference to be restrictive.

Handling/presentation

5.     Hillsborough disaster relatives have in the past received S of S replies. There
are no additional handling considerations.

Thank you for your letter of 21 October about Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s Scrutiny
into the Hillsborough disaster.


The terms of reference which I have given Lord Justice Stuart-Smith for the Scrutiny
will allow him to establish conclusively whether any material evidence was
overlooked in the consideration of the causes of the disaster or the consideration of
criminal or other proceedings. The Judge will also be able to recommend any other
action which should be taken in the public interest. His terms of reference are,
therefore, very wide indeed and I am confident that they will allow him to carry out a
full scrutiny of the evidence which has been submitted by the families and others.


The Judge spent three days in Liverpool meeting the families of those who died and
listening to their concerns. He has said that he found these meetings fruitful and
constructive, and that they will help him to write his report.


I am satisfied that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will provide a thorough report in which
the families and the public can have confidence.

Thank you for your letter of 27 October about Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s reported
comment during his recent visit to Liverpool.


I am sorry that you were upset by the Judge’s comment to Mr Phil Hammond. The
Judge has said on the record that he deeply regrets this remark, which he made off-
the-cuff and without any intention to offend or for it to be taken seriously. He has
made clear that the behaviour of the fans is not the subject of the Scrutiny.


The terms of reference which I have given Lord Justice Stuart-Smith for the Scrutiny

therefore, very wide indeed and I am confident that they will allow him to carry out a
full scrutiny of the evidence which has been submitted by the families and others.


I am sure you will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on
the detailed issues you raise in your letter, many of which fall within the remit of the
Scrutiny. As I have indicated before, I will make public the advice given by Lord
Justice Stuart-Smith in his report, and will take whatever action is needed in the event
that he suggests material evidence about the disaster has been overlooked.


As you know, the Judge spent three days in Liverpool meeting the families of those
who died and listening to their concerns. He has said that he found these meetings
fruitful and constructive, and that they will help him to write his report.


I am satisfied that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will produce a thorough report in which
the families and the public can have confidence.

Dear Sirs

FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO POLICE OFFICERS IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS                           -

YOUR CLIENT: MR B MURRAY

I thank you for your facsimile letter dated the 24 D ecem ber 1998. In view of the delay in
the Crown Prosecution Service providing details of the reasons for the decision taken not
to intervene to take over the conduct of the private prosecution proceedings instituted by
the Hillsborough Family Support Group, it now appears unlikely that the Authority will be
in a position to fully consider the further requests m ade for financial assistance when it
m eets on the 8 January 1999. Accordingly, I have taken steps to call a special meeting
of the Authority on the 15 January 1999.

           Dear Ian

           Further to our telephone conversation this advice is based on Home Office Circular number 77/87
                                                                                                                                                                                 /
           and on the interpretation put on their circular in the case of R Derbyshire Police Authority Ex P
           Wilson (The Times August 8 1989)

           I assume you have access to a copy of the circular and I enclose herewith a copy o f The Times Law
           Report of the Derbyshire case.

                          The concern which I raised us to the appropriateness of your seeking sepai ate legal advice
                          about thus matter was clearly misguided, Paragraph 14 of the circular requires that the
                          application for assistance be submitted to the chief officer who is to put the application with
                          his own recommendation to the Police Authority.              Clearly if you are to make a
                          recommendation then you are entitled to have regard to legal considerations when doing so
                          and this in turn entitles you to take legal advice,

           2.             Reverting to the opening paragraph o f the circular this refers to the discretion of The Police
                          Authority to meet legal expenditure incurred by officers pursuant to the general statutory
                          duty o f the Authority to maintain an adequate and efficient Police Force for its area. The

                         reference to an adequate and efficient Police Force in the Police Act 1964 has been replaced
                         by a reference in Section 6 of the Police Act 1996 to the duty of the Authority to:-

                                     1Secure, the maintenance o f an efficient and effective Police Force fo r its
                                    area"

                         I cannot see any point to be made on the slight difference between the old wording and
                         the new, that is to say the substitution o f “effective” for ''adequate".

            3.           Remaining with the opening paragraph o f the circular it should be noted that the
                         discretion to meet legal expenditure arises where the officers have acted in good faith
                         in pursuance of their duties or (my emphasis) the interests of the force as a whole are
                         involved.

                         This indicates that if you wish to do so you are entitled to argue that even if the
                         Authority finds that there has been any want of good faith on the part of the Applicants
                         it might still be in the interests of the Force as a whole for assistance to be given,

            4.           Paragraph 3 deals with prosecution by the Crown Proseculiun Service which is not
                         relevant here.

            5.           Paragraphs 4 and 5 deal with private prosecutions and it is interesting to note the
                         distinction that is made between the two different forms of prosecution. J.n paragraph
                         4 it is said that;-

                                    “I f in a case where a member o f the public brings a prosecution
                                   against an officer, the Authority is satisfied that ihe officer has acted
                                   in Igood faith and has exercised his judgement reasonably] the
                                   Authority should (my emphasis) provide or fund legal advice and/or
                                   representation

            6.            Clearly this pre-supposes some judgement being made On the part of the Authority as to
                          whether the officers have acted in good faith and exercised their judgement reasonably. In
                          this respect it seems to me that there is only one piece of evidence upon which the Authority
                          could rely in taking the view that David Duckenfield in particular had not acted in good faith.
                          This is the statement which he admits making at about 3;2Q on the day of the disaster to the
                          effect that fans had forced open Gate C.

            7.            My view is that this would represent dangerously thin evidence upon which to form any
                          judgement about bad faith but I have to accept that others might think differently.

            8.            I am not, au vising David Duckenfield but if I were I would consider carefully whether he

                                                                                                          Ian Daines Esq
                                                                                               Assistant Chief Constable
                                                                                                 South Yorkshire Police

                        had not acted in good faith since this would effectively pre-judge exactly what a jury will
                        have to decide.

                        If he chooses not to make any reference to this incident at all there is the possibility of the
                        Police Authority not being satisfied that he was acting in good faith in relation to the charge
                        o f attempting to pervert the course o f justice,

           9.          Paragraph 5 of the guidance appears to contemplate the question of costs being dealt with
                        after the event but it seems to me that this, along with all the other individual instances must
                       be read subject to the general provisions in paragraph 14 which provide for financial
                       assistance to be made available in advance if this is thought appropriate.

           10.         This is nothing in the circular which requires the Authority to insist that the officer should
                       explore alternative funding, including Legal Aid, before making his Application Indeed the
                       contrary is the case. The central principle is that, subject to conditions previously mentioned,
                       the officer should have the services of a lawyer and he should not be out of pocket. The only
                       direct reference to the possibility o f alternative funding is 10 be found ini paragraph 16 which
                       relates to the possibility of funding being provided by the Police Federation where it clearly
                       states that assistance should be sought from the Police Authority first and only if that is not
                       available should an application go to the Police Federation. Although that provision is
                       irrelevant here it is surely a pointer to the way in which the Home Office expect the Authority
                       to approach their task.

           11.         I do not see any basis upon which a properly advised Authority could insist that the Legal
                       Aid avenue be explored first. This is particularly so when the Police Authority are aware that
                       the officers concerned are in receipt of police pension and it must be regarded as likely that
                       they would be ordered to contribute to Legal Aid and thereby be “out of pocket” .

           12.        It could be argued that the Police Authority could offer to meet the cost of any contribution
                       ordered but I do not think this affects the basic point that the circular makes no reference to
                       the possibility of exploring alternative means of payment, save in relation to paragraph 16
                       where it expressly excludes the Federation alternative until a decision has been taken on the
                       merits of the Application to the Police Authority.

           13.        It is my conclusion that if the Police Auxhority were even to consider the availability of Legal
                       Aid they would be taking into account an irrelevant consideration and would make
                       themselves liable to judicial review,

           14.        You raised the question of whether the Police Authority could offer to pay any excess charge
                      over and above what was available on Legal Aid, eg. the difference between charges raised
                      by firms such as Winkworth Sherwood (and Hammond Suddards) as against the payment
                      that would be available on Legal Aid. I can confirm that whilst the Police Authority could
                      make that offer it would in fact be unlawful for the firms concerned to accept any additional
                      payment and it might well be in the circumstances that the officers would be deprived of

           I am very conscious that in providing the opinion above I am differing with the recorded account of
           advice obtained from Leading Counsel, no doubt sclccted by the Police Authority lawyers as
           competent in his or her field. As we both know there are some I .eading Counsel whose opinions are
           not worthy o f great respect but even so I am concerned about reaching such a diametrically opposite
           conclusion and until I have actually seen the opinion or a record of the advice given you will have to
           keep in mind the possibility that there is something I have overlooked.

           Bearing in mind the points made at numbered paras. 1, and 3. above there is no bar (save budgetary
           constraints) to your seeking your own QC’s opinion and if you wish to discuss this option fu r th e r

Meeting of the Police Authority Re Hillsborough Stadium Disaster 1989

I refer to the fax (14.46 hours, 26 January 1999) from your solicitor (Garretts) to my solicitor
(Peter Metcalf). The fax caused Peter Metcalf to make urgent contact with Assistant Chief
Constable Ian Daines and Ian spoke to you urgently yesterday afternoon. Ian has briefed
me and I write to express my concerns.

Ian tells me you think the members may not be in a position to decide on the funding issues
at the meeting on 5 February because the legal position may not be clear. This issue was
first scheduled for discussion on 15 January. It was deferred and it was hoped that we
would discuss the issue on 29 January but it has now been put back to 5 February. I would
be loath to see the decision deferred again. Six months ago you wrote to Mr Duckenfield
and Mr Murray telling them that their legal expenses would be paid by the Authority. Some
weeks ago they applied for funding for a judicial review to challenge the DPP’s decision, of
18 December 1998, not to intervene in the prosecutions. They must commence the judicial
review proceedings within three months, their deadline is 18 March 1999. The committal
proceedings at the Magistrates Court are scheduled for mid April. You have suspended the
payment of Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray’s solicitors bills for work already undertaken and
you have advised that any further legal work may be at their own risk. I understand the
reasons for these actions but Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray cannot properly prepare for
the judicial review or the committal proceedings until the position is resolved by the
Authority. I do hope that everything will be in place to allow the members to reach
decisions on 5 February.

Garretts’ letter to Peter Metcalf refers to Messrs Hicks, Duckenfield, Murray and I being
required to leave the Authority meeting when it goes into private session. This caused
Peter and Ian great concern and I understand that you assured Ian that Garretts were
mistaken on that point. On 8 January the members of the Authority discussed Mr Hicks’
application to make representations to them. They passed resolutions on how the
procedure should be conducted. They wished Messrs Hicks, Murray and Duckenfield (or
their representatives) to have the opportunity to address them. There was no mention of
me addressing the members in the public part of the meeting. I am preparing a report for
confidential circulation to the members. I will speak to that report in private session and will
forward it to you to be circulated to the members before the meeting. I think it would be
wrong for me to say some things in the public part of the meeting and to make further
points in the private part. I prefer to make all my observations to the members in the
      te session and to follow the procedure agreed by the members.

In summary, I hope the members will be in a position on 5 February to end the uncertainty
into which Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray have been placed and that the previously agreed
procedure will be used.

In closing, I find it very disappointing and wasteful of resources that I receive instructions
and advice as to how I should deal with the Police Authority coming via two sets of
solicitors (yours and mine) rather than the normal way in which you and I communicate
(face to face, telephone, letter or fax).     I do hope that whenever possible we can
communicate direct.

 given in respect of a private prosecution currently faced by former Chief
 Superintendent Duckenfield and former Superintendent Murray as a result of their
 involvement in the tragic events at Hillsborough-

               This decision is clearly contrary to current practice and understanding
 and is a matter of national concern. You have said that you are looking for this to be
 judicially reviewed. Can I ask you to pursue the review with all diligence and obtain
 as early a hearing as possible.

                                                                             Yours sincerely,

             Thank you for your faxes of 10 and i i February.

             It is not my understanding that any party is entitled to make representations against the grant of
             leave, as opposed to the grant of substantive relief, but if you and your Counsel have a different view
             then you will wish to know that the application is proceeding in the Crown Office under reference
             CO 582/99.

             If leave were to be granted then I would expect to be instructed to serve you with copies o f the
             papers but it would then be for you Lu decide whether to apply to intervene.

             Therefore the answers to the numbered points in your second tax are;

Dear Peter

Re Fax of 10 February 1999 from Hillsborough Family Support Group Regarding
Judicial Review

When we met at your office on the afternoon of 10 February 1999 you passed me a copy
of a fax from Ms A ADLINGTON, solicitor to the Hillsborough Family Support Group (HFSG)
timed at 13.11 hours, 10 February 1999.

When other commitments permit, please write to Ms Adlington in the following terms;

a)    Her letter is inaccurate and misleading.

b)    W e do not propose to use valuable resources in a lengthy recitation of the truth of
      the matter about which she writes.

c)    Please advise Ms Adlington that the Chief Constable has applied to the High Court
      for a judicial review of the Police Authority’s decisions and give her my reference
       numbers of court dates that may be to hand.

Unless you advise me that we are required so to do, I do not think we should be putting Ms
Adlington’s views before the court. I think it is up to her to do that.

Yours sincerely

    Dear Mr Metcalf


    Proposed motion: R v. South Yorkshire Police Authority, ex party Chief ('onstghje of South
    Yorkshire Police

    1       It has been announced that the Chief Constable will seek judicial review of the refusal
            by the Authority to accede to applications made by the defendants Duckenfield and
            Murray. They had applied for funds for (a) their own proposed application for judicial
            review of the decision of the Crown Prosecution Service, made after six months’
            consideration, to decline to take over and discontinue the prosecution, and (b) their
            defence to the criminal charges o f manslaughter, misfeasance, and. in Duckenfieid’s
            case, attempting to pervert the course of justice.

    2       As the prosecutor. 1 have an interest in th$ proposed application for judicial review.
            The HFSG also has the support of some South Yorkshire rate-payers. I make the
            following observations.

            The interest o f the Chief Comtahle in the decision

    3       ( do not understand why the Chief Constable should be the applicant. Are you
             satisfied that he has the power to make such an application? He does not appear to
             have sufficient interest in the matter. The defendants are the unsuccessful applicants
             for public funds from the South Yorkshire Police Authority, and, if, they cannot afford
             to pay, they can apply for legal aid if they wish to seek judicial review.

     4      The Chief Constable may find himself in the position that, if leave to move is granted.

                                                     l
10/02 *’ 99 13:12                                                                                             Pg. 03



                    the defendants may have applied successfully for legal aid for the criminal proceedings,
                    and may therefore have no further interest in supporting the application. Even if they
                    wish to support your application, they may be unable to obtain legal aid for that
                    purpose.

                    I'he factual and legal basis o f the funding decisions

                    More fundamentally, we are concerned that this application is being presented by the
                    South Yorkshire police as a general matter of principle, of concern to police forces
                    throughout the country, without reference to the facts of the case. Unfortunately, the
                    Police Authority decided, with, we believe, the encouragement o f the Chief Constable,
                    that it would separate the legal argument from the argument as to the facts.

                    I argue that the matter should only go before the Divisional Court if the Police
                    Authority has decided that it would grant the application on its merits if it had the
                    power to do so. It is not the practice of the Divisional Court to answer theoretical
                    questions, In any judicial review application, the court has a discretion whether to
                    grant relief, and the court will have to look, necessarily, at the tacts o f law week's
                    decision

                    This hisiory is obviously relevant to the legality of the decision. Acting on your legal
                    advice, the Chief Constable asked the Authority in February o f last year to allow
                    funding for the defence of any officer who might be prosecuted arising out of the
                    “Scrutiny”. Presumably, you advised that any defendant would be entitled in law to
                    funding, whatever offence was alleged, without consideration being given to the
                    particular circumstances of the case, provided that the Authority considered that the
                    officers had acted "in good faith". No doubt you advised them, as the minutes for the
                    27mFebruary 1998 record, that this finding of “good faith” survived the trenchant
                    support given by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to the Taylor Report, and his observations
                    about Duckenfield's “disgraceful lie'’.

                     I note also that on 21* December 1998, Miss Varty told the magistrate at a remand
                     hearing in the criminal case at Leeds that her client the Chief Constable did not know
                     what the issues in the case were. I assume that you had so instructed her, In these
                     circumstances it is unclear how you can have been advising the Chief Constable that
                     funding was lawful and rational.

                     Accordingly, I invite the Chief Constable to support us in asking the Authority to
                     consider the merits of the matter, so that the High Court will not simply be asked to
                     decide a theoretical point. The Authority has the facts. We gave them a detailed file,
                     and they can conveniently decide the matter at their next meeting. The approach we
                     suggest is easy, less expensive, and will avoid the prospect of two applications for
                     judicial review of the same decision at great public expense,

            10        You have seen the representations we made on the facts of this matter to the South
                      Yorkshire Police Authority. Our case in summary contains the following, among
                      other, arguments and facts;

                                                              2
10/02 *’99 13:13                                                                                         Pg. 04




                   a)     The case against the defendants is strong:
                   b)     The Police Complaints Authority wished to try both these defendants for
                          neglect of duty, but was thwarted because Duckenfield retired on health
                          grounds, after which the case against Murray was also dropped:
                   c)     The South Yorkshire Police has never contested that the conduct alleged
                          against the defendants was negligent, and that it caused the deaths of 96 people
                   d)     Both the South Yorkshire police and you as their lawyer have a strong interest
                          of your own to protect                  :
                   e)     The South Yorkshire Police have publicly accepted the findings of the Taylor
                          and Stuart-Smith enquiries, which both included the finding that Duckenfield
                           lied about the circumstances in which the gates were opened:
                   f)     The senior officers of the South Yorkshire police procured the excision from
                           over a hundred statements of South Yorkshire police officers o f factual
                           criticisms and assertions of crucial matters relevant to the question of gross
                           negligence;
                   g)      You yourself played a leading part in that editing proccss;
                   h)      The South Yorkshire police statements sent to the DPP when a decision was
                           being taken as to whether to prosecute in 1990 were the edited ones;
                   i)      The West Midlands police have never been independent throughout the
                           enquiries in the case, because many important decisions as to disclosure of
                           material were taken only if South Yorkshire police, acting on your advice and
                           in their own interests, decided whether documents should be disclosed.

          11       The argument that it would be inappropriate to pay for the legal costs o f the
                   defendants in the criminal proceedings is a formidable one, and has not been answered
                   by the Chief Constable, The same argument was presented by the prosecution to the
                   CPS in the course of their long and careful review, and it was not answered by the
                   defendants then, either.

          12       The additional request that the South Yorkshire taxpayer should fond an argument that
                   the decision of the Crown Prosecution Service was irrational is manifestly absurd.
                   Leading counsel for Murray, and junior counsel for Duckenfield, informed the Leeds
                   Magistrates Court on Monday 21* December that, even though they were expecting a
                   letter from the CPS which would indicate the criteria by reference to which the
                   decision had been taken, a concluded decision had already been taken by the
                   defendants to apply for judicial review. Such a decision must have been taken on the
                   basis that, whatever the reasons, the decision of the CPS must necessarily have been
                   perverse.

           13       If the Chief Constable decides, contrary to our request, not to ask the Police
                    Authority for a determination of the application for funding on its merits, please ensure
                    that a copy of this letter, and of our full representations to the Authority, accompany
                    any application for judicial review in the fulfilment of your duty o f full disclosure. We
                    invite you further to answer our arguments in the course of your application. We give
                    you formal notice that the HFSG would wish to be heard on.any application for leave,
                    and, if leave is granted, on a full hearing of the motion.


                                                             3
14    We have completed our study of the papers disclosed to us voluntarily by the CPS, and
      will be writing to you shortly about the disclosure of some o f the papers and items held
      by the Chief Constable.

15    We shall send a copy of this letter to the South Yorkshire Police Authority and the
      defendants.

16    I am, of course, drawing all of these matters to the attention of the District Auditor.


Yours sincerely

    Dear Peter

    Letter of Support from Police Federation Re Judicial Review Application

    I attach a letter from Constable Paul MIDDUP, South Yorkshire Police Federation
    Secretar . It arrived just too late for inclusion in the bundle that was being prepared for the
    judicial review.

    Constable Middup explains that the National Chairman is unwell and therefore unable to
    write, i suggest that Constable Middup’s letter be forwarded to the High Court as a
    supplementary item of information. When the National Chairman recovers he may well
    write and we can then consider forwarding his letter also.

   Dear Mr. Hedges,

   Financial Support for Former Police Officers bv the South Yorkshire Police Authority

   I am aware that on 5 February 1999, the South Yorkshire Police Authority - acting on
   legal advice - decided that they could no longer financially support former Chief
   Superintendent David Duckenfield and Superintendent Bernard Murray in respect of
   criminal charges brought against them connected with the Hillsborough tragedy.

   I have been the Joint Branch Board Secretary here in South Yorkshire for 23 years and
   I was a member of the National Executive of the Police Federation of England and
   Wales for 17 years. It has always been my understanding that the Police Authority did
   indeed have full authority to support police officers in circumstances such as this and
   my understanding of Home Office Circular 4/1998 is that it was supposed to
   strengthen that authority. Indeed, it is perfectly obvious that that was the opinion of
   the Police Authority for all these years since the tragedy happened because they have
   supported officers during that time.

   I have discussed the decision of the Police Authority with the National Chairman of the
   Police Federation of England and Wales, Mr. Fred Broughton, and he agrees that the
   potential morale problems within the Police Service if this decision is upheld are very
   serious indeed. Fred would have been writing to you himself today expressing the
   views that I am portraying in this letter but he has been taken ill and is unable to do so.
It is so very important that police officers going about their normal daily duties - never
knowing what is going to happen next - can at least feel that they will be financially
supported by their Police Authority if, after doing their best in what nowadays is
always difficult circumstances, something goes wrong.

Whatever the strict legal interpretation of the law may be I am quite certain that
Parliament and the Home Office meant in the drafting and passing of the law that
Police Authorities should be able to support officers in such circumstances.

On behalf of all the 3000 + officers here in South Yorkshire who I directly represent
and the other 125,000 in England and Wales who I indirectly represent, I ask you
please, to take urgent and immediate steps through the courts to have this decision by
South Yorkshire Police Authority reversed.

With best wishes.

HILLSBOROUGH - JUDICIAL REVIEW
PROVISION OF LEGAL ADVICE/REPRESENTATION TO THE CHIEF CONSTABLE

I write with reference to my recent discussions with Nigel Hiller concerning the provisions
of Standing Order No 34 - Tendering Procedure, and wish to thank you for preparing a
report detailing why the invitation of tenders is neither practical or appropriate in the
particular circumstances. Bill shares your view on this m atter and has discussed the
circumstances with the Chairm an who is of like mind and is agreeable to the appointment
of Hamm onds. In the circumstances I consider a specific report seeking approval to the
appointm ent is unnecessary. I have enclosed a copy of the letter sent to the Chairm an on
the m atter for your file. The estim ated cost of the services is not such as to require a
contract award notice to be published in the Official Journal of the European
Communities. Such a notice would be required if the value of the contract exceeded



Bill intends to submit a report to the Authority setting out details of Hillsborough related
legal costs to date. For the purposes of that report I shall be grateful if you will provide me
with details of Ham m ond Suddards fees including disbursements.

Yours sincerely

Last Friday’s resolution set in motion the process for review of the legal powers of the
Authority on funding legal costs.

The Chief Constable is continuing to use Peter M etcalf of Hamm ond Suddards, who has
been advising on Hillsborough for 10 years. In these circumstances, both the Chief
Constable and myself agree that it would be entirely inappropriate to invite tenders for the
provision of legal advice on this m atter from anyone other than Hammond Suddards.

Standing Orders do not require tenders in this situation (S .0 .3 4 (9 ) is the relevant clause)
w here the Chief Constable, myself and you are of the sam e opinion. In the circumstances
I assum e you would have no objections, but need to check with you first.

Yours sincerely

             Thank you for your two letters of 11 February with enclosure. The HFSG paper factory has been in
             action again and I enclose copies o f their faxes of Friday 12 February and today and my letter to
             them of Friday. I apologise for anticipating your instructions in relation Lo the supply of court
             numbers etc. but 1 did not want the court to have grounds for believing the inevitable allegation
             (now duly made at para 15 of their submissions) that we were trying to prevent HFSG having their
             say.

             In fact I am pleased that they have now put these submissions before the court although very
             surprised that Alun Jones has put his name to them as, to me, they make no sense al all. Even trying
             to be objective I do find it difficult to see how any Judge could find anything in them to militate
             against granting leave.

           Dear Mr Metcalf

           Ji r Smith Yorkshire Police Authority, ex parte Chief Cunstahk o f the South Yorkshire Police.

           1 enclose fbr your information a copy of submissions sent today to the Crown Office. The
           letters exhibited to Mr Daines’ affidavit refer to a practice, said by Garretts to have been
           adopted for some sixty years, by which "‘financial assistance “ has been granted to officers
           "facing prosecution11.

           I would invite you to make good this assertion by evidence. As I understand it, police officers
           who are accused of criminal offenccs are routinely represented at the expense of either the
           legal aid fund or the Police Federation. Do you know of any Police Authorities which provide
           funds either for the prosecution or the defence at a criminal trial, and for any ancillary
           applications for judicial review'? 1 should be grateful if you could provide details, which are
           obviously much more easily available to you than us.

           I appreciate that the Police Federation does not provide assistance for officers of the rank of
           Superintendent or above. It may be, however, that the Police Superintendents Association has
           rules or practices relevant to this question, Have enquiries been made as to whether the
           Association would provide funds to the defendants? No doubt you can make some simple
           enquiries so that we can prepare submissions if leave is granted and so that the Divisional
           Court can have proper information.

           Can you also please confirm that neither Mr Newing nor the Superintendents Association wag
           provided with copies of our material and argument on the facts,

           Yours sincerely

           Inirndnciion

           1        Application for leave to appeal was lodged on Thursday 11th February 1999 at the
                    Crown Office by the Chief Constable of the Somh Yorkshire Police ('‘the Applicant")
                    in respect of a decision of the South Yorkshire Police Authority (“the Authority ") to
                    refuse applications made by David Duckenfield and Bernard Murray (“the defendants ')
                    for money to conduct legal proceedings.

           2        Criminal proceedings were instituted by Ann Adlington, solicitor to the Hillsborough
                    Family Support Group, on I0,h luly 199S in the Leeds District Magistrates Court,
                    when summonses were issued directed to the defendants in respect of allegations of
                    manslaughter, misfeasance, and (in Duckenfield's case) attempting to pervert the
                    course uf justice, allegedly committed in the Hillsborough stadium disaster in April
                    1989

                    It appears that the Applicant has requested that the question of leave be determined on
                    rhe papers and that Ihe Authority supports his application. Although the grounds for
                    granting leave appear therefore to be strong, the prosecution, as an interested party,
                    invites the single judge to take the following matters into account. The prosecution
                    contends that the Divisional Court is being confronted by an essentially theoretical or
                    academic question, the resolution o f which should be deferred until other factors have
                    been considered by the Authority. On that basis leave should be refused.

           4        The prosecution does not wish in any way to seek deny the defendants access to legal
                    representation in respect of the prosecution. It b, however, conccrncd that the
                    defendants appear to have had, and to have expected, virtually unlimited access to
                    public funds, irrespective of any of the constraints that would apply in the case of other
                    defendants, in respect of matters arising from the prosecution.


                    After the summonses vmer issued, ihc defendants asked the Crown Prosecution

  ii'ii vicM to take over the conduct of the proVscution under section 6 (2) of the
  Prosecution of Offences Act 1984,          discontinue it under section 23 (3) of that Act,

  The review was conducted at a his$h level in CPS Headquarters in York and London,
  and the prosecution and the de^ndants made detailed written submissions in relation
  to the strength of the evident;.'., the public interest, and the interests of justice.

  On 7th December 199g at the Leeds District Magistrate - C               before the decision of
  the CPS was announced, committal proceeding'.:- - ere fixed tor 19lh April T h c _ _ ^ —
  prosecution asked that the committal be bf-'^a February, but the^UncairfnTL^the
  court through solicitors that each "'I.- *u be rep^s^nted                  by leading counsel
  (and, it is believed, junior^cniii5«slj; that the jvoc&cumgs would take at least four
  weeks; and        neither leading counsel was available b e f o r e 19“' Apr-'- ji’ince there
  wac * police investigation in 1989-90, the case falls to be commit^.- "dcr the pre-
   1996 procedures,)

  On 18,1‘ December 1998, the C P ^ujounced, after a review of more than six months,
  that it would not         che prosecution.

  On 2IMDecember 1998, at a remand hearing, leading counsel for Murray, and junior
  counsel   for Duckenfield, told the court that an application for judicial review of the
  CPS decision would defipjt. t; ^ made, and thst it was intended to lodge it in the first
  two weeks o f Janut -. Leading counsel for Mr Murray told the court that he was not
  applying +b.     date of I9,h April to be adjourned. Counsel for Duckenfield said
  T'.-hi.vg about the date. However, the court was also told that the CPS would provide
  a decision letter, probably before Christinas, explaining its approach lo its decision.

  The prosecution, which is not publicly-funded, was concerned that no lawyer subject
  to the limitations of the legal aid scheme could possibly advise that an application for
  iudicial revifc. >should be made before he had seen the decision letter. It had been
  decidcr- ospai -fitly, that ar> application would bs made on the basis that, whatever
  criteria hac        applied, or v hatever reasons might be given, the decision was
  demonstrably per;-rse. Accordingly, the prosecution thereafter objected to the
  funding by the A u t h o r       Jie ,osts of the defence, citing the history of the funding as
  it understood it, «,>d '»e:y extensive factual reasons why it should not be granted, even
  if there was powei       ,'o so.

  The approach of the pros ecution to this issue has been to argue that there is no
  statutory power to grant Lit.-, func.^g, but the primary and detailed objection has been
  that the decisions to grant it is; 199\ aad been taken on unlawful, irrational and
  procedurally improper bases.

  In summary, the prosecutor has made the tcJowing allegations, in writing to the CPS
  and the Authority, and has supported its case c / documents (many of which were
  made available tor the first lime in 1998 through \he good offices of the Home
  Secretary);

                           The case against the defendants is strong;

                           The Police Complaints Authority wished to try both tht.se defendants for
                           neglect of duty, but was thwarted because Duckenfield retired on health
                           grounds, after which the case against Murray was alsi; dropped;

                           The South Yorkshire Police has never contested that t;.<: conduct alleged
                           against the defendants was negligent, and that it caused the deaths of 96
                           people;

                           The South Yorkshire Police have publicly accepted the findings of the Taylor
                           and Stuart-Smith enquiries, which both included the finding that Duckenfield
                           lied about the circumstances in which the gates were opened;

                           The senior Officers of the South Yorkshire police procured the excision from
                           over a hundred statements of South Yorkshire police officers of factual
                           criticisms and assertions of crucial matters relevant to the question of gross
                           negligence;

                           Hammond Suddards, solicitors to the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire
                           Police, played a leading part in that editing process;

                           The only South Yorkshire police statements sent to the DPP when a decision
                           was being taken as to whether to prosecute in 1990 were the edited ones;

                           The West Midlands police have never been independent throughout the
                           enquiries in the case, because many important decisions as to disclosure of
                           material to the CPS, Coroner, Police Complaints Authority and Lord Taylor,
                           were taken by them only i f South Yorkshire police, acting in their own interests
                           with the support o f Hammond Suddards, decided whether documents should
                           be disclosed.

                   -       The alleged independence of the West Midlands police has been a sham. The
                           West Midlands police has worked throughout with the South Yorkshire police
                           to disguise critical facts relating to the disaster in order to protect the interests
                           of that force.

           13      On Is1 February 1999, the prosecutor received a letter from Garretts, solicitors to the
                   Authority, indicating that the Authority proposed that its meeting of 5lh Fehruary
                   would consider only the legal issue whether there was power to grant funding at all.
                   Interested parties, including a member of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, the
                   Applicant and the defendants, had been invited to address the meeting briefly and had
                   submitted arguments in writing beforehand. The letter indicated that the question
                   whether in Fact funding ought to be made available would be considered at a l?ter
                   meeting, but only if the Authority had decided it had the power to grant it.

           14        n is believed that the Chief Constable* and Hammond Suddards, advocated this
                     approach. The chief Constable appears to have submitted a tactual reply to the
                     allegations the prosecution had made, but neither that reply, nor the defendants’ replies
                     on this aspect, have been disclosed to the prosecution. The prosecution was not asked
                     whether it consented to the subject-matter of the letter of 1*' February,

           15        After it was held on 5,h February that the Authority had no powers to pay the
                     defendants" costs, the prosecutor argued to the Chief Constable and Authority that the
                     question whether funding should be granted on the ments should be determined before
                     any application for judicial review was made. Otherwise the issue was a theoretical
                     one, A letter to this effect was sent to both solicitors by fax the day before the
                     application was made. Confirmation was later asked, and received, that Hammond
                     Suddards had received this letter on that day. Hammond Suddards were also asked to
                     ensure that the single judge was made aware of the prosecution’s submissions on the
                     merits, but to no avail

           The importance o f the facts

           16        The application for judicial review seeks artificially to divorce the legal issue from its
                     underlying facts. By seeking to concentrate on a point of principle, the Applicant
                     wishes the Divisional Court to hear only some of the facts, and to draw inferences
                     from such assertions as '"the way that David Duckenfield and Bernard Murray have
                     been treated” (affidavit of [an Daines), which a study of the tacts would not support,

           17        This matter should have been resolved before the Authority first. Should leave to move
                     be granted, the prosecution will seek on the hearing of the motion to make brief
                     submissions on the law, and to present substantial submissions to the effect that,
                     whether or not there is power to make funds available, no reasonable Police Authority
                     could in fact decide in favour of the Applicants in the circumstances of this case,

           18        If leave is granted, the prosecution can file affidavit evidence in seven days, and would
                     suggest that any evidence in reply be filed within seven days of receipt.

             Dear Mr. Hedges,

             Financial Support, for Former Police Officers b ^ the S o u t h Y o i k ^

             I am aware that on 5 February 1999, the South Yorkshire Police Authority - acting on
             legal advice - decided that they' could no longer financially support former Chief
             Superintendent David Duckenfieid and Superintendent Bernard Murray in respect of
             criminal charges brought against them connected with the Hillsborough tragedy.

             I have been the Joint Branch Board Secretary here in South Yorkshire for 23 years and
              I was a member o f the National Executive o f the Police Federation of England and
              W ales for 17 years, It has always been my understanding that the Police Authority did
              indeed have M a u th o rity to su p p o rt police officers in circum stances such as this and
              my understanding o f Home Office Circular 4/199S is that it was supposed to
              strengthen that authority Indeed, it is perfectly obvious that that was the opinion of
              the Police Authority for all these years since the tragedy happened because they have
               supported officers during that time

              I have discussed the decision o f the Police Authority with the National Chairman of the
              Police Federation of England and Wales, Mr. Fred Broughton, and he agrees that the
              potential morale problems within the Police Service if this decision is upheld are very
              serious indeed. Fred would have been writing to you himself today expressing the
              views that I am portraying in this letter but he has been taken ill and is unable to do so.

             It is so very important that police officers going about their normal daily duties - never
             knowing what is going to happen next - can at least feel that they will be financially
             supported by their Police Authority if, after doing then besLin what nowadays is
             always difficult circumstances, something goes wrong.

             Whatever the strict legal interpretation of the law may be I am quite certain that
             Parliament and the Home Office meant in the drafting and passing of the law that
             Police Authorities should be able to support officers in such circumstances.

             On behalf of all the 3000 + officers here in South Yorkshire who I directly represent
             and the other 125,000 in England and Wales who I indirectly represent, I ask you
             please, to take urgent and immediate steps through the courts to have this decision by

    FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO POLICE OFFICERS IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

   Thank you for your letter dated 9 February about the provision of financial assistance
   towards the cost of legal representation of former Chief Superintendent David
   Duckenfield and Superintendent Bernard Murray in defending the private prosecution
   proceedings on behalf of the Hillsborough Family Support Group. As you know I did
   have an opportunity to discuss the advice the authority received from counsel with one
   of your colleagues last week.

    I am now writing to confirm that the Association of Police Authorities does indeed
    recognise that it is extremely important that the powers of a police authority to provide
    financial support in situations like this should be clarified as soon as possible. Clearly it
    would be invidious of me to comment on the various legal arguments that have been
    put forward: what is important is that police authorities and police officers should know
    where they stand in respect of their legal powers and we therefore support South
    Yorkshire in your bid to get the issues brought before the court as a matter of urgency.

    I have copied this letter to the Chief Constable.

Dear Catherine

FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO POLICE OFFICERS IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

You will no doubt be aw are that last year decisions w ere taken on behalf of the Authority
to provide financial assistance towards the costs of the legal representation of former
Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield and Superintendent Bernard Murray in defending
the private prosecution proceedings instituted against them by Ann Adlington, Solicitor, on
behalf of the Hillsborough Family Support Group (H FS G ).

Those decisions have been challenged by the H F S G as being unlawful on a number of
grounds including the lack of powers. In the light of those challenges the Authority
instructed independent solicitors to advise them on the challenges m ade by the HFSG .

Garretts, (the Solicitors appointed by the Authority) last Friday advised the Authority that
on balance having taken the advice of leading counsel they did not consider a police
authority had any legal power to provide financial assistance to police officers in legal
proceedings arising from the execution of their duty other than in the circumstances set
out in Section 88 of the Police Act 1996 ie tort proceedings. Garretts rely on a number of
grounds in reaching this conclusion but principally they argue that if Parliam ent had
intended there to be such a power it would have said so expressly.

Louise Varty, Counsel instructed by Solicitors acting for the C hief Constable takes a
different view on this matter. She considers that a police authority in discharging its broad
statutory duty to maintain an effective and efficient police force, does have the power to
provide financial assistance to police officers involved in legal proceedings arising from the
execution of their duty in appropriate circumstances, provided it is satisfied that the officer
concerned acted in good faith. Counsel argues that Section 8 8 of the Act (and its
predecessor Section 4 8 of the Police Act 1964) set out to address the specific issue of the
vicarious liability of a chief constable for the torts of the officers under his/her direction and
control. Incidentally, under Section 88(4) of the Act, provision is m ade enabling a police
authority to pay any dam ages or costs awarded against a m em ber of a police force in
proceedings for a tort committed by the officer, any costs incurred and not recovered by
the officer in such proceedings, and any sum required in connection with the settlem ent of
a claim that has or might have given rise to such proceedings.

W hilst taking cognisance of the arguments m ade by Counsel instructed on behalf of the
Chief Constable, and of those put by the legal representatives of David Duckenfield and
Bernard Murray who also consider that police authorities have a discretion to provide
financial assistance to police officers facing legal proceedings, the Authority acting on the
advice of its legal advisors has reached the view that it does not have a legal power to
provide financial assistance to police officers in legal proceedings other than as provided
for under Section 88 of the Act. The Chief Constable intends to challenge this conclusion.

The Chief Constable considers it is vital to the morale and good m anagem ent of the South
Yorkshire Police Force that officers should know that if they act in good faith when
performing their duties, that the Chief Constable and the Police Authority will do w hatever
it can to support them. Accordingly, he is of the view that a legal ruling on the powers of
the Police Authority to provide financial support should be obtained as soon as possible.
A ruling on this issue is quite evidently of more than local interest. If the power does not
exist than I have no doubt that nationally forces will wish to lobby for the enactm ent of
relevant statutory powers to enable police authorities to provide such assistance.

The Police Authority intends to co-operate with the Chief Constable in seeking clarification
of the issue on powers.

It will greatly assist In bringing this m atter before the Court as soon as possible if the
national representative bodies for both police authorities and police forces endorse the
views of South Yorkshire that this issue is of national and not just local significance, that
the absence of such a power will be detrimental to efficient and effective policing, and that
the m atter needs to be brought before the Court as a m atter of urgency. I hope very much
that the A P A will support the legal proceedings in this respect and as application for leave
is to be filed within days rather than w eeks a response by the end of this w eek would be
appreciated.

Yours sincerely,

 Dear Stuart

 Police Authority Decisions of 5 February 1999 Regarding Hillsborough

 I refer to our telephone conversation of this morning. I refer also to the letter dated 11
 February 1999 from Miss Maureen Oades concerning an “exempt minute”. I refer finally to
 the letter dated 9 February 1999 from Mr Bill Wilkinson to Mrs Catherine Crawford,
 Association of Police Authorities.

 After the Authority’s meeting on 5 February 1 9 9 9 ,1had to move quickly to begin the judicial
 review process. If I am to convince a High Court judge that the case is urgent, I must take
 urgent action myself. First thing on the morning of Thursday 11 February 1999 a complete
 bundle of papers was handed in at the High Court in London. That bundle includes the
 Authority’s resolutions of 5 February 1999. If I am to ask for judicial review of those
 resolutions I must quote them in full. Yesterday afternoon, 17 February 1999, I was told
 that I have leave to begin the judicial review and it will be dealt with urgently.

 I then read Maureen’s letter. Please advise Maureen that my bundle of papers handed in
 to the Court will be copied to all interested parties, including HFSG. That is a requirement
 of the court. Thus, to minute the Authority’s decision in edited form would serve no
 purpose.

 I then read Bill’s letter to Mrs Crawford. Please advise Bill and Mrs Crawford that the case
 is already scheduled for hearing.

 Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Daines

Judicial review of Police Authority decision regarding financial assistance to officers

I acknowledge receipt of your letter of 11 February and am grateful for the advice contained
therein.

I am now aware that the judicial review application has been lodged, and have received the

application.

Yours sincerely

         The decisions of           the                  j
                                              strict Auditor       were given in         his
  report dated 26th June 1967.                  He held that no police officer

 whose actions         had been investigated,                had been   shown to        havl

 been guilty of         wilful C o n d u c t        although the expenditure              on

 the refurbishment had been sho„n to have                      been unauthorised and
 was    therefore       i U egal.             The    amount      „ as   ^
  Inspector Wilson         and        Sergeant             Dalton      had   been    represented

  throughout the      15 days of                   the District        A u d i t o r ’s inquiry      by

  counsel upon the instructions of a solicitor.                                   The total cost

  of their representation was in                          the region of £17,000.               other

  parties interested         had also                been       represented,      including       the

 County Council.            The        services of              solicitor and counsel             had

 been made available for Inspector Wilson and Sergeant Dalton by

 the Police Federation without any stipulation                                 that they should

 be personally liable to repay the Federation.                                 When the result

 of the inquiry      was known the                    Police Federation, on             behalf of

 the applicants,     applied to                    the Police Authority for             the costs

 to be paid,      or for a        payment of a                  contribution towards them.

 It is common ground that the Authority had                              legal power to make

 payment out of police funds.                        The Authority decided to make no
 payment.


        That decision is          attacked on                three main        grounds.         The

first ground       was called             by Mr.          Underhill      the "rubber         stamp

submission".          it    was           said        that the        Police    Authority,           a

committee of which the full membership was 24, did not make the

decision but wrongly left the making of the decision to a panel

of 5 members appointed by                     the Authority to do no more ' than to

hear submissions and         to report.                      The second ground,           called

"the inadequate report submission",                          was that if        the Authority

made the decision         themselves,               they did         so upon an     incomplete

report from the panel.                m       particular,         the panel, appointed to

receive the representations of the officers                             seeking payment of

their    costs,    failed         to          tell        the     Authority      what        their

submissions       were.                             The     third        submission           was

"unreasonableness” .              Having regard                 to    the outcome       of    the

        o f   the 1964 Act,    cited above,         defines     the duty of the        Police

        Authority       and the     purposes for which         the Authority may spend

        the money        provided,       namely to secure       the     maintenance of        an

        adequate and efficient           police force.          The circular       provides

        guidance to police         authorities with reference              to one form      of

        expenditure.         The   first two paragraphs            must be      set out     in
        full:

               p Ii •             statutory authority in section 48 of the
               Police Act 1964 for payments to be made from the police fund
               to meet expenditure incurred     by police officers in defending
              OAno^e,in?S,       tort-     Also, acting in pursuance of its
              noi      / tatutory duty to maintain an adequate and efficient
              police force for its area, the police authority has discretion
                o meet expenditure incurred by officers in all kinds of legal
              proceedings where the officers have acted in good faith in
              pursuance of their duties, or the interests of the force as a
                  ole are involved.    The purpose of this circular is to give
              guidance to police authorities to help them in considering
                 quests on behalf of officers for financial assistance,
                   s guidance has been discussed and agreed with local
              authority and with the police staff associations.

              2 : . JThe central Principle which should guide consideration
              o    individual cases is that, where a        police authority
              considers that an officer has acted in good faith in pursuance
              of his duties or that the interests of a force as a whole are
              involved, the officer should have the support of the police
                 ^°ulty t0 ensure that he has the services of a lawyer and
              that he should not be out of pocket.             The following
              paragraphs provide general guidance to the different classes
              o   proceedings    Payments made to officers in accordance with
              this guidance will be elegible for police grant".

      It was,      as I understood it, common ground in                          this case, and in

      my view it is correct,              that the court can properly approach the

      Home Office Circular No. 77/87 upon the same basis.                                          That is

      not     to     say         that,    in      considering             an    application              for

      reimbursement of            costs by an           officer,      a   Police Authority                   is

     necessarily limited to                factors listed            in the         Circular.              m

     this case, however, it has not been suggested that any relevant

     matters arose          for     consideration            outside       the       ambit        of    the
     Circular.


     The Police Federation.


             It is    necessary          to return          to     the Act      of     1964 for          an

     understanding          of     the    role        and        functions     of          the     Police

     Federation.           Part     III of the          Act by section 44              provides for

     the continuance of             a Police Federation              for England and                Wales

     •••"for       the purpose           of representing            members         of the        police

    forces in England and Wales                  ... in all         matters affecting their

    welfare and       efficiency,             other     than questions            of       discipline

9   affecting individuals,               except as provided by sub-section (1)(A)

    below,     and    questions          of    promotion           affecting         individuals".

    Sub-Section       (1)(A),        inserted         by     the      Police         and     Criminal

    Evidence Act 1984,             permits representation of                   a member of             the

    police force at          any disciplinary proceedings                      or on        an appeal
    from any such proceedings.


            The Secretary of State by section 44(3) may by regulations

    prescribe      the     constitution           and      proceedings         of      the        Police

    Federation and,         in particular,           may make       provision with respect

                                         - 7     -
  to    the     raising         of   funds           by     the Federation by       voluntary

  subscription and the use                     and management of funds derived                 from

  such subscriptions.                The court was informed                  that the funds of

  the Police Federation                  derive only from            private gifts and         the
 subscriptions of policemen.


         The    Police          Federation           regulations      1969     No.     1787,    as

 amended,      were put before the court.                       it   is necessary to refer

 only to Regulation 19:                   Use of Federation Funds.                  It is there

 provided that Federation funds                           shall not, without        the consent

       the    Secretary of           state,          be used    otherwise          than for the

 purposes        mentioned           in        paragraphs            (3 )     to     (7 )     and,

 notwithstanding anything in those paragraphs,                              shall not be used

 •••(c)        in connection             with the defence of a member                 or former

 member of       the       Federation against                whom     civil,       criminal    or

 disciplinary proceedings are                        brought except     as authorised          by

 paragraphs      (4)(h),         (5) or (7).              The construction of Regulation

 19 is not,      in my view, free of difficulty.                        The submission for

the applicants, who are supported by the Police Federation, was

that the decision of the                   F ederation to pay the legal               costs of

the applicants incurred in the auditor's inquiry was made under

paragraph 3(3) of Regulation 19 which provides as follows:

It was not suggested on behalf of the police authority that the

Federation s decision had been made without proper authority.

         The Inquiry by the Auditor



                     inquiry arose          out of an          investigation by the                     County

            asurer into the police accounts.                          Disciplinary proceedings

         were taken against         the Chief Constable,                   Mr. A,.       Parrish            but

           ey did not     proceed to            a hearing           because of the            retirement

•             The Police Committee, which is another name for the Police

        Authority,    (see section          2   of     the 1 9 6 4        A c t ), resolved on              4 th

         ecember 1965 that the accounts and other documents                               be sent to

        the auditor for consideration by him.                         The auditor was invited

        to hold his inquiry in public.                        The clerk       of the Council was

        instructed to retain counsel to represent                          the Police Authority
        before the auditor.


             The nature        of   the proceedings                thus     initiated, and               the

    powers which the auditor could use,                       if the facts justified such

                                        -   9    -
 action,    are sufficiently described by reference to                                sections 19

 and 20 of the Local           Government Finance Act 1982.                            By section

 19, where     it   appears to             the     auditor ...           that        any item    of

 account is contrary           to law           he may        apply to       the court for         a

 declaration.        On his application the court may make or refuse

 to make the declaration asked for and, where the declaration is

made,     then the court may also order that any person responsible

for incurring or authorising any                     expenditure declared unlawful

shall repay it in whole or                 in part.            Such an order            is not to

be made if the       court is satisfied that the                        person responsible

for     incurring    or    authorising             any        such      expenditure        acted

reasonably or in the belief that the expenditure was authorised

by law.       So far      as concerns section                   19,   the inquiry by            the

auditor was thus preliminary                    to other proceedings                 which might

be taken.       By section           20,    however,          where    it appears to            the

auditor that a loss            has been incurred or deficiency                         caused by

the wilful misconduct of any person, he shall                               certify that the

loss or deficiency is due              from that person and, subject                       to an

appeal,    that sum may be recovered                 from the person responsible.

A right of appeal         is provided to             the court which may                 confirm

vary or quash the decision.


      It is necessary to             describe in some detail the                       result of

the auditor's       inquiry.           The        applicants say             that they      were

wholly exonerated         by    the auditor              of     any wilful           misconduct.

The Police Authority did              not share that                view.       In     the sense

that the auditor held that there was no basis                               on the facts for

any application      to the          court        by him       or     for exercising         his

jurisdiction against the             officers to direct                  them to make        any

payment towards the sums             unlawfully paid away,                   the applicants

                                 -    10    -

    (x)           None of the         persons concerned, said                     the auditor

    was an        accountant.                  xf      the accounting        irregularities

    which occurred         were           undertaken in         the       belief        that       the

    refurbishment had               been        properly       authorised         then       their

    wrongfulness was            less serious.                  There      was no evidence

    that Mr. Dalton, Mr. Wilson or Mr.                         Keeton knew at              the time

    that the refurbishment had not been approved.


              Miss Stock, Mr. Keeton,                     Mr. Wilson        and Mr. Dalton

said that          theythought it was correct                       to code expenditure

to the expenditure head                   which          had been underspent.                    The
practices          adopted          may         well                k
                                                   1 have           been     an        innocent

                                                part of the             particular         police

                                -    14    -
  officers, although it          did have      the effect of       concealing

  the expenditure on         refurbishment from          any one who        might
  review actual expenditure with estimates.


  (Xii)     in the view      of the auditor          none of the       officers

  had been shown to      have been guilty            of wilful misconduct.

  It was the auditor's o p i ni on that the parties acted in the

  belief that their actions            were authorised by law           for the

  reasons explained in        the report so          that it would not          be

 proper to seek an order for repayment.


 <*iii)     AS to Mr. Wilson,     he was aware on his own evidence

 Of the improper       certification by        Mr. Dalton on           invoices

 that goods not yet        received had been          received.        He   was

 aware that the purpose was        to secure the         payment of those

 invoices before the end of March 1 983 and the debit of the

 expenditure to the 1982/83 accounts.                 Since     he was aware

 of those     irregularities      it was      his     duty to     refuse     to

 certify the invoices and         to prevent the purpose           of those

acts being     achieved.         But    Mr.   Wilson     did certify        the

invoices and     he    did    not report       the     irregularities        to

anyone.       it seemed, however,        likely that he acted in the

belief that approval for         the expenditure had been              or was

in the    process of    being obtained.               it probably       never

occurred to him that he was doing anything wrong.


    )     As to Mr.    Dalton,    who was      a police sergeant,           he

said that all his      actions were in consequence              of general

or specific     instructions to         him by Miss      Stock,    a    Chief

Superintendent, or Mr. Keeton,          a Superintendent.              He had

discussions with suppliers and obtained invoices                  which he

                       - 15 -
           certified,      including          the irregular       invoices.             He    said

           that he questioned          the propriety of            his actions but             was

           reassured by Miss stock.                „ iss stock denied that she had

           reassured him.           Mr.       Dalton acted       wrongly in           obtaining

           irregular invoices         and       in certifying         them         as to     goods

           received when goods had not been received;                          and it was no

           answer to say that he was acting under                     instructions.             He

          had, however, only          been in the         department for two                 years

          and there was no evidence that he knew the expenditure had

          not been     properly approved.                 H i s _ e v i d e n c e was      honest
          sounding and convincing.                                       '     J        ^        ^


          (XV)       Additional costs           incurred by        the County           Council

          over the question         of unauthorised payments including                        the

          disciplinary       proceedings         were,      at     the       time     of      the

          auditor s inquiry,        already in excess of £ 2 0 0 ,0 0 0 .


          (xvi)   Even if it were to be decided that                         there had been

         wilful misconduct it could not logically be                          said that any


/
    /    loss had been incurred               by the charging of             expenditure to

         the wrong year nor did it seem that                  it could logically be

|        said that     the    irregular          submission of        invoices          caused
I        loss.


    The Process of the Decision of 26th July 1988


         By letter    of     26th February         1988     the Police          Federation

    requested the Police Authority              to meet in full,             or contribute

            legal costs of the applicants.                   Reference was made to

the circular      No. 77/87         and to       those aspects         of the        inquiry

which justified and required legal representation.

 under the terms of it.                 It will be necessary to return to that

 point later in this judgment.


         The Police Authority                did not delegate,           as it might       have

 done,    the function        of deciding             the applications but             resolved

 that     "a   panel         ...      be       appointed         ...     (to)     ...      hear

 representations from Miss Stock and/or her                            representatives and

 report back to this committee;                   and that an opportunity to make

 oral representations to the panel also be offered                              to the other

 applicants and/or their representatives".


         The panel     was duly         established.             It     consisted of        the^

Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Police                         Authority, Councillor

Barnes and      Councillor            Dentith,        respectively,         together      with

Councillor      D.M.       Bookbinder,           the     Leader        of   the    Council,

Councillor Mellors, and Mr.                  John JP, a magistrate.


        On 8 th July 1988 submissions were made to the panel.                              The

submissions made for             these applicants              were presented by          Miss '

Blackburn a solicitor.                  There is at page 3 4 a full account of

her submission.            in      very brief summary             she relied upon          the

following matters:              (i)     the applicants had              provided full co- ^

operation in      the      investigation              at all    stages;         (ii)       the

inquiry posed        the     risk       of     grave consequences           for    the     two

officers concerned;             (iii)        they had both been acting under the

orders of senior        officers;              (iv)    the     nature of the           inquiry

gave rise to problems of evidence and the handling of a mass of

documents and        legal      representation           was therefore          necessary;

(v)     both had been totally cleared of misconduct;                            (vi)     their

claim to reimbursement or contribution fell                           clearly within the

mam   principle      of the        circular;          (vii)      it     would serve       the

 County Council, was present at the meeting of                                             the panel and by

 his second affidavit (page 55) described what happened:

         the decision     th1SC7 tl0n °f thS               (b)    in making

         Mellors he confirmed that the terms of the circular w e 4 wide
         enough to cover a District Auditor's hearing.”


     Mr. Million continued:

     "Tl6 . S nel unanimously decided to recommend that the Police
     Committee not to provide financial assistance either in whole
                 t0 ^   °f thS aPPlicants-    The Panel had not been
     specifically asked by the       Police Committee to     make a
      ecommendation but to hear the representations and report
      ack      Although the point was not raised or discussed the
           P|;°ceeded on the basis that making a recommendation was
     within the remit and formed part of reporting back."


     Finally Mr. Million                         said that            he did        not know which             of

many possible factors caused each of the                                     individual members of

the Panel         to       reach         the conclusion               he     did.                 However     the

following were among                    those mentioned or                   discussed:              (a)      the

report      of      the         auditor          with      particular                 reference to            the

conclusions he              reached             relating         to    the         applicants           and    to


                                            -     19   -
 unlawful     expenditure         and        wilful        misconduct;             (b)            the

 provisions       of    circular        77/87;          (c )        the     fact      that        the

 application had been            made after the            event and that there                   had

 been    no   approach      made        to      the     Police       Authority            earlier,

 particularly      on     the      level        and    scale         of     representation;

 (d)    the assistance provided by the Federation;                            (e )       the fact

 that the     ratepayers         who     had     originally          complained           to     the

 District     Auditor      had     not       asked     for     or     been     given           legal
 assist anc e.


        It will be      necessary to refer              later in this judgment                    to

the evidence of         members of           the Panel as           to the grounds              upon

which each formed his conclusion.


        A report was      prepared by the              Panel and submitted to                    the

Police Authority.               it is        at page       46 and     consisted of               two

sheets of typescript.             it     was a joint report by the                    Clerk to

the Police       Authority,       Mr.        Reg Race       and     the Head         of        Legal

Services, Mr. David Tysoe.                   The purpose of          the report was "to

report the       considerations          of     the Panel         established             by     the

Committee to hear representations                 ..."         Under "Information and

Analysis" it referred to the setting up of the Panel and to its

meeting on 8 th July to hear representations on                            behalf of Chief

Superintendent         Stock,     on     behalf       of     these        applicants,           and

written representations made by Superintendent Keeton.                                    It was

said that the applications               were considered in               accordance with

the circular;      that consideration was given to the principle of

making payment in full, or contribution and not                            to the details

of any payment;          that     detailed submissions                were made by              the

respective parties;         and        that the Panel took into                account the
 findings of the Auditor and the fact that the Auditor concluded

 that no one        involved in       the matter        of the refurbishment            was

 guilty of wilful misconduct albeit the expenditure was declared
 to be contrary to law.


        There was then reference            to the      central principle pointed

 out in     the    circular,     which       should     guide        consideration       of

 individual       cases,     namely      that     where    a     Police        Authority

considered that an           officer had        acted in       good faith ...,          the

officer should         have the support         of the     Police Authority             and

should not        be   out    of pocket.             There then        followed      this

statement:        "Members considered carefully all                  of the arguments

which had been put forward              ... by the applicants but               were not

persuaded that the circumstances of any of the                        cases were such

as to     justify      the    Police Authority          paying       the costs     or    a

contribution towards the m".


        Next,   under the heading "Personnel Considerations",                     it was

noted that Chief Superintendent Stock and Superintendent Keeton

had incurred        their own     costs.          The     Police Federation          had

exercised its discretion to represent the applicants,                          Inspector

Wilson and        Sergeant Dalton,          and "any     reimbursement of         costs

would in effect be a reimbursement to the                   Police Federation of

its costs".


     Under "financial considerations"                   it was noted       that Chief

Superintendent         Stock's   costs        were                       the     Police

Federation's costs           amounted to                       and    Superintendent

Keeton's costs amounted to




                                 - 21   -
          Under "legal      considerations"          it was     said       that "if       the

  Police Authority were            so minded the       costs,       or a   contribution

  towards them, could legally be paid.                     However, whether or not

  to do     so is    a matter       for the      discretion of         the Committee".

  That was followed by            "Panel's unanimous recommendation:                  that

  the Police Authority         do not        provide any financial           assistance
  •.. for the applicants".


        It is necessary to comment at this point upon this report.

 On first looking at these papers it seemed clear to me that the

 authors of the report,           the Clerk to the          Authority and the Head

 of Legal     Services, neither           of whom     had been        present at       the

 meeting of the       Panel, were unaware            of or in        a state of       some

 confusion     as    to    what     the      Panel   had      been     instructed       or

 authorised to do.           it was set up to hear             the representations

 and to report.        It has not been argued that               the Panel was not

 entitled to add a recommendation as                 to its own view.           For my

 part I think that it was so entitled.                     All those on the Panel

were,   of course, members of             the Authority;       but, if it       was to

do what it had been         instructed to do,         it     was,    in my judgment,

essential to report fairly the substance of the representations

which it     had heard.             it is,     for that      purpose, useless          to

recite that "all the arguments have been carefully considered".

That is not a        "report" in the meaning           of that word as         it was

used in the     resolution of the             Police Authority in setting             up

                The apparent explanation for what occurred appears

to be     that the    five Panel       members       were led        to believe,      or

believed    without       advice,     that     the   Police     Authority       could

properly act simply on their view of                 the representations which

had been made.        It is clear that there was              no intention         that
          there should        be any       further report          Qr    explanation of             ^

                        be a mistaken           belief and one          which they should               not

     Authority on 26th July 1 9 8 8 and the Authority decided to refuse

         e applications.            The minute is at page 138.                 it recites the

     fact that         the   Panel     had       carefully        considered          all    of    the

     arguments         put   forward       for        the    applicants     but        unanimously

     recommended that no payment                     be made.       The resolution not              to

    provide financial assistance was recorded.                           Twenty one members

    o'    the Police Authority were                  present at the meeting.                  It „ as

    One only of         a substantial number                 of other items       of business

    It is common ground             that there was             no discussion and that              no

    explanation of the representations made for                          the applicants was
    given to the Police Authority.


           On 29th July 1988 notice                   of the decision was sent               to the

    applicants.         No    reasons were given.                  on 2nd September             1988

    the applicants by             their solicitors asked             for the reasons              for

    the decision.            on    23rd September 1988             Mr. Reg Race,             County


                                       -   23    -
  Director,       replied, as clerk to the                 Police Authority (page 41).
  The following passage should be noted:

                        C°nsistfntly r e f e r s to your clients but .. the
          Federation   undertook to meet those costs           and therefore
          to S     t t o " " and Inspsct0-- Hilso"               not personally liable


  Mr. Race then dealt          with the allegation put forward                     on behalf

  of the     applicants       based          upon a       press     release made    by   the

 Chairman of        the Police Authority,                  "that the      decision of 'the

 Committee was based          upon irrelevant and incorrect                    conclusions

 and that the quotations                .. . indicate that the decision               of the

 Committee was         ...irrational".                    Mr.    Race saw    no reason      to

 Place      the      matter     before              the     Police        Authority      for
 reconsideration.


 The Proceedings for Judicial Review


         Application for leave                to apply was         made on 26th    October

 and leave was granted          by Mr.            Justice Webster on        16th December

 1988.      The affidavit in support was provided                       by Mr. Webber,      a

partner of applicants' solicitors.                          it included      reference to

the public comments made by Mr.                    Albert Barnes,        Chairman of the

Police Authority, to          which reference has                  been made above,      in

support of the         contention that the                decision had been made         by

the Panel and not by          the Police Authority,                 and that     in making

the decision the        Panel had             had regard to         irrelevant matters.

Mr. Webber       referred to        a        report in      the     edition of     "Police

Review" for 19th August 1988.                       There is       now before the court

  copy of a       press release,             upon which         that article was based,

issued by Mr.       Barnes after              the final         decision of the    Police

Committee on 26th July 1988 in                    response,       as Mr. Barnes put it,


                                -       24    -
     to public comments made by the Police Federation".                                     it is at

 page 169 of the bundle and contains the following:

          "Although it has been said that the two officers were
         exonerated at the inquiry, it should be borne in mind that the
         expenditure on the refurbishment of the Chief Constable's
         office was found to have been incurred without authority and
         was contrary to law.      The Police Authority's members Panel
         carefully considered all the facts available before making its
         decision.   I am surprised that the Police Federation, who act
         in a similar role to a trade union, has chosen to unfairly
         criticise the Authority through the media.        in exceptional
         circumstances the authority has the discretionary power to pay
        officers costs but after careful consideration the Panel
        decided not to make an award.        The decision of the Panel,
        which comprises both elected members and           a magistrates
        representative, was unanimous, was in agreement with the
        recommendation of the professionals who served the Panel, and
        was subsequently approved by the full Police Committee.
        Although the Police Federation have said publicly that their
        members should not pay these costs, I think it is unfair to
        expect Derbyshire ratepayers to meet them.           One of the
        benefits of membership is that costs of legal action such as
        this inquiry can be met from the Police Federation’s funds.
        It should be remembered that the two ratepayers who brought
        the matter to the attention of the District Auditor did not
        ask Derbyshire     ratepayers to    pay the     cost of     legal
        representation neither did others among those stated to be at
        risk".


        The applicants complained that,                   if the Police Authority is

to be       treated as    having made             the decision        by accepting              the

decision or recommendation of                    the Panel,    the decision                 was bad

because the         Panel had     taken into             account irrelevant                 matters

namely,       (i)    the ratepayers who had brought                   the matter to the

attention of         the Auditor       had not           sought the        costs of          legal

representation;           (ii)             the     refurbishment           of         the    Chief

Constable's office        was found              by the     District        Auditor to           be

contrary to law;          (iii)       Mr.        Wilson's and Mr. Dalton's                   costs

had been met by the Police Federation;                       and    (added by amendment

at    the    hearing)       (iv)            Mr.     Wilson's         and        Mr.    Dalton's

application for reimbursement                    was a    "late" application,                 made

only after the        costs had        been incurred,              and that the             Police


                                  -   25    -
Authority had had no prior opportunity of considering the scale

and level of representation.


     It was common           ground before this               court that some of        the

matters,    to which reference                was made by members         of the Panel,

were indeed        irrelevant but             it was     contended      for the      Police

Authority that such matters                   had formed no real         or substantial

part of the basis of decision.


     The task given to             the Police Authority under                the statute

in the context           of the    guidance given by              the circular       was,   I

think,   of considerable difficulty.                     It is     similar to the task

which courts        must     perform in           deciding       whether a    successful

litigant should, despite his success,                     not be awarded his costs,

or all     of his        costs.          The validity          of the    exercise of        a

court's discretion in such cases                     has been frequently examined.

The Panel,    if it was going to make                   a decision,     needed guidance

on matters of        law relevant to              the exercise of its         discretion

and the point at which guidance was most                         required was when the

grounds of application had                   been put forward and         the Authority

was required        to    make its           decision    with reference        to     those

grounds.      It     is, I think,            clear    that it did not        receive the

advice which was required in a number of respects.                           Not all of

these matter       were      put       forward       by the     applicants     in     their

grounds.       I will mention                those matters first before             dealing

with the points on which the applicants have relied.


     Firstly, at          the very       outset the           application was       placed

before the Police Authority with a report prepared by the Clerk

to the Authority.             I    have set out          thfe relevant part of          the

report above to the effect that since the                        Police Authority had

                                   -    26    -
 been in      effect the      complainant in            the audit       inquiry it      was

 inappropriate for the Authority to make any payment towards the

 costs.       As I have said,        Mr.      Newman     has acknowledged that this

 was m      error.      it    is necessary to            explain why it           was error

 and,    in my     view, a    serious error.                 The expectation of         the

 applicants to be paid          their costs,           if they were        fairly within

 the central principle stated                 in the circular,        cannot sensibly

 be affected by        the fact that           the Police Authority, which             has

 the task     of     considering         their      claim,    was,    to    an     extent,

 responsible for causing            the inquiry,          in which the       applicants

had been put at risk, to be set up and carried out.                               The role

of the Police Authority             as complainant,          in the sense         that the

County Council,        of which      the Police          Authority is        in form     a

committee,       had    suffered          the       "loss"      which       was     being

investigated, was, on the contrary,                  a fact in       respect of which

the Police Authority was required,                  in my judgment,        to call upon

'ts powers of objective detachment so that,                      in considering the

applications for reimbursement of                   costs,   it would      have regard

only to     matters     relevant to           the    conduct of      the    individual

applicants,      in the light       of the guidance           in the terms of         the

circular,    and     not to any      sense of          general indignation          based

upon its view of the          "loss" suffered by the County                 Council as

contributor to the police            funds.            There is nothing to           show

that the members of          the Police Authority were later                 told that

that first advice from          their Clerk was misconceived but,                    as I

have said,    the point has not beer, relied uocn;                    if it had been

there might have been further                 evidence directed to it;              and I

therefore put it on one side.




                                -   27    -
         Secondly,          it is necessary            to refer to Mr.            Barnes's press

release.             It      contained         the statement           that "in       exceptional

circumstances the Authority has the discretionary                                    power to pay

officers costs".                  It is to be hoped that it is exceptional,                        in

the work of               a Police Authority,               that consideration has to              be

given to an application of this nature.                                 If an application is

made, however,              and if the applicant's circumstances fall fairly

within the           guiding        principle          of    the   circular,         no     further

question of               "exceptional circumstances"                  then    arises and         the

discretion,               given    to   the       Police       Authority,       is    plainly       a

discretion to be exercised properly for the                               purposes for which

the power was              given.           This point also            forms no part of           the

case for the applicants and I lay it on one side also.                                      I will

return to the              question whether the                Panel had regard           to other

irrelevant matters after dealing with the applicants' main case

which was          that the         Police Authority             did     not consider         their

app l i c a t i o n s .


The Applicants'             first two Submissions


        The first two of Mr. Underhill's main                            submissions can, as

he said, be taken together:                       they are the "rubber stamping" and

the "inadequate report"                     submissions.           The     force of the           two

submissions is              that     there was          no     proper decision         upon       the

application for reimbursement of costs by the Police Authority.

The Panel was not                 given authority to            decide the applications,

although the Police Authority had full power                               to have delegated

the decision to              the Panel if             it had    wished to do          so.         The

Panel took upon itself                  to make a decision on                 the applications

as to      what       the     Panel         would     do     and to      report      that    as     a


                                        -    28   -
          commendation.        in reporting back to the Police Authority,                            as

      it had been      instructed to          do,   the Panel           did recite the         main

                 according to which           their recommendation was made.                          I

      accept Mr. Newman's submission that the report was not a "bare"

      recommendation as Mr.          Underhill called it.                  The report          made

      reference to the        fact that there             was under consideration               the

      principle of making          any payment           and not the       question of          how

     much payment might be made;              to the        central finding that there

     had been no      wilful misconduct             but with       the comment that             the

     expenditure had         been held      contrary to           law;      to the       central

     principle      stated    in      the     circular;             to     the    fact         that

•    reimbursement would           amount     to    reimbursement           of    the    Police

     Federation;     and to the fact that there was full legal power to

     make payment.         But the report did not describe the submissions

     made for the applicants          or indicate their relevance,                   or refer

     to the availability of an account of them,                    if any member of the

    Polilce Authority wanted to know                    what they were.            The report

    was placed      before     the    Police        Authority.              There       was     no

    discussion.       The     decision was made.               if it was the            duty of t

    the   Police     Authority       to     consider        the     substance           of     the

    (submissions     made      for    the     applicants           in     deciding           their    !

    application then it is clear that as to 16 of the 21 members of                                   I

    the Police Authority, who             were present on that             occasion,         they

    failed to do so because they did not know what they were.


          Mr. Underhill submitted that                  the nature of the          powers of

    the Police Authority, and             of the decision required to                be made

    upon the application,          was in     each case such             that it was          the

    duty of   the    Police     Authority          to     consider       the     applicants'

    submissions.      He     referred to the discussion                  of discretionary

             I am unable to accept                        this submission.                It is true      that

      exercising administrative   functions       or which is making an
      investigation or conducting p r e liminary     inquiries, especially
      when it is a numerous body.       The Race Relations Board has 12
      members.   The Employment Com m i t t e e has seven members.   It is
      impossible to suppose that all of them need sit to determine a
      matter nor that all of those who sit should have        read all the
      papers or heard all the evidence.         But I do think that two or
      three at any rate must have done so.           If there is a quorum
      o , say, three,  I should   think a quorum must have done so
      That is the ordinary accep t e d method of carrying on business!
      It should be applied here also."



      The passage from the judgment of Lawton LJ. should also be
 noted:   page 22h:

       For my part I can see no r e a s o n at all why the      Board should
      not delegate to its       staff       the  function   of    collecting
      information    it would be impractical for the         members of the
      Board themselves to make investigations.          How  the Board does
     what Parliament has entrusted it to do is not a matter for the
     courts to decide as it acts fairly and in good          faith.    it is
      for the Board, not the courts, to decide how much information
     each of its members should h a v e when      considering a particular
     case.     As  long as the    Board, or       one of its     constituent
     committees, has enough info r m a t i o n to enable it to make a fair
     assessment of the case, the    courts will not interfere.           How
     it gets the information    is for the chairman and his advisers
     to decide.     He may decide      in a particular case that        each
     member of the Board, or   the committee, should have a copy of
     the whole file.     in another case he         may consider that    the
     case can be adequately and fai r l y dealt with if one member has
     the file and reports   to the others what        is in it.      In this
     case three members of   the employment committee had a copy of
     the complete file.     This was enough to enable         the committee
     to deal with the applicant's case fairly."



     In that      case    the       Board,         with     a    power to    delegate   as

described in      the    passages read,               dealt       with a    complaint   in

accordance with procedures adopted and operated in the ordinary

conduct of its     business.              There           was,   it   was there held,    a

decision by the Board,          with sufficient information                     upon which

to deal fairly with the case.                      The Board was not         acting as a

judicial body in the         sense that would have attracted                     any need

for the   Board    as    a   whole            by    individual        members    to   have

considered the particular case and submissions made.

                     in    this       case     the        Police      Authority            had,       as     I    have
             explained,         full power to             deleaate-           hnf-    • ^ j
                     s                                          9       t     but     it did not choose                to
             use that power.            It was,           I agre e, exercising an administrative

             discretion;         but it was not such as to be described properly as

             "purely administrative",                    whatever that may mean.                   The power to

          consider,        and if thought                fit,    to award reimbursement                    of costs

          arose under            the    general           administrative              powers       given         under

          statute;         but, once         a particular claim by                     an officer is made,

          It seems to me that,                 in dealing with it,                   the      Police Authority

                deciding         a     claim         to financial                  redress        based upon           a

    A     ---------- 5 _ ^ P e c t a t i p n        of having         the claim to            reimbursement

         considered in            accordance with the                       principles set         out in         the

         Home Office circular.                     it may raise,             as it did here, questions

^       as      to    the conduct            of the applicant.                        Th at    nature of          the

'•      decision required the body,                       to which was entrusted                  the      task of

         making it,        to     hear properly the                  case made for             the applicant.

         I do not say that an oral hearing was necessary                                       but it was,         in

         this case,        clearly appropriate                  as the Police              Authority itself

              ognised.          The Police Authority in this case decided that it
        would retain to
                                                   the     decision upon              these applications.
        That     is       not     surprising:                they            had     arisen     out     of        an

        investigation of the conduct                        of senior police officers                      in the

        handling of public              money which              had,       inevitably         and properly,

        received much publicity.                         Having made that decision,                     and not

        having altered it, the members of the                                Police Authority present

        were required,           in    my judgment,             to   decide the applications                     by

        their own decisions.                   We        do not have           to consider whether                a

        retrospective delegation is possible.                                 There was no attempt to

        effect such         delegation.                    There      was, also,             no attempt          to


                                               -    33
describe the submissions made                  for the applicants.            There was

not even a summary of them.                   I have well in mind the fact that

the five members of            the Panel were        present,    and the          16 other

members of         the Police     Authority present           knew    that the           five

Panel members could,           if asked,       have reported upon what had been

said.      The Police         Authority was plainly content to                rely upon

the judgment of the five.                 That is,    in my     view, no answer •to

the point.         I am content to rest my            decision upon this ground

°f failure by          the Police Authority          to consider and to             decide

the applications but, since the argument was made,                       I would add

that this is not, in my view,                a merely technical point of legal

analysis.         The 16 members did not know              upon what matters they

might usefully          ask for       further information       unless they              were

given the substance of the submissions made for the applicants.

In particular,         they    might have asked        whether the Auditor                had

held that the applicants               had acted in good faith,          and whether

there      was      any       ground      of      distinction        between            Chief

Superintendent Stock            and    Superintendent       Keeton,     on        the     one

hand,    and     Inspector     Wilson        and Sergeant     Dalton,        as     junior

o f f i c e r s , or either of them,     on the other hand.


        I would,    therefore, hold            that the decision of          the Police

Authority must be quashed and the applications                       remitted to the

Police Authority to be considered in the light                       of the judgment

of this court.


The Wednesbury Submission


        It is    now    necessary       to     consider the     third    ground           of

application:        the Wednesbury           submission.      Both    sides invited

the court,      if the applicants should succeed upon                 the first two

                                  - 34 -
 grounds,    to deal with the third ground also so that the opinion

 of this court upon the issues raised would                               be available to the

 parties     when,       as     is        now        necessary,     the      Police     Authority

 considers the applications again.


         For this       purpose,          it    is necessary         to      refer to     further

parts of the         evidence filed                  for the      respondents.            It      has

been,    as I have said,              common          ground that some of the matters,

to which      reference was               made        by members,       of    the Panel,       were

irrelevant considerations.                           The main     issue has been         whether

and to     what      extent      findings of              the     Auditor amounted           to    a

 complete exoneration" of the applicants and whether there was,

in his     findings, any             basis upon           which     the Police         Authority

could reasonably          conclude              that     no     reimbursement         should      be

provided for the applicants.                           The next issue was          whether,       if

there was        such a       basis for              decision,    the     decision made        was

nevertheless vitiated by the taking into                            account of irrelevant
matters.


     Mr.     Allsop       is         the        Committee         Administrator         of     the

Derbyshire County Council.                            He attended       the meeting of         the

Panel on 8th July and took notes.                          There was         (page 141) "never

an intention to          reproduce the                 notes but     simply to prepare             a

report     for    the     full        Police           Committee     giving      the     Panel's

recommendation".              From his notes he was able to summarise what

he called "the main points of the Panel's                            consideration of the

submissions made" and they were:                         (a) comparisons         with a court

hearing were not fair:                    the Auditor's hearing               was preliminary

to a court hearing;             (b)        if the County Council were not giving

financial assistance to                   the ratepayers           who made the         original


                                      -    35    -
Auditor was     concerned.            The       accounting irregularities              were

committed, on the       Auditor's findings,            in     the belief that           the

methods used     represented the               proper way     to     proceed.            In

particular Sergeant          Dalton had been          expressly so        told:         see

paragraph 57 of the report.


     Mr. Newman firstly attacked this                  submission on the facts:

the report clearly established,                 he said,    lack of     good faith on

the part of the applicants in addition to a                        failure to act "in

pursuance of their duties".                    He added that the        report showed

them to have     told lies.               I have    no hesitation in        rejecting

this submission on the f a c t s .             The Auditor         at paragraph 66 of

his report said this:

     "it is my opinion that the p a r ties acted in the belief that

In my judgment        that was       a finding       that these applicants             had

acted in good faith.          We do not have to              consider in this case

whether the Police          Authority would have             been entitled to          act

upon other material         with reference           to the     good faith of           the

applicants.      For my      part I think that they could                 properly do

so but,    if they were going to do so,              I have     no doubt that they

would,    and should from the requirements of procedural fairness,

have told the applicants of the substance of                       such material and

given them an opportunity of dealing with it.                         But nothing of

this nature arose.          The Panel claimed to decide and did decide

on the     findings    of    the Auditor.                  Those findings,        in    my

 udgment,    exclude both bad faith and lying.


     But Mr. Newman's next submission was more formidable.                              He

argued that, accepting,          as he says for            this argument the Panel

      as one of the matters, which "weighed most heavily" with him in

            Mr. Underhill submitted that the central                           • • ,

  «       the Circular meant that                 there is a presumption that,                if an

 officer is shown to              have acted in              good    faith in     pursuance of
 his duties,          he   should be          entitled          fn   • k
                                              entitled          to reimbursement        of     his
 reasonable costs                   4-u j_
                            and     that          a    refusal to         reimburse    in     such

 circumstances must            be    a bad            decision       unless there      is     some

 relevant factor           which     could reasonably                justify       the refusal.

 Without such justification the Police                          Authority must, said Mr

 Underhill,       be taken to have failed to have had proper regard to

the central         principle.           For          my    p a r t, I    would accept        that
submission.



          Mr. Underhill next submitted that the                          evidence shows that

the members of the Panel did not correctly                               understand what the

central principle was.                  The        report,     said Mr. Underhill,            did

               that    the applicants                 had   acted in       good     faith and,

moreover,      it wholly exonerated them of                     wilful misconduct which

was the only issue          with which,               as regards the        applicants,       the

did,    that the   applicants          had     been      acting           in       good faith,the

members of the Panel were              entitled         within the guidance provided

by the Circular        to rely         upon the negligence and breaches                         of

duty of which the applicants had been guilty.                              For the reasons

which follow,      I would        accept this          part     of the           respondent's

case.      The Circular is not drafted as a set of regulations and

it does     not have      the force          of law     of regulations.                      After

statement of the central principle in paragraph 2 it continues:


"The following      paragraphs          provide        general        guidance          to     the

different classes         of     proceedings".                 Paragraph           1    of     the

Circular     had   pointed       out     that     "the        Police           Authority       has

discretion to      meet        expenditure incurred             by        officers in          all

kinds of     legal proceedings where              the officers                 have acted       in

good faith     in pursuance            of their         duties". No             one of         the

following    paragraphs          was         specifically        directed              to      the

particular sort      of    proceedings           under consideration                   in     this

case,   namely an investigation by an                  Auditor.            In paragraph 4,

under the    heading       "Private Prosecutions",                   it        is said:         "a

police officer should be           able to carry           out his             duties in       the

confidence that, if        he acts           in good     faith and             exercises       his

judgment reasonably,           his Police        Authority will                support him".

In that particular        category,          therefore,    despite the             existence

of good faith, a failure to exercise                    judgment reasonably would

plainly provide a ground           for not awarding             reimbursement under

the central principle.             Next,       under     paragraph 7, beneath the

heading "Civil     Actions        against        individual Police                Officers",

there is a similar reference:                 "in considering             whether to give

financial assistance           the Authority           will wish           to consider          in

particular whether the           officer concerned             acted in good                 faith
 and exercised       his judgment            reasonably".                Where the     Police

 Authority     is      required     to         consider           an     application      for

 reimbursement for costs incurred in proceedings                             not separately

 or specifically considered under                      any of the paragraphs           in the

 Circular I see        no reason        why the          Police Authority should           be

 regarded as     required      to exclude               from     its consideration        the

 question whether        the police          officer           "exercised his        judgment

 reasonably".          if, therefore,             there was, on          the part of      the

 officer,    negligence,    i.e.    failure to exercise such                    care as was

reasonably to be required in the circumstances of an officer of



my view,     the Police Authority is entitled to                        have regard to it

if such negligence         was so connected                  to the subject         matter of

the   legal     proceedings,       or        to        the     causing     of   the     legal

proceedings to be taken,           that it can               fairly be regarded as          a

substantial cause of the           incurring of the                 costs.      I    have no

doubt that a        Police Authority,             if    satisfied of good faith           on

the part of the officer, would normally act,                            and be pleased to

act, on the central principle stated in the                            Circular;     but the

discretion is given to         the Authority and it is                     impossible,    in

my view,    to hold that, once good faith is established, a Police

Authority must       disregard      clear evidence               of     negligence or      a

failure to "exercise judgment reasonably".                              So to hold would

mean that     a Police Authority             would be          required to         disregard

acts of substantial        negligence,            such that       it could fairly         be

said that,     although acquitted of                   bad faith,       the officer      had

"brought the proceedings           on himself".                 The decision         whether

evidence of     such    negligence in              a     particular case           justifies

     decision had been otherwise valid,                     it was rendered             void on the

     ground that, because             there had been           a finding of            good faith,

     the findings of         the Auditor provided                  no basis upon which              the

     olice Authority,            acting          reasonably,        could refuse         to       grant
    reimbursement.


•           Before leaving the point I                would add only            this.      Because

    the submissions made for these applicants to the Panel were not

    summarised in the Panel’s report to the Police Authority,                                     there

    was no need for those who drafted the report to deal with those

      bmissions      or     to     mention         any     distinction          between       these
    applicants and the            oth^r          •
                                  other two applicants,                 chief Superintendent
    stock    and    Superintendent               Keeton.           The    question       whether

    irregularities in            the accounting            procedures constituted                 such

    egligence as justified refusing to reimburse                              costs, wholly or


                                        -   41
 in part,     despite       a    finding of           good     faith,           was one        to    be

answered with reference                to each        individual applicant and                      the

position of the junior officers,                    acting on            the instructions of

senior officers, might               reasonably be regarded as                     sufficiently

different      to      justify       consideration            of        making     a    different

response to the applications of the junior officers.                                         Whether

it does, of course,          is a matt er for the                  judgment of the Police

Authority.


       I    turn    then        to     the        remaining        matters         of        alleged

misdirection.            The first           is the    submission that the                    Police

Authority could not properly                   have regard to the fact                      that the

ratepayers, who had brought the matter to the                                 attention of the

Auditor,    had not sought the cost of legal representation.                                        Mr.

Underhill submitted             that     there was          no evidence           that the          two

ratepayers had incurred costs because they were not represented

at the inquiry.             They had         attended and had at                 most incurred

the    expense      of so       attending.              in         any        event,        said    Mr.

Underhill,       the     fact     that       those     ratepayers               did     not        seek

reimbursement,         assuming there             to be some        power in the              County

Council to pay if a request had been made,                          cannot reasonably be

a ground for not granting an application for reimbursement made

by a   police       officer.                Mr.     Newman,        as     I     understood          his

submission,      conceded that               this would       have been an              irrelevant

factor,    if it had       been relied upon,                but he contended                 that it

was not relied upon.             I think he was right so to concede:                                the

absence of       any     claim       from     the     two     ratepayers              is,     in     my

judgment,    clearly irrelevant to the merits of the                              claim by the

applicants.            As to whether          reliance was placed                 upon it, Mr.

Barnes,    the Chairman of the Police Authority,                          acknowledged that

                                     - 42 -
     he had indeed referred               to the matter            in M s          press                      ^

    which the text            has been set out            above.             „e has said in                 his

                                                     factor foremost in his                     mind when
    agreeing to the recommendation                      of the Pane!".                   An applicant,

    whose    application          h as     been        refused,        may     be        forgiven           for

      inking that         a     factor so         referred        to in        a        press release,

    mended        as     justification            to    the      public            of     the        Panel's

     ecision, must        have      played a           part    in that             decision.                 it

   Played,   however, no part in the decisions of                              the other members

   according to their affidavits.    when the matter                                      was raised,
   Mr. Million,  the Deputy Head of Legai  s_ ice^                                                ^


   that there was a distinction between the                            complaintants and the

   other individuals            who were        personally at risk.                           Asto      the

   effect of this         point on        the validity of               the decision of                 the

   Panel, had it been otherwise sustainable,                           I win        return to that
  when the       other    matters         n-F   an    j
                          matters         of    alleged        misdirection                   have    been
  considered.



       -The next matter           was the         reference to              the fact that              the

  costs of Hr. Wilson and                Mr. Dalton       had been met by                the     Police

^Federation.            it is not         in issue that           this factor was                    taken

  into account         by the    Panel generally.                      xt     appeared in              the

  report    of    the     Panel's         decision:              see        page        47:           "Any

  reimbursement of costs            would in effect               be a reimbursement                    to

  the Police Federation of its costs".                         M r . Underhill submitted

 that this       was wholly       irrelevant:              the    fact         that these             two

 officers had been supported by the Federation did not affect in

 any relevant      way the        merits of            their     applications, and,                    if

       applications           were good,        so      that they           were entitled              to

 reimbursement in whole or in part,                     they should be allowed.                        It

                                    - 43 -
is, of course, a        commonplace of the exercise of                         discretion as

to costs in our courts              that,          in general,      no attention           is paid

to the fact that a plaintiff or defendant is entitled, in right

of his membership           of a        trade union,       to       legal representation.

His right to an order for                 costs depends,            in the ordinary case,

upon the merits        of his           claim thereto.                   The fact that         his

union supports him is as                 irrelevant as the fact, if                   it should

be the case,    that he borrowed the money for                           his costs from his

parents on terms        that he           would not be             expected to        repay it.

Mr. Newman argued that that principle has no application in the

context of the statutory                 power of the Police Authority                      and of

the guidance        given     in        the     Circular;            and     that     a     Police

Authority is entitled to                 refuse to reimburse the costs                      on the

ground that     the officer              is not        personally          liable for        those

costs.       For my     part,       I     have no        doubt that Mr.             Underhill's

primary submission is              correct and that,               having regard to            the

terms of the Circular,             the        mere fact that an officer                   has been

provided     with     legal        representation             by     the      Federation        is

irrelevant     to      the     question             whether        an      application         for

reimbursement should be                 granted.          It is         clear that in         some

cases the question whether reimbursement should                              be granted can

only effectively be           decided by the              Police Authority when                the

result of the proceedings is known.                           Prior application by the

officer to the        Police Authority                 is not in         every case made         a

condition of reimbursement.                         It seems clear          to me that         the

Home Office,    in giving the guidance,                   and      the local authority's

association and the           police staff              associations, with whom                the

terms of the Circular were agreed,                      as is recited in paragraph 1

of it, contemplated that,                 in some cases,           the     Federation might


                                    _    44    _
 agree to provide representation in the first place and that the

 individual officer would be free to seek reimbursement when the

 result is known.        That conclusion does not                  mean that a Police

 Authority could in no case whatever have regard to                         whether the

Federation had provided the legal representation                        or whether it

had been paid for by          the officer personally.                  An application

might be      very finely balanced,          having regard            to the    various

factors requiring to be weighed.               If,     in       a particular case,      a

Police Authority was minded to take into account,                      in support of

a plea based        upon severe financial        hardship,          that an     officer

was personally       liable     for    the    costs,        I    consider     that   the

Authority would be        entitled to        have such regard           to it as      it

would think     proper     in    the circumstances.                   in this    case,

however,    it is clear on the evidence that                    the Panel, viewed as

a whole, did take        into account the fact that                 reimbursement in

respect of these applications would "in fact be a reimbursement

to the Police Federation of its              costs".            It was, accordingly,

in my judgment thus        taking into account              an irrelevant matter.

One last point should be mentioned.                A Police Authority is not

bound to make reimbursement according to the scale                       and cost of

representation incurred by an officer, or by                       the Federation on

his behalf,    in    a case where         the Police Authority           judges that

reimbursement is proper.              A    Police Authority may decide               to

authorise reimbursement to            the extent       that was, in         its view,

having obtained proper          advice and     information,           reasonable     in

the circumstances.


     The final point was          that added by amendment,               namely that

it was a misdirection         on the part of the                Panel to have regard

to the     fact that the      application for          reimbursement by          these
                                                                                                                      I




      applicants was          "late";             that-
                                                           is to     say made          only after          the
      costs had been incurred,                    so that the Police Authority                     had had

      no prior    opportunity of                  considering the              scale    and level            of

  representation.               M r . Newman conceded,                   and rightly in my view,

  that this        „ as    a ' "bad"              point     but he        argued       that,       on    the

  evidence,       only Mr. John and Mr.                    Bookbinder had had regard to it



  before that of negligence and breach of duty.                                         The point was

  bad,    I think,        because it did                  not matter that the                application

  was in that        sense and to                 that extent "late".                   In    the first           ,

 Place it        could        not    effectively             have been           made     before        the

 inquiry was concluded because the Police Authority did not know

 what the outcome would be and any decision                                    on their part would

         had to     have included provisions                        preserving the right                 of

 ultimate decision quite unfettered;                              and,     secondly, the Police

 Authority       had,      as       explained             above,        full     power        in    their

 discretion       to      reject         a        claim     if     it      should       appear       that

 representation was unnecessary,                           or that,       if    necessary at all,

 at a     much reduced          level.                 it could,         in such       a case,       makl

reimbursement only of such costs as should reasonably have been
incurred.


        What,    then,     should be the                  result having           regard to         such

attention as was paid to matter which were                                 conceded to be, and

which I have held to be, irrelevant,                             assuming that the decision

was otherwise valid?                     The position              can be       summarised thus.

 Dear Ian

 Hillsborough Stadium Disaster 1989 - Judicial Review

 Further to our telephone conversation I enclose a copy of the latest letter (17 February 1999) from
 the HFSG and my draft response.

 The only point not addressed specifically is the final sentence of the latest letter which refers to
 “serious allegations against the Force”. I assume this is a reference back to the list of submissions in
 the letter o f 10 February 1999 which I have in turn covered by reference to the outcome of the
 Stuart Smith enquiry. I had thought of asking them to set out what they say these allegations are if
 they are different to those made to Lord Justice Stuart Smith but on reflection I thought this might
 simply tempt them to come out with a new round of nonsense.

 I think it would be a good idea to get a response off before the end of the week and I look forward
 to hearing from you.

 Yours sincerely

           DRAFT LETTER AS FROM P C METCALF TO A ADLINGTON


A Adlington - Solicitor
Hillsborough Family Support Group
1st Floor Central Buildings
41 North John Street
Liverpool
L2 6RR


Dear Miss Adlington

Hillsborough

You will by now have received the Order of Mr Justice Latham and the Notice of Motion. I
await your Affidavit in reply in due course.


Many o f the points made in your various letters over the last week have effectively been
overtaken by events but there are some comments which I think ought to be made namely


1.     The need for the present Application has been at the least prompted and it might be
       said caused by your letters of 22 December 1998 and 5 January 1999 to the Police
       Authority. This provoked the Police Authority into obtaining its own advice which, in
       my view incorrectly, was to the effect that there was no power to grant funding.


2.     It is entirely a matter for the Police Authority as to whether they hold a hypothetical
       hearing as to the merits of an Application which they have already decided they have
       no power to grant. If this was proposed by the Authority and I was asked to advise -
       which has not happened - 1 would advise that it was inappropriate.


3.     In the circumstances I do not agree with your view that the Divisional Court should
       not consider the matter until such a hypothetical hearing has been held.


4.     There are a number of other points made in your letter of 10 February 1999 which are
        at best arguable and at worst misleading. Others fly in the face of the conclusions of
       Lord Justice Stuart Smith. However, in the end it is a matter for you what points you
        choose to put before the Court. I suggest you try and avoid direct falsehoods of the
       type contained in paragraphs 7 and 8 of your letter of 10 February 1999 where you
       state that I or my firm have been involved (prior to your letters of 22 December 1998
       and 5 January 1999 in giving advice about the validity, lawfulness or otherwise of
       decisions to grant financial assistance.


5.     The assertions in Mr Dames’ Affidavit, supported by his long policing experience and
       the letter received from the President o f the ACPO and the President of the Police
       Superintendents Association themselves represent evidence and no doubt if you have
       evidence which you believe contradicts this you will produce it. It is certainly not for
       me to research the matter on your behalf. You might however be guided by references
       to the matter in the Royal Commission report of 1962 and to the precise terms of the
       Home Office Circular of 1987.


There does not appear to be anything of relevance in your various letters which is not covered
by the foregoing.


Yours sincerely

 Dear Miss Adlington

 Hillsborough

 You will by now have received the Order of Mr Justice Latham and the Notice o f Motion. I await
 your Affidavit in reply in due course.

 Many o f the points made in your various letters over the last week have effectively been overtaken
 by events but there are some comments which I think ought to be made namely: -

 1.          The need for the present Application has been at the least prompted and it might be said
             caused by your letters o f 22 December 1998 and 5 January 1999 to the Police Authority.
             This provoked the Police Authority into obtaining its own advice which, in my view
             incorrectly, was to the effect that there was no power to grant funding.

 2.          It is entirely a matter for the Police Authority as to whether they hold a hypothetical hearing
             as to the merits o f an Application which they have already decided they have no power to
             grant. If this was proposed by the Authority and I was asked to advise - which has not
             happened - 1 would advise that it was inappropriate.

 3.          In the circumstances I do not agree with your view that the Divisional Court should not
              consider the matter until such a hypothetical hearing has been held.

 4.          There are a number of other points made in your letter of 10 February 1999 which are at best
             arguable and at worst misleading. Others fly in the face o f the conclusions of Lord Justice
             Stuart Smith. However, in the end it is a matter for you what points you choose to put
             before the Court. I suggest you try and avoid direct falsehoods of the type contained in
             paragraphs 7 and 8 of your letter of 10 February 1999 where you state, quite incorrectly, that
             I or my firm have been involved (prior to your letters of 22 December 1998 and 5 January

       1999 in giving advice about the validity, lawfulness or otherwise of decisions to grant
       financial assistance.

5.     The assertions in Mr Dames’ Affidavit, supported by his long policing experience and the
       letter received from the President o f the ACPO and the President o f the Police
       Superintendents Association themselves represent evidence and our client has since received
       a similar letter on behalf o f the Police Federation. No doubt if you have evidence which you
       believe contradicts this you will produce it. It is certainly not for us to research the matter on
       your behalf. You might however be guided by references to the matter in the Royal
       Commission report of 1962 and to the precise terms o f the Home Office Circular o f 1987.

There does not appear to be anything of relevance in your various letters which is not covered by the
foregoing.

Yours sincerely

PS     With reference to your letter of today now received:

       1.   Copy order enclosed.

       2.   No representations were made to the Judge about further evidence. Our counsel does
            not believe that this will be a matter of controversy but no doubt if further evidence is
            submitted you will have the opportunity of objecting if you wish to do so.

       3.   Although, on counsel’s advice, we did serve the former officers’ representatives with
            copy bundles I have not been told that they intend to take part in the proceedings and
            indeed I am not sure what the procedural position is if they wish to do so. I think that it
            hardly be denied that they have an interest although the Judge did not order that they be
            joined.

Thank you fo r your le tte r of 16 February.

I fu lly recognise the sensitivities of th is case and I am grateful to you fo r
draw ing the present issues to my attention. I have noted your decision to apply
fo r leave to challenge the police a u th o rity's decision th a t it has no pow ers to
fund the legal costs of the tw o form er officers.

Home O ffice Circular 4 /1 9 9 8 on financial assistance to police officers involved
in legal proceedings w as issued after fu ll consultation w ith ACPO, the Police
S uperintendents' A ssociation, the Police Federation, and w ith the APA. If
ACPO, the other s ta ff associations, or the APA believe th a t the legislation needs
to be changed or the guidance needs to be review ed, I w ould of course consider
any points w hich they m ight w ish me to address. For the present, I have
nothing fu rth e r to add to the advice in HO Circular 4 /1 9 9 8 and I am afraid th a t I
cannot find grounds to ju s tify providing financial assistance to help m eet the
legal costs of the judicial review w hich you and the police au thority w ill incur. It
was entirely a local decision to seek judicial review . It seems reasonable th a t
the costs should be borne locally.

On 5 February 1999 the South Yorkshire Police Authority resolved that it does not have the
power to fund the legal costs of two retired police officers who face private prosecutions for
matters arising in the performance of their duties over nine years ago. The Authority acted
upon legal advice which differs from the legal advice I have received. I have applied to the
High Court in London for a judicial review of the Authority’s decision but unfortunately this will
cost both the Authority and the Force a substantial sum of money. This is a matter of
national importance and some urgency and I write to ask for central government financial
assistance to meet the legal costs involved. I will provide a little more detail in order to give
you a fuller picture.

Home Office Circulars have for many years provided advice and guidance to Police
Authorities on the way in which they should consider requests from police officers, serving or
retired, for financial assistance to pay for their defence against prosecutions, whether they be
brought by the Crown Prosecution Service or by private individuals. The very existence of
circulars implies that the Home Office perceive that the Police Authorities have the power to
pay these costs. That has always been my understanding and I am supported in that view
by the President of the Association of Chief Police Officers, Mr John Newing, the Secretary
of the Police Superintendents’ Association, Mr Des Parkinson, and the Secretary of the
South Yorkshire Federation, Mr Paul Middup (please see copy letters).

In 1998 the South Yorkshire Police Authority resolved to pay the legal costs incurred by
retired Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield and retired Superintendent Bernard Murray
in defending themselves against private prosecutions brought by Miss Ann Adlington,
solicitor to the Hillsborough Family Support Group (HFSG) for alleged offences arising from
the Hillsborough Stadium disaster of 15 April 1989. Miss Adlington wrote to the Police
Authority questioning the legality of such payments. The Authority took independent legal
advice which, in summary, said that the power was unclear and that, therefore, the Authority
should resolve to cease payments. If the Authority’s legal advice is correct then many Police
Authorities have been acting illegally and police officers have all been under a
misapprehension about this crucial piece of legislation.

                   Direct Dial No:
I attach a copy of the affidavit affirmed by Assistant Chief Constable Ian Daines in support of
my application to the High Court. In that affidavit ACC Daines explains the impact upon the
efficient functioning of the police service if the Police Authority's interpretation of the law were
to be upheld. My disagreement with the Police Authority is amicable and in good spirit and
the members only came to their decision with great reluctance.

My solicitor (Peter Metcalf of Hammond Suddards) advises me that the cost of the High
Court action may be as much a s [ o r my legal costs and                             for the Police
Authority. If the High Court rules that the Police Authority is correct in its interpretation of the
law then I anticipate that the three police staff associations will all press you for an urgent
amendment to legislation. They would seek retrospective legalisation of payments that have
been made in many cases over the years and legal power to make payments in future cases.

The legal advice received by the South Yorkshire Police Authority focuses upon Section 88
(Police Act 1996) which deals with awards and damages in civil actions caused by the acts
or omissions of police officers. The Act contains no reference to funding the cost of
defending criminal prosecutions brought against police officers. The Authority’s legal advice
is that the omission from the Act of specific reference to defence costs for criminal actions
must be construed as deliberate when read alongside the inclusion of paying the cost of civil
actions.

Because this matter is so much more important than the specific problems faced by Messrs
Duckenfield and Murray or the problems faced by South Yorkshire Police, I ask that you
favourably consider making a special payment toward the cost of these legal actions.

Thank you for your letter of 16 February.

I fully recognise the sensitivities of this case and I am grateful to you for
drawing the present issues to my attention. I have noted your decision to apply
for leave to challenge the police authority's decision that it has no powers to
fund the legal costs of the tw o form er officers.

Home Office Circular 4 /1 9 9 8 on financial assistance to police officers involved
in legal proceedings was issued after full consultation w ith ACPO, the Police
Superintendents' Association, the Police Federation, and w ith the APA. If
ACPO, the other staff associations, or the APA believe that the legislation needs
to be changed or the guidance needs to be reviewed, I would of course consider
any points which they might wish me to address. For the present, I have
nothing further to add to the advice in HO Circular 4 /1 9 9 8 and I am afraid that I
cannot find grounds to justify providing financial assistance to help m eet the
legal costs of the judicial review which you and the police authority will incur. It
was entirely a local decision to seek judicial review . It seems reasonable that
the costs should be borne locally.

 R V SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE AUTHORITY - AND- ANN ADLINGTON EX PARTE
 THE CH IEF CONSTABLE OF SOUTH YORKSHIRE

 Thank you tor your letter of 5 March and enclosures.

 The Home Office guidance which was in effect at the time when the police authority passed both the
 relevant resolutions was Circular 4/1998. The Circular makes it clear that section 88 ot the Police Act
 19% does not apply to criminal proceedings and that police authorities should seek their own legal
 advice on their powers to assist financially in such eases.

 In the circumstances the Home Office position remains as set out in my letter to you of 4 February.
 Moreover there is nothing we would wish to add to the reply of 8 March which I sent to Ms Adlington
 of the Hillsborough Family Support Group. eopy enclosed for information.

 i am sending a copy of this reply and enclosure to the Chief Constable ol South Yorkshire.

Dear Sirs

R v South Yorkshire Police Authority - and -
Ann Adlington ex-oarte The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police

Thank you for your letter of 4 February 1999 in response to ours of 1 February 1999 regarding
Home Office circulars 4/1998 and 77/87.

As you may be aware, leave was granted on 12 February 1999 to the Chief Constable of South
Yorkshire Police to make an application to the Crown Court for Judicial Review of the South
Yorkshire Police Authority's decision not to provide financial assistance to Messrs Duckenfield
and Murray in respect of the criminal proceedings brought against them. The application is due to
be heard between 22-24 March 1999.

We enclose William James Wilkinson's affidavit which has been submitted to the Court on behalf
of South Yorkshire Police Authority. You will note that Mr Wilkinson's affidavit considers inter
alia the terms of two Home Office circulars and the Parliamentary Questions and Answers relating
to this matter.

We think that the Court will be interested to know the Home Office's view on its circulars
regarding financial assistance in criminal proceedings.

In the circumstances, we wonder whether the Home Office may wish to reconsider its decision not
to be involved in any legal proceedings as previously intimated.

We look forward to receiving your response. Should you wish to discuss the matter further, please
contact Mr David Harlock on 0113 399 6136.

Yours faithfully

Dear Mr Wilkinson,

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR LEGAL COSTS

In February, 1998 I made application to the Police Authority for financial assistance
with legal costs in respect of the above and this was approved and communicated to
me in a letter dated 5th March. (Copy attached plus a letter of thanks to the
authority)

During the early part of this year representations were made to the Police Authority
that they may not have the power to provide financial assistance under Home Office
Circular 4/98 and legal advice suggested the position was unclear. On the 5th
February, 1999 the Police Authority, with some reluctance decided to seek
clarification and temporarily suspended payment of legal costs pending the outcome
of a Judicial Review. On 31st March the High Court ruled that the Police Authority
do have the power to provide financial assistance to police officers facing legal
proceedings.

I therefore request that the financial assistance provided previously be reinstated, with
confirmation of continuing assistance with regard to private prosecution. In addition,
as requested previously by my solicitors, I am seeking reimbursement of my costs in
maintaining the judicial review against the Director of Public Prosecutions which was
partially successful, insofar as the decision by the Director in relation to the
perverting the course of justice charge was quashed. Further, if necessary, financial
assistance for the judicial review in regard to South Sefton Chief Clerks refusal to tax
the costs of those previous proceedings.

In addition, an order for costs was made in the judicial review against the DPP
because the main decision was not overturned and I have been ordered to pay two
thirds of the DPP’s costs in that regard. On the basis of Counsel’s advice, considering
the previous decisions of the Director, the inquest verdict, the result of Lord Justice
Stuart-Smith’s Scrutiny and the comments of the judge, I understand that it was
appropriate for this challenge to be made.

Indeed this was borne out by the fact that as a result of the High Court decision the
DPP has discontinued the charge of attempting to pervert the course of justice on the
basis that there was no case to answer. This was the only charge alleging mala fides
against me. The remaining charges concern matters amounting to gross negligence
which will be vigorously defended. The High Court observed that the overall
challenge was highly arguable and had it been successful in all probability the whole
private prosecution with its obvious implications both personally and cost wise would
have been avoided.

I was employed as a police officer for 28 years rising to the rank of Chief
Superintendent until my retirement on medical grounds on the 10th November, 1991.
I had an unblemished disciplinary record and was commended for good police work
on three occasions. I only left the police service after the Police Surgeon had certified
I was medically unfit to perform the duties of a police officer and this was accepted
by the Chief Constable who approved of my medical retirement.




At the time of leaving the Police Service it was indicated I may face disciplinary
proceedings for alleged irregularities arising from my conduct at the football stadium
but these allegations would have been vigorously contested. I shall also contest the
present criminal allegations with the same determination.
I ask that the financial provision made previously be reinstated and the further
assistance be given as requested and would be grateful if you would consider this
matter at your earliest opportunity. The next hearing the the criminal case is on the
26th April when the magistrates will review the progress of the prosecution.

Yours sincerely

W J Wilkinson
Clerk to the South Yorkshire Police Authority
PO Box 37
Regent Street
Barnsley
South Yorkshire
S70 2PQ

*** April 1999

Dear Mr Wilkinson



I write as one o f the two former South Yorkshire Police Officers facing a private
prosecution over the 1989 Hillsborough disaster.

At all times I have carried out my duties as a Police Officer to the best of my ability.
I served the Police for 27 years and I have an unblemished record. Like every Police
Officer I believe that I am entitled to expect the support of my Chief Constable and
the Police Authority.

When it became known that HFSG were going to initiate these private prosecutions,
I was promised financial support. On 28 June I wrote to the Chief Constable asking
that the Police Authority be approached with a view to then reimbursing any legal
expenses that I may incur in defending myself. By letter of 29 June 1998 the
Authority referring to my request confirmed that it would meet such reasonable
expenses as I may incur in defending the proceedings instituted. I have relied upon
that support. It is a matter or record that:

a.     with reluctance the Police Authority sought to revoke the decision to grant
       funding;

b.     that the decision was solely based upon the legal advice that the position as to
       the power to grant funding was unclear at law;

c.     that consequent upon a Judicial Review, the law has been clarified and it has
       been confirmed that the Police Authority does have the power to fund the
       defence for private prosecutions for Police Officers in Judicial Review;

d.     that HFSG were told that as the prosecution they should not be seeking to
       interfere in the w ay in w hich the Defendants costs were being met.

Shortly before the 1988 FA Cup semi-final I was promoted and appointed
Superintendent of Hammerton Road Sub-division. I performed duty at the semi-final
in charge o f the Police Control Room and the event was seen as a successful event.
When the 1989 semi-final between identical teams was arranged, similar plans and
preparations were made. Everyone is aware o f the terrible events o f that day and
despite my best efforts on the day I am sorry that I personally could not do more to
minimise the deaths and the injuries that occurred.

I cooperated fully with the public enquiry that followed, the inquest and the criminal
enquiry. I answered all questions put to me. I accepted responsibility for the officers
under my command. I accepted the criticism in the Taylor report, the decision of
accidental death o f the Coroner’s Jury at the inquest and the decisions in 1990 and
subsequently o f the Director of Public Prosecutions that there was to be no prosecution
against any person.

I had upon my promotion to the rank of Superintendent followed the recommendation
of taking out and paying for a Legal Expenses Insurance Policy. This is recommended
because Superintendents are not eligible to any assistance through the Police
Federation. A claim, under this policy, was made to meet my private legal costs for
representation at the Coroner’s inquest. The inquest lasted much longer than anyone
had anticipated so that the total legal expenses cover became exhausted. Application
was made to the South Yorkshire Police Authority who agreed to indemnify me in
relation to the remainder o f my legal costs.

A charge was laid against me by the Police Complaints Authority. I was absolutely
confident that I could successfully defend this. I would refute any suggestion that
these charges would have been proved and led to my dismissal. In January 1992
whilst serving as a Superintendent I was informed that the charge against me had been
withdrawn. Although I was relieved that there were to be no disciplinary proceedings
I felt that I was also being denied the opportunity o f being able to clear my name.
This was particularly important to me as a Supervisory Officer who placed great
importance on maintaining the respect o f the Officers under my command. I refute
any suggestion that I took early retirement simply so as to avoid having to meet the
disciplinary charges. I was denied the opportunity o f clearing my name because the
charge was withdrawn.

Throughout this whole period of time I continued my employment and remained on
duty. From the day o f the disaster and throughout the whole o f the period o f time
when the various investigations were taking place I continued my employment and
remained on duty.
I have nothing but sadness and sympathy for the families and friends o f people who
lost their lives on that day particularly as so many were young people loved by those
around them and I can understand their anguish and determination. I can understand
their disappointment when the further scrutiny of evidence completed reaffirmed
previous decisions. It was following the Stuart-Smith scrutiny and the Home
Secretary’s acceptance that no further enquiry was called for nor any prosecution
justified that these private prosecutions were commenced. Notwithstanding the decision
o f the Director o f Public Prosecutions not to take over and discontinue the charges
against me, it is still the position o f the Crown Prosecution Service and Director of
Public Prosecutions that there is no realistic prospect of a conviction. This confirms
advices by two eminent QC’s in 1990 and the various other reviews and comes after
they have reviewed every bit o f information and “new evidence” which is suggested
by HFSG.

From the outset the prosecution has been led by Mr Alun Jones QC, a leading and high
profile Queen’s Counsel. He has been assisted by Junior Counsel. Mr Jones has
appeared at every hearing and indeed he was the person that prepared the submissions
to which bundles o f documents were annexed which led to the grant o f summonses.
The Solicitor acting for HFSG is called Ann Adlington. She is a full time paid
employee of Liverpool City Council. That Council has approved her secondment for
the duration of the case to HFSG Jo conduct the proceedings with her wage being met
by Liverpool City Council. HFSG held a pop concert at Anfield Stadium, Liverpool
which is said to have raised half a million pounds to fund the prosecution. They
continue to invite subscriptions and donations and have announced that they are
embarking on a further fund raising campaign.

HFSG have suggested that in reliance upon the agreement of the South Yorkshire
Police Authority to grant me financial support, I have been profligate with the amount
o f legal costs incurred. That is wholly untrue.

I do not believe that it is unreasonable to hope to be defended against these serious
charges with a similar level of legal expertise as the prosecution. Following my
 application in June 1998 for financial support from the South Yorkshire Police
 Authority and the approval of that support, I contacted the Solicitor who represented
 me at the inquest. He was aware of my own personal feelings, the previous issues and
 the background to the events. He has done everything to bring matters to a swift
 conclusion, but it now appears that a trial is to go ahead. My Solicitor has dealt with
 many of the issues himself, but equally it became obvious that Counsel were going to
 have to be retained. This was also done in consultation with and the approval o f the
 South Yorkshire Police Authority. In pursuance o f the attempt to bring the matter to
 a swift conclusion and as advised by Leading Counsel, application was made to the
 Director of Public Prosecutions for him to exercise his power under Section 6 (2) of
the Prosecution o f Offences Act 1985 to take over the private prosecution and then to
discontinue the prosecution under Section 23 (3) o f the Prosecution o f Offences Act
 1985. My Solicitors and Counsel effectively managed to hold the Magistrates’ Court
proceedings in abeyance pending the decision o f the Director o f Public Prosecutions.
It came as a great disappointment to me and to my legal advisors that the Director of
Public Prosecutions decided not to intervene and to allow the case to continue. It was
the strong view of Leading Counsel that this decision of the DPP was unreasonable and
perverse and he recommended that there should be an application for Judicial Review.
That decision was not crystallised until reasons had been obtained from the Crown
Prosecution Service as to the basis of their decision. In simple, every effort was made
to avoid any unnecessary costs. The result o f the Judicial Review was that a charge
against former Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield o f perverting the course of
justice was quashed. The remaining charges, however, were left untouched by the
Court albeit that they said that it was appropriate for the challenge to have been made
and the case was highly arguable. Expressed another way, if the decision o f the
Director o f Public Prosecutions had been to intervene and to have quashed the
proceedings, the Court would not have interfered with that decision.

I therefore seek as part o f the financial assistance, an indemnity for payment o f my
costs in relation to the application to seek Judicial Review o f the decision o f the
Director o f Public Prosecutions and including that part o f the Order for Costs made
against me in favour of the Director of Public Prosecutions because the main decision
was not overturned. No Order for Costs was made in favour o f HFSG.

At the very outset of the attempt by HFSG to prosecute me. Summonses were issued
in the South Sefton Magistrates’ Court. Ultimately those summonses were withdrawn
because they had in the view o f my Solicitors been the subject of an ill conceived
attempt to bring me before a Magistrates’ Court in Liverpool which did not have
jurisdiction. An Order for Costs, was made for payment of my lawyer’s fees out o f
Central Funds. The Clerk to the Justices at South Sefton has refused to tax the bill of
costs submitted. I seek financial assistance in relation to an application for Judicial
Review of the decision of the Clerk to the Justices at South Sefton. This application
is absolutely fundamental because if, as I hope, I am acquitted o f the charges against
me an Order could be made for payment o f all or part of my defence costs out of
Central Funds, from which I could then reimburse the Police Authority. If the South
Sefton decision is left unchallenged it would almost certainly preclude an ability to
have a bill o f costs taxed for payment out o f Central Funds in relation to the
proceedings presently in the Leeds Magistrates’ Court.

In summary therefore, I request:
1.     That financial assistance provided previously be reinstated and with
       confirmation o f continuing assistance without interruption from the date of
       initial authorisation in relation to all works in defending the prosecutions, those
       works to include the applications for Judicial Review and my part o f the
       liability for costs made in favour o f the Director o f Public Prosecutions in the
       Judicial Review proceedings.

2.     If so advised by Leading Counsel to make an application for Judicial Review
        in relation to a refusal of the Clerk to the Justices o f South Sefton to tax the
        bill o f costs for payment out o f Central Funds.

Although o f course this request for financial assistance is made by me personally, I
feel that Mr Duckenfield and myself have been singled out as easily identifiable
representatives o f South Yorkshire Police, effectively making it the South Yorkshire
Police that is on trial. The HFSG are using my presence in a Court o f Law to raise
issues such as conspiracy and suppression of evidence against the South Yorkshire
Police and they also include the West Midlands Police in this. There is a major public
relations onslaught continuously mounted through me at the Police. Thus for example,
in covering the proceedings in the High Court, the reporter who interviewed Assistant
Chief Constable Daines started his report with “the fight for justice goes on”. I believe
that there is a campaign to discredit the Police through me and to apportion guilt
before any trial or even any evidence has been heard, ignoring all other factors which
combined to culminate in this awful tragedy. By their efforts to remove financial
support for me from the South Yorkshire Police Authority, HFSG continue their tactics
to try to weaken my defence and in any event failing a conviction being recorded, to
ruin me financially and to have completely destroyed my health.




On that terrible day I was doing my duty as an Officer of the South Yorkshire Police
in good faith and to the best of my ability. I am innocent of the charges levelled
against me. I would hope and expect to continue to be supported by the South
Yorkshire Police Authority and in particular by the provision o f funding to meet my
defence costs incurred hitherto and on a continuing basis.

Yours sincerely



Mr B D Murray

TO: All South Yorkshire Police Authority Members

Dear

H ills b o r o u g h



1am writing to update members on progress since the last report to the Authority on 18
June.

The committal hearing is due to commence on 5 July at Leeds. As far as we know, up to
2 weeks has been allotted. The matter could be resolved, or the magistrate might refer it
to a full trial at a later date.

I reported on 18 June that Garretts had been progressing the various costs issues. A
costs draftsman has been engaged and has begun the process of reviewing costs
incurred up to 5 February. With the proviso that we reserve our right to recover any
excess following completion of the costs draftsman’s work, I have agreed to pay on
account 50% of the sums claimed for work between July 1998 and February 5th 1999 on
the proceedings in the Leeds Magistrates Court.

On the work since 6 February leading up to the current hearing, Garretts set out the basis
on which the Authority was recommended to agree any support in the papers to the 21
May meeting, and as I reported on 18 June both officers’ solicitors had accepted that
basis in principle. Further detail has been confirmed since 18 June, so that we now have
in position a framework constructed around:

(a) a maximum cost estimate
(b) an hourly rate for solicitors, leading and junior counsel
(c) limits on the numbers of fee-earners who will be paid for by the Authority at meetings,
   conferences, and hearings

The formal terms go into much more detail on fee levels and the level of legal support.
These have been negotiated between Garretts and the two solicitors over the last few
weeks, and the position is that formal letters confirming the basis agreed will shortly be
sent by the Authority to the two former officers.




                                                                        4
The terms also require the officers to take steps to recover costs and disbursements from
other sources, and provide protection for the Authority in the event of the case being
conducted unreasonably. Finally the Authority reserves the right to have its contribution
reviewed by a legal costs draftsman.

Taken as a whole, the package provides the Authority with a high degree of control over
its financial commitment. However, given the way in which the case is proceeding, it is
inevitable that there will be some uncertainty about the final figures i.e. while we can
specify precisely the number and seniority of legal advisers that we will fund and the
respective hourly rates, the actual hours worked will be influenced by the way in which
the prosecution develops. The Authority’s protection in that respect is through the quoted
maximum cost figure, and the subsequent right to bring in the costs draftsman.

A substantial part of the work was undertaken before the Authority agreed to make
support available, and work in connection with the committal has been ongoing while the
detailed terms have been under discussion. The solicitors for all parties have recognised
the situation, and the officer’s solicitors agreed in principle to the terms several weeks
ago. Unless anything unexpected occurs, therefore, the letters which finally pass
between the Authority and the former officers will be a formal statement of what has
previously been agreed.

The letter will however advise the officers that the terms on which the Authority will
contribute to the costs incurred are subject to the final approval of members. I want to
arrange that stage as early as possible. W e have an Authority meeting on 30 July, but if
Garretts and the solicitors have agreed the paperwork earlier, I may ask the Chairman to
call a special meeting of the Authority,

This letter is at this stage for information. I will incorporate the contents in my formal
report to the Authority.

Yours sincerely

 Dear Mr Wilkinson,


Re; SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE AUTHORITY Funding for the defence to
crim inal charges o f D avid Godfrey Duckenfield & Bernard D ean Murray

I write further to my letter, dated 27 January 1999, and your reply of 1 February 1999 in
respect of the above.

I note that, despite failing to answer most of my questions, in particular in relation to
controlling the likely expenditure of the set aside funds and ensuring value-for-money, the
Authority has again decided to fund substantial elements of the defence costs in these
cases. I know that this followed upon the decision of a judicial review which established
vires, but I am stilt concerned that this expenditure will not be subject to vigorous control and
scrutiny - as it would be if the Legal Aid fund were providing it.

I see from your minutes, dated 2 1 May 1999, that following legal advice from Garretts, some
controls on the expenditure have been adopted, but in my view these raise more questions
than they settle. I wonder tnerefore if I mignt have the answer to the following?

1. What is the fixed overall budget for maximum costs and what happens if it is breached?
2. What limits have been placed, if any, on the number of seniority and hourly rate of each
   fee earner and what are those limits?
3. What limits, if any, have been set on the numbers of legal advisers attending hearings? I
    understand that 10 (ten) were present at the committal.
4. What rules have been set in relation to Counsel and leading Counsels attendance and
   fees both in respect of when they are required and what rates are to be paid?
5. How regularly are the costs reported to the Authority and monitored? Is this done prior
   to the disbursement of moneys?
6. Are payments made on account of likely costs or paid in arrears after they are incurred
   and how quickly are they paid when a bill is presented?
                                                   R epresenting:
             A llerton, G rassen d ale, N eth erley, St. M a ry ’s, S peke, Valley and W ool ton Wards.    '
7. Does the requirement to use reasonable endeavours to recover costs from other sources
    require the recipients of funding t o : a) apply for legal aid and b) apply for assistance from
    the Police Superintendents' Association (PSA) or other professional association?
8. If not, what meaning does 'reasonable endeavours' have?
9. What experience does a costs draftsman have in the normal course of his duties for
    determining the reasonableness of costs incurred or the proper conduct of an action?
    His job is to draw up the bill for his client - it is for a district judge to determine what you
    are asking a costs draftsman to determine.
10. Why is there not a requirem ent for taxation rather than an option for it in order that
    value-for-money can be ascertained independently of the cosy and secret arrangement
    you have established?
11. Has any application been made for legal aid by Messrs Duckenfield and Murray or for
    assistance from the PSA to date? Will you require these steps to be taken?

I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.

Dear

HILLSBOROUGH: FUNDING OF DEFENCE COSTS

I enclose a copy of a further letter from Maria Eagle MP. It obviously requires some
response, but I do not intend to do so in detail. However the points listed in the letter give
an indication of the sort of issues which are going to be raised by the HFSG, and I would
value your views, particularly on items 7 to 11. Perhaps we could have a word when we
meet on 3 September.

Yours sincerely

Dear Ms Eagle

RE           FUNDING BY SOUTH YOR K SHIRE POLICE A UTHO RITY(“THE A UTHO RITY”
             FOR TH E C O STS OF DEFENCE TO C RIM IN AL CHARG ES OF MESSRS
             D UCKENFIELD AND M URRAY

Thank you for your letter dated 23 August 1999.

Before responding to the specific issues you raise, it may be helpful if I summarise the
current position of the Authority with regard to reimbursing the former officer’s costs of the                j
criminal proceedings:-                                                                      '

1.          In so far as costs from 27 February 1998 to 5 February 1999 are concerned, we
            have engaged a costs draftsman to review the former officers’ legal costs to assist
            our solicitors to advise us whether they were reasonably incurred, before making an
            offer to the former officers’ solicitors to settle those costs. If the costs cannot be
            agreed, they will be referred to the court for assessment.

2.          As a result of the decision of the Authority on 21 May 1999, an offer has been
            made to the former officers to reimburse their costs from 5 February 1999 to the
            end of the committal proceedings (20 July 1999), subject to detailed terms about
            the conduct of the matter and the maximum amount payable by the Authority by
            way of reimbursement. The agreement has not been formally concluded, although
            the terms have been agreed in principle.

3.           So far as the former officers’ costs of defending the action after committal are
             concerned no further support has to date been approved by the Authority and no
             application is currently under consideration.

                                                                                                 Cont’d ...

Maria Eagle MP
House of Commons
LONDON
S W 1A 0A A
The specific issues which you raise relate to costs incurred by the former officers between
5 February 1999 and the end of the committal proceedings. In so far as your questions
relate to precise charges or charge out rates of individual firms, that information has been
provided to us on a confidential basis, and I am therefore not at liberty to disclose that
information. Details of the precise resources available to the defence are similarly
regarded as confidential.

In relation to reimbursement of legal costs incurred by the two former officers between
5 February 1999 and the close of committal, given the constraints on disclosure referred
to above, I would therefore respond as follows:-

1.     There is a maximum budget set for both former officers’ legal costs and the
       Authority has not obligation to meet the former officers’ costs or disbursements
       above the set budget.

2.     The terms on which the former officers have been offered support for their legal
       expenses specifies the seniority of each member of the legal team engaged on the
       assignment, and hourly rates for each of them. Our advisers have confirmed that,
       in their opinion, these hourly rates represent a fair charge for a case of this type
       and complexity.

3.     There are also controls on the number of legal advisers whose costs will be met by
       the Authority for attending meetings, consultations, conferences with Counsel and
       court hearings. You should not assume that the number is 5 for each former
       officer.

4.     Both the level of representation by Counsel at hearings, and the rate to be paid to
       them for hearings and refreshers are controlled by the terms of which funding has
       been offered to the former officers.

5&6.   Costs are required to be reported to the Authority regularly but no precise time
       periods for reporting were specified as the regularity required depended on the
       level of activity over any particular period. No payments are made prior to reporting
       or prior to the costs being incurred. Bills presented for payment of the costs
       incurred have been considered by our legal advisors and costs draftsman. Interim
       payments of part of the cost claimed have been made following receipt of bills
       pending final determination.

7&8.   The direct answer to your question 7 is no. The issue of Legal Aid and possible
       support from the Police Superintendent’s Association was specifically raised at the
       meeting of the Authority on 21 May 1999, when support for the former officer’s legal
       expenses up to committal was approved. The Authority took its decision having
       regard to the level of contributions which would be required from the former
       officers, were they to rely on Legal Aid, the fact that any support from the Authority
       would be included by the Legal Aid Board in assessing the former officer’s
       resources and would therefore correspondingly reduce the level of net funding

                                                                                    Cont’d
       available to the officers from Legal Aid, and evidence of the limited ability of the
       Police Superintendent’s Association to support the former officers’ legal expenses.
       The ultimate decision to support the former officers’ costs was therefore taken in
       the knowledge that this was likely to make them ineligible for Legal Aid and that
       further support from the Police Superintendent’s Association was unlikely.

       The obligation to use reasonable endeavours to recover costs and disbursements
       incurred from other sources, at the end of the proceedings, was therefore directed
       principally at possible costs awarded from central funds or against the prosecution,
       if the former officers were found not guilty.

9&10 It is within the normal duties of a costs draftsman not only to prepare bills of cost for
     the Court, but to review bills of costs prepared to support claims against his/her
     client and advise on the extent to which these should be challenged as well as
     representing clients at costs hearing. The Authority took the view that experience
     of having bills of costs he/she has prepared assessed by the court, challenging the
     reasonableness and legitimacy of expenditure incurred by other parties and
     appearing at costs hearing is directly relevant to the tasks the Authority would
     require the costs draftsman to perform in this case. Whilst the right to have a
     solicitor’s bill assessed by the High Court is always open to the Authority, the
     Authority will decide whether to pursue this right in the light of advice from the costs
     draftsman it has retained and its legal advisers. Apart from the issue of whether it
     is consistent with court rules, particularly in the light of the recent W oolf reforms, to
     require the High Court to assess a bill which is not in dispute, or which could be
     resolved between the parties by discussion, the Authority would also need to take
     into account exposure to court fees and costs on the taxation itself, before pursuing
     this course of action.

11.   This is a question which should really be addressed to Mr Duckenfield and
      Mr Murray’s legal advisers. My understanding, however, from the evidence
      disclosed in the course of the judicial reviews is that limited financial support was
      sought and made available by the Police Superintendent’s Association for the
      former officers to be represented in the Judicial Review of the decision of the
      Authority to revoke funding, but that no support has been made available for the
      criminal proceedings.

      In relation to Legal Aid, I understand an application to the Clerk to the Justices was
      made on behalf of Mr Murray, and a preliminary means determination conducted by
      the Legal Aid Board to indicate the contribution from income and from capital which
      would be required from him, were the application to be granted. The Clerk to the
      Justices refused to approve funding, however, until the Authority had reached a
      decision on providing support to the former officers and the application was
      therefore left in abeyance. In the light of this, I understand that no formal
      application was made by Mr Duckenfield.

                                                                                     Cont’d .
       The Legal Aid Board regard themselves as funders of last resort, and accordingly
       will not determine a legal aid application whilst the possibility of alternative funding
       remains outstanding. Furthermore, any funding made available by the Authority
       would be treated as part of the applicant’s resources, and accordingly would not
       reduce the contribution from income and capital required by the Legal Aid Board
       from the applicant. As the size of the potential contribution, and the likely financial
       effects on Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray, was one of the factors leading the
       Authority to provide the support offered up to committal, then it would not be the
       Authority’s intention to require the former officers to seek Legal Aid in respect of
       this period.

I hope that this is of assistance to you.

Yours sincerely

The Rt Hon Jack Straw MP
Home Office
Queen Anne’s Gate
Westminster
LONDON S W 1 H 9 A T

Dear

HILLSBOROUGH

I am following up a matter raised with you earlier this year by David Blunkett MP. He
wrote in the context of the private criminal prosecutions brought by the HFSG, and the
South Yorkshire Police Authority’s decision that, given the circumstances of this incident,
it should properly meet the defence costs of the two former officers out of Police Authority
funds. He suggested that there might be a case for Home Office to provide funding to
support the Authority’s costs.

The Authority’s present decision to fund was restricted to the proceedings up to committal
stage - July 1999. In view of the outcome, I envisage that the Authority will receive within
the next month or so a further application for the two former officers to fund the defence
costs for the trial itself, which is scheduled for June 2000.

The case has implications extending beyond South Yorkshire. This was a central issue in
the Judicial Review earlier this year which established that Police Authorities do have the
necessary powers. The morale of the South Yorkshire force is at stake. However, as
Chief Constable Mike Hedges has said publicly, it is vital that all police officers know,
when they are faced with split second decisions to make in pressured circumstances, that
their Police Authority will stand behind them and provide support if they act in good faith
but things go wrong, as happened in April 1989.

While the Authority was unanimous in its decision to support the officers in the committal
proceedings, it was at the same time mindful of the financial implications. Expenditure to
date has been met from reserves, but ultimately the costs will impact directly on policing
budgets or indirectly through the need to reinstate reserves.

The Authority’s budgets are also being squeezed by Hillsborough costs from another
direction. The public liability insurance limit of £8.5m was reached many years ago, but
there remains a number of outstanding claims. So far the Authority has set aside in its
accounts nearly £5m for additional liabilities which are likely to arise when claims are
settled. Recently, our insurance advisers have informed us of reassessment of life
expectancies for two permanently incapacitated victims. These cases alone will require
the Authority to set aside a further £2.6m to meet potential liabilities. If this is raised via
the precept it could add around 13% to Council Tax.

I have given you the broad background to our situation. My purpose in writing personally
to you is to request a meeting with Home Office to discuss an application from this
Authority for financial support towards the costs it is facing on Hillsborough related
matters.

On hearing from you, I will arrange for a more detailed paper to be prepared by the Clerk
and Treasurer and the Chief Constable.

Yours sincerely

There are four elements:

(a)      Costs in connection with the initial enquiries in 1989/1990. The Home Office paid the bulk
         of these costs, leaving South Yorkshire to find approximately £1m.

(b)      Ongoing costs in connection with public enquiries, insurance claims, and scrutinies
         between 1989 and 1999.

(c)      Costs in connection with providing legal support to former officers. Support was provided
         by the Authority at the inquest in 1990. It was made available again in 1998 when HFSG
         announced its intention to take out private prosecutions.

(d)      Public liability insurance costs arising out of claims of victims of the disaster. The
         Authority’s insurers were responsible for the first £8.5m, and have met associated legal
         costs in connection with the settling of claims.
3      Former Officers’ Defence Costs

3.1    Powers

       The March 1999 Court case considered whether Police Authorities had powers under the
       Police Act and the Local Government Act to meet such costs. Three High Court judges,
       led by Lord Justice Laws, ruled that they did, but that each case must be considered on its
       merits.

       The two main considerations which the Authority has taken into account are as follows:

       (a)       In the light of its duty to secure the provision of an effective and efficient police
                  force, the extent of its obligation to defend former officers in a situation where the
                  Authority believes that they acted in good faith.

       (b)       Following from that, the impact on morale, confidence and operational
                  effectiveness of police officers in South Yorkshire and other forces across the
                  country if they do not have the knowledge that their Authority and Force will
                  support them if they act in good faith but things go wrong.

       A number of other Forces and Authorities - including the Met Police, have provided
       financial support to officers. The implications of the March 1999 ruling affected every
       Police Authority.

3.2   Costs

       The Authority set aside £0.5m in its reserves in 1997 to cover costs arising out of the
       Scrutiny. This was subsequently earmarked to meet the defence costs and the Authority’s
       costs. Following the 21 May decision to provide support up to the end of the Committal
       proceedings, this sum was expected to be committed. A report to the Authority on 10
       September provided a revised estimate of £0.95m. This includes nearly £0.3m costs
       incurred by the Authority and the Chief Constable. Of the remainder, approximately
       £0.1m is expected to be recovered from the VAT inspector, and negotiations with the
       solicitors could produce further reductions. In the light of the forecasts, the Authority
       agreed to set aside a further £0.5m.

       The Authority has not entered into any committments beyond July 1999.                Further
       applications from the two former officers are awaited and will be considered in detail if and
       when they are received.

4     In s u ra n c e   C o s ts



The Authority’s Public Liability insurance cover was £8.5m in 1989. Insurance cover ran out in
the mid 1990’s, and the Authority has been forced to make separate provision in its accounts for
uninsured costs, a sum of £4.5m has already been set aside. Recent advice from insurers
suggests that this sum will need to be increased by a further £2.6m following medical review of
life expectancies of severely disabled victims.


5     H o m e   O ffic e    S u p p o rt



Support was provided to the Authority in the initial enquiries in 1989/1990. No applications have
been made since. The Home Secretary has powers to provide specific assistance to Police
Forces and Authorities. He has recently exercised this power on issues such as the cost of
policing the Eclipse Celebrations in Devon and Cornwall.

I am writing with reference to the letter to the Home Office of 10th
September requesting a meeting with the authority to discuss financial
assistance from the Home Office to support the defence costs of former
Officers Duckenfield and Murray in their private prosecution over their
role in the Hillsborough disaster.

As you will be aware I have been concerned for some time over the impact
these costs are having in draining reserves - which could otherwise have
gone to useful improvements to policing in the area, and now as you point
out in your letter, impacting directly on policing budgets.

From the minutes of the SYPA meeting on 21st May, and your letter I
gather that as things stand at present, the costs of the present legal
proceedings will be met either by the already bereaved families in
Merseyside, if Duckenfield and Murray are exonerated, or by the public of
South Yorkshire through their precept to the Police Authority.

I am not at all clear as to the financial exposure of Mr Duckenfield and Mr
Murray, either for preparing their case, or in the event of the charges
against them being upheld. Have any applications been made for financial
assistance - either to the Police Superintendents Association or to the
Legal Aid Board.

I suspect that the public would not support the whole costs falling on the
public purse.

Finally I am unclear, and somewhat sceptical that the South Yorkshire
Police Authority is in the best position to control the legal costs of
defending the officers in the case, because of it’s agreed policy at present
to fund Duckenfield and Murray’s defence at all costs.

If there is any suggestion of financial assistance from main stream Home
Office funds, (Now that an application has been made to Jack Straw to
assist with the funding from the Home Office budget) I believe that an
independent arbitrator should be brought in to monitor both the level of
costs, how they are controlled, and how and from whom they are met both
during and following judgement.

Mrs H Jackson MP
House of Commons
Westminster
LONDON
SW 1AOAA

Dear Mrs Jackson

HILLSBOROUGH

Councillor Swindell has asked me to reply to your letter of 23 Septem ber. The position at
present is that the Authority agreed on 21 May to fund the defence costs to the conclusion
of the committal proceedings in July. With the advice of Garretts and the costs draftsman
appointed by them, a tightly prescribed format was drawn up which limits the Authority’s
commitment on the number of legal advisers, hourly rates and so on. Both officers
accepted those terms.

In the original offer of support the Authority reserved the right to review the
reasonableness of costs. The cost draftsman has been employed also to reassure the
Authority on that issue. Full information has been provided by the officers’ solicitors, and
following completion of the cost draftsman’s work, the Authority will be seeking reductions
in claims where appropriate.

As you will know, the committal hearing ruled that there was a case for the officers to
answer. This is scheduled for June 2000. The officers are pursuing the issue of abuse
of process. The Authority may receive further applications for funding to the trial. They
will have to be considered afresh, with full advice on legal and financial implications. At
this stage the Authority’s commitment does not extend beyond July 1999.

It is inevitable that there will be financial implications. Subject to resolving outstanding
queries arising from the cost draftsman’s work, expenditure to date is expected to
approach £1m. This includes the Police Authority’s and the Chief Constable’s costs,
which together amount to nearly £0.3m. While that is covered by reserves, and there is
no direct affect on policing, reserves can only be used once.

Turning to the other points raised in your letter, Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray have at
various stages approached the Legal Aid Board, to cover themselves in the situation that
the Police Authority declined to make support available. It is in their interest to do so. If
legal aid had been made available at any point it would have required substantial financial
contributions by the two former officers from their capital and their income; legal aid rules
do not for instance allow the Authority simply to meet the legal aid contribution - it is all or
nothing.
 It is of course open to the officers to meet the costs of additional hearings or extra
specialist support over and above the limits supported by the Police Authority. I am not
aware of any discussions between the officers and the Superintendents’ Association,
though I believe the Association is small and does not have access to substantial funds.
The Authority is itself discussing the whole position with the Association at the same time
as we are approaching the Home Secretary. On the latter point you will see from my
briefing note that we have a second - more substantial - concern on Hillsborough, which is
the insurance liabilities. W e are discussing this with the Home Secretary at the
forthcoming meeting which is being arranged with Charles Clarke.

Your comments on control of costs are very relevant. This was one of the issues which
took considerable time at the 21 May meeting. The Authority was in fact seeking not to
make a commitment “at all costs”. The agreement drawn up makes clear the Authority’s
commitment. I don’t pretend it is easy - legal cases are to some extent open ended; it is
possible to control numbers of advisers and hourly rates, but not the hours, which are
dependent on the way that the case proceeds and the tactics of the prosecution.
However, we have since January 1999 appointed Garretts, who are a leading national
firm of lawyers, to provide independent advice to the Authority. They in turn have
appointed legal draftsmen. The Authority is acting specifically on the advice of those two
professional advisers. In that respect I believe there is a necessary degree of
independence.

I hope this is helpful. I will let MPs know the outcome of the discussions between the
Authority and the Home Secretary.

Yours sincerely

HILLSBOROUGH PROSECUTIONS

As I explained briefly when we spoke, I am writing to the Association on behalf of the
Chairman of the Authority, Clarence Swindell.

I think you will be fam iliar with the background. Following the Divisional Court ruling on
Police Authority powers earlier this year, the Authority reconfirmed its previous support
and agreed to make further financial support available to ex-Chief Superintendent David
Duckenfield and ex-Superintendent Bernard Murray for the committal hearing in July
1999. The Authority has not yet met to consider whether it is in a position to make further
support available, and awaits further applications from the two former officers in
connection with the trial which is scheduled for June 2000.

In making its original decision, the Authority took into account that the former officers were
on operational duty at the time of the incident. The Authority also took into account the
conclusions of the inquest and the various reviews of evidence, none of which have
caused the DPP at any time between 1989 and 1998 to instigate criminal proceedings.
The issue, however, goes wider than South Yorkshire. W hile the Divisional Court’s
deliberations earlier this year related to a decision by South Yorkshire Police Authority,
the issue which was at stake was the powers of all Police Authorities to provide support to
officers and former officers facing private criminal prosecutions in relation to their actions
while on duty. W e were aware of a number of Police Authorities who had provided or
were in the process of providing support in similar circumstances. Had the Court not
confirmed that the necessary powers existed, it would have had potential implications for
every police officer in the country.

Attempts are being made by the two former officers’ solicitors to have the proceedings
quashed as an ‘kbuse of process” on the grounds that 10 years has elapsed since the
incident, and that the level of public comment on the matter precludes a fair trial. If those
attempts fail, South Yorkshire Police Authority will almost certainly be asked to make
further support available. In considering such an application, members of the Authority
will be conscious that this issue has ramifications for the Police service as a whole, and
whether that might provide a basis for other parties with an interest in the principle at
stake to consider a degree of joint funding.

I have made an approach to the Home Secretary, and am making contact with the Police
Federation as well as yourself. The Chairman would be grateful if you would agree to
meet with him informally to explore whether there is any scope for a co-ordinated
approach.

Yours sincerely

HILLSBOROUGH PROSECUTIONS

I am writing to the Federation on behalf of the Chairman of the Authority, Clarence
Swindell.   I would have liked to have had a word with you before sending the ietter.
However, your secretary explained that you would be at the Conference for much of this
week so I am sending the letter and will speak to you at the earliest opportunity.

I think you will be fam iliar with the background. Following the Divisional Court ruling on

and agreed to make further financial support available to ex-Chief Superintendent David

      Dear David

      South Yorkshire Police Asthority

      Further to my letter of 1 November 1 think it would be helpful for you to see the previous
      advice provided by Bill Clegg subsequent to the committal, supporting the foreshadowed
      further approach on behalf of Mr Duckenfield, We had intended to make this available in
      the context of a full submission in regard to future conduct but clearly it is important for
      your client to be aware of this advice now.
                                                                                                        *
      Yours sincerely

                                                NOTE




1

                    $his note is written for the benefit of the South

               Yorkshire Police Authority and represents my views on

               the merits of the defence of Mr. Duckenfield to the-
                                                      f
               two charges he has been committed for trial on.




                     It     was    obviously      a       disappointment    that      the

               magistrate found that a prima facie case existed and

               furthermore declined to stay the proceedings on the

                ground that the continued prosecution of the defendant

                amounted to an abuse of the process of the court.                             I

                propose to consider each of these separate submissions

                in turn.          Annexed to this          note is a copy of the

               • skeleton    submissions       submitted       to    the   magistrates

                          these submissions ought to be refined and advanced

                          afresh before the trial judge.                            As can be seen from

                          the    skeleton           the    submissions are advanced under a

                          number       of    separate           heads         of   which    I believe          two

                          warrant some further explanation in this note.




                                  The       submission              advanced        on     behalf      of      Hr.

                          Duckenfield that the prosecution contravened Article

                          6 of the European Convention of Human Rights requires

                          further explanation.                      This submission was dealt with
                          »                                                                                          *
                          at page 24 - 25 of the judgement when the magistrate

                          held having reviewed some of the European authorities

                                   "The principles laid, down in these authorities

                                  therefore are no different,                         in my view, to the

                                  principles              1 have       to decide           in the    abuse      of

                                   process application according to U.K. laws."




                                   With due respect to the magistrate this is not a

                           correct          statement          of     the      law.        One     fundamental

                           difference exists between the domestic law on abuse of

                           process         and the protection a citizen receives from

                                                                          2

                      Article 6.



                                Under domestic law the burden is on the accused

                       to prove on the balance of probabilities that he has

                       suffered prejudice by reason of the delay.                                   Under

                       Article             6     no    evidential          burden   is   placed     on         a

                       defendant at all and the existence of prejudice is not •

                       a necessary ingredient of a "breach".                             The Convention

        )              provides

                                  "in the determination of hie civil rights and

                                 obligations or of any criminal charge against

                                 him,          everyone is.entitled to a fair and public

                                  hearing             within       a   reasonable         time     by      an

                                  independent and impartial tribunal established by

                                  law."
                                                               \




                                  The Convention does not require a defendant to

                        prove prejudice to his case by reason of the delay as

                        U.K. Domestic law does and this crucial distinction

                        was not recognised by the magistrate.

                     publicity in the case.             It wa6 submitted that the

                     effect of the media coverage was such that a fair                                ;

                     trial of the defendants is not possible.                            Although

                     rejecting this submission the magistrate did describe

                     the coverage as

                          "widespread/           extremely             voluminous             and

                          unrelenting"

                     and concluded that,

       1                  "I do accept that the media coverage in this case

                          ie bound to create some prejudice against these

                          two defendants/ more so against Mr. Duckenfield

                          than Mr. Murray."
                                                                               f                      *



                          The    assessment of the degree                 of    prejudice       is

                     obviously a personal one and the trial judge would be

       I             perfectly    entitled to       conclude        that       the       prejudice

                     found by the magistrate was such that no fair .trial

                     was possible.




                          I have no doubt that a strong case exists that

                     this prosecution amounts to an abuse of the process of

                     the court, whether in fact the trial judge will come

                     to the same conclusion is difficult to assess.                              He

                        will need to balance the fight to bring a private

                        prosecution         in    circumstances       where       the      state      has

                        declined       to      prosecute     against    the        rights        of    an

                        individual          to      a    fair       trial        not       brought      in .

                        circumstances of oppression and not prejudiced by pre-

                        trial publicity.




                               it is clearly impossible to predict the decision

                        of the trial judge/ grounds certainly exist that could

                        justify a decision in favour of Mr. Duckenfield while

                        in one sense the high profile nature of the case may

                        be    a       subconscious         influence        in     favour        of         a
                                                                                       i                        _


                        prosecution.




                               I am certain that grounds exist to support an

      l                 application to stay, many cases in the past have been

                        stayed on grounds less strong than those in this case.

                        Whether in fact the trial judge will actually order

                        the proceedings be stayed is a matter of speculation

                        but must be evenly balanced.




                                In one sense I am more confident that the trial

                     of the prosecution case.        This is a decision that does

                     not depend on the exercise of judicial judgement as                          ;

                     the necessary legal ingredients which make up a priina

                     facie case.



                             In ray judgement the Crown at committal failed to

                     prove a prima facie case against Mr. Duckenfield and

                     the magistrate erred in law in committing them for

                     trial.

                             The charge is one of involuntary manslaughter and

                     as was stated in the leading case of R. v. A4oroako_99

                                 Arguably Mr. Duckenfield owed a duty of care

                      feo all those who attended the match and the standard

                      of       care    that   he    owed      was       that     of    a     "reasonably

                      competent         commander".            The      important          question     is

                      whether the Crown can prove a breach of the standard


  t                   of eare owed.




                                 The    causes      of    the         disaster        were    many     and

                      included a dangerous build-up of supporters in the
                      area outside the stadium prior to #the match,                                   poor

                      crowd control in Leppings Lane itself,                               insufficient

                      police/stewards              to    control           the        queue     at     the

                      turnBtiles,          poor or non-existent                  signs       inside    the

                      ground, a dangerous crash barrier on the terrace, no

  0                   separate         monitoring        of       the     individual          pens     and

       ^              insufficient egress from the                       pens either, laterally

                      or onto the pitch.

                      suggested by the prosecution to be a result                                     of a

                       failure of Mr. Duckenfield to provide a "reasonable"

                  standard of care to the supporters.



                         With hindsight it is easy to see how the police

                  plan    for    the match was defective and it may                              have

                  fallen below the necessary standard required under our

                  civil law.        If it did thia was a fault of the plan

                  generally      and     was    not     the       responsibility           of     Mr.

                  Duckenfield.          A person in command is entitled in law

                  to delegate responsibility to someone he reasonably

                  assumes is competent.               Here the plan was prepared by

                  others and Mr. Duckenfield acted reasonably in law in

                  accepting the plan as a basis for policing the match.
                                                                                   /

                  Indeed    it    was     not    suggested         at     committal        by     the

                  prosecution that he had been negligent in following

                  the plan or allowing the build-up of fans outside to

                  reach     a    dangerous        level.            This         area    was      the

                  responsibility of another senior officer who had been

                  delegated the task of policing that area.




                          The    immediate       cause       of    the    disaster         was     the

                  decision       by M r . Duckenfield to open                     Gate     C which

                  resulted in an influx of supporters most of who went

                     overcrowding and consequent, deaths in each pen«



                             The order to open the gates was made following

                     the receipt of a radio message by the control room

                     stating         that    unless the gates were opened someone

                     would die.             Against this background the prosecution

                     did not suggest that the opening of the gates was

                     negligent and based the case against Mr. Duckenfield

                     on the proposition that he ought to have prevented the

                     supporters from entering the tunnel after the gate had

                     been opened and that it was negligent of him not to

                     have done so.
                                                                                  /




                             This raises the issue of whether a reasonably

                     competent commander ought to have foreseen that by

                     opening the gate he would cause gross overcrowding in
                        t
                     the central pens.               It must be emphasised that it was

                      never suggested that he foresaw any danger to anyone

                      (this is not/ of course, a defence to the charge, the

                      relevant question is whether a reasonably competent

                      commander ought to have foreseen the risk and taken

                      action accordingly).

                          Normally in a case of involuntary manslaughter

                     the court will be assisted by expert evidence, from .

                     for example a doctor, who will give evidence of what
                                          p


                     in certain circumstances a reasonably competent doctor

                     ought to do.         In this case no expert evidence is being

                     called   by     theprosecution.                It    follows      that     the

                     assessment      of         whether      the hypothetical        reasonably

                     competent commander ought to have foreseen the danger

       ^             must be based on the other evidence in the case.                           This

                     all points one way and in favour of Mr. Duckenfield.

                     Not only did he not foresee the danger but none of the

                     other officers in the control box did who all had more
                                                                                                       ♦

                     experience      of         the   stadium than        him, 'nor     did     the

                     officer requesting the opening of the gate6, nor the

                     officer who opened them, nor any of the officers who

                     had the responsibility of policing that area of the
       ►             ground   and         could       hear     the       radio   transmissions

                     requesting the opening of the gate and                                latter

                     complying with the request.




                          In my opinion there is no evidence that can prove

                     that a reasonably competent police commander ought to

                     have foreseen danger to those in the central pens when

Dear                      i

Many thanks again for handling things on Friday so efficiently. Looking ahead, there are
a few matters relating to costs:-

(i)         it might not be a problem in future as there will possibly not be any further hearings
            after January and before June, but if the Solicitors incur extra costs that they
            haven’t informed us of, can they be asked to supply a regular schedule, not just
            when we put together the next application (I think this was the problem last week -
            the figures that the Chairman had first looked at related just to the direct cost of the
            2 hearings. W hen the totals were put to g e th e r, of course, it brought in all the other
            preparatory work from July up to now.)

(ii)         Is it possible to tighten up the costs agreement any more? Members didn’t go for
             any sort of cash limit on Friday but nevertheless I am wary of HFSG’s constant
             references to outspending them, and it’s in our interest to keep a very tight rein. Is
             it feasible to pay strictly in line with Legal Aid limits, or is that what it already
             provides?

(iii)        I assume we are retaining the costs draftsman. Can he look very closely at July -
             December costs, as they do look high, especially as they have largely all been
             incurred by the solicitors with no guarantee (until Friday) of funding.

I don’t need a reply. Could we follow up next time we have a progress meeting, but could
you keep the options open when you write to the Solicitors.

Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Wilkinson

Re: Hillsborough com pensation payments

Further to your letter concerning, I enclose the reply from Home Office Minister, Charles
Clarke.

My apologies for the delay in forwarding this. However, I am pleased to see that Ministers
recognise the excessive nature of your situation and Mr Clarke is considering some form
of financial assistance.

Please keep me informed of any progress.

Many thanks for bringing this important matter to my attention.

Yours sincerely

Thank you fo r your letter o f 11 November enclosing the letter o f 3 November
from the Clerk o f the South Yorkshire Police A u th o rity about the escalating
costs o f com pensation payments fo r victim s o f the Hillsborough tragedy.

As you know , I met representatives o f the police authority and the Chief
Constable on 2 November to discuss the costs the police authority continue to
face in respect o f the Hillsborough disaster and the ir request th a t w e consider
providing them w ith some additional financial assistance.

 I have looked at the A u th o rity 's request fo r support in respect o f the personal
injury claims from victim s, w hich it is estim ated could be as much as £8 m illion.
Given the circum stances o f the costs involved, w hich are in excess o f the
A u th o rity's insurance lim it, I have indicated to the A u th o rity th a t I w ould be
prepared to consider w hether w e may be able to o ffe r some lim ited form of
financial assistance.

I have asked my officials to obtain further inform ation from the police authority
on the breakdown o f the costs to enable me to reach a decision. I hope to be
able to let the A u th o rity know our decision early in the New Year.

SPECIAL PAYMENT FO R HILLSBOROUGH ADDITIONAL COSTS

The Police Authority and the Chief Constable met Mr Clarke on 2 November 1999 to discuss how the
additional costs of the Hillsborough disaster were beginning to affect the ability of the South Yorkshire
Police to maintain policing at a level they would like. Mr Clarke undertook to consider what could be
done to assist the force.

Following this meeting and the additional information you have since provided, the Home Secretary and
Mr Clarke have considered very carefully the issue of the additional costs the force has already incurred
and potentially may still incur in the next year or so. I am pleased to inform you that the Home
Secretary has approved a special payment of grant of £1 million. This is being made to the South
Yorkshire Police Authority in respect of the extra expenditure that is being incurred for compensation
payments to victims of the disaster.

This payment will be made by the Home Office under the general provisions o f the Appropriation Act
on 31 March and should be in the bank account of the South Yorkshire Police Authority on Monday 3
April. In the course o f 2000 you wiii be asked to complete a special grant claim form to show that the
payment has been used for the purpose for which it has been made.

This payment does not commit the Home Secretary to further special payments. However, over the
next few months we will be asking Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary to assess the impact on
the force of the need to set aside part of its budget to accommodate the potential for further
compensation payments of around £6 million, as and when they may arise.

On the specific issue o f the Home Office providing financial assistance to the Authority in support of
the two former officers' defence costs I should like to remind you of the Minister's previous decision on
this. He is not prepared to provide any support for these costs. It was the Authority's decision to meet
the officers' legal costs, and while we fully understand your reasons for reaching such a decision it is the
Department's position that having made the decision it should be for the Authority to find the money.
Mr Clarke was pleased that his discussions with Ms Primarolo (HM Paymaster General) obtained a
change of heart by the Inland Revenue in respect of their pre-transaction ruling about the payment of tax
on the two officers' defence costs.

A copy of this letter has been sent to the Chief Constable.

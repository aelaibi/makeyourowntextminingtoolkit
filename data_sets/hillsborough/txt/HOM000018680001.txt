Dear Sir,

RE:   PART II LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR'S INQUIRY

I confirm that it is not the intention of the Hillsborough Solicitors' Group
to seek either representation or the opportunity to give oral evidence in
respect of Part II of the Inquiry but we are collating any comments that
clients of the Group would like to have taken into consideration.

I wrote to members of the Group asking for their clients' comments at the
conclusion of the first part of the Inquiry. Comments are still ftrickling
in and I would be grateful if you could let me know whether any "time table"
has yet been given and inparticular whether there is a final date after
which no written material will be considered.

I look forward to hearing from you.

All good wishes.

Yours sincerely,




MISS E M STEEL

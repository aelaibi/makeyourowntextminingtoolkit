MICHAEL GODDARD



Police Sergeant 616



I    have    been a   member   of    FI   Sub   Division,   for   some   eight    years and

throughout that time have worked football duties as a Serial Sergeant, the

Police Room Sergeant and for the last four years have worked as the Police

ControlSergeant       at       the    Sheffield     Wednesday     Football       Ground    at

Hillsboroughunder the command of Superintendent Freeman (now retired)                     and

Superintendent Murray.

I performed this duty for the 1987 Semi-Final Coventry v Leeds, the 1988

Semi-Final Liverpool v Notts Forest and was again in the Control Box for

the 1989 Semi Final between Liverpool and Notts Forest.                  In addition to

the three above mentioned games I have performed the same duties at ALL

the big matches held at Hillsborough over the past four years.

My duties at FI Sub Division are as supervision of Community Constables

and I share an office with Inspector Sewell.            Therefore I am very aware of

the planning and-requirements necessary to Police matches at Hillsborough.

I have       also performedserial duties at all the other League grounds in

South Yorkshire.

On Saturday 15 April 1989, I commenced duty at 8.00am in Ground Control

which is situated in an elevated box between the South and West Stands and

which overlooks the Leppings Lane terraces.

Present at this time was PC 1035 Ryan with whom I have worked this duty

for the last four years.            The two other members of the Control Box team

are PC      1370 Bichard and Superintendent Murray and the four of us have

worked together for the full season.              There are specific duties allotted

    to the members of the Control Box, I control all the radio messages.                   PC

 Ryan has the tannoy and telephones of which there are three viz.                  Internal
club phone, Police phone for internal and external use and a private phone

for external use only.

?C   Bichard      is    assigned       to   the   video     recorders    and    cameras   within    the

ground and to the use of a VHP hand set which has direct access to Force

Operations Room.

All the tasks mentioned are interchangeable.

During the early morning Roger Holdsworth tested camera 5 which is on the

West   Stand/Leppings           Lane    terraces      due   to a fault        on the camera.        The

picture    quality        he     obtained     although      was   not    of    normal   standard    was

acceptable.        Work was also going on on a Tannoy which is situated on the

boundary wall at the rear of the north side of the West Stand.                             A test on

the tannoy was carried out and it was found to be working satisfactorily.

Other tannoy tests were made byPC Ryan within the ground and were                                  found

to be in order, one Of which was                     to David Barber the groundsman.         He is in

tne centre circle and the words used to him were to the effect                              'David I

thought you would have cut the grass by now'                            David Barber acknowledged

receipt    of     the     tannoy     message.           Also   in use in the Control Box is a

message book in which any incident during a game                         would be noted.

However    on Friday           14 April      1989,    I had seen Superintendent Murray who

informed     me        that    the   Chief    Superintendent,       Mr    Duckenfield     required     a

specific message book.                 I discussed this with Superintendent Murray re an

additional officer being present in the book to log such messages but we

came      to the joint               conclusion that this was not feasibledue to                     thesize of

 the   box and that we would do the log between us.

On the morning of the 15th I opened the log but it was later taken over

 solely by Superintendent Murray because of individual duties by myself and

 the    two others.           All this was very quiet and officers                 began to assemble

 for    the briefing at 10.00am.              I believe that I timed the opening at 0959
                                            - 3 -




hours and ending at 1018 hours.

At    10.00am      PC    Bichard    came     to the       box      and    at the    conclusion      Oi   the

briefing Superintendent Murray arrived.                          I was informed by Superintendent

Murray that many serials were having their meal break but all would be out

on their respective points by 11.15am.                           With that in mind I delayed the

test calls to all the Serial Sergeants and Inspectors.

Prior       to   11.00am     a   Tango     mobile        came     through stating         that   Liverpool

supporters        were    outside    the     Foxpub       in      Foxhill Road      waiting for it to

open.        I was aware         that in     the 1988 Semi Final the               Fox had run out of

drink and there was quite a lot of publicity in local papers about it.

Similar with Middlewood Tavern.

At     11.20am I began radio checks                 to Serial Sergeants and Inspectors.                      I

remember being constantly interrupted during this check and didn't finish

it until approximately 11.45am.

It     became     apparent       that many      spectators        had arrived early but were              in

 public      houses.       I am aware        that    the        gates    at Leppings Lane        opened at

 11.45am and         ther* was      a trickle       of spectators           on to the terraces,          all

 being behind the Leppings Lane goal                       in the central pens with the large

 majority of these spectators being young persons.

 Between         approximately      12   noon      and    2pm     there    were    many    radio messages

 received and transmitted, most of them being in relation to fans at public

 houses and the ones that stand out include the Royal Hotel on Penistone

 Road/Bradf ield         Road where        Notts    Forest        supporters had gathered up to a

 point where the pub closed because of the damage being done by supporters.

     I believed that Serial 60 had a lot of contact re this and a number of

 Tango mobiles attended because of things getting out of hand.                                   Traffic was

     received that the Special Constables were having difficulty in Neepsend

     Lane   with Forest      fans.       Tangos despatched and the matter was resolved.
                                             - 4 -




There was an ambulance call to the White House pub, Halifax Road where a

Liverpool    fan had sat           on a broken bottle or glass.                  Reports were also

received    from    the     Tango mobile       to    the Wisewood/Wadsley arear re large

numbers    of Liverpool fans in the Horse and Jockey,                       Beehive and Wadsley

Jack pubs.

At this stage things were no different to the previous years semi final.

At an unknown time but certainly after the gates had been opened Chief

Inspector     Creaser       came    into     the    Control     Box   and   asked      Superintendent

Murray      about     the    Leppings        Lane     terraces        and   it     was       stated    by

Superintendent      Murray that the standing fans would find their own levels

in   the pens rather than trying to fill one pen at a time.

At   approximately 2pm Superintendent Murray left the Control Box in order

to see the referee which is normal practice.

He       returned     around       2.15pm     and    was    followed into        the   box    by   Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield and the ACC, Mr Jackson.

I noticed      that    the Notts       Forest       end    (Spion Kop and South Stand)                were

 filling    well and coming          to capacity          but   the Liverpool and North,              West

 Stands    on Leppin'g Lane         terraces were COMPARATIVELY empty and I assumed

 there should have probably been more people in those areas at that time.

 I did see that the centre pens directly behind the Leppings Lane goal were

 filling quite well but there was ample room in them.                        This observation was

 mentioned in the box because I believe we all felt that in comparison to

 the Forest end, Liverpool seemed empty.

 By 2.30pm PC Bichard I believe made mention of large crowds in Leppings

 Lane     outside   the     ground and on looking upwards at the TV screen I saw

 large numbers        of Liverpool          supporters      outside    the ground which I would

 estimate at 3 â–  4,000.

 Only once before           have I seen such numbers              and that was when Sheffield
                                      - 5 -




Wednesday played Coventry City in an FA Cup 6th Round match in 1987 when

the Coventry fans        came to Sheffield in their thousands.

Around this time         radio messages were coming thick and fast and any times

from this    point can only           be estimated approximately.

A request came from the Leppings Lane end asking for Leppings Lane                     to be

closed to    traffic due to           the volume of         persons in the          road.

The radio    system was operating on talk           through and at       around2.35- 2.40pm

I received calls         that my radio transmissions were poor and breaking up.

Within seconds of hearing this a civilian communications officer was at

the   control and began looking at the equipment.                 He changedthe Tulip;

Microphone for ;'a telephone handsetbut the fault remained. ' After';a very

short   time      the    back-up   set   with the    telephone    handset    with    central

depression was taken into use by myself.              The fixed ariel lead meant that

the base station had to be placed under the desk.                  As a result the base

station had to remain under the desk and this meant that the microphone

lead would not reach above the level of the desk top making it difficult

to use.      After only two or three calls with the handset, which were not

acknowledged,      I Relieved, that it was faulty. and X;remember throwing -the

handset on to the control desk.           I took a normal hand held radio and from

that time all transmissions were relayed in that fashion..               We were on talk

through so the use of a hand held radio provided the same service.

In    view   of   the    above   difficulties   I   asked   the   Communications      man to

arrange for the Home Office Engineer to test the equipment on Monday.

2.40pm?      A    call   came    from Superintendent Marshall requesting that: the

Leppings Lane gates be opened because of the volume of persons outside.

Further call from Superintendent Marshall asking for gates to be opened

 (means Gate C).         Stated that people were being crushed against turnstiles

 and if gates were not opened someone would be killed.
                                           - 6 -




I remember something being said about large numbers of non ticket holders

who would get in and cause serious problems                   for legitimate ticket    holders.

Mr Marshall again came through asking for                     gates tobe opened.         This was

not a request but an order.

Mr Murray asked Mr Duckenfield for                  his decision and he okayed the gates to

be opened.        'C'    gate was opened           but believed at this time it had been

forced and someone said "They've broke through" I cannot remember if this

was a radio message or said in box.

Mounted     officers      retrieved        the   situation    and   only    a   few persons   got

through.       More manpower deputed to Leppings Lane including mounted.                         Mr

Marshall again asked for gate to be re-opened a second time*                         Gates were

opened    and many more         people      went    through   than the     first time.      Would

estimate many hundreds went through this time.

Radio traffic heavy and much distortion.

At approximately 2.52pm Sergeant Higgins of                   'F' C & V    came through saying

"The   gates      at    'A'   have   got    to be    opened    as   if not somebody      will be

killed."     On receipt of that I said words over the radio, "If that is the

case we have no option open the gates."

The 'A' gate was opened and access to North Stand only wasâ€¢gained.                         By the

time 'A' gate opened the gates at 'C' had been closed.

During this time I am unable to say whether it was before or after the

gates being opened PC 1863 Buxton                   came through asking for the kick off to

be delayed.        As he said this theLiverpool team took                   to the field and I

replied "It's too late one team is already on the field."

I saw      that   in    the Leppings        Lane    end there was ample room in the pen

nearest the control box and the centre pens appeared full but not out of

the ordinary for a big match of this kind.                       I did see swaying in those

pens but again this is a regular occurrence on big match days.                         I was not
                                          - 7 -




aware that the game had started when a track officer on the Leppings Lane

end came       through with an unreadable message.                    I then saw a few people

climbing the fencing in the                central pensarea to get on to the pitch and

at that time my first thought was "Christ                      there's a pitch invasion."

Within seconds people started coming on to the track via a perimeter gate,

although       there was       not    a large     flood.        Even at this stage I        did not

realise the enormity of the. problem and made comment about a Policewoman

who was on the       track serial by Gate 1.               I    would have anticipated that she

would have opened this gate to put the persons on the track: back                        into the

outer pen.       Chief Inspector          McRobbie was in the Control Box at this time

and said words to the effect               "I'll go and sort it out."

It   was about      this    time      that I saw Superintendent Greenwood behind the

Leppings Lane goal.             It waa obvious he was trying to transmit but without

success.       I saw then he was waving his arms in a cross, across his body.

Many   officers      were      now on the perimeter              track helping people from the

central pens.

It   was   appfoximately         3.05pm    when    Superintendent       Greenwood came      through

"Stop the match,'Stop the match" and I saw Superintendent Greenwood run on

to the field of play.                 I didnâ€™t see the match stopped nor the players

leave the field.

All personnel were directed to the perimeter track at the Leppings Lane

end.       I    recall    PC    Bichard    going via VHF           to Force Control   requesting

 ambulances - a fleet of ambulances.

 Inspector      Charles    â€™C        came through requesting deployment of 5 and 50 at

 his disposal.       I directed him to the tunnel Leppings Lane end to enter the

 rear of the terraces.

 A request came through for bolt croppers.                      I phoned Claywheels Lane asking

 for some, to be told there was none.                  On completion of the call I said "No
                                   - 8 -



bolt   croppers," and PC      Bichard    said    "Shall I get the Fire Brigade"           I

didn't answer but just stuck my thumbs up.

Operation    Support   was   requested     and   I   remember   a telephone   call     from

Operations saying "Is it you that's requested Operation Support                 to which

I replied "Yes."

By   now there were many hundreds          of people on    the playing area      and it

appeared to be total         mayhem.     I saw Chief Superintendent Nesbit        by the

goal at Leppings Lane and it was obvious he was in the midst of organising

things in that a tunnel was formed and persons were being brought, o n .to

the pitch.

I saw Police helmets         in the rear of central       pens making their wayto the

front and my thoughtwas "John Charles and his teams."                 People were still

climbing the perimeter fencing and many were being lifted up into the West

Stand and my thoughts re the access to the stands was not one of being

rescued from the crowd but getting up there so they could have. a. seat.

A Tango mobile which I believe was T.G. came through stating manpower was

required in Leppings Lane outside            the ground because of the numbers of

hostile Liverpool supporters and he assisted fire and ambulance personnel

 with injured persons.

Throughout    this time PC Ryan had been on the tannoy at the Liverpool: end

 requesting repeatedly that the supporters in the central pens move back to

 allow injured persons to be brought from the terraces.               His pleas appeared

 to be ignored.

 I remember a sole supporter dressed             in a black     'T'   shirt run down    the

 length of the pitch towards the Notts           Forest end.     He stopped on the     edge

 of the 18 yard area and appeared to be gesturing to the Forest Supporters.

 A Police Officer appeared and brought           the youth down.

 A cordon of Police formed across the            central line and was only broken to
                                    - 9 -



allow injured and dead spectators being carried on hoardings through to

the Spion Kop end.        I remember PC 2988 Burkinshaw coming through on two

occasions asking if control had any ideas where a temporary mortuary could

be set up.        In the second occasion I believe Chief Inspector Beal came

through saying that the gymnasium would be used.

I would estimate that many hundreds of people were on the pitch most of

whom were being attended to by Police and St John's Ambulance Personnel

and I saw a number being given mouth to mouth resuscitation.                                 At some

stage    Chief    Superintendent        Duckenfield       and    ACC     Mr   Jackson    left    the

control, Mr Duckenfield saying words to the effect "Iâ€™ve got to go to the

boardroom."

He did return some time later because the announcement that the match was

 abandoned had to be made and it had been decided not to say anything to

 the crowd so as to enable ambulances carrying the injured to have a clear

 run.     I remember Mr Nesbit coming through stating "You have got to tell

 the crowd that the match is abandoned and to go" and it was Superintendent

 Murray who went on tannoy and announced to the crowd that the match was

 abandoned.       I cannot      remember      his    exact     words    but   it started       Please

 retain    your    tickets..."      At     the      end   of   the     announcement     I heard    an

  applause throughout the ground.

  Prior to this both Brian Clough and Kenny Dalglish had been in the Control

  and nr Clough-asked certain questions of Chief Superintendent Duckenfield

  and stated if there was anything you want, you know where X am.                               Kenny

  Dalglish    attempted    to    talk    to    the    Liverpool        fans   via   tannoy    but was

  unsuccessful and PC Byan took him down to the DJâ€™s box where he made an

  announcement.

  The front areas of the centre pens were cleared and I saw what I thought

   was    part of a barrier having been broken and was lying on the                             track.
                                - 10 -




However, this could have been a piece of hoarding.      The pitch was finally

cleared of the dead and injured and the crowds left the stadium.

There were    isolated reports of fighting between rival supporters in the

Hillsborough Park area but nothing untoward and supporters went quickly

home.     A message had earlier been passed that the Liverpool supporters

were to be treated with sympathy and understanding.

I remained in the Police Control until approximately 10.30pm that evening

attempting for much of the time to relay messages to the Northern General

Hospital    (officer on duty there PC 3082 Fletcher). I was then informed I

was required to attend a meeting at Headquarters.       On leaving the box I

went to the gymnasium where I saw a number of Senior Officers including

the Chief Constable, Mr Wright, plus many, many officers dealing with the

lines of deceased on the gymnasium floor.     I then saw Chief Superintendent

Nesbit and informed him that I would be going to Headquarters.      He stated

 that a meeting at that time of night after such a day was pointless.    I am

 aware that he sought the advice of the Chief Constable on this matter and

 he informed me the meeting would not go ahead.

 I have    always held the belief and still do that the SWFC stadium is as

 WELL POLICED as any ground in the country and is MUCH BETTER POLICED than

 most with consideration given to away supporters who on normal matches are

 not shepherded into a quiet corner of the ground nor are they detained

 after the match as is the case in many football grounds throughout the

 country.

 The question therefore is why did such a disaster occur and I can only put

  it down to three causes :

  a)    Overcrowding in the central pens.

  b)    The collapse of a barrier.

  c)    The late arrival of the Liverpool supporters.
                                           - l i Â­




lt will be seen that I have not included the opening of the gates because

I believe that Superintendent Marshall had no alternative other than to

ask them to be opened and the Chief Superintendent who gave the order

obviously and rightly believed that the gates required to be opened.

One thing does come to mind              here and that isstewards or should I say lack

of stewards in the standing             areas of SWFC.

From the Control Box it is easy to see around the ground and the South,

North and West Stands are more than adequately stewarded with the stewards

being easily identifiable >by their yellow tabards,                       However, on the Spion

Kop and     Leppings    Lane    terraces there are no stewards or should I say I

have never seen a steward.               I know this matter has been brought up with

 the Club in earlier years and attached to this report is a typewritten

 agenda    prepared    I     believe    by     Inspector       Calvert   when he    organised     the

 football duties at Hillsborough.                   Certain points on that agenda have been

 implemented by the Club.

 In   relation   to    (a)    it   is   o b v i o u s   that the supporters used the centre

 tunnel    to gain access.          I do not even remember the tunnel gates being

 closed before        and- the only times a serial manned the tunnel was a few

 years     ago when    both home        and away supporters were             allowed to use the

 Leppings Lane terraces and West Stand.                    The reason for the Police presence

 was segregation of fans and had nothing to do with safety.

 In relation to (b) and (c) there is nothing I can say except hopefully the

  public    inquiry will make           their       findings    known.     When    one   talks   about

  feelings, it is only after the                  event can     one   realise the scale yet whilst

  it was happening I felt afeeling of total                      disbelief witnessing the events

  before my eyes - that this canâ€™t happen at Hillsborough but with things

  going on at such a pace I do not believe that I had the time to take it

  all     in and the events and incidents I have outlined form only a small
                                         - 12 -




portion of what took place that afternoon when a minute seemed an eternity

and an hour a split second.

One thing that does remain vividly              in my mind is the actions of the Police

Officers,    the Special Constables            and   the St John's Ambulance plus all

unknown persons who ferried the dead and injured away from the perimeter

track.

I have always been proud of              being a member of the South: Yorkshire Police

and   I   feel   humble    that    I     could beassociated with         those   persons who

performed    heroics      not     just   on   the    field   but    in   the    gymnasium,     the

hospitals    and   the    centres.for         the    relatives     throughout    the   night    of

Saturday 15 April 1989.

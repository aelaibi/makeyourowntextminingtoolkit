Although             the       machine          is    capable           of    recording                40    channels

simultaneously,                      the     ICR40         Reproducer              can       only       play        back       one    channel          at

any       one       time.         The      channel             listened           to    being          from     one       of    two       replay

heads.              Head       A giving          the        odd      channels,              ie.    1, 3,       5 etc.           and Head          B

giving             the    even       channels             2,    4,     6 etc.           Due       to    the     physical             spacing          of

the       2    described             heads       which          is 6 0 m m a n d             with a          t ape       speed       of    12 mm /

sec,          there       will       exist       a 5       second           difference             between an              odd and an             even

channel.                 In n o r m a l      circumstances                   whilst          only       listening              to    one    channel,

this          is    irrelevant.                 But       by    using        the m u l t i - r e c o r d i n g            method          installed

by me,             the    5 second           time         difference              between          odd and           even       channels          is

relevant             and       detectable.

Although             this       is    th e      case,          it m u s t     be       stressed             t hat    this       time

difference                is    then       constant             and     not       cummulative                over        the    length       of       the

tape,          and       furthermore,                an     incoming          signal          recorded              by    the       machine

at    a       specified           time       will         be    recorded           at       that       time     on a n         odd    or    even

channel             and     the      five       seconds           is     p u r e l y as       a    result           of    our       multi-

recording                m e th o d and will                need       to    be    subtracted                or a d d e d       to a g i v e n

ti m e        to    identify           the      actual          time.

The       ICR40 O pe ra ti o ns                 Room       Recorder           has       a    crystal          controlled              clock

which          lays       down       on    to    channel             2 a digital              time          signal.            This       clock       is

not       synchronised                i nto      any       time        standard,             eg.       British Telecom                    time    or

MSF       Rugby          and    therefore             the       ICR40        clock          can    be at        a time          difference

with any             other        cloc k.            The       use     of    the       ICR40       clock        is       fundamentally                to

allow          quick        location            of a s p e c i f i c          recorded             item       during           playback          and

the       manufacturer                refers          to       it as        the    time       search          s y s t e m . It       has    never-

been          my    understanding                that          this      clock         has    been          used     by    the O p e r a t i o n s

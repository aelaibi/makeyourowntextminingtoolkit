          past.     I do not know whose                  s u pporters      they were         but    there was a lot

          of    red and white.          The    crowd was           large as usual            for a semi         final     day.

          I can't      remember what           time       this was        but    the    police      had a l r e a d y

          b a r r i c a d e d the    road off.       I. remember at about                12pm,      I saw what          must

          have    been about          thirty       police       officers        riding      horses       going along

          P e n i s t o n Road N o r t h    towards           the ground.

                                                         We    f r e q u e n t l y go out    to w a t c h the      horses

          when John       gets      home    from work and             I thought         to myself        whe n he       got

          back we would go and                have a look at             the     horses     ar o u n d    the ground.

          I guess John must             have       got    home at about           ten    past      two   that     day w hich

    ^   k is later       than normal          taut he said the             crowds were          terribly        large.        John

w         changed his          clothes and at about 2 . 4 0 p m w e set                     out

                                           to go     to see        the   police        horses      outside      the     ground

           nd on to the shops .

          As we got        into L e p p i n g s Lane and out of the area                        the      police    had

          c ordoned off         the    first       thing      that    struck me as          very unusual           even for

         a semi      final      was    how many of the s u p p o r t e r s              there were         still

          outside      of the ground.              We were a good 200 yards                   from the       gate and

          the    road and       pavement       were       packed still          wit h supporters.            In fact          I

          commented on this             to John.          The s u p p o r t e r s were making            their way

          towards      the ground a n d            I noticed apart              from eating         chips a       large

          majority       of fans were          quite o b v i o u s l y d r i nking alcohol                 from    cans and

          bottles.       The    road was awash with                  litter      beer    cans      bottles and          I saw a

          number     of supporters            kicking and throwing                 their      litter       into gardens.

          I w ould     not have        described          the s u pporters         as drunk         rather      they were

          in a merry mood a l t h o u g h            I w ould have          said       quite a few were            behaving

          d i s o r d e r l y singing and          chanting        football       songs     which

i ncluded swear words.                 I could not          specifically          remember        the w ords

used.        I would    like to        point      out a l t h o u g h a    large     number       were

d i s o r d e r l y there were also a lot of well                        behaved     supporters,          although

ne a r l y all       of the     suppo r t e r s were youths.

We    con t i n u e d up L e p p i n g s Lane       towards        the    ground and some twenty

y ards       further    on dozens         of     people who were           in red and white              came

rushing        towards       us a g a i n s t    the general        tide    of    people.        They were

as k i n g    us    if we had tickets             to sell.     A number          of these        people were

carrying           fourpacks      of   lager and beer.             Again    I would      not      say they were

drunk        but they were         very     boisterous.        As soon as we said we had                        no

tickets        they w o u l d     rush on to the            next    people.       It w o u l d    be an under

s t atement         to say    I could have          sold a hundred           tickets        in the L e p p i n g s

.ane between                            and the ground.             These    people were all             male,

of all ages and from their acce n t s                        they were       o b v i o u s l y from

Liverpool.           I could not        describe all          of them,       the     only    common

f eature was          they were all             drinking     and all       had got more           to drink w ith

them.

The mood of the              crowd and the number              of    people asking           for    tickets

continued as we got                nearer        the ground.        We had stayed on the                 side of

L e p p i n g s Lane    closest        to Vere R oad because               it was     our    in t e n t i o n    to

see the Police             horses      but having        past Vere R o a d we got to about

tw e n t y yards       from the        gate      of the ground whe n             the volume        and d e n s i t y

of the        crowd grew to such a mass                  that we         could get      no further and

e v e ryone        came to a standstill.              I w ould      say we were about              the    point        of

the sweet          shop.



Esy now       it must have         been about „2 .50          pm a n d there was            literally

thousands           crushing     towards         the gate.     I looked up to M i d d l e w o o d Road

and    commented to John that all                     you    could see was a sea of faces                        and

red and white           colours.        Joh n said to me that               there was        no way we

             could see the horses                that     day.       We     lit e r a l l y            pushed our way to the

             other    side    of the       road by the                bridge.                Irecall            a lot of bawling,

             shouting       and screaming           and there was almost a sense                                        of      panic    in the

             air.

             We   pushed our way along               the    pavement across                            the       bridge         passing

             suppo r t e r s who were        still        asking           if people               had tickets                  to sell.          1 was

             now on the       other       side    of the ground and they were a g a i n all

             drinking alcohol.             A bout    thirty           or forty               people must                have q u i z z e d         for

             tickets       in no more       than     the    length of the                         bridge.

             As we got to the other                 side    of the bridge w h i c h                              is at a s l i g h t l y

             higher       level    than the       gates     to the ground                         1 looked about                  but    could

             see nothing          but   faces and         red         and white pal ours.                            I also      noti c e d as          we

             were    on the other          side     of the            bridgt^-'on some waste ground                                   that    there

rj 1*5 * 0   was a Police          land Rover        van in %me middle                            of the           crowd near           the
                                                                 ^     !         II    !     I         .1!             —



             entrance       to the       ground.     I                saw plenty of helmets                                of    police

             officers       in the area.

             I realised we were             interested               in the            spe c t a c l e         that was          o c c uring       so

             with John,       we s t a r t e d to        climb up a bank at                            the       rear of this waste

             gr o u n d where a second            hand tyre            fitter               bay stands.               F r o m where          we

             were we were about             forty yards              from the gate and by now we were

             probably about             thirty foot about                  the         level       of the g round entrance.

             F rom there      I could hear           police officers who                               1 took         to be       in the

             Lan d Rover a n n o u n c i n g , "This            is a Police                      message,            will       you    please

             stop    pushing.       You are       squashing            people at the                          t u r n s t i l e s . ” This

             mess a g e    kept    being    repeated.           It must                have       been a b o u t £ . 5 5 pm.

             I could not see what was                    h a p pening at the                      turnstiles               but    the mass

             outside were          clearly       pushing        to get                near       the         gates    of the ent r a n c e .

             There was a Police             horse        in the middle                      of the            crowd and all             I could

             see of       it was    the head,        a tan           colour.               The area was               jam       packed with

             supporters.

By    now a Police         officer      was     st o o j j ^ K n e e 1 i ng or sitting        on the      roof

of the Land Rover,               he was          i n a t e 1y outside.          He was    pleading

t h r o u g h a l ouc^speaj^r         system,       "This        is a Police       message       please        stop

pushing,"       1 could sense           his voice was             by now       pleading     or begging          but

the    crowd d i d n ’t alter.

I noticed       now there were             one or two           other    people a r o u n d     us at our

vantage     point      over      the scene.        There were           four young white           girls,       all

about    13 years,         who    I took      to be from S h e f f i e l d        from their accents.                 1

didn't     pay them muc h attention.                  There was anot h e r white               y outh about

•14 youths      old who was          sat    down behind us              on his    own.    He said to us,"

Have you got a ticket."                We     replied       no and from his accent                 1 w ou l d say

he was a Liverpool               fan but      I could not          say m uch else.

It was ar o u n d now that a man                 climbed the            bank and stood a l o n g s i d e         us.

He    said to me       "Have you        got a ticket?"             I said,       "No we've       only     come

from down       road      I'm not go ing," He then said,                       " I ’ve got a season

ticket."       I said,      " Do you        come    from L i v e r p o o l . " He said,          “No    I come

from the M i d lands          but    I follow Liverpool.                 But    I'm not going          down with

that    lot." He       then star t e d        to each his          sandw i c h e s and anot h e r        man

came up and joined us                I remember           the    second man saying            they had

been    "Held up on the             road?" Ar o u n d       this    time       I noticed a good 8 or 9

fans    near   the bridge           below as standing and quite                    openly      urinating.

There were       still      fans a r r iving at            the    back    of the mass w h i c h         by now

was    easily a solid block                of 2 , 0 0 0    people.       The    officer     on the      police

car was     still      pleading with the              crowd but          there was       no m o v e m e n t    from

the    crowd they all            appeared      to be       pushing       forward.

I remember John saying                to me,       "If s o m e t h i g n doesn't         ha p p e n soon

someone will        be killed down there," The                      crowd had s w a l l o w e d the            road

u.p a l t h o u g h the    odd vehicle was a t t e m p t i n g            to edge    their way through.

There was a lot of noise all                     thro u g h but         I could not       remember w h e t h e r

it was from        inside        or outside        the     crowd.

                                                                                                               S538

I carried on chatting                 to the two L i verpool                 fans whilst       John sh o w e d

m ore    interest        in what was            going    on and      in jwtfy a few seconds J o h n

said something about                 a gate,

I looked down towards                 the       crp^ci more      closely and          I saw a surge            of

people         going    thro u g h a ^ a t e      an the       river side        of the entrances.                 I

could not see where               they wetre            going after          they got thro u g h         the       gate.

The     rest of the         crowd were           now moving,,       "en m a s s e 11 towards           that

entrance.         There were         no gaps          they were a solid mass moving                     in w i t h a

defina'te sense           of urgency.            There was       so muc h noise          by this        time       I

could not say            if the      police man w i t h the L and Rover was                       still

talking.         Infact     I can not           recall    seeing what was             going    on wit h        regard

the     policing        but the      crowd did not stop until                    the m a j o r i t y    had

disappeared within              the    ground.          It probably          took    only two to         three

mi n u t e s    for the m a j o r i t y     of the       crowd to have gone.              I could not

say what         time    it was.

13oth John and me then set                      off    to the shops          going L e p p i n g s Lane        into

C a t c h b a r Lane     into M i d d l e w o o d Road.        Ha v i n g    pu r c h a s e d what we w a n t e d

we    returned home          by the        same       route.    I    remember        seeing aPolice             car

with     its     lights     flashing        doing what          I    now      realise         to beblocking

C a t c h b a r Lane at L e p p i n g s         Lane.

As we got to the             bridge        outside       the    ground        it was noticeable              that

there was no noise and a                    lot of       people     just      look.ing at the           ground.          A

fire     engine a r r i v e d and stopped                in the e n t r a n c e      to the    ground.         The

f i r e m e n then ran        into    the ground          carrying          green    packs,    I. thought

there must          be a fire.        We    stood g,n the bridge and                  large    number         of

erne r g ency vehicles          jthe n a r H v e d       i nc: 1 ud i ng a plain white mi ni                 bus       f rorn

wh i c h 8 - 9 police           officers          ran pulling         their      tunics     on.

I do not know why              but    I found myself             looking        towards an exit              gate       from

the ground on the              right       as you       looked at      the     ground,      near       the

river.         A steady     trickle        of    people     leaving         became    quite a flow            of

people,     limping,       holding       one another            up.    There were a lot              clearly

distraught,        crying.        Policemen,        firemen and a m b u l a n c e m e n were              coming

out     putting the       injured on transport and                     rushing     back     in.

I kept most        c o n c e n t r a t i o n on the a r r i v i n g     e m e r g e n c y services        but

remember        hearing    shouting        like,        "you fucking m u r d e r i n g         bastards"         and

York shire       pigs"

At that     point     I recall       hearing a public addr e s s a n n o u nc e m e n t w h i c h                     I

took    to be from        inside     the    ground.         I could hear         the a n n o u n c e m e n t     was

similar     to    “Will    the     people     on the        perimeter       track move          onto      the

playing area so we            can treat the              injured."

There was a lot of            people       coming        out who a p p e a r e d well          and     had

o b v i o u s l y escaped from       injury who were              d i recting a g g r e s s i o n at          the

Pol ice.    The m a j o r i t y    of the Police w§/e                 helping    the    injured         but     the

few officers who           stood a r o u n d a p p e a r e d      to be     purposeful          rather        than

just     idling    their    time away.           Some     of the       fans were       going      up to these

officers        shouting    "Pigs"       "Murdertrig B a stards".               The    police        officers

behaviour        of the fans        like    this.        The    vast m a j o r i t y were       behaving

tota l l y orderly.        One y o u t h was       stood only six              feet away shou t e d at a

police     officer,       "I'm going        to    come      back and      cut you to           pieces" He

a i m e d this    towards     the    police who           ignored his          remarks and           encouraged

people     to    leave    orderly.       The y o u t h was a w hite male 25 years 6 ” 2"

tall,    me d i u m build     curly a n d m o u s e y hair.            He was wearing             a waist

length green        (light)        sweat    top.        He was    pulled off          by some        others      and

went    up Leppings Lane.            He was       shouting        so    loud    I could not            disc e r n

a ny accent.

I suppose we stood for a good three                            quarters     of an hour w a t c h i n g           the

disaster        unfold before        us.    We    briefly went           back    to the house an d

 inside     the      ground.       The a n n o u n c e m e n t       was    to the        fans     to the effect

 the m a t c h was a o a n a o n e a ana w o u l d m e y                   retain tickets.               People were

 still    lying       on the        floor      outside         the     ground when after                 this

 announcement            the    crowd surge            out     of the       ground        began.

 A   private       car    (I can't        remember what                type)      then     pulled up to a

 scree c h i n g     halt      in the mid d l e         of the         road below us near                  the entrance

 to the tyre          bay.      The    car had a green                 light      on the        front.      The    person

 driving       the    vehicle         got out and            ran to the ground.                   The    police and

 some    s u pporters          i m m e d i a t e l y went      over and          phys i c a l l y m ov e d the       car to

 the    pavement         edge.

 Emergency         services        were      coming and going,                   e m e r g e n c y services        people

 were    joining         fans a s s is t i n g       obv i o u s l y    injured         people         but amon g s t     the

 ^ell    behaved but upset                people        leaving         the gr o u n d there             were     still

 unruly    people.          I saw a man thumping                     the    bonnet        of a police           car an d

 one    kicking       the      side,     I am sure           it was        the    tall     one     I described

 earlier.       He was still             cle arly shouting,                 "Fucking B a s t a r d s , "          at the

 police.       A police         officer        got    out of the            car and squared up to the man

 before    telling          him to move          on.      At    least       I assume        that was what

 was    being      said a the arm actions                      gave     that      impression.            I could not

 d e s cribe    the other man.               T h e y both then were                dragged off            by other        fans.

 A   little     nearer,         up L e p p i n g s    Lane,      by the          tyre     bay a man had            climbed

 a tree and          could      clearly        be heard to be shouting,                         "Murdering

 basta r d s . " Two        policemen          stood nearby m o n i t o r i n g             the        crowd and     did

 not flinch.          He shouted          so    loudly he went               hoarse.        I could not d e s c r i b e

 him but       I think, he was a bit                  older.

 It must       have      been about 3pm and we still                         did not        know exactly what

 had h a p pened so we s t a r t e d             to head home               to see        the     news.     It was      only

 then    I realised the               full     extent        of the disaster.

Dear Mr. Fraser,              ,

                       Limited -Resumed Inquests ---Hillsborough- -


I enclose a copy of a schedule shewing the time and date when each
individual inquest for the 95 deceased of the Hillsborough disaster
will be held.

I have written to the individual solicitors representing specific
persons and no doubt you will have received a letter in respect of
the persons whom your firm represents,

I hope that the listing schedule is clear to you.,.



Yours sincerely,

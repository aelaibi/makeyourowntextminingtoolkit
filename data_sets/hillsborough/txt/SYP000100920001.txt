              At    Sam     15 A p r i l      1989       I commenced             duty     at    West       Bar   Police            Station                  for

              briefing          in     relation          to    the    FA C u p Semi            Final       between      Nottingham

              Forest        and Liverpool.

              Phase       1 of m y          serials       (11)       duty    commenced              about     9.30am      at           the           Midland

              Station,          Sheaf        Street.          We     were    specifically               detailed        to         supervise

              the a r r i v a l        of    Nottingham            Forest        football           supporters        travelling                           by

              rail       and    their        subsequent            escort        by P S V      to H i l l s b o r o u g h .

              The    early arrivals                 were       very    orderly          although           in g e n e r a l        spirits                  were

              high.         The       later    the       arrivals          the    higher        the     spirits.          It w a s

              apparent          t hat       alcohol       was      a major        influence           towards        th is.                 I believe

              I travelled              on    the    last      PSV     escorting           the       Forest       supporters.                         These

              were       under        the    influence          of a l c o h o l     shouting           and      swearing.                      We

              increased           the       number       of    police       officers           on    this     escort      to               prevent

              trouble.            However,          t his      did    not    stop       them        singing       obscenities                        and

              there was           a    stream       of    urine       flowing        from       the     upper      deck       of            the       PSV.

              At    that       t ime    we    didn't          have    enough       policemen            to    police      effectively                               and

              safely.           Although           Phase       1 was       successful           a    large       number       of            supporters

              went       to H i l l s b o r o u g h      under       the    influence           of a l c o h o l .

              I arrived           at    Hillsborough               about     2.30pm         and      immediately went                           to    the

              gymnasium           to    regroup          my    serial.           They     were       all     present.              However,                     4

meal     tickets            and    obtained          a meal.             On      completion               serial       sergeants

outside          or    i nside .         He     t o l d me       to    go a r o u n d          on    the    track.           It w a s           a

bit    vague          but    I thought             I would        be met           by an        Inspector             in C h a r g e        of

the    ground.

I informed             serial          members       engaged           in a r r e s t          reports          that       I was       going

to    the L e p p i n g s         Lane.         I switched             my       r a dio    to       the    match       channel             and

walked       towards             the    Leppings           L a ne.       I was         w i t h PC         269 Broomhead,                   PC       22

I could          see     t hat     the       two    teams        were       warming            up on       the       pitch.           As    we

walked       down        the      track       the    atmosphere                was     electric            and       the    noise

that     it w a s        packed.             Too    packed.            People          were         scaling          the    perimeter

fence.           The     fence         was    bowing        with       pressure            and       the    people          at    the

front       were       screaming             for    help.         Shouting             for      the       gates       to    be    opened.

I was       completely             suprised          by     t hi s     because            the       terracing          to    the       right

front       of me.           It    seemed          that     we    should          allow         some       in    the       middle

section          into       the    right        hand       section,.             One      of    the       first       people          out,          a

refused.             He    had        the    number       written          on       his    hand.            He   screamed          that

I noticed            that       several        people          were       coming          out     injured         as    a    result          of

Everyone           seemed         to    have       a go at       me.           Shouting           abuse,,         I was       getting

embroiled            in a r g u m e n t       after       argument,                 I sti ll         d i d n ’t k n o w a n y t h i n g

of    the     tragedy.            I heard          nothing           on    the       radio.          I believed              we    were

There       seemed         to     be    loa d s     spitting          onto          the    pitch        over      the       fence.           I

saw a young               man     on    the    pitch       n ear      the       goals        and a          policeman          running

rapidly.             I began           helping       the       injured.              Sitting          them       on    the    pitch          or

trying        to     get     them assistance.                    I c a n ’t r e m e m b e r             how m a n y         I helped.

I remember            one       chap who           really       worried             me.      He      wa s    unconscious               but       he

was    breathing.                 A man       asked       me    to    help          him.        I placed          him       in the

recovery           position            with    the    help       of       an ambula nce man .                    He    said       he    would

be a l r i g h t .         I left           him when       the o t h e r            m a n came       back.         Ih e l p e d

             out,      I saw         t h e a m fau 1 a nee           on the          p i t c h a n d w e n t b a c.k t o w a r d s            the

             goals.        Several                policemen          were       giving          mouth, to mou t h .               One       man    had

             his    head       covered             and     was      obviously             dead.         I looked           around       and       there

             were    others          covered.                 I realised             we    had     a tragedy             but     not    the

             enormity          of    it.           The     fire      brigade          were        there       and    the        fence       was    being

             pulled       down.              I saw       some       youths       with        wooden          boards        a n d we     put       a man          on

             it.     He    was       about          35     years      old a n d           heavy.         We    ran a c r o s s         the    pitch

             with    him.           He       was    dead.          I left       t h e m at        the    Kop       end     of    the    pitch and

             went    back       towards             the L e p p i n g s         Lane.           The     Forest       supporters              were

             taunting          the       Liverpool             end.        A    large        number          ran    towards           the    Kop.        It

             looked       nasty..             An    Inspector             shouted          at     me    to    get    my m en          together.              I

             didn't       know where                any       of    them were.               I saw       s ome      other        officers          from

             West    Bar       and       we       formed       a    line       across        half       way.        We     were       there       for    a

             few minutes             when          a Chief          Inspector             t o l d me     to    go    outside           onto       the

             Leppings          Lane.

             I stood       on the             Leppings             Lane    while          the     Liverpool          crowd        dispersed.

             Most    of    the       crowd          were       shocked,          s ome       were       distraught,              others       were

             nasty    and abusive.                       We    stood       there          mainly        in s i l e n c e        and    took       the

             flak.        I don't             know       how       long    I stood           there       but       t hat    is w h e r e      I heard

             t h e f i rs t m e s sa g e s              o v e r t h e ra d :i.o .

             When    the       crowd          had       dispered          I went          int o    the       ground        looking          for    the

             remnants          of m y         serial.              I found       PC       Cheetham           in the        gymnasium.              He    was

             dealing       with          a    body.           I became          aware        how       big    the    t r a g e d y w as.           The

             other    members                of    my    serial       were       outside           the       ground        completing             the

             escort       of    the F o r e s t            fans      back       to    th e      Midland        Station.

                                                                                                                                   R328

had    been       screaming            for     the       gate       to be       opened          and     a police            officer       had

refused.           He    had       the      number        written          on his          hand.           He    screamed          that

people       were       being         killed.            I told          him    to    get       off     the      pitch       so    I could

get    others       out.           I continued                to    filter        people          out      towards          the    right

hand    terrace.              They       were       refusing             to go       in    a nd      stayed       on     the

perimeter.              I was         looking        round          for    people          to h e l p       me    but       I had

already       become          detached          from my             ser i a l .

I noticed          t ha t     several          people          were       coming          out     injured         as     a result         of

the    crush.       St      Johns        Ambulancemen                were       getting           involved            with       these.

I still       tried         to     filter       people             from    the       middle          towards          the    right.

Everyone          seemed         to h a v e     a go          at    me.        Shouting           abuse,         I was       getting

embroiled          in    argument            after        argument.               I still            didn't       know       anything

of    the    tragedy.              I heard          nothing          on    the       radio.           I believe             we    were

still       trying       to p r e v e n t       a pitch             invasion.              The       numbers          of p o l i c e     were

increasing          but       the      situation              was    getting          out       of hand.          The       crush      didn't

seem    to    abate         and       the    crowd        were       frantic.

There       seemed       to      be    loads        spitting             onto     the     pitch         over      the       fence.        I

saw    a young          man      on    the     pitch          near       the    goals       and       a policeman                running

onto    the       field.

The    number       of      injured          people           coming       from       the       terrace          increased

rapidly.           I began            helping        the       injured.              Sitting          them       on    the       pitch    or

trying       to    get      them       assistance.                  I can't          remember           how      many       I helped.

I remember          one       chap       who    really             worried        me.      He     was      unconscious             but    he

was    breathing.             A man         asked        me    to    help       him.      I placed              him    in    the

recovery          position            with     the       help       of    an    ambulanceman.                    He    s aid      he   would

be    alright.           I l e ft        him    when          the    other        man     c ame       back.           I helped

another       girl       to      the     side       of    the       pitch       with      an      arm      injury.          She    was

extremely          distraught.                 Whilst          I was       at     the     side        of    the       pitch       a young

man    jumped       from         the     sta nd.          He       had    a brace         on his           teeth       and       was

screaming          that       it      was    ou r    fault .             I told      him        we    couldn't           get      people

Dear Superintendent,

I refer to a conversation which I had with P.C.     Greenway on
Tuesday  15th July concerning the release to me of witness
statements.  At his request I enclose a copy of the signed
authorities of Roger Houldsworth and Dr. Ed Walker.

You may be aware that Lord Justice Stuart Smith has requested that
the families written representations should reach him by the end
of August.  In the circumstances I should be grateful if you would
let me have the above mentioned statements by return.

 I thank you for your assistance.

 Yours faithfully,




 Ann Adlington

establishment of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s Scrutiny on aspects of the Hillsborough
Disaster, I fee! we must take a slightly different approach now.

I have written to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to ask his permissionto comply with your
request. I am anxious not to cut across his work. As soon as I hear from him, I will contact
you again.

Yours sincerely

            I refer to your letter of 23rd July.  I understand that Lord
            Justice Stuart-Smith has now authorised you to release the

HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER


I have been appointed by the Home Secretary to conduct a scrutiny of possible fresh evidence
relating to the Hillsborough Stadium disaster. I am writing to ask for your assistance (my
Secretary Mr Bone has already spoken to ACC Daines).

It might be helpful if I explain that the objective of my scrutiny is to establish whether there
is any significant new evidence which was not previously available to Lord Taylor’s Inquiry,
to the Inquests, or to the prosecuting or police disciplinary authorities. If there is significant
evidence, it will be my aim to see if it would have affected the outcome of any of the
proceedings. I hope to report my findings to the Home Secretary by the end of the year. I
attach my terms o f reference.

In the course o f my work I expect that I will need to have access to the documents about the
incident and the various proceedings arising out of it which are held by your force. I should
be obliged if you arrange lor tiie Secretariat to my scrutiny to be informed in writing by 4
August of the nature of these documents and how we may most conveniently obtain access to
them.

I have already seen the material submitted by you under cover of your letter of 3 February
1997 to Mr Pugh, including the two files and the video recordings TB1 and TB2.

If your force has any fresh evidence relating to the disaster I would be grateful if it could be
forwarded to my Secretariat, at the address above, by 1 September.

I have written to the Hillsborough Family Support Group and to various other people who
have come forward asking for some basic summary information about the new evidence
which is said to exist. This information will help me during the preliminary stages of my
work.
As my scrutiny o f the evidence proceeds I may wish to interview some witnesses directly. I
am also willing to consider interviewing individual witnesses at their request. These
interviews will be private.

The Secretariat to my scrutiny will be happy to discuss the arrangements if you wish. Please
note that the telephone and room numbers shown above are temporary - we will notify you of
our permanent address and telephone as soon as we have them.

              "I. have today started w ork on the scrutiny of possible new evidence
              relating to the Hillsborough Stadium disaster. My objective is to establish
              w hether there is any significant evidence which was npt previously
              available to Lord Taylor's Inquiry, to the inquests, or to the prosecuting or

              "If there is significant evidence, it w ill be my aim to see if it would have
              affected the outcome of any of the various proceedings.       I w ill then advise
              the Home Secretary whether in my opinion there should be a further public
              inquiry, and the prosecuting and disciplinary authorities and the A ttorney
              General whether the fresh evidence is such that they should reconsider the
              decisions they have already taken.


              "I w ill shortly be inviting w ritten representations from those interested and
              w ill then decide whom I wish to see in person. But I can confirm th a t after
              the summer I w ill go to Liverpool to meet the relatives of those killed and
              their legal representatives.


              "The meetings I have w ill be private and I will not be making any public
              com ments on the evidence or representations which are made to me during
              the course of the scrutiny. I hope to report my findings to the Home
              Secretary towards the end of the year.

Dear Mr Bone

Documents Pertaining to Hillsborough Disaster

I refer to the letter dated July 1997 from Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to Richard Wells, Chief
Constable of South Yorkshire. In paragraph 3, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith asks that you be
informed of the nature of documents we hold and how you may obtain access to them.

Our store of documents is held in police premises at Heeley, near the centre of Sheffield.
Our Heeley offices accommodate the Discipline and Complaints Department and the Audio
and Visual Aids Unit. The premises are locked and alarmed at night.

The store room of documents contains about 70 hours of video tape recordings, 30
photograph albums and numerous documents, statements and transcripts. The room is
about 15 feet square and is full from floor to ceiling with shelves of Hillsborough related
items. There is also a central column of documents. There is about 315 feet of shelves full
of papers, etc. We have a computer to help keep track of all the items. Many of the
documents, videos etc are duplicates of records held by other bodies.

We will provide every assistance to you and your staff in gaining access to the documents.
Constable Ken GREENWAY (tel: 0114 2821047) is conversant with all aspects of the
disaster and the documentation. He works at Heeley and I am sure you will find him of
great assistance in your work.

Please contact me when you have considered ho"/ you wish to work, and I will make the
necessary arrangements.

Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Bone

Requests for Access to Hillsborough Related Material

I attach a letter I recently received from Ms Ann Adlington. I also attach the reply I have
faxed to her.

The Chief Constable has responded to many similar requests over the years and has no
objection to responding to this request. However, as explained in my letter to Ms Adlington,
I feel I should consult you first.

We have received a number of similar requests in recent weeks and have acknowledged
them in similar vein. Again I am happy to respond to them but do not wish to do so without
your approval.

Yours sincerely

Dear Chris

Please find attached unsolicited correspondence from:




Each letter is pertinent to the scrutiny to be carried out by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith. Some
of the correspoondence suggests that they have fresh evidence to offer.                 I have
acknowledged each letter using the same format (a specimen letter is attached). In
response to my replies I have further letters from two of the correspondents (attached).

I forward these papers for your attention to deal with as you see fit. Please acknowledge
receipt of this and all the attached.

Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Bone

Report bv David Phillips on Hillsborough Disaster

I attach a report dated August 1990 by Mr David Phillips, then Deputy Chief Constable of
Devon and Cornwall Constabulary, now Chief Constable of Kent.

The provenance of the report is a little unclear. At paragraph 2.1, Mr Phillips says;

       “On 20th October, 1989, I was asked to consider documentary material emanating
       from the Inquiry conducted by Lord Justice TAYLOR into the disaster at
       Hillsborough. I have confined my research to a consideration of documentary
       evidence although I have spoken to other senior police officers, serving and retired,
       in relation to this match and other issues in general, (none of whom had any direct
       involvement in the game at Hillsborough), ”

In response to your request for “fresh evidence" to be submitted to you, I forward this
document. I do not believe it represents fresh evidence but is principally another
perspective on pre-existing evidence. However, as with all similar material, the Chief
Constable would prefer to lay material before you rather than pre-judge the material’s
freshness. I will cause enquiries to be made into the background that led to this report and
will contact you again as soon as I have more information.

I would be obliged if you could acknowledge receipt of this letter.

Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Daines

HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER

I am writing further to your four letters of 23 July to Chris Bone.

As requested, I can acknowledge receipt of both the report on the disaster by David Phillips,
then Deputy Chief Constable of Devon and Cornwall Constabulary, and of the copies of
correspondence to the Chief Constable.

With regard to the approach you have received from Ms Ann Adlington, I can confirm that
we are content for you to agree to any requests you receive for copies of statements from
those who made them. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has indicated in letters to interested parties
that documents can be made available in such circumstances.

documentation in your premises at Heeley is much appreciated, and we shall be in contact in
due course to discuss arrangements further.

Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Ward

Hillsborough Stadium Disaster

I refer to your letter of 30 July 1997 and, at the risk of appearing to be pedantic, I must ask
you to clarify one point.

We continue to receive requests for various items; for example

a)    photographs of the ground and deceased persons,

b)    statements made by the person requesting that statement,

c)    statements made by a person who authorises the release of that statement to a
       third party.

Your letter only approves the release of copies of statements to those who made them.

As indicated previously, we have been releasing papers to interested parties for many
years. We have no objection to continuing to do so but the Chief Constable is anxious not
to act without the approval of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith.

I would be obliged if you would clarify the position at your earliest convenience.

Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Bone

Hillsborough Scrutiny

On 23 July 1997 I wrote to you regarding a report by Mr David Phillips concerning the
Hillsborough Stadium Disaster. As indicated in that letter, I wrote to Mr Phillips to seek
clarification of the background to his report.

On 4 August 1997 I received a reply from Mr Phillips (attached). I believe that Mr Philips’
reply confirms my earlier view that his report does not constitute “new evidence”. However,
that is a matter for Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to decide, not me.

The Chief Constable has instructed me that anything which could be possibly construed as
new evidence should be brought to your attention and I will continue to comply with that
instruction.

Yours sincerely

                            Lord Justice Stuart-Sm ith’s Scrutiny o f Hillsborough

                  Thank you for your letter regarding the above. At the time of the Hillsborough
          Disaster I was the Secretary o f the ACPO Football Hooliganism Committee and had done
          much to promote a universal approach to the problems of policing football. As a
          consequence I was asked by the then Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, Peter Wright, if
          I would provide a professional expert opinion which might be relied upon in the civil
          proceedings which were anticipated. I prepared my report on that basis both by reference
          to the evidence which came before the hearing; statements obtained in the course of the
          enquiry led by then ACC Mervyn Jones of West Midlands and by interviewing a number
          o f people myself and examining documents. The real weight o f my report is interpretive.
          For example, I think it was highly significant that the football ground had hardly ever
          been at capacity in the preceding 12 years whereby there was no local knowledge of the
          problems relating to overcrowding; I think that the evidence relating to the previous
          overspill which Mr. Gosling dealt with and the correspondence thereafter, was of great
          importance; I believe that the failure of John Motson and so many other commentators to
          recognise overcrowding was significant; I believe that the engineering of the ground,
          particularly in relation to the lack of secure connection between turnstiles and parts of the
          ground with crowd limits, was a matter of greater importance than the enquiry considered;
          and finally I think there was a good deal of evidence about the conduct of the late arriving
          Liverpool supporters which seemed to be minimised as the enquiry concentrated upon the
          tragic blamelessness o f those who suffered.

                  I hope my observations are of some value.

                                                     With respect,

HILLSBOROUGH


We spoke about the attached letter which I have had from Ann Adlington, solicitor to the
Family Support Group.

2.     She asks in her first paragraph about the report on Hillsborough by Mr Phillips. She
suggests that we supply the Group with a copy of that report, of which it seems the families
were previously unaware.

3.      You said you would be writing to me about the origin of this report. It was, I think
you said, commissioned by Mr Wright as chief officer of South Yorkshire in anticipation of
civil actions against the force. My initial view, having briefly read the parts you sent (I do
not have pages 9 to 149) is that it is unlikely to contain any ‘new’ evidence about the disaster.
We would like to see the parts we have not yet had, but I doubt whether they will prove to be
of much interest in Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s scrutiny.

4.     But I think it would be helpful to meet Ms Adlington’s request. Do South Yorkshire
have any objection to the Group having a copy of the report (in full)? If not, I think it would
be more sensible for you to send it to her yourselves.

5.      Ms Adlington asks also for a copy of the report which your force provided to Mr
Howard before the General Election. This is, I think, the two volumes of material attached to
Mr Wells’s letter of 3 February to Paul Pugh at the Home Office. Would there by any
difficulty about that? If not, it would again help us if you could let her have the papers
direct.

6.    Ms Adlington’s last paragraph takes up the subject of the statements by Houldsworth
and Walker. I know you are actioning this. But it might help if I confirm that, as Mike
Ward said in his letter last week, there is no objection from the point of view of Lord Justice


G:\HILLSBOR\MAIN\SVORKS.027
Stuart-Smith’s scrutiny to the release of currently existing documents and photographs to
those who have a need to see them. We have no difficulty with your force policy on this
you have outlined it to us.

7.       I hope this is not too burdensome.

   Dear Mr Bone

   Farther to our recent telephone conversation I would confirm that
   Ian Daines, Assistant Chief Constable, South Yorkshire Police has
   provided me with a copy of a letter to him from your office dated
   30 July 1997.  That letter contains an acknowledgment of receipt
   of a report on the (disaster by David Phillips, then Deputy Chief
   Constable of Devon and Cornwall Constabulary. I should be
   grateful if you would supply me with a copy of this report.

   In addition, the former Home Secretary Michael Howard asked the
   Chief Constable of South Yorkshire to provide him with a detailed
   report of all the points raised in the Hillsborough programme.
   Are you able to furnish me with a copy of the report?

    Finally, please find enclosed copies of my written requests to
    South Yorkshire Police asking them to forward statements made by
    Roger Houldsworth and Dr Ed Walker.  As discussed I am extremely
    concerned at their delaying tactics and would ask you to bring
    this matter to the attention of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith.

    I thank you for your assistance.

Dear Mr Bone

Hillsborough Scrutiny

Thank you for your letter of 6 August 1997 which I received on 8 August 1997.

I have made arrangements for the Phillips report to be supplied to you. I have reservations
about making it available to a wider audience. The report was commissioned by the (then)
Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police in anticipation of civil actions against the Force.
We have appointed Winckworth Pemberton to provide legal advice to us on the Scrutiny. I
will ask Mr OWSTON to advise me on whether the release of the Phillips report to Ms
Adlington would compromise issues of confidentiality.

I have a similar reservation about the release of the report which the Chief Constable
provided to the Home Secretary before the General Election. Again I will ask for advice
from our solicitors.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, you and your staff are entitled to unrestricted access to our store
of material. I am happy to supply material to other people but not if it breaches the privacy
of others or if the material is confidential, for instance legal advice.

I will turn now to the issues raised by Ms Ann Adlington, solicitor for the Hillsborough
Families Support Group. In her letter to you, dated 5 August 1997, she says she is
“extremely concerned at their (South Yorkshire Police) delaying tactics” in supplying the
statements of two named individuals. Ms Adlington wrote to us on 17 July 1997 asking for
some statements. I wrote to you on 23 July to ask permission of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith
to release material. On 30 July 1997 you wrote to say that it was in order to release any
material we deemed fit to release. Your letter arrived on Friday 1 August 1997. I was out
of the office that day and acted upon it on Monday 4 August. I do not think this can be
construed as “delaying tactics”. Please feel free to copy all this letter to Ms Adlington if you
wish.

Yours sincerely

Dear Sir

Hillsborough Scrutiny

On 23 July 1997 the Chief Constable, Mr Richard Wells, wrote to you (copy letter attached
for ease of reference). On Page 2, Paragraph 4, he referred to a planned visit to
Hillsborough Stadium. Things were said during that visit which Mr Wells is keen that you
should know of (Mr Wells began a period of leave on 30 July 1997).

Mr Wells and I met Constable GREENWAY and Inspector CALVERT at the stadium.
Constable Greenway fulfils a role as archivist and librarian for our Hillsborough material.
Inspector Calvert worked on a number of football matches before the disaster and was
involved in planning events.

Constable Greenway had prepared an album of photographs, taken at the time of the
disaster, which allowed Mr Welis and I to picture the stadium as it was then. We walked
around the inside and outside of the ground and re-familiarised ourselves with what had
happened.

During this tour, Inspector Calvert said that officers, who had been on duty on the day of
the disaster, were instructed to write their own statements and to include anything that may
have been relevant. Inspector Calvert said that when these statements came back from
typing they had been altered in a manner that some officers had found unacceptable, but
they had nonetheless signed the statements.

Inspector Calvert said that officers were coached in evidence to give to Lord Taylor’s
enquiry but that practice ceased part way through the enquiry when it became apparent
that officers were unable or unwilling to adhere to an unacceptable version of the truth.

The Chief Constable and I were concerned at the implications of Inspector Calvert’s
comments. We did not question him nor comment lest any such action be misconstrued.
At the conclusion of our visit, Mr Wells and I discussed what we had heard.

Mr Wells said that in the seven years he has been Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, he
has not previously heard such things, nor have I in my 12 months with South Yorkshire.
Nonetheless, we resolved to act upon Inspector Calvert’s comments.

Our store of Hillsborough Disaster material is held in the Discipline and Complaints
Department at Heeley Police office. The acting Head of that Department is Superintendent
Alan FOSTER. Mr Wells and I discussed with Superintendent Foster the action to be
taken. Superintendent Foster said that he had been a member of the team of officers who
had worked on the enquiry that followed the disaster. Part of that team’s role was to liaise
with the officers of West Midlands Police and to facilitate their work. Superintendent Foster
recalled that officers on duty at the disaster were instructed to write their “recollections” and
to put down anything they felt, as well as what they believed to be true. He said that, on
legal advice, the recollections were then converted into statements of evidence. He was
unsure of the source of that advice as he was relying upon his memory of events some
eight years ago.

Superintendent Foster recollected that officers who were to give evidence to Lord Taylor’s
enquiry were prepared in the sense that they were briefed. Lord Taylor’s enquiry was
conducted differently to officers’ experiences of giving evidence in a criminal court. It was
an enquiry not a trial. The nature of giving evidence, and questions on that evidence, were
not as in a criminal case. The event itself was traumatic for many officers in a way that is
rare in criminal trials.

As discussed with Mr Wells and Superintendent Foster, I examined our archive of
Hillsborough Disaster material. The “recollections” of officers are systematically filed there.
Some are handwritten. Some are typed in a manner that suggests to me that the officers
did the typing (spelling mistakes, poor type alignment, etc). All that was written in the
recollections was then typed into the HOLMES computer. HOLMES (Home Office Large
Major Enquiry System) was launched in 1987 and the Hillsborough Disaster was one of the
first major uses of it in South Yorkshire.

The typed recollections have been annotated by indexers, police officers who identifying
salient points to be entered in the HOLMES index. For instance, if Constable 123 SMITH
refers to being on duty in serial 21 under the supervision of Sergeant 456 JONES, the
indexer would highlight “serial 21” and “Sergeant 456 JONES” as cross references. Actions
would be raised to ensure that a statement was obtained from Sergeant 456 Jones and
other officers in serial 21.

Some of the typed recollections show pencil lines through some sentences.                 These
statements are in a box marked “Amended Statements”.

I examined a small number of randomly selected amended statements. One officer’s
statement contained a page of information about the writer’s feelings the following day
(shock, distress etc) and the reactions of his colleagues. That part of his statement was
deleted no doubt because it was not relevant to the causes of the disaster. Another
statement referred to the duties performed by Special Constables on the day of the
disaster. The officer expressed opinions to the effect that Special Constables should be
confined to traffic point duties. That part of his statement was deleted, no doubt because it
was opinion not evidence. One statement has a note attached which says that the officer
declined to delete parts of it.

Also in the archive is a letter dated 7 June 1989 from Mr Mervyn JONES, Assistant Chief
Constable, West Midlands Police, to Mr David BRUMMELL, Treasury Solicitor.                 Mr
Brummell was one of the team who assisted Lord Taylor in his enquiry. I attach a copy of
Mr Jones’ letter. The opening sentence is pertinent to this matter and I quote it in full;

       “You will recall that in the early stages, because o f the slowness o f the supply o f
       written recollections from South Yorkshire officers, it was agreed that we would take
       from them their initial submissions which would be later superseded by their signed
       final versions, after they had been checked by the appropriate legal advice’’.

I attach a copy of Mr Brummell’s reply, also dated 7 June 1989. Mr Brummell recognises
that “expressions of opinion were removed from the first versions”. He also says, “it would
not be appropriate to use the original statement for the purpose of the inquiry when this has
been superseded by a subsequent statement”.

The conclusion I draw from this is that the existence of the “recollections” was known to
Lord Taylor’s team and there was no aspect of suppressing evidence. It is a matter for
your Lordship to decide whether Inspector Calvert has “fresh evidence” to offer but my
opinion is that Inspector Calvert was not conversant with what happened and has
misunderstood a perfectly open and proper procedure.

I hold a similar view of Inspector Calvert’s statement that officers were coached in the
evidence to give. In chapter 18 of his interim report, Lord Taylor comments specifically on
the evidence of police officers (paragraphs 279 and 280). Lord Taylor said, "... I must
report that for the most part the quality o f their (police officers) evidence was in inverse
proportion to their rank . . . the senior officers in command were defensive and evasive
witnesses . . . neither their handling o f problems on the day nor their account o f it in
evidence showed the qualities o f leadership to be expected o f their rank.”

As a police officer, it gives me no comfort to say that Lord Taylor clearly found some police
witnesses lacking. He was more than capable of determining the truth of what he heard
and had good lawyers to help him.

I think it naive of Inspector Calvert to confuse briefing with coaching. To even attempt to
manipulate witnesses, about to face such a rigorous process with so much hard evidence
(videos, photographs), would have been foolish as well as criminal.
In the spirit of openness that is the hallmark of Mr Wells’ style, he briefed Her Majesty’s
Inspector of Constabulary, Mr John STEVENS QPM, LLB, MPhil, CIMgt, on these
developments. I am sending this letter to him to bring him up to date.

The Chief Constable is determined that any report which even hints at new evidence
should be put before your Lordship and that such notifications should be made at the
earliest opportunity. For this reason I report these matters to you with only very limited
research. I am confident that additional research would shed further light on Inspector
Calvert’s comments. If you wish me to undertake that research, or to assist your staff in
that work, I will be glad to assist.

Yours faithfully

THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER: SCRUTINY OF MATERIAL

Thank you very much indeed for your recent letter, which I received on 21 July, with its
helpful information and suggestion.

Its arrival coincided with the finalisation of a letter which I had just written to you, stimulated
by your news release on 14 July.

I will take the opportunity, in this slightly amended letter, if I may, to deal with my original
points and your own.

I was very interested to hear from the Home Secretary that he had decided to place in your
hands the task of reviewing material associated with the Hillsborough Disaster. Whatever
your final decision, you will be aware of strongly polarised views on the desirability o f a full
new public inquiry. The combination of your judicial independence and your seniority within
the Court of Appeal will be invaluable in underwriting the integrity o f the process o f scrutiny.

Reading your recent press release, I see that you have declared your intention to visit the
families in Merseyside, with their legal representatives.

I wonder if you would think it helpful if you were to visit other parties as well, not only for the
obvious advantage of transparent even-handedness, but for very practical purposes, too.

For example, I would very much like to brief you personally on the stance which I have taken
towards the awful consequences of the 1989 events, since arriving to take command of the
Force in 1990. The very basis of this stance is a frank acknowledgement of the errors which
can be attributed to the South Yorkshire Police.

Needless to say, I wouldn't dream of canvassing you on the question of the material to be
placed before you in the more formal part of your scrutiny.

It is my firm belief that all the evidence held by the South Yorkshire Police was made available
to earlier appropriate authorities with an interest in discerning the causes of the disaster.
However, the publicity surrounding the Home Secretary's latest decision has stimulated a
number of approaches to our Force on different themes. Rather than making assumptions
about your interest or otherwise in these offers or enquiries, I have asked Assistant Chief
Constable Ian Daines to forward them to your secretary, Mr Bone.

We will, of course, make available to you and to your secretarial support team any
documentation you need to pursue your scrutiny and which is under our control. The total
material which we house is stored in a room some 15 feet square. All four walls are full from
floor to ceiling with, in addition, a central column (allowing a barely reasonable amount of
access) which also reaches from floor to ceiling. It probably amounts to around two tons in
weight. I describe it in this way only to give you some impression, at a distance, of its scale
and volume.

Ian Daines has already spoken to Mr Bone, offering him (and yourself, should you wish it)
ready access. I will be happy to meet your request for information about the nature of these
documents by 4 August and will try to make it as digestible as possible.

On Saturday 26 July, a small number of officers will be going to the Hillsborough Stadium to
re-familiarise ourselves, or in the case of some officers, to acquaint themselves for the first
time, with the reconfigured ground. Some features remain intact (particularly outside the
ground) following alterations pursuant to the late Lord Chief Justice Taylor's 1989
recommendations but others are, thankfully, very different.

I tell you this only so that you are aware of our intentions and, if you were so minded, to
mention such a facility (willingly provided by Sheffield Wednesday Football Club) to the
Merseyside families when you meet them.

This is one of the other "practical purposes" to which I referred earlier, should you
contemplate visiting other parties.

Whatever your decisions in these matters, you may be assured of my fullest co-operation.

            SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE RECOLLECTIONS

            You will recall in the early stages, because of the slowness of the
            supply of written recollections from South Yorkshire Police Officers, it
            was agreed that we would take from them their initial submissions which
            would be later superseded by their signed final versions, after they had
            been checked by their appropriate legal advice.  I personally made an
            undertaking with the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police that only
            the final versions would be the ones used in the Public Inquiry and this
            was after discussion with you.

            I am concerned that yesterday an officer was referred to his initial
            submission which contained opinion that had subsequently been removed
            from his final account.     Given the undertaking I made to South Yorkshire
            Police I would hope that this would    not happen in the future because It
            was only on that understanding that we received their information as
            early as we did.

            I have formalised this in writing because this effects our personal
            integrity in the matter.  I have copied this letter to the Chief
            Constable of South Yorkshire Police for his information.

                               SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE RECOLLECTIONS

           Thank you for your letter of today's date, which we have already discussed.

          The main difference between the initial and final versions of the South
      Yorkshire Police Officers' statements is that any expressions of opinion were
      (as I understand it, on the advice of Mr. Woodward) removed from the final
      version. As I understand it, Andrew Collins' view is that there is absolutely
      no reason for excluding such expressions of opinion when they touch on matters
      relevant to the Public Inquiry and that, in the circumstances, there is no
      objection in principle to written statements containing such opinions being
      submitted to the Inquiry.

          Clearly, in view of the personal undertaking which you have given to the
      Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, Andrew Collins agrees that it would not be
-v    appropriate to use the original statement for the purposes of the Inquiry when
      this has been superseded by a subsequent statement. However', what I understand
      may have happened in the case of the Officer who gave his evidence yesterday is
      that the original unamended statement was circulated because of the need to
      circulate statements to all parties as much in advance of the calling of the
      relevant witnesses as possible and because at the time of circulation of the
      relevant batch of witness statements the revised, final version of the
      statement in question had not yet been received.  I understand that in total
      there are three cases where this has been necessary: P.C.s Best, Huckstepp and
      Illingworth. However, in such cases only the final, revised version of the
      statement was given to the press.

           I trust that this problem will not recur in the future.

          I have not copied this letter to the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire
      Police, but am naturally happy for you to do so.

Dear Mr Owston

New Hillsborough Enquiry

I was pleased to meet you in London on 3 July 1997.

On the basis and in the expectation that we will be able to settle an appropriate fee rate South
Yorkshire Police propose to retain the services of Winckworth & Pemberton. These instructions
extend to your firm representing the Chief Constable and senior officers of South Yorkshire Police
Force and the Police Authority in connection with the forthcoming scrutiny of possible new evidence,
which will be conducted by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith.

The Chief Constable's representative who will be in charge of an internal team of officers in
connection with the scrutiny will be the Assistant Chief Constable, Mr Ian Daines.

We would be pleased to meet you and your colleagues here at Police Headquarters, in order to
discuss the situation. We would then be very pleased to show you the archives held by South
Yorkshire Police arising from the Hillsborough Disaster.

I would be grateful if you would arrange for your secretary to contact Mr Daines' secretary,
           >n 0114 252 3405, in order to arrange the meeting.

Yours sincerely

Dear Alan

Hillsborough Stadium Scrutiny

I am most grateful to you, Mr Daines and PC Greenway for the extremely focused and
succinct introductory meeting which took place yesterday. We emerged from it with a
reasonably clear idea of the way forward at this stage although of course events that we are
not yet aware of and factors which have not yet been taken into account will inevitably
change the present plans and the present horizon.

It seems that the present Scrutiny has been brought about by pressure from bereaved
relatives and others who allege that hitherto unseen video recordings have been unearthed
and that there is new evidence to suggest that victims were dying after 3.15 pm. from causes
which were either new or continuing after that time - on the 15th April 1989.

It seems that the concern over the video evidence is a sort of hysterical linking of the
knowledge that there were two video tapes which were lost or went missing on the night of
the 15th/16th April and these related to specific fixed video cameras covering specific
turnstiles. The drama/documentary produced in December last year used video footage
which Yorkshire Television had "discovered" in their archives. There is a popular belief,
and it seems to be one of the factors which has led to the current Scrutiny, that the video
material produced by Yorkshire Television was drawn, in part at least, from the two video
cassettes which went missing shortly after the disaster.

As you explained so ably yesterday, nothing could be further from the truth. The videos
of the turnstiles have still not been found and the other videos, allegedly "discovered", had
in fact been made available at the time of Lord Justice Taylor’s Inquiry but were of poor
quality and may not have been given a lot of attention.

The other element of the "new evidence" is more in the nature of medical expert opinion
than actual new evidence. It also seems to be sparked by the drama/documentary and it has
caused deep concern from Dr Edward Walker who was the anaesthetist who went to the
Northern General Hospital at Sheffield when he learnt about the disaster and coped, first
hand, with several resuscitations in the initial wave.

With proper investigation and possibly with the assistance of further expert medical opinion,
it should be perfectly possible to show that there are no inconsistencies between what the
Coroner found, the basic factual information that Lord Justice Taylor was working on and
what Dr Walker now recollects in the light of the drama/documentary. This may however
be a slightly more grey area partly because death by asphyxiation is probably not an exact
science and partly because there are other contributory factors in each victim’s case.
Nevertheless the causative background must be very similar and the only area for further
investigation, if it be due, will be the extended period from 3.15 pm. onwards when the
terraces were still being cleared and/or treatment and resuscitation was being given as best
they could. To that extent medical evidence of the scene at the time will be significant.
Even so the causative effects may be difficult to distinguish post 3.15 pm. compared to pre
3.15 pm.

The way in which we intend to tackle this is to apply appropriate resources with appropriate
experience to the case but not to treat it as a cause celebre and either do more or react
further than is actually necessary. Both I and -Ailsa Lawrence have experience of this type
of tribunal but certainly not of any disaster of this scale. The most recent case we have been
dealing with, as I believe Chris Porteous has explained to you, is an Inquiry involving the
Essex Police where one prisoner killed another whilst on remand at Chelmsford Jail, having
been held in custody for a few days by Essex Police. The role and duties of the police and
the sometimes differing considerations between Essex Police as an entity and the individual
officers in it come into relief in such cases. We are familiar with the law and practice and
procedure of such tribunals although we would highlight the fact that the subject matter of
these instructions has been called a Scrutiny and as such its status is somewhat unclear.

It will be for Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to say liow he thinks the Scrutiny should proceed
but we hope and believe the intention is reasonably clear to identify whether or not there is
genuinely any new evidence and the bearing any such evidence would have upon the
findings of the Taylor Inquiry, the criminal investigation and the PCA investigation. If there
is new evidence it will of course have to be fully disclosed and it was absolutely apparent
to us that that of course is the intention and desire of South Yorkshire Police. The other
outcome of this Scrutiny may well be to bring the public inquiry aspect of this disaster to
a conclusion or at least to an end. As Mr Daines pointed out in his opening remarks, it may
have some bearing on the findings of the Inquest in which case the likelihood of a full
blown inquiry would greatly increase.

The terms of reference of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s appointment are -

       "To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at Hillsborough
       Stadium on 15th April 1989 which was not available:-

               (a)    to the Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or

               (b)    to the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General for the
                       purpose of discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or
                                            -3 -

              (c)     to the Chief Officer of South Yorkshire Police in relation to police
                      disciplinary matters.

       And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is of
       such significance as to justify the establishment by the Secretary of State for the
       Home Department of a further public inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw
       to their attention any evidence not previously considered by them which may be
       relevant to their respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action
       which should be taken in the public interest."


We therefore decided to proceed as quickly as reasonably possible:-

1.     to view the drama/documentary which has sparked off this renewed concern and has
       given the impression that there is new evidence;

2.     to identify what video evidence was made available to Yorkshire Television and if
       possible to identify the evidence relied on for the drama/documentary and to prove
       beyond all doubt that it was not new video evidence and had been made available to
       Lord Justice Taylor;

3.     to prove and confirm that the video footage in respect of the so-called "new"
       evidence is in no way associated with the two lost video tapes;

4.     to review the existing factual and medical evidence about the time of death and the
      findings of the Inquest in that respect with a view to identifying whether further
      expert medical opinion would be appropriate on that subject and the incidence it
      would have on the findings of the Inquest and the other findings of fact relating to
      the disaster and its management immediately before and after 3.15 pm. on the day;

5.      to request from Lord Justice Stuart-Smith the guidelines and procedures he proposes
       to set up for the carrying out of the Scrutiny;

6.     to advise and consider on the involvement of the other agencies, individuals and
       authorities involved in the disaster, its immediate aftermath and its management
       having regard to any findings of fact or revised expert opinion in the light of the
       above factors;

7.     to advise you throughout with regard to the interests of the police authority and any
       conflict which may arise or divergence between those interests and the interests of
       individuals or other agencies as mentioned above;

8.     to have regard to any conflicts of interests which might exist or might become
       apparent between the advice being given by other solicitors in relation to civil actions
       or claims for compensation arising either in connection with the proceedings now
       being taken to the House of Lords, any new proceedings which are not statute barred
                                            -4 -

       and any claims for compensation in relation to serving officers which are in process;
       to advise you of any conflicts and the appropriate steps to be taken to perform your
       duties and obligations as a police authority in the light of the Scrutiny, any
       subsequent inquiry and such civil litigation and associated matters as you have
       informed us of;

9.     to liaise with you and keep you informed of developments and likely consequences
       in which case for general purposes of course our client is South Yorkshire Police and
       we are ultimately answerable to the Chief Constable. For immediate purposes
       however we would regard our day to day client as you, the force solicitor. If there
       are matters of policy that we wish to be informed of or alert you to or in respect of
       which we have questions to ask we would refer the matter to the Assistant Chief
       Constable, Mr Ian Daines and for daily fact gathering purposes and for access to the
       archive of material we would refer directly to PC Greenway.

I must point out that the parameters of these instructions cannot be regarded as exhaustive
and facts, directions from Lord Justice Stuart-Smith and other developments may alter these
considerations. However the above sets out the intention and the starting point of the
working method and objectives. Perhaps, although not so specific, the overall objectives
which so clearly emerged from our discussion were that if there was any new material it
should of course be disclosed immediately and that South Yorkshire Police would continue
with their policy of the fullest possible co-operation to the public and the Scrutiny in
general. However in view of the Scrutiny itself immediate steps have been taken to make
the archive of material secure and, as was evident from our visit, it is currently under a 24
hour police guard. During the review of the evidence foi the purposes of reporting to Lord
Justice Stuart-Smith I believe you may temporarily suspend your policy of providing copies
of any documents or other matters referred to which are in the archive and this I think
would be a prudent move otherwise it might appear that new information is being
disseminated at a point of increased and renewed public interest. In fact everything which
is within the archive was made available to Lord Justice Taylor and it would not be in the
interests of the Scrutiny for any impression to the contrary to be given.

I am also taking this opportunity of enclosing my firm’s standard terms and conditions of
engagement. As I am at the moment the Managing and Senior Partner, in the event of a
complaint or of a serious lack of satisfaction other than the day to day management of any
team operating under me that matter should be referred to the Partnership Chairman, Paul
Morris who of course is a fellow partner of mine. In the event of any difficultly or review
of the conduct of the case falling short of a complaint then the matter should be referred to
me.

I am enclosing a diagram showing the organisational structure of the firm. We are in fact
a client-led firm. That means that our departments are divided up by client or client type
rather than work type. Similar skills exist in various departments but the underlying
objective is that each major client or client type should receive a one-stop service in the
department in question. For special cases we can marshal cross-department teams. In the
event of a public inquiry the team would be based on the element responding to you now,
                                             -5 -

CGS-Commercial and Tax, where you already have one of the assistant solicitors, Ailsa and
we would probably draw on CGS Litigation and also our Parliamentary Department (they
are always doing public inquiries).

The circumstances of this case are such that it could require enormous commitment and it
might demand very significant legal resources if it goes to a public inquiry. For the
purposes of the Scrutiny however I think that I myself and Ailsa Lawrence with suitable
support and backup are sufficient to cope with it with all the co-operation that I know we
will have from yourselves. In the event of more help being necessary then, as the matter
is reviewed and as the liaison and instruction process takes place, you will be made aware
of that and the team will be enlarged if that is necessary. I start however from the premise
that such resources as are necessary to deliver the professional result which is agreed will
be provided and, within the boundaries of reasonableness, no more and no less resources will
be put into this case than is necessary to achieve that proper professional result.

So far as the involvement of counsel is concerned we do not think it is necessary at this
stage and in particular not before some form of representation is needed with Lord Justice
Stuart-Smith in connection with the terms of reference and conduct of the Scrutiny. We did
however suggest that it would be sensible to identify a suitable counsel and possibly even
retain counsel to be certain that the person of the right calibre and knowledge was already
retained on behalf of South Yorkshire Police. We put forward the name of Jeremy
Gompertz QC in that respect.

Finally we touched on the question of charging rates. Having due regard to all the
circumstances I would suggest that a flat charging rate of £|     [>er hour be applied whether
the work is done by a partner or Ailsa Lawrence who is an experienced and senior solicitor.
We quote this figure because it is an "out of London" rate and is aimed at being competitive
with the sort of price that we believe you should je paying for the right level of advice from
a local firm. The figure is put forward for agreement and is not regarded as immutable.
Equally it is put forward as a serious figure and is not simply meant to be a bargaining
factor.

At the moment we are learning about the case and the facts of the whole matter. However
we think it should be possible to advise you in the initial stages on the above basis without
ourselves carrying out a massive review of all the evidence. That is in accordance with our
policy of using resources sensibly and in conformity with agreed objectives to thorough
professional standards.

I submit this letter to you therefore as the basis for formally entering into a professional
relationship as described.

Yours sincerely_______________________________

  Dear Alan

  Hillsborough Stadium Scrutiny

  We have now received the video of the drama/documentary and both Ailsa and I have
  watched it. We have also completed our reading of the Taylor Reports and the information
  is beginning to assemble itself in our brains in something approaching the correct context
  and emphasis.

  The points that struck us from the video of the drama/documentary were really as follows:-

   1.                   We missed the reference to the unidentified doctor but, as has been pointed out to
                       us, there is a clear statement from the anaesthetist Dr Edward Walker which of
                       course had been taken shortly after the disaster and which was available to Lord
                       Justice Taylor. Presumably Dr Walker can be reminded of this. Also we can
                       presumably prove, for example by way of affidavit (perhaps of PC Greenway), that
                       the statement made by Dr Walker was made available to the Inquiry, the Inquest and
                       the D.P.P. at the time of the original investigation.

  2.                  There was reference in the documentary to the fact that ambulances and medical
                      teams were not allowed through to the pitch more or less as an operational police
                       decision. That is not the way that the Taylor Report read. I rather gained the
                       impression there that the first few ambulances to arrive did not go onto the pitch
                       because of the difficulty of gaining access to it although eventually a St John’s
                       ambulance did. I did not appreciate that there was an operational decision not to
                       admit ambulances to the pitch. Could you please confirm whether this was in fact
                       the case.

   3.                 It is clear from the medical statements and in particular those of Dr Wardrope, who
                       of course had an overview of the whole emergency, that medical teams were not

       dispatched to the stadium until well into the emergency and that was because of lack
       of resources at the casualty units. There is also evidence, though, that emergency
       resuscitation activity was going on at the stadium and in the gymnasium. There were
       presumably doctors and first aiders present including ambulance crews who had gone,
       on foot, into the stadium. Presumably there are extensive statements to explain this
       better. I think it will become relevant to re-examine the amount of trained medical
       and first aid help that there was available inside the stadium.

4.     The drama/documentary was pure drama throughout the entire inquest sequences.
       However if that drama is to be believed, evidence was being given that there were
       still compacted people on the terraces at between 3.20pm. and 3.25pm. That may
       be contained in existing evidence. If that is the case, it may result in a request for
       further expert opinion in relation to the cause of death in respect of people either
       unconscious or semi-conscious and in a compacted state post 3 .15pm.

5.     The above could have a bearing on the police and other emergency services’ conduct
       of the disaster.


The other issue of course relates to the video evidence. From the drama/documentary there
were sections which were clearly acted and others which were taken from a number of
different sources. There were what looked like one or two shots which could have come
from police/Hillsborough CCTV but I am at the moment substantially unversed in this area.

We do however need to "nail" the whole question of whether there is any new footage of
any kind. Despite what was said in the drama/documentary I of course understand that the
missing videos have nothing to do with the actual disaster and were fixed cameras looking
at particular turnstiles (in one case obscured by a wall). The target we were trying to
achieve with PC Greenway was to identify the bits of footage which were used in the
drama/documentary and to demonstrate that they were all drawn from material which had
been supplied by the police to Yorkshire Television and to confirm and explain that the
missing videos had nothing whatever to do with the disaster itself.

The final stage in all this is the method and way which we propose to adopt for informing
Lord Justice Stuart-Smith of the absence of any new evidence and/or the submission of any
new expert evidence in the grey ''causative” a.‘ea which we have identified. The terms of
reference of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith make it clear that he is to decide:-

(a)   Whether there is indeed any new evidence; and

(b)   Whether that new evidence is sufficient to justify a new inquiry. His terms of
      reference also provide for him to draw to the attention of both the D P.P. and the
      Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police "any evidence not previously considered
      by them which may be relevant to their respective duties".

We will need to consider further, both with you and at some stage through making
                                           -3 -

representations to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, how exactly he will interpret these terms of
reference. If we can show conclusively that the "new" video evidence was made available
to the Inquiry, the D.P.P. and the police for disciplinary purposes and that a statement was
taken from Dr Walker which again was made available then on a very simple view of the
matter there is no new evidence. However Lord Justice Stuart-Smith may consider that the
evidence of people breathing after 3.15pm. constitutes evidence which ought to be brought
to the attention of the D.P.P. and the police at this stage because it is evidence to which
nobody gave proper consideration at the time. Since this is very likely to be the case we
will need to verse ourselves much better with all the medical evidence and it is likely we
will also need further expert medical opinions.

Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Owston

Hillsborough Disaster Scrutiny

Thank you for your letter of 29 July 1997 and your fax of 5 August 1997. They show that
you and Ailsa Lawrence have quickly mastered a very complex issue. Your letters were
addressed to Alan Walker, Force Solicitor. He and I have discussed the issues you raise.

Alan’s role was to secure the services of a good solicitor (yourselves), to arrange a first
meeting and to advise me on terms of engagement.             I attach your “Client Care”
memorandum which I have signed. Now that we have completed the formalities, Alan will
withdraw.

On the specific topic of medical evidence, Ailsa and I discussed a few thoughts on 5
August. The Sheffield Coroner, Dr Stefan POPPER, conducted the inquest into 95 deaths.
The inquest jury ruled that death was caused by “accident”. In recent months articles have
appeared in newspapers reporting interviews with Dr Edward WALKER. He has also been
interviewed on television. Dr Walker has said that he was not seen by police officers
enquiring into the disaster. He has also said that some people were alive after 3.15pm
Saturday 15 April 1989; the time at which Dr POPPER ruled that they were dead.

Constable GREENWAY gave you a file of papers relating to these issues. One item is a
statement dated 20 July 1989, by Dr Walker. The original is seven pages long. The
photocopy (which you have) does not reveal that the original is written in blue ink as are the
signatures of Dr Walker. The persons witnessing his signature, police officers DICKS and
APPLETON, have signed in black ink. Dr Walker has left a blank line between paragraphs;
a practice not used by police officers when writing statements. My point is that Dr Walker
did make a statement, he wrote it himself, signed his name eight times, two police officers
witnessed the process and it happened three months after the disaster. I am therefore at a
loss to understand why he is saying he did not make a statement.




                                                                           Direct Line: 0114 2523405
            Tel: 0114 2202020                                              Direct Fax: 0114 2523481
We have received numerous requests, over the years, for copies of documents. We have
released statements to deponents, solicitors acting on their behalf and persons authorised
by deponents. We have released plans and sketches to anyone with a genuine interest.
We have released crowd scene video stills and photographs to anyone with a genuine
interest. We have been cautious about releasing photographs of casualties. We have
released these photographs to close family members or their solicitors but not if a
photograph shows another identifiable casualty. We follow this policy out of respect for
the privacy of other people. We also release statements which have been made public at
the inquest and/or Lord Taylor’s enquiry.

Miss Ann ADLINGTON is a solicitor representing the Hillsborough Family Support Group.
She has written to us asking for various statements and has produced authorisations
signed by the deponents. Some requests have been received since the Home Secretary
announced the establishment of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s Scrutiny. I have written to Mr
Chris BONE, Secretary to the Scrutiny, to say that I have no objection to releasing material
but do not propose to do so until I have his permission. I am keen not to cut across the
work of his Lordship. The first reply from Mr Bone only referred to releasing statements to
those who made them. I wrote again to ask if it was in order to release statements to
authorised third parties and if it was in order to release sketches and photographs (subject
to the restriction described above). I kept Miss Adlington informed of each development.
On Monday 4 August 1997 I received a reply from Mr Bone’s office which gave unequivocal
approval to release papers.

About midday, Monday 4 August 1997, I received a telephone call from Dr Walker querying
the delay in supplying his statement to Miss Adlington. I explained why I had delayed and
that I would be replying shortly. I pointed out to him that I had seen press coverage of his
remarks to the effect that he had not been seen by police officers and had not made a
statement. He replied that he could not recall whether or not he had made a statement. I
told him two police officers had witnessed his signature on his statement. He agreed, that
being the case, that his memory may be flawed.

The file, which Constable Greenway gave you, contains;

a)     a photocopy and typed copy of Dr Walker’s statement;

b)     transcripts of evidence to the inquest by James WARDROPE (Consultant),
        Professor Alan USHER, Dr David SLATER and Dr Ernest GUMPERT;

c)     statements by Mr WARDROPE.

In view of the eminence of these people (especially Alan USHER) and theshilly-shallying of
Dr Walker, I do not think we need to pursue further medical opinion. If we did, I would feel
obliged to divulge it to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, whatever it might say. Also, I feel that it is
for Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to decide whether he wishes to gather further evidence in
response to what he is told.
Similarly, the preparation of an affidavit by Constable Greenway (regarding Dr Walker’s
statement being available) can be prepared if Lord Justice Stuart-Smith receives evidence
from Dr Walker and asks us to respond.

At the Sheffield inquest, Counsel for the Chief Constable declined to be drawn into the
argument over time of death. The 1993 judicial review of the Coroners’ verdict was
focused on time of death and the High Court ruled that the coroner’s 3.15 pm cut-off time
should stand. For all these reasons, we should wait and see what medical issues we are
asked to comment upon.

I take the same view of aspects of the Hillsborough drama programme. Its maker, Mr
McGOVERN, does not claim that every element of the programme is factually correct.
Therefore, we do not need to “disprove” facets of the programme such as whether or not
ambulances went onto the pitch.

I attach a draft statement which David Maclean MP, Home Office Minister, was to make to
the House of Commons. In the event the Home Secretary, Michael Howard MP, addressed
the House in somewhat different terms. You may find this draft a useful briefing document.

I attach a draft letter which I propose to send to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith.     I would
welcome your advice on it.

I will be on leave from Saturday 8 August 1997 and will be back at work on Friday 27
August 1997. I would be grateful to hear from you before I go on leave.

Yours sincerely




Ian Daines
Assistant Chief Constable

ADJOURNMENT          DEBATE:         HILLSBOROUGH         - D RAFT        SPEAKING       NOTE      FO R    MR
MACLEAN



I w o u l d like to join w it h the Hon Member for L i v e r p o o l W a l t o n in
e x p r e s s i n g my d e e p e s t sympathy for the families of those w h o were
invol v e d in the         tragic events               at Hillsborough.             I k n o w I speak
for the w h o l e H o u s e in s a y i n g that o u r thoughts will r e m a i n with
them this Christmas,                  which I k now they m ust find a p a r t i c u l a r l y
difficult         time of        the year.


A n y b o d y who saw      the news reports               that d r e a d f u l    Satur d a y      - 15th
of April 1989 - w i l l have been o v e r w h e l m e d by those t e r r i b l e and
d i s t r e s s i n g pictures.        X kno w that for the families w h o s u f f e r e d
such a p p a l l i n g tragedy their loss was made all the w o r s e by the
fact    that       they    arose       out of      an event w h i c h       should have            been      a
n ormal      family outing.


F a c t u a l d r a m a m e a n s points can't be challenged.
The     Hon       Member       for     Liverpool         Walton      has    howe v e r      drawn         the
att e n t i o n of the H ouse not so much                     to the events themselves but
to    a programme          -    a    so    called       factual    drama     - which         was        s hown
recently on C h a n n e l            4. The makers of the p r o g r a m m e H i l l s b o r o u g h
have e m p h a s i s e d that they were acting on behalf of the families.
Bur     I    must     admit         that     1    have    a   deep    sense       of     unease          when
p r ogramme makers choose to make their points                               through a d r a m a t i c
format,       w hich      plays       upon       the    emotions     of    viewers       rather          than
through a d o c u m e n t a r y which can allow points to be d i s c u s s e d or
challenged.


Pr o gramme w r o n g about the miss i n g video
So t.he p r o g r a m m e makers made a two hour                      ‘'drama d o c u m entary"             in
which       they c l a i m they raised a number of fresh points.                                  In     fact
many of these points had already been considered by Lord T a y l o r ' s
 inquiry.         In p a r t i c u l a r I understand the programme makers clai m e d
 that e vidence had come to light about a so called missing video
 tape       and   that     the      Coroner       had    been   wrong      in    co n s i d e r i n g    that
 those who d ied were dead by 3.15.


 If the pro g r a m m e makers had used a normal d o c u m e n t a r y format and
invited       S outh     Yorkshire       Police       to    comm e n t   on    the     charges,          I
u n d e r s t a n d that S o u t h Y o rkshire Police could have told t h e m that
the    alleged         missing     video       which       is    s u p posed    to     hav e      shown
e v i d e n c e of o v e r c r o w d i n g on the terraces is not m i s s i n g at all.
It    never     has      been.     The    film       is    in   the    possession         of      S outh
Y o r k s h i r e P o l i c e and was g iven both to the Taylor inquiry and to
the inquest.


It is true that a v i d e o from a fixed camera,                         d i r e c t e d not at the
enclosures        where     the tragedy          took place but at             the turnstiles,
did indeed d i s a p p e a r on the night of the disaster.                            I understand
that   this       particular       video       was    never     in the p o s s e s s i o n       of    the
police.     The        loss of    the    video was         reported      as a c rime         bu t     the
culp r i t w a s not detected.            This v i d e o has n ever b e e n found an d it
is not the v i d e o that the pro g r a m m e makers appear to be c l a i m i n g
as new e v i d e n c e .


If the p r o g r a m m e makers had used a normal d o c u m e n t a r y s tyle they
would hav e b een forced to show that the matter of the ti m i n g of
the deat hs and whet h e r the Coroner had made a mist a k e in taking
a 3.15      cut    off point had already                  been considered         by a judicial
review.        The       producers        chose       not       to    give     aud i e n c e s        that
information.            Instead    they    called         for another public            inquiry.         I
will dis c u s s       that call in a moment.


F our i n v e s t i g a t i o n s already taken p lace
But    first       I    would     like    to    remind      the      House     that    there          have
 already      bee n     four    independent          investigations          or reviews          of    the
 Hillsborough           tragedy:


                  there was Lord Taylor's                  inquiry


        *         there was the inquest into each of the 95 d e a t h s


                  there     was    the     investigation              into    police     behaviour
                  s u pervised by the PCA


                  finally,       there was the judicial review of the inquest.
Each of     these       a d i f f e r e n t purpose;           I think it m i g h t be h e l p f u l
if I w e r e   just to say a little about of each of these inquiries
and t heir outcome.


Lord T a y lor's enquiry
First,     the     formal           inquiry       by    Lord     Justice       Taylor.          This       was
c o m m i s s i o n e d by then Home S e cretary on the s e c o n d day a f t e r the
disaster.      It terms of reference were not only to inquire into the
events but a l s o to make r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s about the needs of c rowd
cont r o l and safety at sports events.


Ove r    31 days b e t w e e n the 15th of Ma y and the 29th of June,                                  L ord
T a y l o r h e a r d o ral e v i d e n c e from 174 witnesses at a public h e a r i n g
in      Sheffield.        He        also     recei v e d       evidence        in    the        form        of
s u b m i s s i o n s and letters.          The inquiry c o nsidered v ideo film from
three     separ a t e    sources          which    provided          in all    some       71    hours       of
further evidence.


Lord T a y l o r p u blished an interim report in A u g u s t w hich set out
the causes        for the disaster and m a d e immediate recommendations,
he found that there were a number of causes why the d i s a s t e r took
place.     He found that:


                 the immediate cause of the gross o v e r c r o w d i n g was the
                 failure       to     cut    of    access       to    the    central       pens       which
                 were already o v e r f u l l .


                 they     were       already       overfull          because    no       safe    maximum
                 capacities had been laid down,                         no a t t e m p t was mad e to
                 control        entry        to    individual          pens    numerically,                and
                 there        was    no     effective          visual       monitoring          of    crowd
                 densi t y .


                 he found that when the influx from gate C e n t e r e d pen
                 3,     the    layout        of    the    barriers          there    a f f orded       less
                 prot e c t i o n     than    they       should      have    done    and       a barr i e r
                 collapsed.


                 he     found       that     the       need    to    open    gat e   C    was        due    to
                   dangerous            congestion              at        the       turnstiles.               Tha t
                   c o n g e s t i o n o c c u r r e d because,           as bot h the club and the
                   po l i c e s h o u l d h ave realised,                 the t u r nstile a r e a c o u l d
                   not     ea s i l y    cop e     with       the large         numb e r s      unless        they
                   a rri v e d s t e a d i l y over a lengthy period. The p o l i c e had
                   failed to d r a w up plans as                         to how they w o u l d c o n t r o l
                   large      numbers          sh o u l d    they     arrive        in    a short          period.
                   U n f o r t u n a t e l y that event, w h i c h Lord Ta y l o r c o n s i d e r e d
                   was forseeable,               took place.


                   Fina l l y      he found         that        the       presence         of    an         unruly
                   minority         wh o         ha d       drunk too         much       aggr a v a t e d         the
                   problem.         So    did      the      C l u b s 's confu s e d       and    inade q u a t e
                   signs and ticketing.


So we have           it:    a nu m b e r of reasons                 for the disaster;                 no    single
p e r s o n or o r g a n i s a t i o n       to blame.         But Lord Ta y l o r clearly put                      a
s i g n i f i c a n t p o r t i o n of the blame for the d i s a s t e r at the d o o r of
the police.


Indeed        he    was     particularly             critical            of   the    attitude          of    South
Yor k s h i r e     Police to the              disaster.           I quote from the report:


         “'It is a m a t t e r of              regret that at the hear i n g and in their
         submissions,              the    South         Yorkshire         Police were not              prepared
         to        concede       that           they were           in        any respect         at       fault    in wha t
         occurred.            Mr        Duckenfield,            under         p r e ssure        of         cross-
         examination,            a p o l o g i s e d for blaming the Liverpool fans for
         causing the deaths,                    But that apart,               the police case was                  to
         blame       the     fans       for    being        late     and drunk           and    to blame          the
         Club       for    failing           to moni t o r      the       pens.     It was       argued       that
         the       fatal c r u s h was not caused by the influx                                 through gate
         C    but     was     due       to    barrier         124a       being      defective.             Such    an
         u n r e a l i s t i c appro a c h gives cause for anxiety as to w h e t h e r
         lessons          have     been       learnt.        It would         have       been    more       seemly
         and encour a g i n g            for the         future       if respons i b i l i t y         ha d been
         f a c e d ."
 if n e e d e d
[He a l s o c o n s i d e r e d        the reports             that    had been p u b l i s h e d         in the
press a b o u t the b e h a v i o u r of Li v e r p o o l fans.                      A g a i n I q u o t e from
his report:
        "Before         this       Inquiry         b e g a n there w e r e stor i e s             reported        in
        the press,           and       said    to have e m a n a t e d          from po l i c e o f f i c e r s
       present          at the match,                of   "mass        drunkenness".              It w a s    said
        that      drunken           fans      urinated           on     police        whilst        they      were
        pulling         the      dead        and     injured          out,     that     others       had      even
        urinated            on     the       bodies       o£     the     d ead       and      stolen         their
        belongings.              Not     a    single       witn e s s        was     called        before      the
        inqu i r y to support any of those allegations,                                     a l t h o u g h every
        o p p o r t u n i t y was a f f orded for any of the r e p r e s e n t e d parties
        to have any witn e s s called w h o m they wished. As soon as the
        a l l e g a t i o n s I h a v e m e n t i o n e d were in m a d e in the press,                           Mr
        Peter       Wright,         Chief      C o n stable       of     South        Yorkshire,          mad e    a
        dignified            s t atement       dis s o c i a t i n g     hims e l f        from    such      grave
        and    emotive           c a l u m n i e s . Those       who     made      them      and    those      who
        disseminated               them       would       have    done        better        to     hold      their
        p e a c e ."




Memb e r s     of      the       House.       This        is    strong         criticism:           it    hardly
suggest s that Lord T a y l o r m                     any way had the wool pulled before
his eyes.


But I must stress that since the report the police have a c c epted
responsibility               for    the      part     they       played       in     the    disaster.         Most
recently,         the present chief constable of South Y o r k s h i r e Richard
Wells      said        on    the    Today          programme          that     the    police        saw      their
responsibility               in three particular areas.                        He said
                  once       the       gates        were       open      the       police         should      have
                  foreseen w h e r e the fans would go


                  he a c c epted that                they might have reduced                      some of      the
                  pressure by changing the kick off time.


                  he also a c c e p t e d that officers did not r e cognise soon
                    enough the distin c t i o n between d i s o r d e r and distress.
So,    the South           Y o r k s h i r e Po l i c e   have   accepted        that    they w e r e      at
fault       in     those        respects.         They    have     pai d    compensation           to     the
families.          Thi s is a part from money paid out by the H i l l s b o r o u g h
d i s a s t e r appeal.


The inquest
The    second        investigation               into events was           the   inquest c o n d u c t e d
by     Her       Majesty's            Coroner       for     South     Yorkshire.          This       was    a
d i f f i c u l t task partly b e c a u s e of the n u m b e r of deaths and p a r t l y
because          the T a y l o r      inquiry was         itself     in progress.          The c o r o n e r
conducted            an        inquiry       into     the    deaths        of     each      of     the     95
i n d i v i d u a l s and sat for a total of 96 days.


I t hink         it is       important       that I remind           the H o u s e of the p u r p o s e
of     an        inquest;       it     is    a    fact      finding        inquiry c o n d u c t e d       to
e s t a b l i s h r e l i a b l e answ e r s to four important but limited factual
questions.           They are:


                    the identity of the deceased


         •          the place of death


                    Che time of death;                and finally


                    how the d e c e a s e d came by his death.
 That       is    all     an    inquest      can consider.          Rule    36 of       the C o r o n e r s ’
 Rules       1984         requires          that the        p roceedings          and evidence             are
 d i r e c t e d solely at finding the answers to t hese questions and it
 forbids          any expr e s s i o n of opinion on other matters.


 As    members          of      this     House are          aware,      the      jury e x a m i n i n g    the
 evidence found chat the cause of death was a ccidental death.                                             But
 the    findings           of    an    inquest      do not       bind   any      person     a f f e c t e d by
 them.       The inquest conc l u s i o n must not be framed in such a w a y as
 to d e t e r m i n e any q u e s t i o n of criminal r e s p o n s i b i l i t y on the part
 of a n amed person or any q u e stion of civil liability.                                       A f ind i n g
 of accidental death does not prevent                               further proceedings.
Investigation by West Midland' Police


The     third      investigation                 into    the    events          was    con d u c t e d   by   West
M i d l a n d P o l i c e s u p e r v i s e d by the Police C o m p l a i n t s A u t h o r i t y wit h
a v i e w to e s t a b l i s h i n g w h e t h e r the d i s a s t e r r e s ulted from or was
made w o r s e by            criminal          a c t ivity on     the part of any                 individual.
It    also      considered             whether          any    officer          should       be      subject     to
d i s c i p l i n a r y proceedings.                 The i n v e stigation involved the ta k i n g
of    5,341     statements                as    well    as    a scrutiny          of     all    the m a t e r i a l
w h ich   ha d p r e v i o u s l y been examined. The evidence was sent to the
D i r e c t o r of Pu b l i c P r o s e c u t i o n s who c o n c l u d e d that the re s u l t did
not indicate that any one should be made t h e                                        subject of c r i minal
proceedings.                 This     meant           that     neit h e r       C hief       Superintendent
Duckenfield,             nor S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Mu r r a y      not      for that m a t t e r          any
o ther p e r s o n has bee n c h a r g e d with any c r i m e .


For any o ther pe r s o n apart from a police offi c e r that w o u l d have
been      the    end         of     the    p r o c e e d i n g s . For      a    police        officer        there
r e m a i n e d the q u e s t i o n of whether they had failed in their duty.
The     PCA d e c i d e d         that b o t h Chief Sup e r i n t e n d e n t             Duckenfield          and
Superintendent                Murray           should    face d i s c i plinary            charges.        Police
dis c i p l i n a r y       h e a rings        are    held    in private;             they     are     concerned
only wit h whet h e r an offi c e r may have failed to conform to police
 discipline.             A     disciplinary              hearing      does        not        consi d e r      wider
 issues.


 But,     a further point about police d i s c i plinary hearings w h i c h is
 often f o rgotten is that whilst there are a number of p u n i s h m e n t s
 which       can        be     imposed           for    bad     discipline             the     most        serious
 punishment             a     disciplinary              tribunal         can      impose          is     that    of
 d i s m i s s a l or of a requirement to resign.


 This is the heaviest punishment which it is possible to award an
 offi c e r for the very worst offence w hich he could have committed.
 It m eans that his cond u c t must have been so bad that it w o u l d be
 inapp r o p r i a t e        for him to remain an officer.


  In the event Mr Ducken f i e l d retired because of his ill he a l t h in
  advance of a d i s c i p l i n a r y tribunal's ruling on w h e t h e r or not he
was    guilty.              But by     doing        so he        took on himself               what        the w orst
disciplinary                 j u dgement        c ould      have     imposed         upon      hi m     to      do.   He
s top p e d    being          a p o l i c e officer.             The d i s c i p l i n a r y    hearing           could
not    continue              beca u s e    such      hearings         can     only       be    held        on    police
officers.


On    13      January          the     Po l i c e    Complaints           Authority            announced           that
d i s c i p l i n a r y p r o c e e d i n g s against S u p e r i n t e n d e n t M u r r a y w o u l d be
w i thdraw n.           When     explaining              their d e c i s i o n the A u t h o r i t y             stated
that       the      retirement             of       the      Chief      Superintendent                on        medical
grounds        meant           that       what      in     effect      was     a     joint      allegation            of
neglect of duty c o u l d not be fairly h eard in the abse n c e of the
more senior officer. But, some time later,                                         S u p e r i n t e n d e n t M urray
also d e c i d e d that he did not wish to remain as a po l i c e officer.


So    that         is       three     separate           examinations           of      events        su r r o u n d i n g
Hillsborough;                  each       one    with        a    separ a t e       purpose.          The        fourth
e x a m i n a t i o n was the judicial r eview of the Co r o n e r ' s proceedings.




R e v i e w of      the inquest


Agazn it might be help f u l if I remind the house that neit h e r the
Home       Sec r e t a r y      nor    the Attorney              General       has the power to order
 a fresh inquest.                   That can only be done if my rt hon and learned
 Fri e n d       makes         an applic a t i o n under              section         13 of     the        1988 Act.
 There        is        a    statutory           requirement            that       in    order         to       justify
 directing              a    fresh     inquest            “here     should         not    o nly       be     specific
 grounds,           such        a     fresh      evidence,            but     circu m s t a n c e s         that      the
 interests of justice require a fresh inquest.


 The High C ourt has also developed a d o c trine of judicial reviews
 so that the vast m a j o r i t y of issues arising from the conduct of
 inquests can be c o n s i d e r e d by the High Court. Mr T a y l o r w hose son
 Kevin was              so tragically killed put forward an a p p l i c a t i o n under
 section           13 of       the act        ; the main points were:




                        that the coroner wrongly failed to di r e c t the jury as
                          to the verd i c t of lack of care or accid e n t a l d e a t h due
                          to    or    " a g g r a v a t e d 'by    lack      of    care"     r e l ating       to     the
                          n e g l i g e n c e of the police which cau s e d the tragedy.


                •         that the c o r o n e r wrongly e x c l u d e d evide n c e of lack of
                          care in the e m e r g e n c y services and pol i c e r e a c t i o n to
                          the d e c e a s e d        initial      injuries,         wrongly       i n s isted on a
                          cut off p o i n t of 3.15 pm for the e v i d e n c e heard at the
                          m a i n inquest.
and
                          w r o n g l y failed to direct the jury on the a v a i l a b i l i t y
                          of     a verd i c t        of   a c cidental         death   by    lack       of    care     or
                          lack       of   care        based       on     the      failure    of       the     various
                          responsible                agencies          to    provide the       deceased              w ith
                          a d e quate      medical         attention           after they         had       sustained
                          their o r i g i n a l        injuries.


It was a ls o a s s e r t e d in r e l a t i o n to Kevin W i l l i a m s that there was
evidence to justify the coro n e r in c o n c l u d i n g that he was alive
beyond the 3.15 pm cut off time adopted by the C o r o n e r and that
p r e ssure had been put on two witnesses to retract their evidence
about               the   signs of            life    they described              in Kevin W i l liams           after
     -1 -




My              Hon and          learned         friend           the       Attorney General            car e f u l l y
consi d e r e d                the evide n c e        and concluded that none of                       the matters
raised                a f f orded         a      r e alistic            likelihood of             a      succ e s s f u l
a p p l i c a t i o n to the High Court.


The appl i c a n t s p r o c e e d e d by way of -udicial review.                                     In gi v i n g the
judgement                  of     the     Divisional         Court,         Lord    Justice       McCowan        ruled
that none of the p r o c e d u r a l or technical points raised justified
the int ervention of the D ivisional Court.                                          It found that            the cut
off point of 3.15 was a reasonable and sustainable point.


As          a       Minister         it   is    clearly        not       possible      for    me       to    kno w    the
 truth of what h a p p e n e d on that terrible Saturday. None of us here
 can.               But we can be satisfied                    that those dreadful                 events nearly
 seven years ago have been fully investigated and examined.                                                         It is
i m p o s s i b l e to g u a r a n t e e that a tragedy will never o ccur a g a i n but
measures        have          ben taken        to ensure that B r i t i s h            football stadia
are a m o n g the             safest     in the world.


The hon M e m b e r            for n o w c alls       for a further pu b l i c i n q u i r y                  into
these      events.           I fully      sympa t h i s e w i t h       those     families       who          feel
that in some wa y they h a v e not been g i v e n the truth a b o u t their
loved      one 's       deaths.        Certainly          in an    appalling           tragedy       s uch       as
H i l l s b o r o u g h it is perhaps inevitable,                   though d e e p l y d i s t r e s s i n g
for     the      families,            that     there       will     be     confusion         about            some
details. A f t e r all the investigations and e x a m i n a t i o n s that have
taken to place, c ould we ever achieve g r e a t e r cer t a i n t y a bout the
events         a fter         nearly      s even years? I         believe       we     c ould            not.     I
b e l i e v e that L o r d Ta y l o r did an e xcellent job at                         the time and one
for     which        sports        fans      have     reason       to    be     grateful.        I       do     not
beli e v e we could better it now.


What       w ou ld       be     the     purp o s e    of      a    further        inquiry?           I     fully
under s t a n d         that    some      families        still    feel       bitter     about       the        way
that events were hand l e d that terrible day;                                  things w ere done,               or
not done,         things were said that should not have been said but the
fact that we kno w about them proves there has been no c o v e r up.
Lord Ta y l o r c r i t i c i s e d the police;               South Y o r k s h i r e have a c c e p t e d
 that they were partly responsible                            for the cons e q u e n c e s and have
paid      compensation.                 The     DPP   considered          and     rejected           criminal
 procee d i n g s        against       any     police      officer       and    though d i s c i p l i n a r y
 pr o c e e d i n g s    were      not       taken:       Superintendent              Duckenfield,              who
 might,        and      we    must     remember       this,       not    have    b een    found          guilty,
 chose      himself           to   take    the    strongest         measure       which     he       could       be
 forced to take and stop being a police officer.


 Positive lessons have bee n learnt. Lord Taylor made far r e a ching
 r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s which have been implemented:
           •            All    clubs      of   the    Premier       League       and     First       Division
                     have       converted        their      stadia       to     all    seated        grounds.
                     Second and T h i r d Divison clubs should have all seater
                     stadia by August               1999.


                     The       Government           has     made        £139m     a v ailable            to     the
                Football               Trust        to.    fund     Taylor      related           work       at
                   f oo r t b a l l g r o u n d s    for projects        t o t a l l i n g £437rn


B r i t i s h s t a d i a are n o w r e c o g n i s e d as being amon g s t the safest in
the     word.        This        was     com m e n t e d     on    by   overseas          visitors          and
officials          during        EURO     S6.Than k f u l k i y      there hav e         been     no    major
i n c i d e n t s since Hillsborough.                     So, we should not forget the very
positive       things w h i c h h ave been achieved.


My c u r r e n t     bel i e f    is that a further public                   inquiry         w o u l d serve
no us e f u l purpose.


W hat   if there          is fresh evidence? Now a drama d o c u m e n t a r y                         is not
in itself evidence.                    I don't o ften agree with the hon M e m b e r for
B l a c k b u r n but he too recognised that it was i m portant to exam i n e
the evidence,             not the programme.


But wha t if in ma k i n g the drama,                       the researchers have d i s c o v e r e d
new inf o r m a t i o n ? As I have explained I am not yet c o n v i n c e d that
they    have.        But if       they     have,      what        then? The Chief          C o n s t a b l e of
South     Yorkshire             has    already        made    clear     that    if       there    is    fresh
e v i dence he w ould wish to have it examined,                              I u n d e r s t a n d that if
there were fresh evidence he would not wish it to be e x a m i n e d by
p olice       from the          South Yorkshire              force,     who might         be c o n s i d e r e d
to h ave      a vested           interest           in the outcome,        but by officers                  of a
different           force.       Furthermore,             he would wish        this       inves t i g a t i o n
 to be s u p e r v i s e d by the independent Police C o m p l a i n t s Authority.
The Police Comp l a i n t s Authority have themselves                                indicated their
willingness             to   u n dertake        this       supervision.        If    evidence          of    any
 wrongdoing           'were uncovered               those    papers     would       be    passed       to    the
 Director       of      Public         Prosecutions          in order      to d e t e r m i n e     whether
 charges       sh o u l d be brought against a n y b o d y .


 But    all    this       is,     at present,             entirely hypothetical.               At pres e n t
 we have no new evidence.                      As     I have already made                clear    I am not
 convinced          that it exists.

How is that police officers have been awarded substantial sums
in compensation and the families have not?


The j u d g e m e n t on the m a n a g e m e n t of the claims for p o l i c e o f f i c e r s
was a m a t t e r for the Police Authoroity.                         I u n d e r s t a n d that o n the
basis of legal a d v i c e the police a u t h o r i t y s e t t l e d                   14 c ases out
of court.          T h e r e are a further            25 cases outstanding.                  Five cases
have    been       taken         to    court;    of     these,      four      w ere   s u ccessful      in
achieving          c o m p e n s a t i o n : one was not.         The Po l i c e A u t h o r i t y   hav e
said that they will appeal against the four s uccessful claims.


The q u e s t i o n of c o m p e n s a t i o n for members of the public is one for
the     courts.              I        understand       that      the     courts        have      awarded
c o m p e n s a t i o n only in thoese cases where there is a c lose familial
tie.    I u n d e r s t a n d that over £12m has been awar d e d in d ama g e s and
costs    to members of                 the public.


If furt h e r pressed
This    is entirely              a ma t t e r for the courts.


Background
The fact that police officers have received s u b s t antial sums                                       in

Dear Sir

Hillsborough Scrutiny

On 23 July 1997 the Chief Constable, Mr Richard Wells, wrote to you (copy letter attached
for ease of reference). On Page 2, Paragraph 4, he referred to a planned visit to
Hillsborough Stadium. Things were said during that visit which Mr Wells is keen that you
should know of (Mr Wells began a period of leave on 30 July 1997).

Mr Wells and I met Constable GREENWAY and Inspector CALVERT at the stadium.
Constable Greenway fulfils a role as archivist and librarian for our Hillsborough material.
Inspector Calvert worked on a number of football matches before the disaster and was
involved in planning events.

Constable Greenway had prepared an album of photographs, taken at the time of the
disaster, which allowed Mr Wells and I to picture the stadium as it was then. We walked
around the inside and outside of the ground and re-familiarised ourselves with what had
happened.

During this tour, Inspector Calvert said that officers, who had been on duty on the day of
the disaster, were instructed to write their own statements and to include anything that may
have been relevant. Inspector Calvert said that when these statements came back from
typing they had been altered in a manner that some officers had found unacceptable, but
they had nonetheless signed the statements.

Inspector Calvert said that officers were coached in evidence to give to Lord Taylor’s
enquiry but that practice ceased part way through the enquiry when it became apparent
that officers were unable or unwilling to adhere to an unacceptable version of the truth.




                                                                        Direct Line: 0114 2523405
           Tel: 0114 2202020                                            Direct Fax: 0114 2523481
The Chief Constable and I were concerned at the implications of Inspector Calvert’s
comments. We did not question him nor comment lest any such action be misconstrued.
At the conclusion of our visit, Mr Wells and I discussed what we had heard.

Mr Wells said that in the seven years he has been Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, he
has not previously heard such things, nor have I in my 12 months with South Yorkshire.
Nonetheless, we resolved to act upon Inspector Calvert’s comments.

Our store of Hillsborough Disaster material is held in the Discipline and Complaints
Department at Heeley Police office. The acting Head of that Department is Superintendent
Alan FOSTER. Mr Wells and I discussed with Superintendent Foster the action to be
taken. Superintendent Foster said that he had been a member of the team of officers who
had worked on the enquiry that followed the disaster. Part of that team’s role was to liaise
with the officers of West Midlands Police and to facilitate their work. Superintendent Foster
recalled that officers on duty at the disaster were instructed to write their “recollections” and
to put down anything they felt, as well as what they believed to be true. He said that, on
legal advice, the recollections were then converted into statements of evidence. He was
unsure of the source of that advice as he was relying upon his memory of events some
eight years ago.

Superintendent Foster recollected that officers who were to give evidence to Lord Taylor’s
enquiry were prepared in the sense that they were briefed. Lord Taylor’s enquiry was
conducted differently to officers’ experiences of giving evidence in a criminal court. It was
an enquiry not a trial. The nature of giving evidence, and questions on that evidence, were
not as in a criminal case. The event itself was traumatic for many officers in a way that is
rare in criminal trials.

As discussed with Mr Wells and Superintendent Foster, I examined our archive of
Hillsborough Disaster material. The “recollections” of officers are systematically filed there.
Some are handwritten. Some are typed in a manner that suggests to me that the officers
did the typing (spelling mistakes, poor type alignment, etc). All that was written in the
recollections was then typed into the HOLMES computer. HOLMES (Home Office Large
Major Enquiry System) was launched in 1987 and the Hillsborough Disaster was one of the
first major uses of it in South Yorkshire.

The typed recollections have been annotated by indexers, police officers who identifying
salient points to be entered in the HOLMES index. For instance, if Constable 123 SMITH
refers to being on duty in serial 21 under the supervision of Sergeant 456 JONES, the
indexer would highlight “serial 21” and “Sergeant 456 JONES” as cross references. Actions
would be raised to ensure that a statement was obtained from Sergeant 456 Jones and
other officers in serial 21.

Some of the typed recollections show pencil lines through some sentences.                These
statements are in a box marked “Amended Statements".

I examined a small number of randomly selected amended statements. One officer’s
statement contained a page of information about the writer’s feelings the following day
(shock, distress etc) and the reactions of his colleagues. That part of his statement was
deleted no doubt because it was not relevant to the causes of the disaster. Another
statement referred to the duties performed by Special Constables on the day of the
disaster. The officer expressed opinions to the effect that Special Constables should be
confined to traffic point duties. That part of his statement was deleted, no doubt because it
was opinion not evidence. One statement has a note attached which says that the officer
declined to delete parts of it.

Also in the archive is a letter dated 7 June 1989 from Mr Mervyn JONES, Assistant Chief
Constable, West Midlands Police, to Mr David BRUMMELL, Treasury Solicitor.                 Mr
Brummell was one of the team who assisted Lord Taylor in his enquiry. I attach a copy of
Mr Jones’ letter. The opening sentence is pertinent to this matter and I quote it in full;

       “You will recall that in the early stages, because o f the slowness o f the supply of
       written recollections from South Yorkshire officers, it was agreed that we would take
       from them their initial submissions which would be later superseded by their signed
       final versions, after they had been checked by the appropriate legal advice”.

I attach a copy of Mr BrummeH’s reply, also dated 7 June 1989. Mr Brummell recognises
that “expressions of opinion were removed from the first versions”. He also says, “it would
not be appropriate to use the original statement for the purpose of the inquiry when this has
been superseded by a subsequent statement”.

The conclusion I draw from this is that the existence of the “recollections” was known to
Lord Taylor’s team and there was no aspect of suppressing evidence. It is a matter for
your Lordship to decide whether Inspector Calvert has “fresh evidence" to offer but my
opinion is that Inspector Calvert was not conversant with what happened and has
misunderstood a perfectly open and proper procedure.

I hold a similar view of Inspector Calvert’s statement that officers were coached in the
evidence to give. In chapter 18 of his interim report, Lord Taylor comments specifically on
the evidence of police officers (paragraphs 279 and 280). Lord Taylor said, "... I must
report that for the most part the quality o f their (police officers) evidence was in inverse
proportion to their rank ... the senior officers in command were defensive and evasive
witnesses ... neither their handling o f problems on the day nor their account o f it in
evidence showed the qualities o f leadership to be expected of their rank.”

As a police officer, it gives me no comfort to say that Lord Taylor clearly found some police
witnesses lacking. He was more than capable of determining the truth of what he heard
and had good lawyers to help him.

I think it naive of Inspector Calvert to confuse briefing with coaching. To even attempt to
manipulate witnesses, about to face such a rigorous process with so much hard evidence
(videos, photographs), would have been foolish as well as criminal.
In the spirit of openness that is the hallmark of Mr Wells’ style, he briefed Her Majesty's
Inspector of Constabulary, Mr John STEVENS QPM, LLB, MPhil, CIMgt, on these
developments. I am sending this letter to him to bring him up to date.

The Chief Constable is determined that any report which even hints at new evidence
should be put before your Lordship and that such notifications should be made at the
earliest opportunity. For this reason I report these matters to you with only very limited
research. I am confident that additional research would shed further light on Inspector
Calvert’s comments. If you wish me to undertake that research, or to assist your staff in
that work, I will be glad to assist.

Yours faithfully




Ian Daines
Assistant Chief Constable

                      SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE RECOLLECTIONS

    Thank you for your letter of today's date, which we have already discussed.

    The main difference between the initial and final versions of the South
Yorkshire Police Officers' statements is that any expressions of opinion were
(as I understand it, on the advice of Mr. Woodward) removed from the final
version. As I understand it, Andrew Collins' view is that there is absolutely
no reason for excluding such expressions of opinion when they touch on matters
relevant to the Public Inquiry and that, in the circumstances, there is no
objection in principle to written statements containing such opinions being
submitted to the Inquiry.

    Clearly, in view of the personal undertaking which you have given to the
Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, Andrew Collins agrees that it would not be
appropriate to use the original statement for the purposes of the Inquiry when
this has been superseded by a subsequent statement. However, what I understand
may have happened in the case of the Officer who gave his evidence yesterday is
that the original unamended statement was circulated because of the need to
circulate statements to all parties as rrnch in advance of the calling of the
relevant witnesses as possible and because at the time of circulation of the
relevant batch of witness statements the revised, final version of the
statement in question had not yet been received.   I understand that in total
there are three cases where this has been necessary: P.C.s Best, Huckstepp and
Illingworth. However, in such cases only the final, revised version of the
statement was given to the press.

    I trust that this problem will not recur in the future.

    I have not copied this letter to the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire
Police, but am naturally happy for you to do so.

   Dear Mr Gieciiway

   Hillsborough Disaster Scrutiny

  I am acknowledging receipt of Mr Daines’ letter of 8th August enclosing a copy of the
  Inquiry and Report by J D Phillips, Deputy Chief Constable of Devon and Cornwall in
  August 1990, and two ring binder volumes amounting to a response to Home Office
  enquiries resulting from the drama/documentary and three videos.

  I also note the contents of Mr Dames’ letter to Mr Bone in the Home Office of 8th August.
  Of course the Phillips Inquiry Report had beets supplied to the Scrutiny team but Mr Daines
  is concerned as to whether that documentatir n should be made available to Ms Ann
  Adlington on behalf of the Hillsborough Family Support Group.

  I have only looked at the very beginning of the Phillips Inquiry Report but it does not
  introduce itself in a way which would firmly suggest that it could be the subject of legal
  professional privilege. As mentioned on the telephone, legal professional privilege is
  available where any document or evidence comes into existence with a predominant purpose
  of its being used in legal proceedings.

   Therefore if the Phillips Inquiry Report does j o r proclaim legal professional privilege at its
   outset or if the whole tenor of the Report does not put it in that category, the only other
   possibility is that the letter or correspondence commissioning the Report might give it that
   status.    Can you therefore please investigate how the Phillips Report came to be
   commissioned so that I can decide whether there might be a claim of legal professional
   privilege in respect of it.

   Although it is not strictly part of my instructions, I also need to consider the status of the
   Phillips Report in any litigation which is under -way. I understand from you that there are
   two sets of litigation which are current, one involvesatest case o f six claims by "rescuers"
   and their case is subject to an appeal to the House of Lords. I do not think the Phillips
   Report would be relevant to that case because presumably the test case relates to claims for
   compensation for suffering, shock and trauma in the rescue process as rescuers.

The other litigation is apparently being pursued by a firm in Liverpool called Wakeman
Rutherfords and if I understood the position correctly from Mr Daines, it is being defended
on your behalf by Messrs Hammond Suddards. Even if legal professional privilege had been
claimed in relation to the Phillips Report in that civil litigation, its existence should have
been disclosed. It therefore follows that its existence should have been disclosed to
Hammond Suddards. Can you confirm that is the case?

I notice, in passing, that Ms Adlington was not aware of the existence of the Phillips Report
until recently and if she was liaising closely with the active litigation which is going on and
being pursued by Wakeman Rutherfords, I would have expected her to have been aware of
the existence of that Report. It was because of this that I thought I should contact you to
see what the state of disclosure of that Report really was.

If there are good grounds for withholding the Phillips Report on grounds of legal
professional privilege, then the advice in that direction from me will be clear. If there are
no grounds for withholding it then South Yorkshire Police will have to operate according
to their policy on this whole subject. My understanding of the policy was that full
disclosure of all material you were holding and all the material which had been made
available to Lord Justice Taylor would be disclosed to any interested party once they
established that they had an interest which was more than just frivolous. If that is the case
and in the absence of any claim for privilege, I would have thought that it should be
disclosed. However I can quite see that begs the question of why it has not been disclosed
in the past when you have adopted a policy of full disclosure.

Yours sincerely,

                           Lord Justice Stuart-Sm ith’s Scrutiny o f H illsborough

                  Thank you for your letter regarding the above. At the time of the Hillsborough
          Disaster I was the Secretary of the ACPO Football Hooliganism Committee and had done
          much to promote a universal approach to the problems o f policing football. As a
          consequence I was asked by the then Chief Constable o f South Yorkshire, Peter Wright, if
          I would provide a professional expert opinion which might be relied upon in the civil
          proceedings which were anticipated. I prepared my report on that basis both by reference
          to the evidence which came before the hearing; statements obtained in the course of the
          enquiry led by then ACC Mervyn Jones o f West Midlands and by interviewing a number
          of people myself and examining documents. The real weight of my report is interpretive.
          For example, I think it was highly significant that the football ground had hardly ever
          been at capacity in the preceding 12 years whereby there was no local knowledge of the
          problems relating to overcrowding; I think that the evidence relating to the previous
          overspill which Mr. Gosling dealt with and the correspondence thereafter, was o f great
          importance; I believe that the failure of John Motson and so many other commentators to
          recognise overcrowding was significant; I believe that the engineering of the ground,
          particularly in relation to the lack of secure connection between turnstiles and parts o f the
          ground with crowd limits, was a matter of greater importance than the enquiry considered;
          and finally I think there was a good deal of evidence about the conduct of the late arriving
          Liverpool supporters which seemed to be minimised as the enquiry concentrated upon the
          tragic blamelessness of those who suffered.

                 I hope my observations are of some value.

Dear sir

Hillsborough

Thank you for your letter of 25 July 1997 relating to material which you hold. The Chief
Constable is on leave now but I mentioned to him your letter and he asked me to reply on
his behalf.

Your bundle of documents would be of use to us. I note your comment that it may well
duplicate items that we already hold, but we would rather have the material than run the
risk that an item would be lost. Constable Ken GREENWAY monitors our Hillsborough
Stadium Disaster archive. I will ask him to contact your secretary to discuss how the
material can be passed over to us.

HILLSBOROUGH

You will no doubt be aware that I retire at the end of August. When I concluded my investigation in
the Hillsborough Inquiry in 1991 I kept copies of certain documentation relevant to the Inquiry.
These were kept for reference should I have to refer to them subsequent to the conclusion of the
investigation. In addition, I kept my personal notes which I intend to retain. However, the question is
whether the South Yorkshire Police wish to receive the duplicate material which I presently hold.
There are no original documents, merely duplicates of certain parts that were passed to you by
Detective Chief Superintendent Foster at the end o f the Inquiry.

The question again, therefore, is would this duplicate material be of any assistance to you? If not I
will make arrangements for it to be confidentially destroyed.

With best wishes

Dear Sir

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s Scrutiny of Hillsborough

I enclose a letter I recently sent to Mr Chris Bone who is the Secretary to Lord Justice
Stuart-Smith’s Scrutiny of Hillsborough. Lord Justice Stuart-smith’s Scrutiny was set up to
establish whether there is any fresh evidence relating to the Hillsborough Disaster that was
not available to previous enquiries.

In that context, I have become aware of the report you prepared in August 1990, after Lord
Justice Taylor’s enquiry had concluded.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith requires us to notify him of any fresh evidence in our possession
by 1 September 1997. As you will see from my letter to Chris Bone I am a little unsure of
the background and purpose of your report. You will recall that we bumped into each other
on the afternoon of Thursday 24 July 1997 when we were both at the Buckingham Palace
Garden Party and that I said I would be contacting you about this.

I would be obliged if you could, at your earliest convenience, write to me a letter which I can
forward to Mr Bone which gives the purpose and background of your report. This will allow
Mr Bone to determine whether your report represents new evidence.

Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

Yours faithfully

Dear Mr Bone

Report by David Phillips on Hillsborough Disaster

I attach a report dated August 1990 by Mr David Phillips, then Deputy Chief Constable of
Devon and Cornwall Constabulary, now Chief Constable of Kent.

The provenance of the report is a little unclear. At paragraph 2.1, Mr Phillips says;

       “On 20th October, 1989, I was asked to consider documentary material emanating
       from the Inquiry conducted by Lord Justice TAYLOR into the disaster at
       Hillsborough. / have confined m y research to a consideration o f documentary
       evidence although I have spoken to other senior police officers, serving and retired,
       in relation to this match and other issues in general, (none o f whom had any direct
       involvement in the game at Hillsborough).”

In response to your request for “fresh evidence” to be submitted to you, I forward this
document. I do not believe it represents fresh evidence but is principally another
perspective on pre-existing evidence. However, as with all similar material, the Chief
Constable would prefer to lay material before you rather than pre-judge the material’s
freshness. I will cause enquiries to be made into the background that led to this report and
will contact you again as soon as I have more information.

I would be obliged if you could acknowledge receipt of this letter.

Yours sincerely




Ian Daines
Assistant Chief Constable

Thank you for your letter o f 15 May to               about the calls for a new inquiry
into the Hillsborough disaster. I am replying as this issue falls within my remit at the
Home Office.

As you will be aware, the Home Secretary announced on 30 June that Lord Justice
Stuart-Smith is to conduct an independent scrutiny to ascertain whether there exists
any new and significant evidence relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough football
stadium which was not previously available.

I am grateful for your offer to meet and discuss the events at Hillsborough. At the
moment, however, you will understand that these are issues for Lord Justice Stuart-
Smith to consider in his scrutiny.

I will ensure that your helpful letter is drawn to his attention.

 G eneral Note
       A local authority, being a corporation, is subject to the doctrine of ultra vires (see hereon   2-249
   Ashbury Railway Carriage Co. v. Riche (1875) L.R. 7 H.L. 653, and Att.-Gen. v. Fulham
   Corporation [1921] 1 Ch. 440). As to the doctrine of ultra vires (see General Introduction
   para 1—10 et seq. and Chapter 4. The courts have held that a corporation may do not only
   those things for which there is express or implied authority, but also whatever is reasonably
   incidental to the doing of those things: Att-Gen. v. Great Eastern Ry. (1880) 5 App.Cas.
   473, per Lord Selborne at p. 478. This common law rule is now given statutory force.
      It should be noted that Part V of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 contains
   a statutory code relating to companies in which local authorities have interests. Those pro­
   visions sub-divide local authority companies into three broad categories: local authority
  controlled companies; local authority influenced companies, and companies in which a local
  authority has a minority interest. The purpose of controls over local authority companies
  set out in Part V of the 1989 Act is that, when a company is effectively under the control of
  a local authority, the most significant controls that Parliament has laid down for the conduct
  of local authorities should apply to that company. The company is treated as an extension
  of the local authority.
     The legislation contained in Part V of the 1989 Act from a study conducted by the
  Government m the light of the report of the Widdicombe Committee of Inquiry into the
  Conduct of Local Authority Business. The Government concluded that it was anomalous
  that although there is detailed statutory regulation of the way in which local authorities
  discharge their functions, there was no control over the operation of companies subject to
  the control or dominant influence of a local authority.
     Part V of the 1989 Act does not prevent local authorities from continuing to set up, or
 participate in, companies, either as formal members or by appointing directors. All such
 cases, however, are now brought within a framework of regulation contained in Part V
 (ss.67-73) of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989. These controls do not impose
 any new controls on companies but regulate the conduct of local authorities participating in
 them. The subsidiary powers of local authorities contained in this section are widely drawn.
 Since they authorise the doing of any thing which is calculated to facilitate, or is conducive
 or incidental to, the discharge of a function of the local authority, the section would author­
 ise the formation, acquisition or control of a company under the Companies Acts. A local
authority may enter into a contract with a company in which it is involved, to do things on
Its behalf, in the same way as it can contract with an independent contractor. The Local
 Government and Housing Act 1989, s.67(2), provides that a local authority may not exer­
cise any constitutional involvement in a company to which the controls apply; that is to say,
a local authority may not subscribe for or acquire shares in the company; nor be a member
of a company limited by guarantee; nor exercise any power to nominate any person to
become a member of a company; nor appoint a director of a company.
    Controlled and influenced companies are therefore subject to regulation of local auth­
ority activity and dealing in them. The Secretary of State may direct that individual compa­
nies shall be excluded from the categories of controlled and influenced companies.
    See Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982, s.33 (post, para. 3-222) for

               incidental to." This is not equivalent to the phrase “in connection with”; it has a nar­
           rower meaning: see remarks of Lord Macnaghton in Amalgamated Society o f Railway Ser­
           vants v.O sborne [1910] A.C. 87, at 97. It will not justify a corporation engaging in activities
          which the court considers were not contemplated by the legislature: see Att.-Gen. v. Fulham
          Corporation [1921] 1 Ch. 440 (laundry service not authorised by the Baths and Washhouses
          Acts 1846 and 1878); Att.-Gen. v. Manchester Corporation [1906] 1 Ch. 643 (parcels delivery
          service not authorised apart from limited power to use tramways for that purpose under a
          private Act). But the modem tendency has been for the courts to adopt a more liberal
          interpretation; see Att-Gen. v. Smethwick Corporation [1932] 1 Ch. 562 (establishment of a
          department to carry out the council’s printing and stationery work, intra vires); Att.-Gen. v.
          Crayford U.D.C. [1962] Ch. 575 (collective insurance of council tenants’ household goods
         authorised by the general power of management under s . l l l of the Housing Act 1957 but
                ^ f s s a r i i v all aspects of the welfare of tenants); Grainger v. Liverpool Corporation
         [1954] 1 Q.B. 351 (employment of a private consultant to advise on rating proposals)- cf. R
         ^Kensington and Chelsea Royal Borough Council, ex p. Brandt, The Times, December 2 U
                 (payment of interest not incidental, etc. to payment of housing benefit, and in any
        event impliedly prohibited by the housing benefit legislation: see para. 1-12). The more
        liberal interpretation may well be encouraged by the phrase “calculated to facilitate” used in
        this subsection.
            “functions” In Hazell v. Hammersmith and Fulham London Borough Council [1990] 2
        Q.B. 697, 722-723, Woolf L.J. said. “What is a function for the purposes of the subsection is
        not expressly defined but in our view there can be little doubt that in this context ‘func­
        tions’ refers to the multiplicity of specific statutory activities the council is expressly or
        impliedly under a duty to perform or has power to perform under the other provisions of
        the Act of 1972 or other relevant legislation. The subsection does not of itself, indepen­
       dently of any other provision, authorise the performance of any activity. It only confers, as
       the sidenote to the second indicates, a subsidiary power. A subsidiary power which author­
       ises an activity where some other statutory provision has vested a specific function or func­
       tions in the council and the performance of the activity will assist in some way in the
                                   function or those functions.” This was approved by the Court of Appeal:
       [1990] 2 Q.B. 697, 785, and the House of Lords: [1992] 2 A.C. 1, 29.
                     v; Greater London Council, ex p . Westminster City Council, The Times, December
          7, 1984 it was held that the maintenance of good staff relations was a proper function of a
       ^ “ [authority and 3 decision t0 release staff for that purpose was within s . l l l subject to
       the Wednesbury test of reasonableness. But if the object, or a major object, of the decision
       was to conduct a political campaign in opposition to government policy that was an irrel­
       evant consideration and the decision would be invalid. On that basis a decision by the Inner
       London Education Authority to release one member of staff to a joint committee or body
       of trade unions made in the interests of good industrial relations was valid but a decision of
                       t0 re'ease seven members of staff with pay to the same body in support of the
       GLC s campaign against government policy was invalid. (See also annotations to s 142 at
      para. 2-326).
      n             \ J l ner London Education Authority, ex p. Westminster City Council and Others
         11           W L R - 28> it was held by the House of Lords that decisions by the G.L.C. to
      allocate funds to the Inner London Interim Education Authority and to various voluntary
      organisations to meet their needs during the financial year 1986-87 were ultra vires and
      unlawful: see para. 1-12, ante.
           In R. v. Eden District Council, ex p. Moffat, The Times, November 24. 1988, the Court of
      Appeal held that s . l l l enabled the council to appoint a working party comprising council­
      lors and officers to consider ways of improving the structure and efficiency of the council.
      Ihe working party was not a committee or sub-committee appointed under s.102 as it was
                                                    2120

 not discharging any of the council’s functions under s.101. Furthermore, the officers would
 not have been members of such a committee or sub-committee by virtue of s . 1 0 4 ( 1 ) and
 s.80(l)(a).                                                                                        2-250
    In R. v. Richmond Upon Thames London Borough Council, ex p. McCarthy & Stone
 (Developments) Ltd. (1989) 58 P. & C.R. 434, Popplewell J. held that s .l l l ( l ) gave a local
 authority power to raise money by charging an individual company for pre-planning appli­
 cation discussions. The words in brackets in subs. (1) were inclusive and not exclusive. The
 charges were calculated to facilitate, or conducive or incidental to the discharge of the auth­
ority’s functions. The wording of subs. (3) made it clear that the raising of money by rate,
 precept or borrowing was within the scope of subs. (1). The restrictions in subs. (3) that
raising money had to be in accordance with enactments relating to those matters applied
only to the methods of raising money specified, and did not restrict the power to raise
money by charges. This was affirmed by the Court of Appeal: [1990] 2 W.L.R. 1294, but
reversed by the House of Lords'. [1992] 2 A.C. 48. The House held that a power to charge
had to be authorised by statute either expressly or by necessary implication; that the giving
of pre-application advice was not itself a function of the council, although it was incidental
to the discharge of the council’s planning functions; that charging for such advice was
accordingly “incidental to the incidental”; and that this was too remote to be permitted by
section 111(1). The House rejected the council’s argument that a distinction was to be
drawn between functions which a council has a duty to perform (in respect of which it was
accepted that no charge could be made) and those which it had a power to perform, where
a charge would be made. On the other hand, it also rejected the developers’ argument that
charging under section 111(1) was prohibited by section 111(3).
   In Hazell v. Hammersmith and Fulham London Borough Council [1990] 2 Q.B. 697, 722-
726, the Divisional Court held that the interest rate swaps and similar transactions conduc­
ted by the council were not authorised by s.111. They did not facilitate the management of
a function (borrowing) but only the consequence of a function (the obligation to pay inter­
est on borrowing). Moreover, they constituted a trade or business conducted to make a
profit, R. v. Greater London Council, ex p. Westminster City Council and R. v. Eden District
Council, ex p. Moffat, supra, were distinguishable as they were not concerned with the
financial activities of a council, for which express provision was made by Schedule 13. This
position was endorsed by the House of Lords: [1992] 2 A.C. 1 (see para. 1-12). Similarly, in
R. v. Wirral Metropolitan Borough Council, ex p. Milstead (1989) 87 L.G.R. 611, the Div­
isional Court held that a “factoring” agreement to sell, for a current payment, the right to
receive the proceeds of future sales of land was not lawful under s .l l l . Entering the agree­
ment was not incidental to sale of the land, but was concerned with the sale of sums of
money derived from the proceeds of sale of the land: “To my mind disposal of the proceeds
of sale cannot be said to be incidental to sale of the property” (per Stuart-Smith L.J. at p.
618). See also para. 3-294/8.
   In Allsop v. North Tyneside Metropolitan Borough Council (1992) 90 L.G.R. 462, the
Court of Appeal held that payments under an enhanced voluntary severance scheme in
excess of the limits prescribed by delegated legislation were not authorised by section
111(1) and were contrary to law (see para. 1-12).
   In R. v. Elmbridge Borough Council, ex p. Health Care Corporation Ltd and Prime Com­
mercial Properties (1991) 63 P. & C.R. 260, Popplewell J. noted that in reaching a determi­
nation that an outline planning permission had lapsed, the council was not exercising an
express statutory power under the Town and Country Planning Act 1971, but its power or
function as a planning authority pursuant to section 111 of the 1972 Act.
   See s.137 of this Act for the power of local authorities to incur expenditure for certain
purposes not otherwise authorised by statute.

G eneral Note
   This section derives from a number of provisions in Part IV of the Local Government 2-253
Act 1933 (ss.98 to 104) which, in addition to granting a general power to appoint officers,
laid down a number of statutory appointments. Local authorities are now given a much
wider discretion in the appointment of staff for the proper discharge of their functions,
although the officers listed in subsection (4) must still be appointed. S.220 contains a
requirement to appoint coroners. The term “officer” is not defined in the Act but in the
context of this section it obviously covers all employees of the authority. In R. v. Hertford­
shire County Council, ex p. NUPE [1985] I.R.L.R. 258, C.A., however, the Master of the
 Rolls suggested obiter that for the purpose of an application for judicial review an employee
may only be considered an “officer” if he holds an office independently of the person filling
it. The case concerned the council’s decision to dismiss their school dinner ladies and offer
them re-employment on less favourable terms which the union unsuccessfully sought to
challenge on the Wednesbury principles of unreasonableness and failure to take into
account material considerations such as the relevant NJC national agreement. See also R. v.
East Berkshire Health Authority, ex p. Walsh [1985] Q.B. 152, where an application for
judicial review was rejected by the Court of Appeal in connection with the dismissal of a
Senior Nursing Officer as not a public law matter and R. v. Derbyshire County Council, ex
p. Noble, [1990] I.R.L.R. 332, C.A., where it was held that there was no public law element
in the post of deputy police surgeon. Cf. R. v. Secretary o f State for the Home Department,
ex p. Benwell [1985] Q.B. 554, where the dismissal of a prison officer was held to be subject
to judicial review procedure in the absence of a private law remedy. See also post, paras.
5-32 et seq.
   If an authority proposes to embark on an employment or redeployment policy which is in
breach of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 or the Race Relations Act 1976, or is otherwise
unlawful, the public law remedies should be available to the unions and employees affected:
R. v. Hammersmith and Fulham London Borough Council, ex p. NALGO [1991] C.O.D.
397.
   A local authority may not terminate the appointment of officers necessary for the proper
discharge of its functions for an unlawful reason: R. v. Liverpool City Council, ex p. Fergu­
son, The Times, November 20, 1985 (decision of council to dismiss its teachers as a conse­
quence of its failure to fix a legal rate declared ultra vires).
   Section 5 of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 provides a duty on a local
authority to designate one of their officers, who is to be known as “the monitoring officer,"
to perform the duties specified in that section. These duties include a duty to report to the
authority at any time it appears to him that any proposal, decision or omission by the auth­
ority or a committee or sub-committee of it, contravenes any enactment, rule of law or code
of practice or is likely to lead to maladministration or injustice as defined in Part III of the
Local Government Act 1974. The officer designated by a local authority in pursuance of
this section may be the head of the authority’s paid service but shall not be their chief
finance officer.
   Section 8 of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 enables the Secretary of State
by regulations to require local authorities to incorporate such provisions as may be pre­
scribed in the regulations in standing orders relating to their staff, including provisions reg­
ulating the appointment of persons or the dismissal of persons. The section goes on to
detail matters which may be included in regulations.

             HOKE OFFICE CXRCOXAR HO 77/87

             FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO POLICE OFFICERS IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS -

     There is statutory authority in section 48 pf the Police Act 1964 for
     payments to be sade fros the police fund to aeet expenditure incurred
     by police officers in defending proceedings in tort* Also, acting in
     pursuance of its general statutory duty to aaintain an adequate and
     efficient police force for its area, the police authority has
     discretion to meet expenditure incurred by officers in all kinds "bt-
     legal proceedings where the officers have acted in good faith in
     pursuance of their duties, or the intereats of the force as a whole
     are involved.   The purpose of this circular is to give guidance to
  .^police authorities to help them in considering requests on behalf of
  ''-"officers for financial assistance. This guidance has been discussed
     and agreed with the local authority and with the police staff
     associations.
             2.    The central principle wh i c h should guide consideration of
             individual cases is that, where a police authority considers ^hat an
             officer has acted in good faith in pursuance of his duties (cr\ that
             the interests of a force as a whole are Involved, the officer~ihould
             have the aupport of the police authority to ensure that he has the
             services of a lawyer and that he should not b e out of pocket.   The
             following paragraphs provide general guidance to the different
             classes of proceedings. Payaents aade to officers in accordance with
             this guidance will be eligible for police grant.



                                                                                                                  1
CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS

Prosecution bv the crovn Prosecution Service
 3.  An officer who is the subject of a public prosecution for an
alleged offence committed while carrying out his duties as a police
officer is in the sane position as any other defendant and must be
expected to bear the costs of his defence.   If he is acquitted, he
should,   like any other defendant,      look to the court for
reimbursement of his expenses.   If the costs are not paid, or not
paid in full from central funds, the police authority are in a
position to decide, on the full facts, whether or not to make a
payment to the officer or to the Police Federation if they have
provided the funding.   There may be cases where it is proper to
provide legal advice and/or legal representation even where the
officer is found guilty. This say arise for example in test cases
where the officer has been carrying out e practice hitherto
approved of but is found guilty as a result of that practice being
found unlawful by the court in the light of the circumstances of
that particular case.


E r lv ftt* J r c it g tt U fln t
4 . A police officer should be able to carry out his duties injfcfee
confidence that, if he acts in good faith end exercises T O *
judgement reasonably, his police authority rttill support him. If,
in a case where a member of the public brings s prosecution against
an officer# the authority is satisfied that the officer has acted
in thl* way, the authority should provide or fund legal advice
and/or representation.
5.   Where a court decides that a prosecution brought against an
officer was not brought in good faith, it may order the prosecutor
to pay the whole or any part of the costs incurred by the defence;
again, if the officer is acquitted on indictment, his costs say be
met from central funds. In either of these cases, the question of
the police authority providing financial support to the officer may
not arise.   However, where the costs of an acquitted officer ere
not awarded by the court or awarded only in part, the police
authority should consider whether to reimburse any costs not
covered, taking into account the reasons, if any, given by the
court for failing to award all costs claimsd.

    Under section 48(1) of the Police Act 19«4, the chief officer
of a force is liable in respect of torts committed by constables
under his direction and control (which includes special constables
and officers of other forces serving in the police
lutuil «id arrangements)       in the performance or purported
performance of their functions. Under section 48(2) any damages or
JUL   ’97   15:42   FROM   S   Y   P                         P A G E . 00 4


  Costs awarded against the chief officer in such proceedings, any
  costs he incurs himself, and any sum paid in connection with the
  settlement of a claim, provided the settlement is approved by the
  police authority, must be paid out of the police fund.      Zn such
  cases, therefore, the police authority’s discretion extends only to
  whether or not to approve a proposed settlement of the claim.


 gjvil Actions Against Indlvldual^Police Officers
  7.  Alternatively, the plaintiff say be awarded damages against an
  individual police officer, though he cannot recover the damages
 twice over against the chief officer as veil, section 48(4) Cf the
 Police Act 1964 specifically empowers a police authority "to such
 extent as they think fit* to pay out of the police fund any damages
 or costs awarded against an officer^ any costs he incurs himself,
 and any suns paid in connection with the settlement of a claim.
 This provision applies to actions against officer* of the
 authority's own force, officers of another force serving the police
 area under mutual aid arrangements, and special constables for the
 police area,   in considering whether to give financial assistance
 the authority vill wish to consider in particular whether the
 officer concerned acted in good faith and exercised his jmdgeaent
 reasonably. Where the court finds for the officer, he May seek his
 costs from the plaintiff; should the costs not be awarded or
 awarded only in part, the police authority should consider whether
 to reimburse any costs not covered, taking ' into account the
 reasons, if any, given by the court for failing to award all costs
 claimed,
 8.   Joint actions naming both the chief officer and an individual
 police officer say be brought in some cases.   In such cases it is
 important that any discussion of the merits and quantum of the
 proposed settlement should involve all the parties named in the
 claim together with advisers even if they are represented by
 different advisers.

 Civil Actions Under the Data Protection A g t .19.84
 9.   under sections 22 and 23 of the Data Protection Act 1984 an
 individual who suffers damage as a result of the inaccuracy, loss
 or unauthorised disclosure of personal data is entitled to
 compensation from the data user. In the absence of any ease law on
 these provisions, it is unclear whether the acts covered by
 sections 22 and 23 amount to torts, to which the guidance in
 paragraphs 6 and 7 above applies. If not, section 48 of the Police
 Act 1964 does not apply.      However, the position is broadly the
 same.    Under section 38 (3 ) (a) of the 1984 Act constables^ are
 treated as servants of the chief officer for the purposes of the
 Act.   A chief constabls is therefore liable for the sets of his
 officers falling within sections 22 and 23 in the saie way a s h e is
 liable for their torts under section 48(1). the position of non-
 police officers is less clear but it is possible that in some cases
 the chief constable might be regarded as having liability for their
 acts. It follows that it would be proper for the police authority
         JU L   ’ 97   15:43   FROM   9   Y   P                                   PAGE. 0 0 5




         to oeet all costs, including any award of compensation, arising
         from this liability. It should be noted that the liability of the
         "data user'* under the Act is not vicarious but his personal
         liability. Therefore his own care in having instituted a system of
         obtaining, checking and recording data which would reasonably guard
         against error and loss under section 33(3) of the Act should meet
         his responsibility under section 22(3) and ha should not be held
         liable if one of his officers disregards the system established.
         10.   Where compensation is sought from an Individual officer, the
         police authority will wish, in considering whether to meet the
         cost* which would otherwise fall on the officer, to take account of
         the same matters as in exercising thair power under M ot io n 4J(4)
         of the Police Act 1964 (•** paragraph 7).        Police authorities
         should apply th* *ame broad principla* and in particular, maet the
         cost* of any comp*n*ation awarded against a chief constablewhere a
         non-poliee officer is at fault and th* chief constable is found to
         have liability for the actions performed.

 Legal B*pr«*.*flta.tion for Chief Officers

 12.   Any interested arty Bay be legally represented at an inquest
 but at his own expense since expenses are payable only to witnesses
 and jurors.   An interested party will normally be entitled to be
 legally represented at a public enquiry or other public tribunal.
 Where the interest of the force is affected, it will be appropriate
 for the police authority to provide at its expense for the chief
 officer to b* legally represented on behalf of the force.

 Legal Representation for Individual Officers

13.   Separate representation for individual officers whose interest
is involved may be necessary. For exaaple, there will be occasions
when (a) the chief officer*s legal representative cannot reasonably
be expected to represent the separate interests of such officers
and (b) the police authority considers that such interests should
be represented,   in such cases the authority should give financial
assistance to the officers.        In considering (b) above, the
authority will wish in particular to assess Whether the offloirs
are at risk of being held to blam* for actions in connection with
the death to which the inquest relates and whether any such finding
might give rise to legal proceedings for the costs of which the
police authority would be liable under section 48(1) of the PoMup*
Act 1964 or for which financial assistance night be appropriate
within the terms of this circular.                               v;

APPLICATIONS FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE
14.   An officer wishing to seek financial assistance from his
police authority should have the opportunity in advance of as veil
as on the conclusion of th* proceedings to submit to th* chief
officer tn application for financial assistancs* Th* chiaf offiC*r
should put this, together with his own recommendation to th* pelic*
authority for decision.   Th* officer should normally be given the
opportunity by th* police authority to make representations to th«m
if he wishes to do so.
15.    If it decide* to give financial    assistance, th* authority
should inform the officer concerned that, if th* information on
which they baa*d their decision to grant th* assistanc* is shown in
aubsequent l*gal proceedings to be inaccurate or inconplet*, the
authority will normally expect to recover th* money unless it is
satisfied that no cilpabl* misrepresentation was involved and that
to recover the mon*y would involv* th* applicant in substantial
hardship.   On th* other hand, if an authority refuses financial
assistance and then discovers in the light of subsequent *v*nts
that such assistance would have been warranted, th*n financial
assistanc* should b* granted in order to m**t th* r«asonabl* costs
incurred by the officer in seeking l*gal advic* or assistanc*.
Assistance from Police Federation Fuids
 16. Under Regulation Id of the Police Federation Regulations 1969,
as amended, Federation funds say be used to defray legal charges
incurred by a member in connection with criminal proceedings
brought against him for an offence under the roed traffic
enactments (other than offences involving driving whan impaired by
drink or drugs or taking a vehicle without authority), or for
offences of causing the death or injury of any parson, or for any
assault, or in connection with his action for libel or slander* An
officer seeking financial assistance in circumstances covered by
Regulation 19 should seek such assistance from the police authority
in the first instance.   If the police authority does not consider
the request to fall within the terms of this circular, the
Federation may then consider the application within the teres of
Regulation 19.   If the officer receives legal assistance from the
Federation the terms of Home office circular Ho 26/1967 Will
Continue to apply.

SUBJECT:       THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER 1989


I met this morning with representatives of the Force's superintendents at Niagara - one of a series
of regular meetings for up-dating each other informally on key issues at play within the South
Yorkshire Police.

My first item on the agenda was to up-date them on aspects of the Home Secretary’s deliberations
on the Hillsborough Disaster and his recent appointment of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to conduct a
judicial examination into purported new evidence.

After my up-date Superintendent Steve King shared with the group an aspect which had been
troubling him. This concerned reports of an incident in 1981 at a football match at the Hillsborough
ground when, it is said, there had been some crushing of fans. Steve King went on to say that,
even after the Taylor Enquiry, there had been reports of a similar occurrence at the Sheffield
Wednesday ground in November 1989.

Steve King's belief is that the then capacity of parts of the ground had, as I understand it, been
over-stated in the numbers allowed to enter those parts of the ground by SWFC. Steve King had
always thought that somehow this was material to the findings of Lord Justice Taylor.

Some members of this superintendent group confirmed that speculation to this effect had been
circulating the Force at junior level since the Disaster.

Now in possession of this suggestion, I am duty bound to take professional cognisance of it, even
if it is deleterious to the Force or any other party to the Disaster. It is possible that we should make
it available to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith as part of his review of the supposed new evidence, even
though it may not fall within the terms of reference that we have to date. It is also possible that it
will open up a completely new avenue to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's examination, including the
possibility of a full public enquiry.

However, before we move further in that direction, we have to establish whether there is any
substance to the suggestions - in other words, does what is being speculated about amount to
"new evidence"?

As the portfolio-holder responsible, and with your comparative freshness to the SYP, I believe that
we must now take appropriate steps to assure a professional regard for these matters, as
mentioned above.

This formal report to you is the first step in the proceedings, an hour after this morning's meeting
concluded. The next step should be an analysis of what is being said and the extent to which it is
supported by credible fact. A further aspect of this analysis is who is best placed to carry it out in
order to ensure objectivity and transparency of process.
It is even a possibility that the material was presented in some form to the Taylor Enquiry, even
though it did not emerge in his final reports. With such a bulk of available information, Lord Justice
Taylor could not, after all, cover all aspects in detail.

Another aspect to consider which was mentioned at this morning's meeting was to the effect that
local press, it is suggested, published similar assertions.

I would value your early recommendations in this direction and, when you have them to hand I
suggest that they are given urgent attention by the SCT.

Hillsborough Scrutiny

Thank you for your letter of 7 July 1997 to Mike Hedges on the above topic.

As discussed on the telephone on 10 July, the Chief Constable has asked me to lead on
this topic for him. We will be assembling a small team of staff to deal with this “scrutiny” (I
am told that this is the word we must use).

I have read the cutting from the Daily Mail. Like you, I am confident that the writer is
mistaken when he says that lies were told about the video footage. The Chief has written
to a number of newspapers to correct inaccuracies but I fear that it is too late to write to the
Mail.

Thank you for your offer to be available if needed. I will bear it in mind and may well call
you in due course.

      NEW HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY

      I write to you Mike as I have lost track of whom might be overseeing the issues arising
      from the Hillsborough Disaster. Perhaps you will forward my note to whoever has this
      responsibility.

      I was sorry to see that the new Home Secretary has raised hopes and expectations by
      calling for a new inquiry. Nevertheless, I hope that it does, in the words of Jack Straw,
      “settle things once and for all”.

      I was particularly intrigued by a reference in the Daily Mail dated 27 June. Please see
      paragraph four of the cutting attached. “There is equally no doubt that lies concerning the
      existence of video footage of one part of the disaster were told to the original inquiry”.
      Aside from the tortured grammar of this sentence, I do not understand the reference. In
      particular, my recollection of the Taylor Inquiry is such that I would feel confident in
      rejecting the assertion of the paragraph.

      I know that most of the people that were engaged on the Inquiry within South Yorkshire
      have now retired. If the person who is going to respond to the new inquiry would wish to
      speak with me about any issue arising from the 1989 investigations, I should be happy to
      help.

Criminal law Misbehaviour in public office - Common law offence - Persons to whom offence applying - Maintenance officer o fcity council
charged with misconduct fo r dishonestly causing unnecessary works to be undertaken by council employees - Whether Qjjence applicable to
local authority officers,

The appellant was employed by a local authority as a maintenance manager of Hie city works department. Under his contract o f employment be
was responsible for the management and direction of subordinate employees and accountable for ensuring that his department and its activities
were within budget. In 1993 the appellant was charged with an offence o f misconduct in a public office for dishonestly causing maintenance
works to be carried out by local authority employees at premises which were occupied by a friend o f the appellant when such works were not
required under the local authority’s repairing policy. At the outset of the trial the judge made a preliminary ruling on a point o f law that the
common law offence o f misconduct in a public office applied generally to officers o f local authorities and in partktUar to the post held by the
appellant. Following that ruling the appellant pleaded guilty to the offence aid was convicted and fined. Thereafter he appeal tad against the
judge’s ruling, contending that the offence applied only to servants o f the Crown; alternatively that it did not apply to his particular post, which
was too lowly to fell within its scope.

Held - The common law offence o f misconduct in a public office applied generally to every person who w w appointed 10 discharge a public
duty and was paid compensation in whatever form, whether from the Crown or otherwise, and clearly applied to local authority officers. On
die facts, the appellant was a public officer and, as such, he fell within the scope of that principle, since he was responsible to the city for the
upkeep of local authority housing and in that capacity was accountable for the receipt and disbursement o f public money          5050 derived by
the local authority either from the rates (or their modem equivalent) or from central government grants and since he received a salary p^jd fram
the same public funds. The appeal would accordingly be dismissed (see p 509 j to p 5 1 0 //, post).

Appeal against conviction
By notice dated 23 December 1993 Terence William Bowden appealed on a point o f law against his conviction in the Crown Court at
Wolverhampton on 21 October 1993 following his plea of guilty to the charge of misconduct in a public office in response to a preliminary
ruling by Judge Mott that that offence applied generally to officers in local authorities and, in particular, to the post held by the appellant in his
employment as miscellaneous maintenance manager by the Stoke-on- Trent. City Council, The facte are set out in the judgment o f tibe court,

24 February 1995. The following judgment o f the court was delivered.

HIRST' LJ. This is an appeal on a point o f law by the appellant, Terence William Bowden, against a ruling o f Judge Mott in the Crown Court
at Wolverhampton an 21 October 1993, following which the appellant pleaded guilty to misconduct in a public office and was lined £350.
     The sole but very important question at issue is whether the common law offence of misconduct in a public office applies generally to
officers in local authorities and, in particular, to the post held by the appellant in his employment by the City of Stoke-on-Trent
     The judge held that it did so apply, and this conclusion is challenged by Mr Anthony Barker QC, on behalf o f the appellant, on the footing,
as stated in the grounds o f appeal, either that the offence only applies to servants of the Crown or, alternatively, if it has a wider application,
that it does not apply to the post held by the appellant.
     The decision turns on the proper interpretation and application o f a number o f authorities to which we shall shortly refer.
     The appellant was, at the material time, employed by the Stoke-on-Trent City Council as miscellaneous maintenance manager o f the City

R v Bowden

Worts Department. This department was a direct labour organisation, set up in accordance with Ft in of the Local Government, Planning and
Land Act 1980. Under his contract of employment he was responsible tor management and direction of subordinate employees; he was also
accountable for the handling of money and obliged to ^ 506(31 ensure that his department's activities were within budget, it being a statutory
duty under s 16 o f the 1980 Act for every local authority to secure that, in respect of each financial year, their revenue from construction or
maintenance work shows such positive rate o f return on the capital employed lor the purpose o f carrying out the work as the Secretary of State
may direct
     Following the judge’s ruling on the point of law. the appellant pleaded guilty to an offence o f misconduct in a public office, particularised
as follows:

        ‘TERENCE BOWDEN ... between the 1st December, 1989 and the 1st June, 1990, when the holder o f a public office, namely the
     Chief Building Maintenance Officer ... o f Stoke City Council dishonestly caused enhancement joinery, plumbing and electrical wort, to
     be carried out on the premises known as 61 Honeywell House, Stoke, by Council employees when the same was not required under the
     repairing policy o f the Stoke City Council.’*

The premises in question, wens let to the appellant’s lady friend.
     a is convenient at the outset to deploy the relevant authorities in chronological order.
     In the leading case of R v Bembridge (1783) 3 Doug 327, 99 ER 679 the defendant, who was an accountant in the office of the Receiver
and Paymaster General o f the forces, deceitfully concealed from his superior his knowledge that certain sums which should have been inserted
in a filial account were omitted. Following his conviction, on a motion for the arrest o f judgment, Lord Mansfield stated (3 Doug 327 at
331-332; 99 ER 679 at 681):

         ;Tht duty of the defendant is obvious; he was a trustee tor the public and the paymaster, for making eveiy charge and every allowance
     he knew o f ... If the defendant knew o f the omission ... and if he concealed it, his motive must have been cotTupt. That he did know was
     fully proved, and he was guilty therefore, not o f an omission or neglect, but of a gross deceit. The object could only have been to defraud
     the public o f the whole, or part o f the interest... Here there are two principles applicable: first, that a man accepting an office o f trust
     concerning the public, especially if attended with profit, is answerable criminally to the King for misbehaviour in his office; this is true,
     by whomever and tn whatever way the officer is appointed. ’

Willes and Buller JJ concurred.
     M H&tty v Lyme Corp (1828) 5 Bing 91, 130 ER 995 a civil action was brought against Lyme Regis Corporation for failing, in breach o f
their public duty, to repair the Cob- The claim succeeded before Litfledaie J at the Dorchester Spring Assizes m 1828.
     On a morion in arrest o f judgment Best CJ upheld the decision and stated as follows (S Bing 91 at 107,130 ER 995 at 1001):

        ‘Now I take it to be perfectly dear, that if a public officer abuses his office, cither by an act o f omission or commission, and the
     consequence of that, is an injury to an individual, an action may be maintained against such public officer. The instances o f this are so
     numerous, that it would be a waste of time to refer to them. Then, what constitutes a public officer) In my opinion, every one who is
     appointed to discharge a public duty, and receives a compensation in whatever shape, whether from the crown or otherwise, is constituted
     a public officer ’

                                                                    <*5070
Best CJ then instanced certain classes of office holders, including bishops, clergymen and lords o f the manor and also the Bank of England. He
then concluded by enunciating the established principle that-"

          ‘if a man takes a reward,—whatever be the nature of that reward, whether it be m money from the crown, whether it be in land from
      the crown, whether it be in lands or monev from any individual,—for the discharge o f a public duty, that instant he becomes a public
      officer ’ (See 5 Bing 91 at )0 8 : 130 ER 995 at 1001.)

     I n # v Hall [1891 ] 1 QB 747 an overseer far the poor, who was charged with the duty by statute to prepare the register o f qualified voters
in parliamentary and council elections in Whitechapel, was indicted on a number o f counts, on the footing that he corruptly omitted from the
register persons qualified to vote, or included therein persons who were dead or otherwise not entitled to vote. All ihe counts were k id as
common law misdemeanours. On a motion to quash the indictment it was held by Charles J that by virtue o f tbe provisions o f the
Representation of the People Act 1832 and subsequent statutes regulating elections, the only remedies available were those laid down in the
statutes, and that accordingly the indictment was bad. It was clearly implicit in the decision that, but for the statutory provisions, the
iadictmcnt would have been good.
     There are three repotted twentieth century authorities in which convictions for the ofienccs of misconduct in a public office have been
upheld on appeal.
     In i? v Whitaker [1914] 3 KB 1283 The Court of Criminal Appeal (Lawrence, Lush and Atkin JJ) upheld the conviction o f a commanding
officer who had accepted, from a firm o f caterers, sums o f money paid to induce him to accept their representative as tenant o f the regimental
canteen. In response to the argument that the appellant was not a public officer, the court stated (at 1296):

          ‘A public officer is an officer who discharges any duty in the discharge o f which the public are interested, more clearly so it'he is paid
      out of a fund provided by the public. ‘

Heniy v Lyme Corp was cited in argument by the Attorney General, Sir John Simon KC (see [1914] 3 KB 1283 at 1290).

R v Bowden

     In R v Llewellyn Jones [1967] 3 All ER 225, [1968] 1 QB 429 the Court of Criminal Appeal (Lord Parker CJ, Winn U and Willis J) heard
an appeal against conviction by a county court registrar who had made an order with the intention of gaining improper personal advantage. The
court rejected the submission that the count laid in the indictment did not reveal any offence known to the law, which, Lord Parker CJ stated,
‘can in general terms be described as misbehaviour in public office' (see [1967] 3 All ER 225 at 228, [1968] ] QB 429 at 435). Having cited R
v Hal! and R v Bembridge, the court upheld the conviction, stating: ‘Assuming ... there must be some element of dishonesty involved ... that is
inherent in the words of the count1 (see [ 1967] 3 All ER 225 at 229, [ 1968] 1 QB 429 at 437).
     Finally in R v Lfyitham [1979] 3 All ER 641, [1979] QB 722 the Court of Appeal, Criminal Division (Lord Widgery CJ, Shaw LJ and
McNeill J) held the conviction of a constable who, while in uniform, had witnessed the commission o f serious offenses of violence, but had
wilfully failed to take any steps to preserve the Queen’s Peace, or to protect the person o f the victim, or to arrest his assailant- In the course o f
his judgment, Lord Widgery CJ quoted the following passage from Stephen‘s Digest o f the Criminal Law (9th edn, 1950) pp 114-115, art 145:

                                                                     % 508Q
          ‘Every public officer commits a misdemeanour who wilfully neglects to perform any duty which he is bound either by common law or
      by statute to perform provided that the discharge of such duty is not attended with greater danger than a mart o f ordinary finnnc3S and
      activity may be expected to encounter.4 (See [] 979] 3 All ER 641 at 644, [1979] QB 722 at 727 )

Having cited R v Bembridge, Lord Widgery CJ proceeded:

          ‘The neglect must be wilful and not merely inadvertent; and it must be culpable in the sense that it is without reasonable excuse or
      justification. In the present case ... [t]he allegation made was not of mere non-feasance but o f deliberate failure and wilful ncglect. This
      involves an element o f culpability which is not restricted to corruption or dishonesty but which must be o f such a degree that the
      misconduct impugned is calculated to injure the public interest so as to call far condemnation and punishment’ (See [1979] 3 All ER
      641 at 644, [1979] QB 722 at 727-728.)

    Mr Barker opened his argument by relying on the heading to the section in Archbold's Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice in
Criminal Cases (44th edn, 1992) vol 2, para 25-333, viz ‘Misconduct by Executive and Administrative Officials o f the Crown’, though he
recognised that in the current edition (1994) the heading has been changed to ‘Misconduct in A Public Office’,
      He submitted that the earlier heading accurately represents the law, and that it is significant that all the recent cases related to persons
holding high offices o f public trust who owed a duty to the Crown. At the very least, the scope o f the offence was limited to offences where a
breach o f trust would significantly disadvantage the public at large. In no case had a local authority employee been held to fell within the
scope of the offence and any argument based on Henly v Lyme Corp was, he submitted, fallacious, seeing that the case concerned civil and not
criminal liability.
      He submitted that the best definition was that given in Stephen's Digestt which did not cover the appellant seeing that, as Mr Barker
submitted, he was not bound by either a common law or a statutory duty. In any event, Mr Barker submitted that the appellant’s duty was
merely contractual and had no public qualitv.
      Even if this general submission was wrong, the appellants position as a middle manager was, he contended, too lowly to fall within the
 scope of the offence
      At one stage m his argument Mr Barker submitted, by analogy with R v Mall [1891] 1 QB 747, that the common law offence oonld not, in
any event, apply to local authority employees since their position in this field was covered by the Public Bodies Corrupt Practices Act 1889,
which prescribes, in summary, offences of bribery by officers of local authorities who corruptly solicit or receive or agree to receive bribes, rad
by other persons who give promises or offer such bribes to such officers. However, in his reply he did not press the argument since he
recognised that the appellant could not have been prosecuted for his present conduct under those statutory provisions and therefore conceded,
tightly in our judgment, that in his words the 1&89 Act could not be the only mechanism.
      Ably though the argument ’SUSS presented by Mr Barker, we arc unable to accept i t substantially for the reasons submitted by Mr Burbidgr
 on behalf of the prosecution.
      In our judgment the theme which runs through all these cases over the past 200 years is, in the words of Lord Mansfield ir. R v Bzwbridge
 (1783) 3 Doug 327 at 331-332,99 ER 679 at 6$1, that ‘a man accepting an office o f trust concerning the public is answerable criminally to the
 King for misbehaviour in Jus office’ and, <i, 5 09 0 most significantly, that ‘this is true, by whomever and i» whatever way the officer is
 appointed’.
      The same principle is to be found in Henfy v Lyme Carp, where, in our judgment, even though it was a civil case, a public office is
 correctly defined, as embracing— ‘everyone who is appointed to discharge a public duty, and receives compensation in whatever shape whether
from the Crown or otherwise' (see 5 Bing 91 at 107,130 ER 995 at 1001). (Our emphasis.)
      In that case, significantly, the public officers in question were not servants of the Crown, but the corporation o f a borough (the same
 applied, mutatis mutandis, in if v Hall).
      Nothing in the later cases, in our judgment, in any way affects or qualities this general principle. The fact that, as it happened, most of the
 cases are concerned with officers or agents of the Crown docs not establish any curtailment o f the well-established general principle, since in
 no case has it been laid down that the offence is limited to officers or agents o f the Crown. Indeed, the twentieth century cases, in our
judgment, proceeded on the basis o f this general principle, which there was no need to restate,
      So far as the appellant’s personal position is concerned, he was responsible to his employers, the City o f Stoke-on-Trent, for the upkeep o f
 their council housing and in that capacity was accountable for the receipt and disbursement of public money derived by the city council either
 from the rates (or their modem equivalent) or from central government grants. Moreover, his salary was paid from the same public funds. He
 thus, in our judgment, falls fairly and squarely within the definition o f ‘public officer’ laid down in the authorities and we are unable to accept
 the submission that, with these responsibilities, his position was too lowly to qualify.
      In the words o f Best CJ in Henfy v Lyme Carp, repeated almost verbatim in R v Whitaker, he was appointed to discharge public duties and

received compensation therefor from the city o f Stoke-on-Trent This seems to us to fall fully within the public duty at common law referred to
in Stephen's Digest.
     Furthermore, although for reasons already given the 1889 Act does not directly apply, we think that Mr Burbidge is right in submitting
that his argument is reinforced by the definition o f public office in $ 7 of that Act, namely "any office or employment o f a person as a member,
officer or servant o f such a public body ', which is itself defined as ‘any council o f a county ... of a city or a town, any council o f a municipal
borough’.
     This is enough to dispose o f the appeal and it is unnecessary for us to consider Mr Snrbidge’s further argument that the appellant
personally was bound by the statutory duty laid down in s 16 of the 1980 Act, though it is iair to say that w e should have found some difficulty
in bolding that this provision, which clearly lays a duty on local authorities to secure a positive rate of return on the capital employed for the
purpose of carrying out maintenance work, also lays a statutory duty personally on the local authority's officers. However, the point remains
open for future consideration.
     For all these reasons we dismiss this appeal.

COURT OF APPEAL, CRIMINAL DIVISION
LORD WIDGERY CJ, SHAW LJ AND MCNEILL J
9 ,1 8 JU L Y 1979


Criminal law - Misbehaviour in public office - Common law offence - Ingredients o f offence - Police constable charged with wilful neglect to
carry out his duty by omitting to take steps to preserve the peace and protect a man being violently assaulted and arrest his assailants -
Whether offence constituted by matters charged- Whether corruption or fraud a necessary element o f offence.

H ie appellant, a police constable, was on duty in uniform at about 1 am near a club when a man was ejected from the club and. then violently
assaulted by a number o f men who beat and kicked him to death. The appellant took no steps to intervene in the assault and when it was over
merely drove away. He was charged in as indictment with misconduct whilst acting as an officer of justice in that he deliberately failed to
cany out his duty as a police constable by wilfully omitting to take any steps to preserve the pcacc or to protect the man or to arrest or
otherwise bring to justice his assailants. At the trial he objected to the indictment on the ground that it did not disclose an offence known to
the law. H ie trial judge ruled against the objection and the trial proceeded. The jury returned a verdict o f guilty and the appellant was
convicted. He appealed against the conviction on the ground that the trial judge erred in ruling that the indictment disclosed aa offence known
to law. The appellant conceded that at common law there existed an offence o f misconduct in a public office, but contended that mere
non-feasance by a person in the discharge o f his duty as the holder o f a public office was insufficient to constitute the offence and there had to
be a malfeasance or, at least, a misfeasance involving corruption or fraud

Held - A public officer who wilfully and without reasonable excuse or justification neglected to perform any duty he was bound to perform by
common law or statute was indictable for the common law offence of misconduct in a public office. The element o f culpability required v « s
not restricted to corruption or dishonesty, although it had to be such that the conduct impugned was calculated to injure the public interest aed
called for rjmrfgmTiatiiw and punishment. Whether there was such conduct was a matter for the jury on the evidence. Since the indictment
alleged deliberate and wilful neglect by the appellant to perform his duty as a police constable, it disclosed an offence o f misconduct in a
public office. It followed that the judge’s ruling had been correct and that the appeal would be dismissed {see p 644 g to j , post).

18 July 1979. The following judgment was delivered.

LORD WIDGERY CJ read the following judgment of the court prepared by Shaw U . The appellant was a police constable in Lancashire.
On 17 March is>77 at about one o'clock in the morning he was on duty in uniform and was standing by a hot dog stall in Duke Street, St
Helens. A Mr Wincke was inside the stall and a Mr Sothera was by it Some thirty yards away was the entrance to Cindy’s Club. A man
named Stubbs was ejected from the club by a bouncer. A fight ensued in which a number o f men joined. There arose cries and screams and
other indications of great violence. Mr Stubbs became the object of a murderous assault He was beaten and kicked to death in the gutter
outside the club. All this was audible and visible to the three men at the hot dog stall. At no stage did the appellant make any move to
intervene or any attempt to quell the disturbance or to stop the attack an the victim. What the hubbub had died down he adjusted his helmet
and drove away. According to the other two at the hot dog stall, he said that he was due off and was going off.
     His conduct was brought to the notice o f the police authority. As a result he appeared on 10 October 1978 in the Crown Court at Liverpool
to answer a s indictment which was in these terras:

         '... the charge against you is one o f misconduct of an officer of justice, in that you ... misconducted yourself whilst acting as an
     officer o f justice in that you being present and a witness to a criminal offence namely a violent assault upon one ,,, Stubbs by three
     others deliberately failed to carry out your duty as a police constable by wilfully omitting to take any steps to preserve the Queen’s Pstwc
     or to protect the person o f the said ... Stubbs or to arrest or otherwise bring to justice [his] assailants.’

      On arraignment the appellant pleaded not guilty and the trial was adjourned to 7 November. On that day before the jury was empanelled
counsel for the appellant took an objection to the indictment by way o f demurrer. The burden of that objection was                  6420 that the
indictment as laid disclosed no offence known to the law, Neill J ruled against the objection and the trial proceeded. The defence on the tacts
was that the appellant had observed nothing more than that a man was turned out o f the club. It was common ground that in that situation his
duty would not have required him to take any action. The juiy were directed that the crucial question for their consideration was whether the
appellant had seen the attack on the victim. If he had they could find him guilty o f the offence chained in the indictment The jury did return a
verdict o f guilty. Hence this appeal which is confined to the matters o f law raised by the demurrer pleaded at the court of trial-
     At the outset o f his submissions in this court counsel for the appellant conceded two matters. The first was that a police constable is a
public officer. The second was that there does exist at common law an offence of misconduct in a public office.
     From that point the argument was within narrow limits though it ran deep into constitutional and jurisprudential history. The effect o f it
was that not every failure to discharge a duty which devolved on a person as the holder of a public office gave rise to the common law offence
of misconduct in that office. As counsel for the appellant put it non-feasance was not enough. There must be a malfeasance or at least a
misfeasance involving an element o f corruption. In support of this contention a number o f cases wexe cited from IS and 19th century reports-
It is the feet that in nearly all o f them the iwscoiKluk asserted involved some corrupt taint; but this appears to have been a» accident of
circumstance and not a necessary incident o f the offence. Misconduct in a public office is more vividly exhibited where dishonesty is revealed
as part o f the dereliction of duty. Indeed in some cases the conduct impugned cannot be shown to have been misconduct unless it was done
with a corrupt or oblique motive. This was the position for example in A v Betnbridg? and also in the modem case o f R v Llsweifyn-Jones emd
tougher. There the registrar o f a county court was charged in a count which alleged that he had made an order in relation to funds under his
control ‘in the expectation that he would gain personal advantage from the making o f such carder1. On a motion to quash the count as
disclosing no Offence known to the law L as trial judge m the course of my ruling, made the following pronouncement (51 Cr App R 4 at 6-7)-

         ‘The authorities to which 1 have been referred show that there is a variety of ways in which the holder o f a public office may be
     indicted under tins principle for misconduct or misbehaviour. It is clear that a culpable failure to exercise a public duty amy, because the
     duty is a public one, lay the defaulter open to indictment for criminal offences, whereas, had he been working for a private employer, his
     default would have been no more than a civil liability. Even so, it is not easy to lay down with precision the exact limit; of the kind of
     misconduct or misbehaviour which can result in an indictment under this rule. I have formed a clear view, but stated in hypothetical
     terms, that i f the registrar o f a county court when exercising his power to order payment out of court of money held on behalf o f a
     beneficiary were to make an order in expectation of some personal benefit which he hoped to obtain and in circumstances wiere, had it
     not been for the personal benefit, he would not have made the order, that would be an example o f misconduct in a public duty sufficient
     to come within this rule. The reason why 1 feel that that would come within the rule is because m that hypothetical case a public officer
     would be distorting the course o f justice to meet his own persons! ends and, in my opinion, it would be sufficient to justify a conviction it'
     it could be shown that he had made such an order with intent to obtain personal benefit for himself and in circumstances in which f e r e
     were no grounds for supposing that he would not have made the order but for his petsonal interest and expectation. On the other hand, i
     have <t. 643d reached an equally clear view that it is not enough to bring a county court registrar within the principle merely to shew
     that, when making an order which was within his power and which he could make for perfectly proper motives, he tosew that by a side
     w a d , as it were, he was going to gain some personal benefit. The mere fact that he knows o f his persona! interest is, in my view, a very
     good ground for his tfaritning to exercise jurisdiction and for his arranging for someone else, such as the judge, to make an order tor h m
     Everyone in judicial office knows how unwise it is to deal with a case in which personal interests are raised, but I would not be prefared
     to say that it would be misconduct for this purpose tor a registrar to make a decision which did affect his personal interests, merely
     because he knew that his interests were so involved, if the decision was made honestly and in a genuine belief that it was a proper
     exercise o f his jurisdiction so far as the beneficiaries and other persons concerned came into it. When one looks at the terms o f count 1

R v Dytham

     as it now stands, it seems to me that it alleges no more than knowledge on the part o f the defendant that Ms personal interest was
     involved. For the reasons I have given, it is not enough to disclose an offence known to the law and, if the matter rested there, that count
     and others to which similar considerations apply would have to be quashed. On the other hand^ it is not difficult, to amend          1 so a-s
     to introduce the vital element to which I have already referred and I am satisfied that such an              con be       without injustice
     in the circumstances of this case.7

     So also in R v Wyat, a case tried in 1705 it was held that ‘where an officer [in that case a constable] neglects a duty incumbent on him
either by common law or statute, he is for his fault indictable’. Counsel for the appellant contended that this was too wide a              of.
principle since it omitted any reference to corruption or fraud; but in Stephen5s Digest of the Criminal Law3 are to be found thasa words:

a   9tbBdnU9SQ)pn*-n5,mi45______

         ‘Every public officer commits a misdemeanour who wilfiilly neglects to perform any duty which he isbound either by common law or
     by statute to perform provided that the discharge o f such duty is not attended with greater danger than a man o f ordinary firmness and
     activity may be expected to encounter.1

     In support of this proposition R v Wyat is cited as well as R v Bembridge, a judgment of Lord Mansfield. The neglect must be wilful and
act merely inadvertent; and it must be culpable in the sense that it is without reasonable excuse or justification.
     In the preseat case it was not suggested that the appellant could not have summoned or sought assistance to help the victim or to arrest his
assailants. The charge as framed left this answer open to him. Not surprisingly he did not seek to avail himself of it* for tine facts spoke
strongly against any such answer- The allegation made was not of mere non-feasance but o f deliberate feilurc and wilful neglect This
involves an dement of culpability which is not restricted to corruption or dishonesty but which must be o f such a degree that the misconduct
impugned is calculated to injure the public interest so as to call for condemnation and punishment. Whether such a situation is revealed fey die
evidence is a matter that a jw y has to decide. It puts no heavier burden on them than when in more familiar contexts they are called on to
consider whether driving is dangerous or a publication isobscene or a place of public resort is a disorderly house: see R v Quinn, R v Bloom
([1961] 3 All ER U at 91, {1962} 2 QB 245 at 255).
     The judge’s ruling was correct The appeal is dismissed % 644D

                        However, it is plain that the court had substantial reservations about

                                      15 APRIL 1989

                                         INTERIM REPORT OF INQUIRY


                                                  INTRODUCTION

   1. On 15 April 1989 a football match to d ecide a sem i-final round o f the FA Cup com p etition was to be
played between the Liverpool and N ottingham Forest Clubs. The neutral venue chosen was Hillsborough
Football Stadium , Sheffield W ednesday’s ground. Only six m inutes into the gam e, play was stopped when it
was realised that spectators on the terraces behind the Liverpool goal had been severely crushed. In the result,
95 died and over 4 00 received hospital treatment.

  2. On 17 April 1 9 8 9 1 was appointed by you to carry out an Inquiry with the following terms o f reference:

      To inquire into the events at Sheffield W ednesday football ground on 15 April 1989 and to make
      recom m endations about the needs o f crowd control and safety at sports events.

   3. Two A ssessors were appointed to assist me: Mr Brian Johnson Q P M , C h ief C onstable o f Lancashire,
and Professor Leonard M aunder OBE, BSc, P hD , ScD , FEng, FI M ech E, Professor o f M echanical
Engineering at the U niversity o f N ew castle upon Tyne. Their help has been invaluable and I am very grateful
for their expert a dvice and w ise counsels. W hile the sole responsibility for this report is m ine, I am com forted
in the knowledge that both Assessors agree with it.

  4. Mr Robert W halley was appointed Secretary to the Inquiry. He and his assistants have worked
prodigiously and skilfully to give m e all the advice and support I could have wished. I also wish to acknowledge
the help I have received, as always, from my clerk, Mr Ernest Pott.

   5. The policing arrangements for 15 April were in the hands o f the South Yorkshire Constabulary. The
efficacy o f those arrangements and their im plem entation was from an early stage called into question. It was
therefore decided that the investigation o f the disaster and the gathering o f evidence for this Inquiry should be
conducted by an independent police force. Mr Geoffrey Dear Q PM , C h ief C onstable o f West M idlands
Constabulary, undertook this task. He was made responsible directly to me; he appointed Assistant C hief
Constable M ervyn Jones to take full-tim e charge o f the investigation. I am deeply indebted to both o f them.

  6. On 18 April I visited Hillsborough Stadium. I inspected the scene o f the disaster on the terraces and all
relevant parts o f the stadium and its approaches. M y Assessors and I have m ade further visits during the
Inquiry. I also visited Liverpool on 21 and 29 April.

    7. The Lord Mayor and the Sheffield City Council kindly offered to m ake the accom m od ation and facilities
o f Sheffield Town Hall available for the hearing o f oral evidence. T his offer was gratefully accepted and I would
like to record my thanks for those facilities and for the co-operation afforded to the Inquiry by the authorities
in Sheffield.

   8. On 28 April 1 9 8 9 ,1 held a preliminary hearing to announce the date when the oral evidence w ould begin,
to give som e directions as to the procedure I intended to follow and to hear applications from those w ishing to
be represented at the hearing. I accorded representation to the following:
      (i)     T hose bereaved or injured as a result o f the disaster.
      (ii)    The Football Supporters’ Association.
      (iii)   The Football A ssociation.
      (iv)    Sheffield City Council.
      (v)     Sheffield W ednesday Football Club together with the Football League, the Club’s casual sta ff and
              their insurers, the Sun Alliance.
      (vi)    South Yorkshire Constabulary.
       (vii) South Yorkshire Fire and Civil D efence Authority.
Subsequently, during the hearing. I further accorded representation to:
      (viii) Trent Regional Health Authority, for the South Yorkshire Metropolitan A m bulance Service
             (SYMAS).
and   (ix)   Dr W Eastwood, consultant engineer to Sheffield W ednesday Football Club.

   9. Since the circum stances o f the disaster raised urgent questions o f safety, especially at football grounds,
you indicated at the outset that you w ould w elcom e any recom m endations, even o f an interim nature, which /
m ight be able to give in advance o f the new football season due to com m en ce in m id-August 1 9 8 9 .1 therefore
announced at the preliminary hearing on 28 April that I w ould conduct an oral hearing with all possible
expedition as the first phase o f the Inquiry to discover the facts and causes o f the disaster and enable me to
m ake any im m ediate interim recom m endations necessary in the short term.

   10. The West M idlands Police investigation began on 24 April. A “Freephone” num ber was advertised to
enable members o f the public, especially those who had attended the m atch, to offer their evidence to the
Inquiry. Initially this number was available for three days on 28 different lines. The response from the public
was such that the lines were continued for a further three days by the end o f which 2,6 6 6 calls had been
received. There were also many written offers o f help. S om e 4 4 0 West M idlands officers were deployed on the
Inquiry. To service this operation, special police offices were established in Birmingham, Liverpool and
Sheffield and com puter technology was used to the full. In all som e 3 77 6 statem ents were taken. There were
also som e 1550 letters to Ministers, to the Inquiry and to m e personally all o f which I read. The police,
Sheffield W ednesday Football Club and the BBC had vid eo cameras film ing at the ground on 15 April, in
aggregate, they recorded som e 71 hours o f film covering the period before, during and after the disaster. Thus
the material gathered and potentially available for presentation at the oral hearing was enorm ous. From this
m->s it was essential to select only sufficient good and reliable evidence necessary to establish the fat and
causes o f the disaster.

   11. W here it seem ed likely that any allegation or criticism might be m ade o f the conduct o f any person or
party, the Treasury Solicitor, after consultation with Counsel for the Inquiry, wrote to the party concerned
setting out the likely grounds for com plaint. This followed the practice established by the Royal C om m ission
on Tribunals o f Inquiry (the Salmon C om m ission).

   12. The hearing began on 15 May. It continued, sitting long hours, for 31 days concluding on 29 June. In
that period, 174 w itnesses gave oral evidence. Counsel's subm issions were delivered in writing on 7 July and
on 14 July I heard their b rief oral subm issions supplem enting the written argument.

  13. W itnesses were not sworn. Since this is a departmental inquiry, there was no power to adm inister the
oath but there was no instance o f any witness giving evidence which I considered might have been different
had he or she been sworn.

  14. T he w itnesses called were only a small fraction o f those from whorr: statements were or could have been
taken. Nevertheless, I am satisfied that they were sufficient in number and reliability to enable m e to reach the
necessary conclusions. To have called more would have prevented m e from presenting an interim report in the
required tim e and w ould not have added significantly to the relevant evidence. I have, however, been able to
take into account m any written statements in addition to oral testimony.

   15. Apart from the evidence called by Counsel for the Inquiry which was drawn from statements taken by
the West M idlands Police and others volunteered by individuals, each o f the represented parties was given full
opportunity to put forward any w itnesses they considered should be called. A final subm ission was made by
Counsel for the South Yorkshire Police that since the investigation by West M idlands Police is still continuing,
all the evidence has not been assembled and it would be unsafe for m e to make findings o f fact. I should
therefore make clear that the investigation continues principally to furnish as much detail as possible to HM
C oroner for the C ity o f Sheffield as to the cause o f death, the precise position at death and the care and
m ovem ent o f each o f the 95 victim s individually. I am assured by C h ief Constable D ear and Assistant C hief
C onstable M ervyn Jones that it is m ost unlikely any further evidence gathered will significantly alter or add to
the history o f events which emerged at the hearing.

  16. I should like to thank all those who made it possible for the oral hearing to take place so soon after the
event and for evidence to be efficiently presented and tested so as to give a full and fair account o f what
happened in all its aspects without irrelevancy or duplication. I pay tribute particularly to the West M idlands
Police for their speed and dedication in gathering the evidence and to all those responsible for processing it.

The most eloquent tribute to the fairness and thoroughness o f the police investigation cam e from the Secretary
o f the Football Supporters A ssociation. He said there had been initial anxiety in Liverpool as to whether that
investigation would be fair and objective. His A ssociation therefore collected 200 witness statements
themselves. Having heard the opening statement by Counsel to the Inquiry based upon the evidence gathered
by the police, he found that it accorded entirely with his A ssociation’s evidence and the initial anxiety was
wholly dispelled.

   17. Before and during the Inquiry I derived great assistance on a w ide range o f technical issues from the
Health and Safety Executive w ho providentially have a laboratory in Sheffield (the Research and Laboratory
Services D ivision ) where tests were conducted and reports prepared swiftly and efficiently. This was d one
in close consultation with Professor Maunder. I am m ost grateful to the Director, Dr A Jones, and to the
Deputy Director, Dr C E N icholson, for their invaluable help.

   18. 1 wish to com m en d Counsel to the inquiry, Mr Andrew C ollins QC, M r Alan G oldsack and Mr
Bernard Phillips for their industry, care and fairness in selecting and presenting the necessary evidence; also.
Counsel for all those represented who tested that evidence fully but expeditiously. This Interim Report could
not possibly have been prepared in so short a tim e had I not had the whole-hearted co-operation o f all those
m entioned and many others.

   19. The second phase o f the Inquiry will be directed to m aking final and long term recom m endations about
crowd control and safety at sports grounds. I need to consider in depth information, o p in io n s and arguments
from a w ide range o f sources and contributors both here and abroad. It was clear from the outset that this
second phase could not be carried to com pletion before the next football season. However, at an early stage o f
the oral hearing I invited evidence from all w ho wished to contribute to it and specifically from m any sporting,
local authority, em ergency service and p olice bodies as well as technical consultants. I asked that subm issions
should be in writing and should be m ade prom ptly so that the second phase o f the Inquiry could
follow im m ediately after the first. I shall now proceed to consider the large body o f written evidence which has
been subm itted. I shall want in som e instances to have further oral evidence or discussion in conjunction with
my Assessors. We will also need to make a number o f visits and inspections.

  20. I now present my Interim Report and R ecom m endations. I shall prepare my Final Report and
R ecom m endations as soon as reasonably possible.

                          T H E G R O U N D A N D PRE-M ATCH A R R A N G E M E N T S

Fixing The Venue
   21. On 20 March 1989. the Football Association (the FA) requested that their Cup semi-final between
Liverpool and N ottingham Forest be held on 15 April at Hillsborough Football Stadium. The corresponding
semi-final between the sam e two team s had been held there in April 1988. The arrangements had been
successful in the view both o f the police and o f the host club. Sheffield Wednesday (the Club) were therefore
w illing to accom m odate the 1989 match. South Yorkshire Constabulary were prepared to police it but only if
the ticketing arrangements were the sam e as those for 1988. Otherwise, the FA would have to look elsewhere.
T hose arrangements did not please Liverpool or its supporters either in 1988 or 1989. They thought the ticket
allocation was unfair for reasons to be explained later. Reluctantly, however, the police requirement was
accepted and the match was fixed for 15 April at Hillsborough.

The Ground
  22. The Hillsborough Stadium is som e 2'A m iles to the north-west o f central Sheffield in the district o f
Owlerton. The ground was op en ed in 1899 on what was then a greenfield site by the river D on. T he pitch lies
roughly east to west. A plan o f the ground and its im m ediate environs is at A ppendix 1.

  23. The west end. with w hich this Inquiry is principally concerned, is known as the Leppings Lane end. The
east end abuts on Penistone Road, the A 61. To the south is the river D on and to the north a residential street,
Vere Road, which runs between Leppings Lane and Penistone Road North.

   24. Alongside the river is a private roadway giving access to the south stand, to the Directors’ and players’
entrances, and to the adm inistrative block under the stand. The roadway gives both vehicular and pedestrian
access between Penistone Road and Leppings Lane, but there are gates w hich can shut it o ff at each end. There
is som e car parking along this roadway principally for Directors, players and em ployees o f the Club. The south
stand dates from 1914 and is the oldest at the ground. It is all seating with places for 8.800. 5.500 o f those are
roofed over and 3.300 are uncovered.

  25. The north stand is also all seating and accom m odates about 9.700. Behind it is a gym nasium or sports
hall. There are also a first aid room and police room close by.

  26. The east end is all terracing and is known as the Spion Kop. It was enlarged and roofed over in 1986 and
now accom m odates som e 21.00 0 standing spectators. There are crush barriers in the Kop running parallel to
the goal line but no dividing fences to prevent free m ovem ent from side to side.

   27. At the west or Leppings Lane end o f the ground there is terracing close to the pitch. Behind it is the west
stand which provides covered seating and was built in 1965 for World Cup matches, som e o f which were held
at Hillsborough in 1966. The covered stand accom m odates 4.45 6 seated spectators. The terracing in front o f it
extends higher in the corners between the stands and its total capacity was stated to be 10,100. At both the Kop
end and the west end access to the pitch is barred by perimeter fencing. The fencing is about eight feet high
m ounted upon the low wall at the foot o f the terracing. At the top o f the fencing the w ire returns back at a sharp
angle for som e 15 inches to make it difficult for anyone to clim b over towards the pitch. There are gates at
intervals along the perimeter fencing to afford access between terrace and pitch. These gates are less than a
metre w ide and were designed to be opened only from the pitch side for police purposes or in an emergency.
They are marked and numbered on the plan A ppendix 1.

   28. U nlike the Kop end. the west terracing has not only crush barriers parallel with the goal line but radial
fences at right angles to it. dividing the area into pens. This d ivision was begun after an FA Cup semi-final in
1981 when crushing occurred due to overcrowding and gates had to be opened. It proceeded in stages, the final
arrangement being shown on the plan A ppendix 1. The first section o f the west terracing m oving south to north
contains gates 1 and 2 and is known as pens 1 and 2 although in fact constituting only o n e pen. N ext is pen 3
with one gate, next pen 4 with on e gate; pen 5. which is extrem ely narrow, was intended as a sterile area to
d ivid e pen 4 from pen 6. This was to isolate hom e and away fans on occasion s when both might be
accom m odated on the west terracing in separate pens. Finally there is pen 7 at the north-west com er. Pens 5, 6
and 7 each have a perimeter gate. At the back o f the pens, under the front o f the west stand, there is a gate in


                                                          4
each radial fence. W hen those gates are open, the back row o f the terracing is intended to permit access from
pen to pen along the whole west side. In practice, when substantial numbers are present, those gateways are not
readily visible or accessible The nrfSen! layout o f the pens, fences, crush barriers and gates has resulted from a
series o f piecem eal changes. The nature and effect o f those changes must be considered later.

T h e T u r n stile s
   29. Because o f the housing in Vere Road there is no access from the north side o f the ground. Along
Penistone Road North there are som e 46 turnstiles which usually give access both to the Kop and to the east
end o f the north stand. They are marked 43 to 88 inclusive on the plan. T he 12 numbered 77 to 88 are designed
to feed the north stand but were not used for that purpose on 15 April in order to segregate supporters o f the
two teams as appears later. Two o f them, 77 and 78. were however used for access to the Kop.

  30. At the south side o f the ground there were 24 turnstiles (numbered 19 to 42 on the plan). Those
numbered 37 to 4 2 led to the Kop and the rest to the south stand.

  31. In summary, the south and east sides o f the ground accom m odated som e 29 ,8 0 0 whose access on the
day was through 60 turnstiles.

  32. The other two sides o f the ground, north and west, with a capacity o f 24,256 were fed solely from the
Leppings Lane entrance where there were only 23 turnstiles.

Travel to th e G r o u n d
  33. Most supporters were expected to com e by road although rail transport was available. Nottingham
supporters travelling by train w ould arrive at the m ain line Sheffield Midland Station w hence they would be
directed and escorted northwards by the police. They would arrive at the ground along Penistone Road.
Nottingham supporters travelling by coach, m ini-bus or car w ould approach Sheffield from the south mainly
on the M 1. Again their arrival at the ground w ould predom inantly be via Penistone Road or Herries Road.

   34. Liverpool supporters travelling by normal rail serv ice would arrive at Sheffield M idland Station just
like their N ottingham counterparts. The police aim ed to segregate the rival fans and put them into separate
coaches. Liverpool fans could alternatively travel by special train to Wadsley Bridge, a British Rail station
catering solely for football supporters and situated to the north o f the ground. A police escort was available to
conduct them on foot to the Leppings Lane entrance. Those com in g from Liverpool by road would approach
Sheffield either via the M 62 and down the M 1 from the north or across the Pennines from the north west. All
such routes would bring them to the ground via one or other limb o f Leppings Lane as shown on A ppendix 1.
Broadly, therefore, arrivals from Liverpool would be from the north and west: arrivals from Nottingham
would be from the south and east.

A llo ca tio n o f P l a c e s a n d T i c k e t s
  35. Experience in recent years has produced a policy o f segregation to prevent trouble between supporters
of rival teams. T he need for this policy to be m aintained was endorsed and em phasised by the Popplewell
Report following the Bradford City disaster in 1985. Accordingly, before the 1988 semi-final the police decided
that sections o f the Hillsborough Stadium should be allocated so as to achieve efficient segregation o f
Liverpool and N ottingham Forest fans. T he section to be granted to each was determined by the direction
w hence each predom inantly approached. Thus, Liverpool were allotted the north and west sides o f the ground
for which access was from Leppings Lane. N ottingham Forest were allotted the south and east sides with access
from Penistone Road.

   36. The effect o f the decision was that for this all-ticket Cup Tie. Liverpool were allotted only 24,256 places
as against 29.800 for N ottingham Forest. This, although average attendance o f supporters at h om e matches
was substantially higher at Liverpool than at Nottingham . Moreover, with standing tickets at £6 and seats at
£12, Nottingham Forest had 2 1 .0 0 0 standing places com pared with Liverpool’s 10.100. So, Liverpool’s
allocation was more expensive as well as smaller. Understandably. Liverpool were aggrieved by the allocation
o f places and tickets. They sought with som e support from the host club and the FA to have it changed in
1988. but the police were adamant. To switch ends would, in their opinion, have involved rival supporters
crossing each other's paths when approaching the ground thereby frustrating attempts at segregation and
creating a risk o f disorder. In 1989, when the sam e plan was proposed. Liverpool again challenged it. The
police, however, m aintained their view, adding that those who had attended in 1988 would be familiar with the
arrangements and that any change would lead to confusion.


                                                         5
A c c e s s from L e p p in g s L a n e
   37. As the plan Appendix 1 shows, the approach to the west turnstiles is across a narrow neck or forecourt at
a bend in Leppings Lane where, com in g from the north, it turns to the south-west and crosses a bridge over the
river D on. Parking areas for the Liverpool supporters had been arranged north and west o f the ground. They
were therefore expected to arrive on foot along both lim bs o f Leppings Lane and would converge on the
forecourt at the bend. In an arc across that forecourt is a line o f railings with six sets o f double gates. Inside
those perimeter gates is the short approach to the turnstiles. As shown in the photographs A ppendix 2. the
latter are in two sections divided by a fence. The northern section consists o f turnstiles 1 to 16. Num bers 1 to
 10 gave access to the north stand. Thus there were 10 turnstiles for the 9.700 with north stand seats. Their
tickets were marked “Entrance A ” and were colour-coded brown. Turnstiles 1 to 10 correspondingly had the
letter A above them and brown boards on the wall.                                         '

   38. Turnstiles 11 to 16 were for those with seats in the west stand. Thus 4,456 were served by six turnstiles.
They were the next block to the right o f those marked A. However, instead o f these turnstiles and the west stand
tickets being marked B as might alphabetically have been expected, they were marked C. Their colour-code on
tickets and boards was red.

   39. On the other side o f the d ividing fence in the approach area, there were only seven turnstiles to serve
10.100 with tickets for the west terracing. Those seven turnstiles were labelled A to G . This was because there
had originally been 18 turnstiles at Leppings Lane and the sequential numbering continued from 19 upwards
on the south side o f the ground. W hen the number at Leppings Lane was brought up to 23 the present
arrangements o f 1 to 1^. A to G and then 19 upwards was adopted to avoid re-numbering all round the ground.
However, above the lettering A to G was a large letter B. "Entrance B” also appeared on tickets for the west
terrace. Thus, the three blocks o f turnstiles encountered by a ticket holder at the Leppings Lane end read from
left to right A. C, B. The colour-code for west terrace tickets and the boards beside turnstiles A to G was m auve.
To the right o f turhstile G is a tubulai steel barrier to d ivid e the queue for that turnstile from the roadway to the
south stand.

I n s id e th e L e p p in g s L a n e T u r n s tile s
  40. Turnstiles 1 to 10 gave access to a passageway leading to the north stand. There is an exit gate (marked A
on Appendix 1) between turnstile 1 and the adjacent housing.

  41. Inside turnstiles 1 to 16 is a concourse leading to pens 6 and 7 and the steps to the west stand. There is a
wall dividing this area from that inside turnstiles A to G . It had been built to segregate hom e and away fans at a
tim e when the Club intended they should share the west terrace. That idea was not pursued but the wall
remained. There was. however, a gateway in the wall which did permit access between the tw-o areas. An exit
gate (marked B on A ppendix 1) was provided from the area inside turnstiles 11 to 16.

  42. Finally, anyone using turnstiles A to G entered a concourse bounded on the left by the wall just
m entioned and on the right by the wall o f the private roadway com ing from the south stand to Leppings Lane.
There was an exit gate in the latter wall (marked C on Appendix 1)just inside turnstile G.

  43. All three exit gates. A. B and C. were o f concertina design. They could be opened only from the inside
and were not intended for entry o f spectators into the ground.

   44. Those entering through turnstiles A to G had three options once inside the ground. They could by
m oving to the right go round the south end o f the west stand and gain entry into pens 1 and 2. They could go
through the gap in the dividing wall towards the concourse behind turnstiles 11 to 16 and then round the north
end o f the west stand into pens 6 or 7. However, there were no conspicuous signs inviting them to take either o f
those courses. The obvious way in was straight ahead o f the turnstiles where a tunnel under the m iddle o f the
west stand gave access to pens 3 and 4. Above its entrance in large letters was the word "Standing” and a large
letter "B”. Thus B ticket holders were drawn towards the tunnel.

   45. The length o f the tunnel is som e 23 metres. It rises slightly at first then levels o ffb u t finally descends
towards the terraces at a gradient o f 1 in 6. As it emerges onto the terrace, the way ahead is bisected by the radial
fence between pen 3 on the right and pen 4 on the left. A short spur o f brick wall projects forward from each side
o f the tunnel at its mouth. Those emerging are thus guided straight forward rather than to either side Ti.e
photograph at A ppendix 3 shows the west stand and terraces.

  46. As with the layout on the terraces, the configuration o f the Leppings Lane turnstiles and the areas inside
them was effected by a series o f piecemeal changes. Again, it will be necessary to analyse their resultant effect.


                                                            6
Policing A r r a n g e m e n ts
  47. At the 1988 semi-final, policing had been under the control o f C hief Superintendent Mole, then
Commander o f F D ivision within whose area Hillsborough lies. He was still in post on 20 March 1989 when
the FA broached the 1989 semi-final, but he was due to hand over com m and o f F D ivision on 27 March to
Superintendent Duckenfield on the latter’s prom otion to C hief Superintendent. Both were present at an initial
meeting on 22 March, but on 27 March Mr Mole bowed out and Mr Duckenfield took over. Under him were
Sector C omm anders, all Superintendents with much experience o f policing football m atches at Hillsborough
and elsewhere. In particular. Superintendent Marshall was in charge o f the area outside the Leppings Lane
entrance and the approaches to it. Superintendent Greenwood was in com m and inside the ground, but this
included the area between the turnstiles and the perimeter fence. They thereby swapped roles from the
previous year. Under Mr D uckenfield’s overall com m and were som e 801 officers and men on duty at the
ground plus traffic officers and others from D D ivision to deal with the influx o f supporters into the city centre.
In all. therefore, som e 1,122 police were deployed for this match am ounting to about 38 percent o f the total
South Yorkshire force. Included in the m ounted section o f 34 were officers from Liverpool and Nottingham to
assist respectively in marshalling their hom e supporters. The total at the ground was divided into serials
consisting usually o f eight to ten Constables plus a Sergeant and an Inspector. The serials were posted to duties
at various stations in and around the ground in three phases: before, during and after the match. All o f this
was provided for in an Operational Order which followed closely the Order drawn up for the 1988 semi-final
and took into account the force's “Standing Instructions for the Policing o f Football Grounds”. The Order
described the duties o f each serial at each phase. It was supplem ented by oral briefings before and on the day o f
the match.

S h e ffie ld W e d n e s d a y 's A r r a n g e m e n ts
  48. The Club provided 376 stewards, gatemen and turnstile operators for duty on 15 April. The stewards
were briefed as to their duties on the morning o f the match by police Inspectors and were allocated round the
ground. They wore yellow tabards. The Club's control room, situated below the south stand, could
communicate by VHF radio with the stewards. Closed circuit television was installed by the Club with
screens in their control room showing all the turnstiles round the ground. A com puterised counting system was
incorporated in the turnstiles. This flashed onto a screen in the Club control room the running total o f
spectators passing through the turnstiles section by section. Thus, at the Leppings Lane end. there would be
separate running totals for turnstiles 1 to 10 (north stand), turnstiles 11 to 16 (west stand), and turnstiles A to G
(west terraces). When the total for any section was w ithin 15 per cent o f its permitted capacity a warning pulse
showed on the screen. For the west terracing that warning would occur when the numbers were within 15 per
cent o f the total terrace capacity o f 10.100. What the system could not d o was m onitor the distribution o f fans
on the terracing, pen by pen. It could give no warning therefore if one pen was full beyond its safe capacity.

P olice C o m m u n ic a tio n s
  49. The nerv e centre for police control is the control room or box situated at the south-west corner o f the
ground between the south stand and pen 1 o f the west terracing. The box is elevated and reached by a number
ot steps. It has window's com m anding views across the pitch and straight ak ng the line o f the west perimeter
tence. The box is very small and has seats for only three officers. Superintendent Murray was in control o f it
and was advisor to Mr Duckenfield as he had been to Mr Mole the year before. N ext to him sat Sergeant
Goddard who operated the radios. The third seat was for Police Constable Ryan w ho operated the telephone
and public address sy stems. At the back o f the box stood Police Constable Bichard who was in control o f the
police closed circuit television system operated by a row1o f consoles on a bench in front o f him and behind the
 three seated officers.

    50 There were five television screens showing views o f five roving cameras fixed at high points on the
 stands and directed both inside and outside the ground. There was also a master screen which flicked in
 rotation from one camera view to another and which made a vid eo recording. The cameras have a zoom
 facility to close in on any point o f interest. Specifically, there were good camera views o f the west terracing, o f
 ihc lepp in gs Lane turnstiles and beyond them o f Leppings Lane itself.

   51. The Tannov public address system was relayed through speakers fixed at vantage points inside the
 gtound and outside the turnstiles. It was used by a disc jockey, housed under the police control box. to relay
 music before the match, but it could be overridden by the police. Messages could be relayed through all
 speakers or If appropriate to one area only.

   53.    R adio contact at Hillsborough from control to serials operating both inside and outside the ground was
U H F on channel 25. There was a W1 FU portable base station in the control box and if it failed there was a
stand-by station under the operator’s bench. Hand sets were issued to all ranks o f Sergeant and above.
C om m un ity Constables on duty would already have their own. Other Constables had no radio.
C om m un ication was on "talk through” i.e. any message from any source would be heard by everyone tuned in
and if more than one source spoke messages could becom e garbled. Ear pieces were issued to som e officers in
an attem pt to overcom e the loud crowd noise which made receipt o f signals very difficult. There were other
radio channels open to Sergeant Goddard: V H F to police Headquarters at Snig Hill, channel 35 to F!
Sub-divisional Headquarters at Ham m erton Road and channel 19 used by C ID . There was also a set tunM to
Sheffield W ednesday’s radio system between its control room and the stewards.

Early A rriva ls
  54. 15 April 1989 was a warm sunny spring Saturday. The match was a sell-out, so 54,000 ticket holders
were expected. Others would com e without tickets hoping to acquire them or even to gain access otherwise.
The following account concentrates, as did the evidence, on the western approaches and the Liverpool
supporters since the disaster occurred at their end. They began to arrive in the Hillsborough area quite early in
small numbers. Som e brought cans o f beer with them and were seen drinking as they walked; others took
advantage o f the weather and sat about on walls and open spaces. W hen the public houses opened, many
resorted there, drinking inside or spilling out into the sunshine. Leppings Lane and its environs com prise a
mixed shopping and residential area. Local residents saw groups o f Liverpool supporters keen to find a public
house or off-licence. Many were asking for tickets or "spares”. There were a few touts selling them at inflated
prices. From an early stage, som e o f the fans were using private gardens and yards to urinate. As the morning
wore on, numbers increased. Requests for tickets and trespass to urinate also increased. Still the prevailing
mood was one o f carnival, good hum our and expectation.

P u b lic H o u s e s
  55. There were som e 74 shops with off-licences in and around Sheffield. In general, they opened at 8 am.
Liverpool supporters did visit them but the evidence did not suggest a great am ount o f alcoholic drink was
bought there.

  56. Opening tim e at public houses was in general 11 am . Som e remained closed all day. O f the others, som e
72, mostly in the city, were frequented by local patrons only. Som e 23 public houses, however, served over a
hundred Liverpool supporters each. Another 51 served more than 20 each. Little trouble was reported, but
many supporters drank enough to affect their m ood. At first excitem ent; later frustration.

T h e G a t h e r in g C ro w d
   57. Towards the end o f the morning, fans gathered on and around the bridge near the Leppings Lane
entrance. They seem ed reluctant to enter the ground early. All turnstiles were open at 12 noon and one or two
as early as 11.30 am. Som e 53 police had been deployed to operate outside the turnstiles and in the Leppings
Lane area. They enquired at random whether fans had tickets. T hose who had not were advised to go away;
nevertheless, many returned more than once. Those w ho had tickets were guided in the right direction. The
police tried to persuade them to enter the ground early. Officers, male and female, had been posted outside
each turnstile with the duty o f searching entrants for weapons, drink or drugs. Once through the turnstile, an
entrant was liable to be searched again by one o f a serial o f officers p ositioned just inside.

   58. At about 12 noon C h ief Inspector Creaser asked Superintendent Murray whether the pens on the west
terrace were to be filled on< by one successively, but was told that they sh ou H al> be available from the start and
the fans should find their own level.

  59. By 2 pm it was apparent to those inside the ground and those m onitoring events in the police and Club
control rooms that the num ber o f N ottingham fans in their places greatly outnum bered those from Liverpool.
The Kop and the south stand were filling up steadily, but the north and west stands were half empty. It was
noted about that time that the turnstile figures showed only 12.000 had entered as against 20,000 at the same
time the previous year. On the west terraces, although pens 3 and 4 were filling, the wing pens 1 ,2 ,6 and 7 were
nearly empty. At 2.15 pm a Tannoy message asked fans in pens 3 and 4 to m ove forward and make room for
others.

  60. There had been three special trains from Liverpool in 1988. This tim e, there was only one. It arrived
early, just before 2 pm. at Wadsley Bridge station. The 350 passengers were met by both m ounted and foot
police officers who escorted them in a crocodile down Leppings Lane. They were orderly and passed through
the turnstiles into the ground by about 2.20 pm without incident.

   61. By this time the police Traffic D ivision reported that the Liverpool routes were clear, so the majority o f
 Liverpool fans were in the Sheffield area. The numbers converging on the Leppings Lane entrance were
 increasing rapidly. Between the perimeter gates and the turnstiles the crowd becam e congested. There was no
 longer a separate queue at each turnstile but a single phalanx filling the w hole approach area. The foot officers
 outside the turnstiles were no longer able to search everyone and had difficulty in searching even selectively.


                                                              9
M ounted officers in and outside the turnstile area were having difficulty manoeuvring in such a dense crowd.
The poliCt were beset by fans bem used by the ticket and turnstile labelling asking for directions. Many had
been drinking but up to and just after 2.30 pm the mood remained good.

   62.     Superintendent Marshall was on foot amongst the crowd. He becam e anxious about the numbers
com in g down Leppings Lane and spilling out onto the roadway where buses and cars were moving. At 2.17
pm he radioed to control to have m otor traffic in Leppings Lane stopped. This was eventually done at about
2.30 pm. U p to this time, despite the large mass outside the turnstiles and the numbers still approaching, there
was still no panic in the crowd; no perception o f crisis by the police. In the control room Mr Murray, w ho could
see Leppings Lane on the video, advised Mr Duckenfield that they would get everyone in by 3 pm. Mr
D uckenfield reaffirmed to him the policy about a delayed kick-off. It would be ordered only if there was som e
major external factor such as fog on the Pennines or delay on the motorway: not if spectators merely turned up
late even in large numbers.

                                    TH E C R ISIS AT TH E T U R N ST IL E S

    63. In the 20 m inutes from 2.30 pm to 2.50 pm there were crucial developm ents both inside and outside
the ground. In pens 3 and 4 there was a steady increase in pressure as more fans cam e through the tunnel to the
favoured area behind the goal. By 2.50 pm these pens were already full to a degree which caused serious
discomfort to many well used to enduring pressure on terraces. The numbers at that tim e were clearly in excess
o f the m axim um density stated by the H om e Office G uide to Safety at Sports Grounds (1986 Edn) (the Green
Guide) i.e. 54 persons per 10 square metres. (Although the Green G uide has no statutory or legal force, it is the
only official advice available about safety at sports grounds.) In the wing pens 1, 2. 6 and 7, there was still
ample room and bare patches o f concrete were visible.

   64. Meanwhile, the crowd grew at the Leppings Lane entrance. As more arrived at the back the crush at the
front grew worse. Entry to the turnstiles becam e more difficult. Their efficiency was impaired and'jheir rate
reduced. Arrivals at the back exceeded deliveries through the turnstiles, so the build-up increased. The foot
officers outside were unable to function and in danger them selves so they went through the tum stile^and out
again through gate C where they did what they could to relieve pressure by the tubular barrier. The mounted
officers were surrounded by the dense mass o f people and becam e ineffective. Superintendent Marshall was in
the midst o f the turmoil. He extricated him self and stood on a parapet o f the bridge to get a clear view. A
drunken fan tried to push him off: a beer can was thrown at a m ounted officer. But these were isolated acts by
individuals: the m enace cam e from the m assive numbers single-m indedly determ ined to be in for the kick-off
with tim e running out. At the back o f the crowd fans were frustrated by the lack o f progress as 3 o’clock
approached. Some, mostly young men who had been drinking, tried to push and force their way forward. At
the front, people were jam m ed together and against the turnstile walls. Som e panicked as the pressure
intensified. Som e youngsters and wom en were fainting and in distress. They were helped out through the
tubular barrier by turnstile G or were passed over the turnstiles elsewhere. Fans clim bed up and over the
turnstile building or on to the dividing fence. This was to escape the crush rather than to gain free entry since
most o f them had tickets.

  65. At 2.44 pm Mr Marshall radioed for reinforcements, for the Tannoy to request the crowd to stop
pushing and for a vehicle with loudspeaker equipm ent to com e and request the same. Unhappily, at about 2.40
pm. radio com m unication on channel 25 became defective. For a period o f two or three minutes the control
room lost contact. A com m unications officer cam e promptly and switched to the standby station. With the use
of a handset at control, contact was restored. D espite this hiatus, two o f Mr Marshall's requests were received.
The Tannoy was used but with little effect. Reinforcements, including m ounted officers from Penistone Road,
were sent. The third request, for a Landrover. was received direct by its driver PC Buxton who arrived at 2.46
pm and urged the crowd by loudspeaker not to push. This was no more effective than the Tannoy. The
mounted officers besieged near the turnstiles cam e outside the perimeter gates. An attempt was m ade to shut
them against the crowd outside, to enable the throng inside to be dispersed or at least thinned through the
turnstiles. The pressure from without, however, opened the gates again. Mounted officers, now reinforced to
greater numbers, formed a cordon across tne elbow o f Leppings La.ie from the sweet shop to the bridge, again
with the object o f reducing pressure inside the gates. They were successful in this for som e minutes despite
desperate individuals forcing their way under or between the horses. However, this exercise was overtaken by a
more dramatic relief o f the pressure.

"Open the Gates"
   66. Between 2.40 pm and 2.45 pm the crowd inside and outside the turnstile approach had swelled to
over 5.000. At the head o f the phalanx conditions had becom e intolerable. Those w ho got through were short
o f breath and sweating profusely. Many com plained to police officers on the concourse inside the turnstiles
and asked them in forceful terms to do som ething. Exit gates A and B were being shaken. It was clear the crowd
could not passthrough the turnstiles by 3 pm. Police Constable Buxton radioed from the Landrover to control
asking that kick-off be postponed. The suggestion was acknowledged but rejected.

  67. Superintendent Marshall realised the crowd had becom e unmanageable. Although loth to do so, since it
-vas contrary to basic police strategy, he decided to request the exit gates be opened to relieve the pressure.
Otherwise, he feared fatalities would occur. Other senior officers outside the ground agreed. At 2.47 pm he
radioed control to permit the gates to be opened. At 2.48 pm. whilst Mr Duckenfield was considering the
request, gate C' opened to eject a youth who had climbed in with no ticket. Immediately, fans outside took
advantage and about 150 managed to get in before a mounted officer enabled the gate to be closed again. Mr
Marshall repeated his request. Still no response from control. He repeated it a third time, adding that if the


                                                        11
gates were not opened som eone was going to be killed. In the control room. Mr Duckenfield Had not made a
decision Mr Murray asked him “Are you going to open the gates?”. Mr Duckenfield gave the order and Sg:
Goddard radioed to Mr Marshall “Open the gates”. N either the Club control room nor anv oolice officers
inside the turnstiles were told o f this order before or after it was given or o f any action it would require.

  68. At 2.52 pm. gate C was opened wide. Fans behind turnstiles A to G and from the concourse beyond
cam e round to flow through it in large numbers.

   69. About two m inutes later the pressure outside gate A led Sgt Higgins to radio, despite the gateman’s
objection, for it to be opened. If it was not, he said, “ It’ll go and som eon e will get killed". Permission was given,
but this tim e reserve serials were alerted to m onitor the inrush towards the north stand. Gate B was also briefly
opened against the gateman’s wishes and about 2 0 0 o f those pressed at turnstiles A to G gained entry to their
left.

  70. The largest entry, however, was through gate C. In the five m inutes it was open about 2,0 00 fans passed
through it s'eadilv at a fast walk. Som e may have had tickets for the stands. N o doubt som e had no tickets at all.
The majority had tickets for the terraces. O f these, som e found their way either right to pens 1 and 2 or left
through the dividing wall to 6 and 7. But a large proportion headed straight for the tunnel in front o f them.




                                                           12

   71. The initial influx through gate C, augmented by entrants via the turnstiles, cam e through the tunnel
with great m om entum . Fans spoke o f being swept through, feet o ff the ground. The I in 6 gradient accelerated
their progress. U pon reaching the crowded pens, som e wished to go back but were unable to d o so. The new
arrivals found them selves pushed forward and the pressure becam e intense. At 2.54 pm, shortly after this
influx began, the team s cam e onto the pitch. As usual, this was greeted by a surge forward. Many were now
acutely uncomfortable and som e were in distress. The mass seethed about but voluntary m ovem ent by any
individual was difficult; hands down could not be raised and som e fans found it hard lo breathe. Still the flow
continued through the tunnel causing further surges forward. There were shouts for help and for the gates to be
opened to the pitch. Police officers on the perimeter track did not im m ediately react. In the deafening n oise
from chanting and shouting they did not at first recognise the problem. Realisation cam e at different m om ents
to different officers in different places.

   72. G ate 3 sprang open under the intense pressure from within. An officer quickly closed it. Shortly
afterwards, it sprang again; officers tried to shut it. Those seeking to escape were urged and pushed back. G ate
4 was opened by a policem an who noticed the crushing. People began to spill out through it and were directed
to the wing pens where there was still am ple room. Meanwhile, gate 4 was closed again and then re-opened. At
gate 3, a Constable, now alive to the crisis, followed strictly his written orders and radioed for perm ission to
open that gate. R eceiving no reply, he took it upon him self to open it.

  73. Just before 3 pm. the match kicked off. At the sam e tim e, gate C. which had been closed at 2.57 pm,
was reopened and a steady trickle continued to enter through the tunnel.

   74. To escape the crush, fans began clim bing the radial fences out o f pens 3 and 4 into pens 2 and 5. Others
tried to get over the front perimeter fence but were at first turned back by police w ho feared a pitch invasion.
Near the front, fans, m ostly youngsters, were weakened to the point o f collapse and in som e instances death but
they were held upright by pressure all round. Further back, most were so preoccupied with the pain o f being
pressed against barriers and with breathing problems that they saw nothing o f the game. But at the rear there
were many who. although cramped, were watching the football unaware o f the distress at the front.

  75. At 3.04 pm. Beardsley for Liverpool struck the crossbar at the Kop end. There was a roar from the
Liverpool fans and at the sam e tim e a powerful surge forwards in pen 3. The several surges which occurred after
the influx from gate C carried the pressure down the pens towards the pitch. The force becam e such as to twist
and break two spans o f a crush barrier towards the front o f pen 3. The evidence does not establish with
certainty when this happened. Probably it was triggered by the surge at 3.04 pm. But I am sure it occurred after
the influx from gate C so greatly increased the pressure in the pen. W hen the barrier broke those whom it had
supported were projected towards the perimeter fence. Many fell and the involuntary rush o f those behind
pressed them down. The crushing force was transmitted and dispersed so that all along the front o f pen 3 fans
were pressed hard up against the low wall and the wire mesh o f the fence above it.

  76. In pen 4 no barrier broke. N evertheless those at the front were crushed against wall and fence. Further
back, two barriers were bowed and som e individuals succum bed to the pressure around them.

   77. Surges on terraces are com m on. Usually, they go forward, then recede. Here, with the weight o f
numbers, there was no receding. The pressure stayed and for those crushed breathless by it. standing or prone,
life was ebbing awav. If no relief cam e in four m inutes there w ould be irreversible brain damage; if longer,
death.

  78. In the control room no-one noticed the overcrowding or anything am iss in pens 3 and 4 until the first
fans spilt out onto the perimeter track just before kick-off. Then, the officers in com m and assum ed that there
was an attempted pitch invasion. They called up reserve serials waiting in the gym nasium and all available
officers elsewhere to go to the pitch. A request was m ade to HQ for dog handlers.

   79. Superintendent Greenwood, the Ground C omm ander, was by the players’ tunnel at the kick-off. He
noticed fans on the track and went to the west end behind the goal. As he approached, he did not think the pens
overcrowded until he was very close and saw those pressed against the fence. Even then, he thought the
situation "retrievable’’ if those higher up the pen relieved the pressure. He clim bed on the wall below the fence
and signalled with both hands to those behind to move back. Other officers joined him. It was im possible.
Those fans who would have wished to com ply were powerless to do so. Behind them, there were still many


                                                        13
unaware o f the crisis, w atchingthe game. The football continued tojoyou s shouting and singing round the rest
o f the ground while those crushed and trapped slowly expired.

   80.    W hen Mr G reenw ood’s signals to move back proved fruitless, he tried to radio for the match to be
stopped. At first, his message was not received by control, so he signalled with his arms towards the control
box. Mr Duckenfield sent Mr Murray down from the box to have the match stopped via the linesman, the
agreed emergency drill. Before he could do so. Mr G reenwood ran over the pitch to the referee who stopped the
game. It was 5'/: m inutes past 3.

Rescue Attempts
   81. From 3 o'clock, gates 3 and 4 had been open and remained so. At first, fans had walked or staggered out
winded and faint. But the final surge at 3.04 pm. and the struggle to reach the open gates, caused a horrendous
blockage o f bodies. The dead, the dying and the desperate becam e interwoven in the sum p at the front o f the
pens, especially by the gates. T hose w ith strength left clambered over others submerged in the human heap and
tried to clim b out over the fence. They were now helped by police and other fans w ho hauled them up and over.
Num bers o f fans were clim bing over the radial fences into adjacent pens. At the back, many were hauled up
into the west stand to relieve the pressure.

   82. The steps from the sump at gateways 3 and 4 were so congested with bodies live and dead that each had
to be prised from the pile by the police. Initially, no officer took effective charge. A number o f individual
officers and fans worked frantically to free those trapped but the gateways were so narrow that only two or three
could get at the entwined bodies Willing hands got in one another's way. More officers arrived from the
gymnasium and elsewhere in the ground. Many used their own initiative to help those laid out on the pitch, to
assist in getting others over the fencing and to comfort the distressed. But som e stood in groups near the
perimeter fence not knowing what to do. They had been sum m oned in response to what was thought to be a
threat to public order. What they found was a hori ific scene o f carnage and som e young officers were shocked
into im potence by what they saw.

  83. It was truly gruesome. The victim s were blue, cyanotic, incontinent; their m ouths open, vomiting; their
eyes staring. A pile o f dead bodies lay and grew outside gate 3. Extending further and furtheron to the pitch, the
injured were laid down and attempts m ade to revive them. More and more walking survivors flooded out on to
the pitch as the players left. The scene was em otive and chaotic as well as gruesome. As the enorm ity o f the
disaster was realised, many o f the fans milling about were bitter and hostile to the police, blaming them for <
what had happened. Officers were confronted, abused, spat upon and even assaulted. A small number o f i
hysterical fans had to be subdued.                                                                         *

  84. Adding to the chaos, a num ber o f press photographers dodged about am ong rescue workers apparently
avid to secure photographs at point blank range o f those dying through the wire mesh and those laid on the
pitch. Angry fans sought to assault them. Police had to intervene.

   85. At about 3.12 pm. C hief Superintendent Nesbit. C om m ander o f the Traffic D ivision , arrived on the
pitch. He took charge at gate 3 and organised a chain o f officers to sim plify and expedite the extraction o f
casualties from the pen. In the absence o f any m echanical means, police and fans together pulled and worked
at the wire mesh with their bare hands and their feet to breach the fencing. They succeeded in both pens,
enabling officers to get in and fans to be got out.

  86. By now. som e officers o f their own initiative went round from the pitch to the tunnel where they met
other officers from the turnstiles and the west stand. Together, they tried to persuade fans at the rear o f the pens
to go back through the tunnel. Som e com plied, but many resisted, wishing to stand their ground. Casualties
were brought out through the tunnel, and as the pressure in the pens was relieved, officers were able to get
further in and bring out more casualties, dead and alive. They were laid on the ground in the concourse outside
the tunnel and attempts were made to revive them.

First Aid
  87. The St John Ambulance Brigade had som e 30 personnel posted round the ground for the match - 25
adults and 5 junior cadets. They were quickly on the scene when the first casualties emerged and sought to
revive them. Their D ivisional Superintendent. Mr Wells, tried unsuccessfully to help those pressed against the
fencing by feeding oxygen to them through the mesh until they could be got out.

  88. Dr Purcell. Sheffield W ednesday's doctor, cam e from his seat in the south stand and attem pted
resuscitation. Assisted by a male nurse from the crowd, he m oved from patient to patient doing what he could,
but in most cases it was too late.

  89. At 3.13 pm a St John's am bulance cam e onto the pitch at the north-east corner and drove to the
perimeter fence close to gate 3. There was no call for doctors and nurses on the public address system until
nearly 3.30 pm. Nevertheless, as the m inutes ticked past, som e o f them cam e on to the pitch to help o f their


                                                         15
own accord when they saw the casualties and the am bulance and realised the gravity o f the situation. Mar
fans also worked prodigiously in attempts to revive the dead and the dying, in som e cases their own relativi
and friends. Artificial respiration, m outh to mouth respiration and cardiac massage were applied by the skille
and the unskilled but usually in vain. Those capable o f survival m ostly cam e round o f their own accord. Th
rest were m ostly d oom ed before they could be brought out and treated.

   90. There was an urgent need to get casualties o ff the pitch and to hospital. There were six stretchers in th
first aid room and three in the St John's am bulance. They were quickly brought into use. Then the fan
im provised by tearing down the hoardings around the edge o f the pitch and against the stands so that lengths 01
board could be used as stretchers. Im provising in this way. parties o f fans and police ran repeatedly the length
o f the pitch bearing casualties to the north-east corner. A num ber were dead on arrival there.

In the Control Room
  9 1. Mr D uckenfield stayed in the control room . C h ief Inspector M cR obbie was there in civilian clothes as
an observer. Mr D uckenfield sent him down to the track to tell a policew om an at gate 1 to admit those
displaced from the centre pens. Mr D uckenfield did not realise there were injuries until he saw som eone laid
on the pitch. Even then, he did not realise the nature o f the problem or its scale.

   92. Mr Murray returned from his attempt to stop the match and Mr D uckenfield sent him down again to
clear the pitch and assess the situation. A m essage was broadcast requesting fans to clear the pitch. This was
because Mr D uckenfield could not from the control room see clearly what was happening for the m illing and
increasing numbers.

   93. The Assistant C h ief Constable (Operations). Mr Jackson, had attended the match in civilian clothes as
a guest o f the Club. He cam e from his seat in the south stand to ask what had happened. Mr Duckenfield was
unable to say: he did not tell Mr Jackson that the exit gates had been opened on his authority. Mr Jackson went
down to the pitch to discover the situation.

   94. At 3.06 pm Mr Duckenfield. still primarily concerned about public order, caused a message to be sent
to Headquarters asking for Operation Support. That was a call for all available additional police resources to
com e to the ground to strengthen the police presence.

   95. Mr Jackson was told by Mr Greenw ood that there were casualties and returned im m ediately to control
to m ake sure emergency services were alerted. M eanwhile. Mr Murray had seen the plight o f those behind the
fence. He radioed to control that a fleet o f am bulances was required. He also asked for a Tannoy broadcast to
those in the pens to m ove back but there is no clear evidence that it was made.

  96. Only when Mr Duckenfield received the request for a fleet o f am bulances did he realise the nature and
gravity o f the situation. Then, supported by Mr Jackson, he caused m essages to be sent converting Operation
Support into calls for the Major D isaster Plan.

N o Information
   97. Apart from the message to clear the pitch and the belated call for m edical assistance about 3.30 pm. no
inform ation or advice was broadcast on the public address system. Mr D uckenfield feared that the crowd
might turn hostile or might all attempt to leave together thereby hampering the emergency services if they were
given inform ation about what had happened. The result was that apart from those close enough at the west end
to see the terrible truth for them selves, the majority o f the crowd were left in ignorance. Many, especially
N ottingham supporters in the Kop, still thought there had been a pitch invasion or other m isbehaviour by
Liverpool fans. They continued singing and chanting incongruously. This infuriated som e Liverpool fans who
were already distraught. A few began to run towards the Kop end. The police feared violence might result on
top o f the existing disaster. Accordingly, they deployed a large number o f officers to form a line across the
width o f the pitch at the Kop end and advance up to the halfway line sweeping any Liverpool fans back as they
m oved. There the line stood as an insurance against disorder but doing nothing. O ther officers were posted to
the perimeter track facing the north stand for the sam e purpose. To those distressed and distraught w ho
 wanted urgent action, this large contingent o f passive officers was seen as an affront. Feelings against the police
 intensified.

 Misinformation
   98. At about 3.15 pm, Mr Graham Kelly. C h ief Executive o f the FA. Mr Kirton also o f the FA and Mr
 Graham Mackrell. Secretary o f Sheffield Wednesday, went to the control room for information. Mr
 D uckenfield told them he thought there were fatalities and the game was likely to be abandoned. He also said a


                                                          16
gale had been forced and there had been an inrush o f Liverpool supporters. He pointed to on e o f the televisioi
screens focussed on gate C by the Leppings Lane turnstiles and said “That’s the gate that's been forced: there'
been an inrush”. Inevitably Mr Kelly was interviewed a little later live on television. He spoke o f the two storie:
concerning the gate - the fans’ account that the police had opened it. the police assertion that the fans hao
forced their way in.

  99. About 3.30 pm there was a further m eeting in the Club’s boardroom. Mr D uckenfield went there and
met Mr Kelly, the referee and representatives o f the three clubs. ACC Jackson was also there. Mr
Duckenfield indicated the match was likely to be abandoned although no firm ruling was given. He added that
he did not want people to know it was to be abandoned lest the dispersing crowd hamper the emergency
operations.

Public Announcements
   100. Later the managers o f the two teams were asked to go to the control room. They were invited there to
make a public announcem ent to calm the crowd. Mr Kenny Dalglish agreed to do so. He told the crowd that
there were problems and asked them to assist the police and those rendering first aid. He asked for calm and his
message was well received. It was then 3.56 pm. At 4 .10 pm it was announced that the match was abandoned
for that day. Again that m essage was received calmly by the crowd m ost o f w hom behaved responsibly as they
dispersed.

Fire B r ig a d e
   101. M eanwhile the em ergency services had been in action. At about 3.10 pm a request cam e from the
perimeter fence to control for bolt croppers to cut the wire m esh. Sergeant Goddard contacted the police garage
close by without success. At 3.13 pm. PC Bichard requested Headquarters to call the fire service to bring
hydraulic cutting equipm ent to the Leppings Lane entrance.

   102. There was no arrangement for a fire officer to be present during the match. However, the Major
Disaster Plan required all emergency services to be alerted. After 'phone messages which m ust be described
later, fire appliances arrived at both Leppings Lane and Penistone Road at 3.22 pm. At both entrances their
arrival surprised police w ho were uninform ed as to why they had been called or where they should go.

  103. At Leppings Lane a police Inspector told Station Officer Swain “ 1 don't really think we need you”.
Another police officer then asked for more resuscitators as people were dying so Mr Swain radioed for ten fire
appliances. Each carries oxygen and resuscitation equipm ent.

   104. At the Kop end. Leading Fireman Housley arrived with an emergency tender and Station Officer
Fletcher in another appliance, each with a crew. The em ergency tender cam e along the roadway by the south
stand but owing to its height was unable to proceed further. It therefore backed out and went to the Leppings
Lane entrance losing som e eight minutes. From there. Mr H ousley and his crew went onto the pitch with
resuscitation equipm ent. They rendered help there and later at the gym nasium . Mr Fletcher and his men ran
along behind the south stand carrying cutting equipm ent and oxygen cylinders. When they arrived at the
fence, the cutting equipm ent was not required as by then the last o f the dead and injured were being removed
from the pens. Mr Fletcher set up a casualty clearing area under the police box and firemen assisted in carrying
victims as well as rendering first aid on the pitch.

S o u th Y o r k sh ire M e t r o p o lit a n A m b u la n c e S e r v ic e ( S Y M A S )
   105. Before 1986 there had been no SYM AS representative routinely present at Hillsborough matches. The
C lub was content, as indeed are many other clubs, to rely upon the St John's A m bulance Brigade and a 9 99 call
if necessary. From 1986 onwards, after representations, the Club provided two seats in the south stand for
SYMAS staff at League matches. At on e stage it was suggested they would be best placed in the north stand
close to the gym nasium which had been designated as the casualty centre in the event o f a major incident. T he
south stand seats were allotted as they placed the SYM AS staff closer to the players' tunnel should a player be
injured. These seats were, however, not available at Cup sem i-finals. SYM AS representatives nevertheless
attended at the sem i-finals by arrangement with the police in 1988 and again in 1989. The SYM AS officers
stood on the ramp leading to the pitch at the north-east corner. They had one am bulance outside the ground
and one on standby.

   106. On 15 April 1989, Officers Higgins and Eason were at the ground with an am bulance and crew. They
noticed fans on the track and went to the Leppings Lane end whilst the game was still in progress. They began
to attend to casualties. M eanwhile, at 2.59 pm. there had been a call from Police Constable Waugh at police


                                                                                17
Headquarters to the Hillsborough police control asking i f ambulances were required. This was on the
instruction o f C h ie f Inspector Edmundson who had heard over the radio, as had Police Constable Waugh
himself, crowd noise an H snatches o f speech from Hillsborough suggesting distress and possible injuries. The
reply from the control box was: no reports o f injuries but keep standing by. At 3.07 pm after hearing from the
ground that there might be injuries, police Headquarters notified S Y M A S that ambulances might be required.
Then, seconds later. M r Murray's request for a fleet o f ambulances was relayed to S YM A S . They reacted at
once. Ambulances began to arrive at the Leppings Lane entrance at 3.13 pm and at the Penistone Road
entrance at 3.17 pm. In all, some 42 ambulances attended. 31 o f them from S Y M A S and I I from
neighbouring authorities. By 4.30 pm, they had conveyed some 172 casualties to the Northern General
Hospital and the Royal Hallamshire Hospital.

Gymnasium
   107. The gymnasium had been in use for serving meals to the police. W hen the M ajo r Disaster Plan was
ordered, it was cleared and divided into two. One end became a temporary mortuary: the other was used as a
casualty clearing area for the injured. As the stretchers, designed and improvised, brought in more and more
casualties, the scene was initially and inevitably chaotic and harrowing. There was intense distress amongst
the injured and bereaved; relatives were reluctant to be parted from the dead and sought to revive them. There
were people looking for missing friends and relations: there were recriminations, there were scuffles. Some o f
those involved were the worse for drink. Doctors and nurses had followed the casualties in from the pitch and
sought to attend the injured as best they could in the adverse circumstances. Those in most urgent need o f
hospital treatment were taken to ambulances as they arrived, triage being employed to determine priorities.
Doctors were requested by the police to examine each person thought to be deceased to confirm and certify
death. A police Constable was detailed to attend and guard each o f the dead and a photograph o f each was
taken by a police photographer so that relatives coming to identify bodies could be spared the ordeal o f
searching amongst all who had died.

The D ead and the Injured
  108. O f the 95 who died, the evidence suggests that at least 16 and probably 21 came through gate C after it
opened at 2.52 pm. T h at is established by the statements o f relatives and friends who came through with them
but survived.

   109. By commendable hard work, a team o f pathologists headed by Professor Usher completed
post-mortem examinations on all the deceased within 48 hours. They found that 88 o f the victims were male
and seven female. Thirty-eight were under 20 years o f age. 39 were between 20 and 29 years and only three were
over 50. In virtually every case the cause o f death was crush asphyxia due to compression o f the chest wall
against other bodies or fixed structures so as to prevent inhalation. In all but nine cases that was the sole cause.
In one, pressure on the chest had been so great as to rupture the aorta: in six cases there were also injuries to the
head, neck or chest: in the remaining two cases, natural disease was a contributory factor. In 18 cases bones
were fractured. Thirteen of those were rib fractures. However, one was a fractured femur, one a fractured
ra^'us and the remaining three involved fractures of bones or cartilages round the voice box. These injuries
; . st the victims may have been trodden while on the ground.

  110. Blood samples were taken from the dead. N o alcohol was found in any o f the females. O f the males. 51
had no more than ! 0 milligrams per cent in their blood which is negligible; 15 had over 80 milligrams per cent
and six over 120 milligrams per cent.

  111. Although the great majority o f those who died were in pen 3. at least five were in pen 4. Most deaths
occurred at the front o f the pens but there were a few fatalities further back.

  112. In all. some 730 people complained o f being injured inside the ground and 36 outside it. O f the 730.
about 30% are thought to have entered through gate C after 2.52 pm. The largest category o f injury was
brursing. especially to the ribs and chest.

             113. 1 have given my findings as to the basic factual background and the main sequence o f events in
          narrative form. There was very little conflict as to the principal events save as to some timings and numbers.
          Indeed, the consistency o f the evidence has been a remarkable feature o f this inquiry. The experiences o f most
          witnesses were unforgettable and no doubt the early hearing helped to preserve accurate memory. Also, the
          existence o f timed videos and photographs and o f logged and taped messages provided reliable checks by
          which to prompt and test witness recollection. Accordingly. I have not for the most part burdened the narrative
          with citations from the evidence o f individual witnesses.

             114. However, there were several instances o f detailed evidence and assertions being highlighted by the
          media in dramatic and emotive terms during the hearing. Since some o f those much-publicised incidents gave
          rise to unfair criticism, they ought to be the subject o f specific findings. I have therefore dealt with them
          individually at Appendix 6,

                                                                   D r John Habgood. Archbishop o f York, preaching £

   115. This disaster was the worst in the history o f British football. It happened because pens 3 and 4 becarru
grossly overcrowded. They were uncomfortably overcrowded by 2.50 pm at least to a degree which requirec
that they should be closed to further arrivals. Even the numbers coming through the turnstiles in the last 1C
minutes would have increased the pressure beyond danger point and there would have been injuries i f not
fatalities. As it was, the influx through gate C after 2.52 pm so increased the pressure in the two pens as to
cause fatal crushing.

  116. The overcrowding up to 2.52 pm was due to a number o f factors which can be considered broadly
under three heads.
   (i) The layout at the Leppings Lane end.
  (ii) Lack o f fixed capacities for the pens.
 (iii) Lack o f effective monitoring o f the terraces.

  117. The crushing and fatalities after 2.52 pm must be considered under a number o f headings.
 (iv ) Th e build-up at the turnstiles.
  (v) Th e blunder on opening the gates.
 (v i) The barriers in pen 3.
(v ii) Th e crushing not recognised.
(v iii) The response o f the police.
 (ix ) The perim eter gates were too small.

  118. 1 have already observed that the layout o f the turnstile area, o f the terraces and o f the concourse
between them was the result o f piecemeal changes. A b rief history o f these changes is now necessary.


The History
   119. Before 1965, the Leppings Lane end consisted entirely o f terracing like the Kop. In that year, the west
stand was built and the terraces remaining in front o f it were truncated to their present depth, front to back. As
to width, they consisted o f a single standing area with no dividing fences. D uring the early 1970’s, hooliganism
and pitch invasions made it necessary to prevent access to the playing area and the perimeter fences were
therefore erected in 1977.


   120. Section 1 o f the Safety o f Sports Grounds Act 1975 empowered the Secretary o f State to designate a
sports stadium having, in his opinion, accommodation for more than 10,000 as a stadium requiring a
certificate from the local authority. Hillsborough was so designated with effect from I January 1979 by SI
 1978/1091. In anticipation o f that date, Sheffield Wednesday instructed Eastwood and Partners, a firm o f
consulting engineers, to act on their behalf especially in their dealings with the local authority. D r Eastwood,
the principal o f the firm , is a highly experienced civil and structural engineer and has advised several m ajor
football clubs. H e recommended that a number o f additional crush barriers should be added since those
already in place were insufficient to comply with the Green G uide (1976 edition). T h at work was approved
and carried out during 1979.


  121. The relevant local authority at the tim e was the South Yorkshire County Council. It set up an O fficer
Working Party consisting o f representatives o f the police, the fire service, its own building surveyor’s division
and its own legal and administration department. The Working Party made inspections and consulted with the
Club and D r Eastwood. A Safety Certificate was issued on 21 December 1979 for an indefinite period. It has
remained in force ever since and has not been amended.


   122. Schedule 3 o f the certificate sets out the m axim um crowd capacity for various areas in the ground. The
figure for the west terrace is 7.200 and for the north-west terrace 2.900. These figures were intended to be in
accordance with the Green G uide (1976). Paragraph 15.4 provided for a m axim um “ packing density” o f
between 54 and 2 7 persons per 10 square metres depending on the condition o f the terrace. D r Eastwood had
calculated 8.000 for the west terrace on the basis o f 54 per 10 square metres. He thought this a justified starting
figure in view o f his improved system o f barriers. However, he reduced it to 7.200 because there were no
gangways on the terrace and he did not think it feasible to provide any. So. the total figure for the Leppings Lane
terraces was and is 10.100.


The 1981 Sem i-Final
  123. As already mentioned, there was crushing at the Cup semi-final in 1981. The match was between
Tottenham Hotspur and W olverhampton Wanderers. The police debriefing minutes after the incident
prophetically refer.


  “to the late arrival o f a large number o f spectators who were still waiting to enter the Leppings Lane
  enclosure when the match started. The flash point occurred when Tottenham scored’’ (at the Kop end) “after
  only three minutes. The spectators just entering pushed forward to see what was happening and caused a
  crush, which resulted in the injuries”.


  124. Those being crushed called for the perimeter gates to be opened onto the track. There was no
immediate reaction, according to M r Vaux who was there, but fortunately a police Inspector gave instructions
and the gates were then opened. About 2 50 came out onto the track. There were broken arms, legs and ribs and
38 were treated either in hospital or by the St John Ambulance Brigade. It is clear from the documents (a) that
the turnstile readings showed the capacity figure o f 10.100 had been exceeded by over 400 (b) that the police
shut o ff further access to the terraces because o f crushing, and (c) the police view after the event was that the
capacity figure o f 10,100 in the Safety Certificate was too high. This latter view was communicated to the C lub
by the C hief Superintendent then in command o f F D ivision but it was not pursued.
Three Pens
   125. After this incident in A pril 1981 the police requested that the terrace should be divided into sections.
The object was to improve crowd control by reducing sideways movement. Division would enable more even
distribution to be effected when there was a capacity crowd. It would also enable the west end to be used for
both home and away supporters who could be segregated in separate pens, i f necessary with an empty pen
between them.

   126. This proposal was agreed by the Club and the O fficer W orking Party and was approved by the local
authority. Two radial fences were accordingly fitted in November 1981. They are the fence now separating pens
2 and 3 and that now separating 5 and 6. The result was to divide the whole terrace into three pens. Access from
the concourse to the m iddle pen was through the tunnel and to the wing pens round the sides o f the west stand.
D r Eastwood suggested and illustrated an altered layout which would have provided separate access through
separate banks o f turnstiles to the north stand, to each end o f the west stand, and to each o f the three pens.
W hilst the main object o f this was segregation, such a layout would have enabled each o f those areas to be
monitored numerically via the turnstiles so as to ensure its m axim um capacity was not exceeded. The plan was
not adopted. The m axim um capacity for the new centre pen was calculated at 2.200. but no alteration was
made to the Safety Certificate so to lim it it nor was there any means mechanically o f counting the numbers
going into that pen.

The 1985 Changes
   127. By 1985, Sheffield Wednesday had been promoted to the First D ivision and was drawing larger
crowds. The improvement o f the Leppings Lane end was raised again by the Club and D r Eastwood prepared a
number o f drawings. These illustrated various schemes for achieving segregation by providing more turnstiles
in separate banks and divisions o f the concourse. The police wanted further divisions o f the terrace itself,
again to improve control and segregation. There was much discussion o f these schemes which included
suggestions o f 29 and even 34 turnstiles in total. In the result, the following alterations were carried out in
1985.

N ew Radial Fences
   128. On the terraces, two more radial fences were fitted. One divided the existing central pen into the
present pens 3 and 4. Gates were fitted at the mouth o fth e tunnel to enable each o f those pens to be closed off.
The second fence was placed in the new pen 4 so as to create the narrow pen 5 intended to be a sterile area. U ntil
those two fences were added there existed only perimeter gates 1 .2 .4 . 5 and 6. The creation o f pen 3 required a
new gate 3 to be fitted which was done.

Barriers
   129. The lines o f the new radial fences ran across existing crush barriers so that without modification those
barriers would have run through the fencing. The police considered the barriers would be used by fans as
convenient mounting points to scale the new fences, thereby defeating their object. They therefore wished
spans to be removed from the barriers. H ad their wishes been met in full the result would have been an
unimpeded run in pen 3 from the mouth o f the tunnel down the south side o f the new fence to the perimeter. D r
Eastwood dug his heels in against that proposal which he rightly regarded as dangerous. H e did however agree
to some modification to the middle row o f barriers in the newly created pen 3. chiefly to facilitate access.
Likewise in the new pen 5. The 1985 modifications to the pens are shown on the plan Appendix 4.

The Turnstiles and Concourse
   130. A t the entrance, modification but no increase in number was made at the turnstiles. The bank 1 to 16
was divided from A to G by the metal fence now in place and that division was projected across the concourse
inside the turnstiles in the form o f a brick wall. A personnel gate was provided for access through that wall but
was enlarged to its present size at the request o f the police. Those alterations were made in the interests o f
segregation. The more elaborate divisions which D r Eastwood had suggested, giving separate access to each
sub-division o f the accommodation, were not pursued for financial reasons. In M ay 1985 the Bradford
disaster occurred. The south stand at Hillsborough had wooden decking and the Club realised it would have to
undertake e x p e n s i v e remedial works there. The cantilever roof o f the same stand was also discovered to
require expensive repairs.

   131. In fact, shortly after the new dividing fence and wall had been built at the Leppings Lane entrance and
concourse, the Club, by agreement with C h ie f Superintendent Mole, ceased to accommodate home supporters
at the Leppings Lane end. There was therefore no longer any need for segregation at that end, but the wall
remained.


                                                        22
   132. Also in 1985. electronic counting equipment was installed at all turnstiles. This conveyed the running
count for each bank o f turnstiles, for example A to G . to a television screen in the Club control room where the
figures were displayed. In 1986. an electronic eye was installed in each turnstile booth to catch and record
anyone who climbed over the turnstile.

B arrier 144
   133. In June 1986, the police requested that the crush barrier nearest to the tunnel at the entrance to pens 3
and 4 should be removed to assist the flow o f fans into the pens. They found it caused obstruction because it
was in a good viewing position and spectators liked to stand against it in numbers thereby blocking access by
others further into the pens. Th e police also suggested it might hamper effective evacuation through the tunnel
especially in an emergency. D r Eastwood considered the prosand cons o fthis proposal and accepted the police
view. The O fficer Working Party approved the proposal at a meeting on 7 August 1986 on site. A uthority was
given then and there by M r Bowneson behalf o f the Sheffield C ity Council which had taken over responsibility
for the Safety Certificate from South Yorkshire County Council on 1 A pril 1986. Two spans o f the barrier were
therefore removed, leaving only one span in pen 4 as shown on Appendix 4.

Effects o f the Layout
   134. The result o f these changes was to divide the terrace into a number o f small areas without providing
any computerised or mechanical means o f lim iting entry numerically into any one area i f all areas were open
for choice. Before the fences and pens had divided the terrace, the overall figure o flO . 100 could be monitored
via the turnstiles and in theory the crowd could even itselfout laterally. Even then, it was not possible strictly to
ensure compliance with Schedule 3 Part 1 o f the Safety Certificate which prescribed a m axim um o f 2.900 for
the north-west terrace and 7.200 for the west terrace. Paragraph 3 o f Schedule 2 o f the Safety Certificate
provides:

  "The number o f spectators admitted to the Stadium and to the several areas o f spectator accommodation
  within the Stadium shall not exceed the figures specified in Part 1 o f Schedule 3”.

  The Club had to rely upon visual monitoring.

   135. The situation became worse however with the division o f the west terrace into pens. N o t only were
there more and smaller discrete areas but some were likely to attract more than their appropriate share o f the
 10.100 total. It is well recognised that the area behind the goal is very popular. Moreover, the position o f the
tunnel vis-a-vis the turnstiles A to G . its labelling and the absence o f signposts advertising the wing pens would
draw to it those w ith terrace tickets. It was therefore highly likely that pens 3 and 4 would fill to capacity and
indeed exceed it unless preventive steps were taken. Had D r Eastwood’s plan for separate turnstile access to
separate sections with separate toilet and refreshment facilities been im plemented, total computerised control
could have been kept.
                                                   CHAPTER8
                               LACK O F F IX E D C A P A C IT IE S F O R T H E P E N S

  136. In 1981. when the terrace was divided into three areas. D r Eastwood gave the Club the figure o f 2,200
capacity for the centre pen. He based this on the Green G uide, making such allowances as he thought right. No
doubt the numbers could have been counted in via the turnstiles i f only that pen was in use or i f such pens as
were in use were filled sequentially, but not otherwise.

   137. A fter the 1985 changes. D r Eastwood did not him self give any figures for the new pens 3 and 4,
Someone on his staff however split the figure 2.200 into 1,200 for pen 3 and 1,000 for pen 4, Those figures did
not even take account o f the fact that pen 5 had been carved out o f pen 4 which was bound to have a reducing
effect on capacity. Nevertheless, the figures o f 1,200 and 1.000 were put on a drawing emanating from
Eastwood and Partners and the figures have been notionally regarded since as applicable by the C lub and the
police. They are in fact too high.

  138. D r Nicholson, at the Research and Laboratory Services D ivision o f the Health and Safety Executive,
has calculated that the figures for pens 3 and 4 respectively would be 1,015 and 1,036 i f the strength and
spacing o f the crush barriers had complied with the Green G uide. But they did not.

Departures from the Green Guide
   139. In pen 3, four out o f five gaps in the lines o f crush barriers do not conform with paragraph 115 o f the
Green G uide ( 1986). In pen 4, nine out o f ten do not conform. In particular, the spans taken out o f the barriers
in pen 3 in 1985 left gaps well in excess o f the m axim um o f 1.4 metres prescribed. Onegap was 57% wider than
the Green Guide m axim um . Moreover, that gap was in direct diagonal line from the mouth o f the tunnel to the
barrier which collapsed. D r Eastwood justified these larger gaps by the absence o f gangways. Fans had to be
able to get in and out and standard gaps tended to get blocked up. Th e effect o f his reasoning was that the
absence o f gangways, recognised as having a safety function, led to the sacrifice o f a second safety feature,
namely gaps o f strictly lim ited width.

   140. Again, the removal o f barrier 144 was bound, as D r Eastwood conceded, to affect capacity. In fact it
did more, as I shall indicate later.

   141. Capacity should also have taken account o f two further departures from the Green Guide. If. as was
the case, the perimeter gates were not regarded as exits, some 40% o f those in pens 3 and 4 were more than 12
metres from an exit (and ihere was no gangway) contrary to the aim o f paragraph 96. Four out o f fiv e o f the
crush barriers in pen 3 and six out o f nine in pen 4 were below the height prescribed in paragraph 110. These
were the old barriers which had been repaired and plated where their bases had corroded and fresh concrete
had been applied, raising the level o f the steps. The point is not academic since, in the event, many fans were
bent painfully over barriers under great pressure.

   142. D r Nicholson calculated that when all relevant factor* regarding the configuration and the Green
G uide are taken into account, the m axim um capacity for pen .   ilil have been 822 and for pen 4. 8 7 1.

Safety Certificate
   143. Whatever should have been the m axim um capacities for pens 3 and 4. the fact is that no figures at all in
respect o f them were put into the Safety Certificate. Despite all the changes in layout o f the fences and barriers,
the two figures, 2.900 for the north-west terrace and 7.200 for the west terrace, have remained as the only
maxim a w ith which the Club has to comply.

  144. Section 2(1) o f the Safety o f Sports Grounds Act 1975 provides (so far as is relevant):

  " A Safety Certificate shall contain such terms and conditions as the local authority consider necessary or
  expedient to secure reasonable safety at the stadium when it is in use.. ."

  Section 2(2) provided (so far as is relevant):

  “ W ithout prejudice to sub-section (1) above, a Safety C ertificate-
  (a) shall specify the m axim um number o f spectators to be adm itted to the stadium;
  (b) may specify the m axim um number to be adm itted to different parts o f it:
  (c) shall include terms and condilions-
  ... (iii) as to the number, strength and situation o f any crush barriers."
Section 2(2) was repealed by the Fire Safety and Safety of Places o f Sport Act 1987, section 19, which
gave power to the Secretary o f State to lay down, by order, terms and conditions. N o order has yet been
made and guidance from the Hom e Office has recommended local authorities to approach their
function under section 2(1) in accordance with the criteria in the repealed section 2(2). (See H om e
Office Circular 71/1987 dated 25 November 1987, Annex A, paragraph 6.)

   145. It is clear that when the certificate was first issued the South Yorkshire County Council went
further than simply to fix the maximum numbers for the whole Stadium. They prescribed figures for
each part o f the ground not merely by the four points o f the compass but by specified sections.

   146. Section 8(1) o f the 1975 Act requires the holder o f the certificate before carrying out any
proposals to alter or extend the stadium or any o f its installations while a Safety Certificate is in
operation to give notice o f those proposals to the local authority. That obligation is specifically
repeated in Sheffield Wednesday’s certificate at Schedule 2 Paragraph 5(2). The Club complied with
the requirement. Having received notice o f the alterations to the pens and the barriers, the local
authority ought, in my view, to have amended the Safety Certificate accordingly. They did not do so.

Why was the Safety Certificate not Amended?
   147. Although D r Eastwood acknowledged that the various changes to the layout would have had
an effect on capacity, he did not take active steps to see that appropriate amendments were made. He
says he mentioned from tim e to tim e that the alterations would have an effect on capacity and that he
did not realise the Safety Certificate was not regularly updated. However, I find two memoranda in
early 1987 highly significant. D r Eastwood's assistant M r Strange was concerned with queries from
the FA as to Hillsborough's capacity for a semi-final. M r Strange recorded these questions in a
memorandum: -

  “ Has any account been taken for alterations done on Leppings Lane over the last few seasons? Is the 10,200
  or so figure still correct? I said that in my opinion it needs to be adjusted, better do it now than later."

  148. M rStrange’s next memo (a few days later) records as follows:-

  "D r Eastwood says leave the capacity at Leppings Lane end as it is. providing police have gates under West
  stand open so that people can distribute throughout the terrace evenly."

Although he says the last nine words do not report him accurately. D r Eastwood accepts the rest o f that
message.

   149. In my view the provisions as to capacity in the Safety Certificate ought to have been reviewed and
altered. The unhappy situation is that the police believed even the overall figure o f 10.100 to be too high as far
back           1. That was reported to the Club but apparently not to D r E a s t v ~ ^ . Meanwhile, that global figure
h a d b ^ .. rendered academic by the sub-division o f the terrace which was            flr  -.J in the Safety Certificate
at all. I f proper m axim um figures had been inserted in the certificate for each o f the pens, the Club and the
police might well have been prompted to find some means o f lim iting the numbers entering those pens other
than by visual monitoring. This could have been done by implementing one o f D r Eastwood’s plans for totally
separate sections, turnstile to viewing area. It could have been done by insisting on sequential filling o f pens at
all matches: alternatively, by counting fans into each viewing area.

The City Council
  150. Th at the Safety Certificate was not amended and individual capacities not reviewed cannot be laid
solely at D r Eastwood s door. He was. after all, consultant engineer to the C lub and responsibility for the
certificate was that o f the local authority. When the South Yorkshire County Council handed over to the
Sheffield C ity Council, the latter delegated all its powers and duties under the 1975 Act to its General Purposes
Panel. Apparently, therefore, the decision-making body on behalf o f the Council was that Panel, although two
specific functions were delegated to the Head o f Adm inistration and Legal Department - the power to issue a
prohibition under section 10 o f the 1975 Act and the power o f entry and search under section I I o f the Act.

  151 In practice. M r Bownes. the Council's C h ief Licensing O fficer in the Adm inistration and Legal
Department, bore the brunt o f the Council's duties under the Act.




                                                           25
   152. The Officer Working Party was superseded by a Safety o f Sports Grounds Advisory G roup, but
apart from the change o f the name the system continued as before. M r Bownes attended the inspections
and meetings o f the Advisory Group together with the representatives o f the police, the fire service, the
department o f health and consumer services, and the building engineer's division o f the Council. The
latter was an engineer and ought therefore to have been alive to the same issues as D r Eastwood.

  153. The Advisory Group seems to have worked in a very informal manner. A short passage from M r
Bownes' evidence gives the flavour o f it : -

      Q     W ho was taking the lead in the working party as you understood it?

      A     That is a good question, sir. Leads were coming from several different directions really.

      Q    W ho chaired it, ifanyone?

      A     Nobody as such. sir. It was an inspection rather than a meeting as I understand it.

      Q     Who decided what should be inspected?

      A    Effectively the group itself, sir. it seemed to me. There was also some input from              the Club
            representative as to. i f you like, an element o f direction as to what should be looked at.

      Q    Apart from the inspections the working party met, presumably, or did they only                  meet on
            inspections?

      A    No, sir. I have referred to three previous meetings.

      Q    W ho took the chair when it met?

      A     I suppose it could be said that I did. to some extent.

      Q     There is no point in having inspections unless you form conclusions as a result ofth at inspection, is
            there?

      A    That is correct.

      Q    There must presumably have been some meeting following the inspection at which you all sat down
            together and decided what, i f anything, should be done.

      A    There was not. to my recollection, no.

      Q    How did you decide what should be done, i f anything needed to be done?

      A    There were discussions on the site, particularly in relation to barrier 144. which took place at the
            time.

      Q    Nothing more than that and no record anywhere o f any decisions that were made?

      A    N o. sir."

The decision to remove barrier 144 was assented to on behalf o f the C ity Council by M r Bownes. It was not
referred to the General Purposes Panel. W hether M r Bownes strictly had any power to assent to it is to say the
least very doubtful. But he him self admits that he was ill-equipped to do so. H e knew very' little about football
grounds. He had read the file passed on from South Yorkshire County Council and assumed all had been run
satisfactorily by them.

   154. It was recorded, however, in a report which M r Bownes drafted that "the conditions (in the Safety
C ertificate) give some cause for concern as they appear to be inadequate or inappropriate in some areas” . The
report to the General Purposes Panel suggested that new Safety Certificate conditions should be drafted.

   155. The task o f revising the Safety C ertificate was begun in June 1986. In July 1987, a draft was sent to the
fire service to which they replied in August. In September 1987, the Panel was informed that the redrafting was


                                                        26
•progressing steadily" and should be submitted to the Panel in October. The final draft was not circulated until
30 March 1989. 16 days before this disaster.

   156. Meanwhile, the Safety Certificate has remained unamended since 1979. The enlargement o f the Kop
in 1986 increased its capacity to 21.000. Although this was known and agreed by the Council it had not been
the subject o f any change in the certificate which still showed the capacity o f the Kop as 16.850. M r Mackrell.
Sheffield Wednesday's Secretary, raised the question o f amendments to the Safety Certificate and in particular
with regard to the Kop in A pril 1987 with Eastwood and Partners but nothing resulted.

  157. Sheffield United Football Club was designated under the 197 5 Act on 3 July 1984. A Safety Certificate
was about to be issued by South Yorkshire County Council at the time it handed over to the Sheffield C ity
Council on 1 A pril 1986. N o certificate has yet been issued to Sheffield United.

   158. The explanation given for these delays was pressure o f work. M r Bownes as C hief Licensing Officer
was responsible for 32 other licensing systems when this one was added to his burden. H e had a staff o f only
five. I fully accept that the addition o f further statutory responsibilities to the already heavy workload o f a local
authority with curbs on its expenditure creates problems. But it is clear that the attention given to this
important licensing function was woefully inadequate.

Summary
   159. The Safety Certificate contained no m axim um figures for individual pens.There was therefore no
sanction or provision focussing attention as to the need to lim it entry to the pens by numbers. The layout at
Leppings Lane as it evolved made electronic or mechanical control over numbers entering individual pens
impracticable i f all pens were to be available. Given an im portant match and a capacity attendance, fans were
likely to crowd into popular sections like pens 3 and 4. Those pens were likely to become overfull well before
warning came from the turnstiles that numbers were approaching the terrace m axim um o f 10.100. Control
over numbers and the avoidance o f overcrowding therefore depended entirely on visual monitoring o f tne
crowd

                               LACK O F EFFECTIVE M O N IT O R IN G O F TH E TER RA C ES

  160. M onitoring the spectators on the terraces so as to avoid overcrowding involves observing the numbers
and their distribution in each area, making decisions as to when an area is “fu ll”, taking steps to close it o ff
and moving spectators from one area to another, if necessary. It is a function beset by three problems. 1) W ho
should carry it out? 2) When is an area “ full”? 3) Fear o f hooliganism.

W ho should M onitor the Terraces?
   161. Should it be the host club via its stewards? Should it be the police? Should it be both? O r should it be by
arrangement, depending upon the ground or section o f the ground in question?

  162. In principle, a football club which invites the public to a match on its premises for reward is
responsible for securing safety at that event. The Green G u ide (1986) provides:    'y ■

         “ 23. The safety o f the public inside the ground is the responsibility o f those who stage the event and
               administer the ground in which it is held, ie the “ management”. This responsibility applies in
               both normal and emergency situations...

           195. ...there are five basic duties which stewards are called upon to carry out. These are:

                   (a)     controlling or directing members o f the public who are entering or leaving the ground, to
                           help achieve an even flow o f people to the viewing areas and safe dispersal o f spectators on
                           the terraces or viewing slopes:

                   (b)     patrolling the ground to deal with any emergencies, eg raising alarms or extinguishing
                           fires:

                   (c)     manning entrances, exits and other strategic points, especially exit doors and gates which
                           are continuously open whilst the ground is in use:

                   (d)     assisting police as appropriate or as requested with crowd control: and

                   (e)     undertaking specific duties in an emergency."

T h e In terim P o p p le w e ll R ep o rt
   163. There was considerable controversy in the course o f the public inquiry held by M r Justice Popplewell
in 1985 as to the responsibility o f the club and the police. In paragraph 3.6 o f his interim report. M r Justice
Popplewell quoted from a report produced for the M in ister o f Housing and Local Government in 1969 as
follows:-

   “The responsibility for controlling crowd behaviour is divided between the police and the club operating the
   ground. The broad line o f division being that police are responsible for movement o f spectators in public
   thoroughfares and from public thoroughfares into the ground, while the club is responsible for the control o f
   spectators once they are on the club’s premises . . .”

M r Justice Popplewell said he did not quarrel with that view and went on to observe that in practice the police
have to take charge and be responsible for controlling crowd behaviour. He then said (paragraph 3.8):

   “ It follows, therefore, that as a matter o f practice, while the physical safety o f the building and the
   maintenance and good housekeeping o f the ground must always be the responsibility o f the club, the police
   have to take the de facto responsibility o f organising the crowd, with all that entails, during the game . . .”

M r Justice Popplewell went on to instance evacuation o f the ground as a procedure in which only the police
could bear the responsibility o f supervising the organisation o f the crowd.

T h e F in a l P o p p le w e ll R ep ort
   164. He harked back to this subiect in chapter 4 o f his Final Report. There, he came down more firm ly in
favour o f holding the club responsible for crowd safety. At paragraph 4.13 he said “ Because, as a matter o f


                                                               28
practice, police officers have regularly attended in large numbers at football grounds, it has somehow been
assumed by the clubs that the responsibility for control o f what goes on inside the ground has passed from
them to the police. A police presence is there to assist in the enforcement o f law and order. Those responsible
for organising a private function, however, have the primary and continuing obligation and responsibility to
ensure reasonable safety for those who are invited on to their premises.’’ M r Justice Popplewell ended that
section as follows: “ It cannot be too strongly emphasised that it is upon the club, or the occupier o f the ground
who vs putting on the function, that the prim ary and continuing obligation rests."

    165. There remains, however, the question whether there are some grounds or parts o f grounds where the
club may need to rely upon the police (w hom they pay to attend) to control filling o f pens and monitoring them
for overcrowding. In other words, whilst the duty in law to ensure safety rests upon the club, they may need,
and by agreement be entitled, to employ the police to act as their agents in certain circumstances. This very
difficult and grey area as to club and police responsibility w ill need to be reviewed in greater depth at stage two
o f this Inquiry.

Arrangements at Hillsborough
  166. W hat is clear, however, is that de fa c to the police at Hillsborough had accepted responsibility for
control o f the pens at the Leppings Lane end. The evidence o f the senior officers who had been concerned with
policing at Hillsborough over the years was all one way on this point. O nly M r Duckenfield. who had not
policed at Hillsborough for some 10 years prior to 15 A pril, took a different view.

   167. M r Lock is now security officer at Sheffield Wednesday and was formerly a police Superintendent at
Hillsborough matches occupying M r M u rray’s role. H e claimed there had been a formal although unwritten
agreement between the Club and the police in about 1982, whereby the police agreed to steward the Leppings
Lane end o f the ground. Such a formal agreement is denied by other senior officers and I do not accept that any
formal agreement was reached. Nevertheless, a practice o r arrangement did develop which was known and
accepted by both Club and police. Its effect was that throughout the ground the stewards were responsible for
manning exits and entrances, for controlling entry into the stands, for assisting spectators to their seats in the
stands and for helping to control the exits after the match. They were also responsible at the Kop end on the
terraces for keeping gangways clear and helping to control the crowd which usually consisted o f home
supporters. At the Leppings Lane end, however, there were no gangways on the terraces and the crowd
consisted usually (and always since 1987) o f away supporters. M r M ole and other senior officers accepted that
it would have been unreal and unreasonable to expect stewards to go onto those Leppings Lane terraces. They
would not have been effective there: moreover, they could well have been in some danger from hostile away
supporters. The police accepted, therefore, that the proper filling o f the pens and monitoring them for
overcrowding could and would not be carried out by stewards. M any stewards have tended to be either
extremely young or somewhat elderly. They are paid only a modest sum (£9 at Hillsborough) and they are not
suitable either by physique or by training to cope on a crowded terrace with no gangways.

Case for the South Yorkshire Police
  168. Not-withstanding the overwhelming evidence from senior police as alrc i y mentioned and from the
Club. Counsel for the South Yorkshire Police continued throughout the hearing to contend that the Club and
not the police were responsible for filling and monitoring the pens and that this was well known to both parties.
He maintained that the police were there essentially to secure and preserve law and order. Q uite apart from the
police evidence to the contrary at this Inquiry, the official stance o f the South Yorkshire Police has not always
been to that effect.

Harris -v- Sheffield United Football Club Limited
   169. In March 1986. the South Yorkshire Police Authority obtained a judgement against Sheffield United
Football Club for money due for police services provided at Sheffield U n ite d ’s matches. Thedefence had been,
inter a lia , that the police were not providing “special police services". They were doing no more than
performing their normal police duties o f securing and preserving law and order amongst a crowd. The police
argument was that they had additional duties. In his judgement. Boreham J summarised the instructions for
policing as providing for:-

 "(a) the maintenance o f enforcement p f law and order:

  (b) the enforcement o f the Club's ground regulations, many o f which are concerned w ith law and order;

  (c) the safety and comfort o f the spectators, officials and players.”
H e re f e r r e d to th e a r g u m e n t o f C o u n s e l fo r th e S o u th Y o rk sh ire P o lice a s follows:-

  "Thirdly, here the police were not discharging their own duty to the public; they were in fact discharging the
  C lub’s duties to the spectators whom the Club invited to the ground. The Club chose to invite large numbers
  to their private premises; it was the Club's duty to provide for their safety, health and comfort. They could
  have employed a security firm as banks and others have to do to protect their interests; they chose to request
  the police to perform those duties knowing that the police expected payment. Fourthly, the police w ithin the
  ground provided serv ices which it was not w ithin the scope o f their public duty to perform. For instance,
  they assisted in crowd management and in the enforcement o f such ground regulations as refused entry to
  those who tried to enter without paying or prohibited spectators encroaching on parts o f the ground which
  their entry fee did not entitle them to enter. It may be, submits M r Bentley, that the maintenance o f law and
  order was the predominant aim but there were other services performed.”

The learned Judge found:-

  “ In addition to what may be called their law and order role the police were expected and did take part in
  crowd management, ensuring the safety o f spectators, the enforcement o f the C lub’s regulations and to be on
  hand to assist in the event o f some emergencies such as fire or accidental injury.”

Police Practice at the Leppings Lane End
   170. At League matches at Hillsborough, the police practice was to decide in advance how many and which
pens would be used. I f a modest crowd was anticipated only one or two pens might be needed. It was better to
confine the fans to lim ited spaces (a) to prevent them running about and (b) to reduce the number o f police
required. The practice was then to fill the pens one by one. This involved making a judgement as to when a pen
was full. There would then be a police decision to close that pen and fill another. It was regarded as impractical
and unsafe for police officers (just like stewards) to go onto the Leppings Lane terraces with away supporters.
T his meant that monitoring the numbers in any pen had to be done from vantage points outside it. Here, the
police were much better placed than the stewards. There was a good view from the control box and the
television screens there. There were officers on the perim eter track. N o stewards were placed there because
having both police and stewards interfered with the viewing. There were also police in the west stand who
could look down on the pens. Intelligence from all these sources could give the police a good appreciation o f
the state o f the terraces. W hen it was necessary to shut o ff access to the pens officers on the concourse could be
informed by radio and could take the necessary steps.

“Find Their Own Level”
   171. At Cup semi-finals, a different approach was adopted. All the pens were opened from the start and the
policy was “ to let the fans find their own level” . This phrase was repeated again and again by police officers at
the Inquiry. W hat it meant was that no specific direction was given to fans entering through the turnstiles.
They were free to go wherever they wished on the terraces. I f they became uncomfortable or wished for any
other reason to move their position, then theoretically they could move elsewhere. In this way it was hoped that
the fans on the terraces would level themselves out and that distribution would be achieved without police
intervention. On these occasions, the gates at the top o f the radial fences were locked in the open position. It
was sought to argue, therefore, that there was freedom o f movement from one pen to another enabling fans to
"find their level” .

   172. This argument was bad both in theory and in practice. In theory, the whole object o f the radial fences
had been to achieve even distribution by directing fans into desired positions. To say then that they could move
freely from one pen to another would defeat the object and enable fans to go from a less popular to a more
popular area without inhibition. In practice this did not happen because the position and size o f the gates was
such that once a substantial number o f spectators were in, the gates were unnoticeable and inaccessible
especially to those towards the front who might have most need o f them.

  173. The same argument was deployed to suggest that individual m axim um capacities for individual pens
need not be assessed since the presence o f the open radial gates still meant that the terrace was one area. In
practice this simply was not so. The photograph at Appendix 5 taken from the north stand at 2.59 pm shows
very clearly the congestion in pens 3 and 4 contrasted with the sparseness in pen 6. This gives the lie to the
suggestion that the fans could, if uncomfortable, "find their own level” .

  174. The effect o f this policy was that whereas at League matches the police had to make a positive decision
when to close one pen and open another, at semi-finals, where overcrowding was much more likely, the police


                                                                            30
left it to the fans themselves to "find their own level". Effectively, they were left to m onitor their own comfort
and safety so as to avoid overcrowding. The police would only intervene when there was some overt sign that an
area was '‘full” .

When is an Area “ Full"?
   175. Over the years, spectators on terraces have come to accept conditions which are often very
uncomfortable and not infrequently downright dangerous. They are subjected to buffeting and squeezing to
get in and out o f the terraces. They are packed tightly and exposed to surging and swaying during the match.
They put up with these conditions because they are devoted to the game and because there is little they can do
about them. They believe the discomfort will pass and nothing very untoward will happen. Usually that is the
case and they are reassured by it. Most clubs have not. until very recently, consulted their supporters as to their
grievances or suggestions. The practice has been to pack them in on the assumption that i f they are prepared to
put up with it the conditions must be tolerable. Although crowd figures at football grounds have been reduced
in recent years, this has been due principally to the increased proportion o f seating as against standing
accommodation. Terraces have still been packed.

   176. It is said that many fans enjoy these features o f terrace viewing. Clearly close proximity, shared
discomfort, weathering sways and surges together and chanting the same songs and slogans en masse do evoke
good humour and have produced a spirit or cult o f the terraces which m any enjoy. Equally there are many who
simply endure these things for the football, for a cheap ticket or indeed for the chance o f getting in at all. And
before Hillsborough most fans on the terraces, even if they enjoy the hurly-burly, had not realised the narrow
margin o f safety between an uncomfortable crush and a fatal one.

    177. The Green Guide sought to improve safety and comfort by laying down criteria for m axim um
capacity, ie defining what is ‘‘full". The standard set was 54 persons per 10 square metres in favourable
conditions but fewer, down to 27. in less favourable conditions. The tendency may have been to aim o ff too
little from the higher figure for shortcomings in the layout. Certainly the figures considered appropriate in
pens 3 and 4 at Hillsborough were too high, as already indicated.

   178. Even taking the highest figure suggested in the Green G uide, the problem remained that those
supposed to be monitoring pens visually had and have little idea o f what 54 persons per )0 square metres look
like. M r Duckenfield's opinion was that when a pen was full to capacity, the spectators would be “shoulder to
shoulder and chest to back". That view may derive from seeing the sort o f density crowds regularly endure
without injury resulting. But it is much more dense than the Green Guide m axim um .

   179. The South Yorkshire Fire Brigade provided the Inquiry with photographs o f people standing in an area
of 10 square metres at various densities o f packing. Together w ith my Assessors and others. I took part in a
similar experiment at the Health and Safety Executive's Sheffield laboratory. We stood in a room o f measured
area at densities o f 54. 80 and 100 per 10 square metres. It was clear from the photographs and from our
experiment that the m axim um density set out in the Green Guide left considerably more room than those
monitoring the terraces would have left before declaring an area “ fuH".

   180. The tendency has been to allow the pens to fill until the fans complain or show signs o f discomfort. I f
the density at the front appeared less than at the back, the Tannoy would invite the fans to move forward to
make room for more. The evidence before the Inquiry and many anecdotal letters I have received clearly show
there have been frequent occasions when the packing on terraces, not only at Hillsborough, has caused
discomfort and sometimes, for b rief periods, fear. Usually the surge recedes, the sway returns, the pressure
cases and the incident passes unrecorded.

  181. After the crushing at the 1981 semi-final. Hillsborough was not chosen again by the FA until 1987.
There was evidence that the central pens were uncomfortably overcrowded on that occasion and again at the
1988 Cup semi-final, although entry to the tunnel was blocked o ff by police shortly before kick-off in 1988
bccause the pens were deemed to be ‘‘full".

Fear of Hooliganism
   182. Over the last few years, hooliganism at and associated with football matches has strongly influenced
the strategy o f the police. In their plans and management they have concentrated on averting or containing
threats to public order. This is understandable and indeed commendable. But it has led to an imbalance
between the need to quell a m inority o f troublemakers and the need to secure the safety and comfort o f the
majority. In the police Operational Order, the emphasis was upon prevention o f disorder and in particular
prevention o f access to the field o f play. There was no express requirement that officers on the perimeter track


                                                        31
or in the west stand should keep watch for any possible overcrowding on the terraces. Indeed, the view was
expressed in evidence that packing fans close together on the terraces assisted in controlling the unruly since
the less room they had the less scope there was for misbehaviour.

   183. Although the police had accepted de fa cto responsibility for monitoring the pens, their policy on the
day was to leave fans to “ find their own level” and to concentrate their own attention on possible disorder.
Whilst in theory the police would intervene if a pen became "fu ll” , in practice they permitted the test o f
fullness to be what the fans would tolerate.

  184. By 2.52 pm when gate C was opened, pens 3 and 4 were over-full even by this test. M any were
uncomfortable. To allow any more into those pens was likely to cause injuries: to allow in a large stream was
courting disaster.

   ] 85. The decision to open gate C. and subsequently gates A and B too. wa.s forced on to the police by the
crowd conditions which developed outside the turnstiles. The crush was so severe that injuries were being
suffered and deaths were feared unless the pressure could be swiftly relieved. Why the crowd pressure had built
10 such intensity was one o f the principal issues during the hearing. The suggested causes must be considered in
turn.

T h e P h y sic a l L a y ou t
   186. 1 have already described and illustrated the approach to the turnstiles (Appendices 1 and 2). At
Penistone Road and at many other grounds, turnstiles are in a straight line, adequately spaced and with a
sufficient waiting area for queues to form. N ot so at Leppings Lane. The building line, the bridge over the Don
and the bend in the road, left a wedge-shaped approach to perimeter gates set in an arc, and across a short
forecourt, to turnstiles also set in an arc. The pairs o f turnstiles were close together and the forecourt, especially
as divided by the metal fence, provided little space for a waiting crowd.

T h e N u m b er o f T u r n stile s
   187. The decision to fill the whole o f the north stand from the Leppings Lane end required the 23 turnstiles
there to admit 24,256 spectators. O f those, the seven turnstiles (A to G ) serving the terraces had to admit
10.100, ie an average o f just under 1.450 through each turnstile. At the Penistone Road end. 29.800 were
served by 60 turnstiles, or just under 500 per turnstile.

   188. The Green Guide recognises (paragraph 47) that the rate at which spectators can pass through
turnstiles depends on a variety o f local circumstances but states “ in general based on observation and
experience, it is unlikely that the maximum notional rate per turnstile would exceed 750 per hour”. Since the
semi-final was an all ticket match requiring no cash transactions, the Club considered that a higher rate o f
about 1,000 per hour per turnstile could be expected. Even at this higher rate, which assumes the turnstiles
working at maximum efficiency non-stop, it would have taken nearly I 1/: hours to adm it all those with terrace
tickets. At 750 per hour, it would have taken nearly two hours.

   189. The Green Guide provides (paragraph 44):-

   'Turnstiles should be o f such numbers as to adm it spectators at a rate whereby no unduly large crowds are
   kepi watting for admission ..

    190. The Officer Working Party had discussed in 1985 the need, and D r Eastwood's various schemes, for
improvement o f the turnstile arrangements. The mathematics are elementary. Both the police and the Club
should have realised that the Leppings Lane turnstiles and the waiting area outside them would be under strain
in admit all the Liverpool supporters in time. Success depended on the spectators arrivingat a steady rate from
.in early hour and upon the maximum turnstile rate being maintained. In fact neither o f these requirements.
   Inch are inter-linked, was fulfilled. That they might not be so was in my view foreseeable.

 1 he “ l-ate” arrival o f L iverpool F a n s
     191. Between 2.30 pm and 2.40 pm the crowd waiting for the turnstiles swelled to over 5.000 and became
 unmanageable. The case made for the police was that large numbers o f Liverpool supporters arrived late: a
 tiigh proportion o f them were drunk and unco-operative; a high proportion had no tickets; all o f them were
 Ikil-bent on getting in on time. They say this was unforeseeable and explains why they lost control.

     192. Whether those who arrived between 2.30 pm and 2.40 pm were •"late" was much debated. The ticket
 simply requested its holder “ to take up [his] position 15 minutes before kick-ofF. That may have been
 intended to persuade those with stand tickets to take their seats, but it would not be unreasonable for a
 '-landing spectator to arrive at the turnstiles between 2.30 pm and 2.40 pm. W hether they were “ late” or not,
 however, there was certainly a large concentration o f Liverpool fans arriving at about 2.30 pm and after.

  I raffle D e la y s
    1 I t is unlikely that traffic conditions had any significant effect on this. True, there were delays on the
 1 lu-rpool traffic routes. There were roadworks on the M 62 which was the recommended route. A t various
 points the carriageway was reduced from four lanes or three lanes to two. but no serious delays were reported.
On the M 6 3 there were longer delays due to a contraflow and at its junction with the A 560 there was heavy
congestion due to volume o f traffic. However, the Liverpool routes were clear by 2.20 pm and those witnesses
who complained o f delays en route had nevertheless managed to be in range o f the ground in ample time.

F in e W e a th e r a n d D r in k in g
   194. The likeliest explanations for the sparse Liverpool attendance in the ground before 2.30 pm were four­
fold - the warm weather, drinking, disinclination to enter the ground early and prolong the standing, and a
tendency o f Liverpool supporters to cut it fine.

   195. The police emphasised that at the 1988 semi-final there was no comparable build-up o f “late” arrivals.
They claim, therefore, that they had no reason to foresee it in 1989. However, in 1988, although the weather
was fine, it was 11 ° F cooler than in 1989. 15 A pril was the sort o f fine spring day which tempted fans to sit or
stand about in the sun with a drink. I f you had a ticket it would seem more pleasant and sensible to relax in that
way than to enter the ground early and stand on the terrace for an extra hour. Pre-match entertainment in the
ground had been advertised but did not take place. Even i f it had, it may not have been an encouragement to
many fans to enter so early.

W a s D r u n k e n n e s s a M a j o r F a cto r in t h e C r is is a t t h e T u r n s tile s?
    196. O f those who arrived at 2.30 pm or after, very many had been drinking at public houses or had
brought d rin k from home or an off-licence. I am satisfied on the evidence, however, that the great majority
were not drunk nor even the worse for drink. The police witnesses varied on this. Some described a high
proportion as drunk, as "lager-louts" or even as ■"animals". Others described a generally normal crowd with an
unco-operative m inority who had drunk too much. In my view some officers, seeking to rationalise their loss
o f control, overestimated the drunken element in the crowd. There certainly was such an element. There were
youngsters influenced by drink and bravado pushing im patiently at the rear o f the crowd thereby exacerbating
the crush. But the more convincing police witnesses, including especially Detective Superintendent M cK ay
and C h ief Inspector Creaser as well as a number o f responsible civilian witnesses, were in my view right in
describing this element as a minority. Those witnesses attributed the crush to the sheer numbers o f fans all
anxious to gain entry. There was no criticism o f the crowd by any o f the witnesses in the period up to 2.30 pm
or even 2.35 pm. W hat happened then was not a sudden deterioration in the mood or sobriety o f those
assembled there. N o doubt those coming behind would have had more to drink and would have included the
unruly minority. But the crisis developed because this very large crowd became packed into a confined
turnstile area and its very density hampered its passage through the turnstiles.

    197. Superintendent Marshall and other officers criticised the crowd as unco-operative because police
exhortations to stop pushing and to ease back were not heeded. How could they be? In that crush most people
had no control over their movements at all. Two incidents involving police horses illustrate the point. One
horse was found afterwards to have cigarette burns on its rump. Clearly that was the despicable work o f a
hooligan whether in drink or not. However, there were also eyewitness accounts o f a horse being physically
lifted o ff its feet by the crowd. That occurred, as the police accepted, without malice or intent but as an
involuntary consequence o f crowd pressure which those by the horse's flanks could not resist any more than the
horse itself.

R e d u ce d E ffic ie n c y o f th e T u r n s tile s
   198. The labelling o f the turnstiles in the order A. C. B was confusing. A fan with a B ticket who went by
mistake to the wrong side o f the metal fence would have had the greatest difficulty in getting back and round to
the correct side. The colour coding was inefficient because the coloured wooden panels were affixed to the
turnstile walls so low that they were not easily visible through a crowd. The inform ation on the ticket printed by
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club was misleading and its layout unhelpful, as M r Mackrell frankly conceded.

   199. The result was that in the early stages, police officers were pestered by fans for help as to where they
should go. Later, as the crowd became more dense, fans were presenting their tickets at the wrong turnstiles.
There were also Liverpool supporters who had acquired tickets for the Kop end but sought entry at Leppings
Lane. They caused delays in the turnstile operation when entry was refused and after a while the police
instructed the operators to let them through. There was further delay because the crush made it difficult for
fans to get into the turnstile entrances. Once there, the pressure from behind was such as, on occasions, to ja m
them in the doorway or against the paddle o f the turnstile. Finally, there were fans without tickets who sought
to enter by offering payment, by seeking to go over or under the paddle or by sliding through w ith a ticket
holder. All o f these activities slowed down the turnstile rate which at the worst period was only about 600 per
hour per turnstile. The waiting crowd therefore expanded and as the minutes passed frustration grew. Visitors


                                                                                  34
who had paid for tickets and travelled from afar realised they were making little forward progress. Frustration
increased pressure and induced panic at the front. Determination to get into the match was intensified by
determination to get out o f the crush.

W ere F a n s W it h o u t T i c k e t s a M a j o r Factor in t h e B u ild -U p ?
  200. It has become a fact o f football life that fans do turn up at all-ticket matches without tickets. It is not
possible to give an accurate figure or even a reliable estimate o f the number without tickets on 15 A p r :l. Police
estimates varied from about 200 to about 2.000. There were certainly frequent requests for tickets or “spares”
during the hours before the build-up. M any o f those warned o ff by the police were seen to return to the area.
Some were hangingabout on the bridge. Again, however, the police witnesses who most impressed me did not
consider the number o f ticketless fans to be inordinately large. This accords with two other sources o f
evidence.

   201. First, there was a wide range o f witnesses who observed inside the ground that the Liverpool end was at
a late stage well below capacity save for pens 3 and 4. The north stand still had many empty seats and the wing
pens were sparse. The match being a sell-out. there were clearly many ticket holders to come and they could
account for the large crowd still outside the turnstiles. H ad the Liverpool accommodation been full by 2.40
pm, one could have inferred that most or much o f the large crowd outside iacked tickets.

   202. Secondly, such figures as are available from the Club’s electronic monitoring system and from analyses
by the HSE suggest that no great number entered without tickets. They show that the number who passed
through turnstiles A to G plus those who entered through gate C roughly equalled the terrace capacity figure o f
 10.100 for which tickets had been sold. The C lub’s record showed 7.038 passed through turnstiles A to G.
However, the counting mechanism on turnstile G was defective, so the HSE d id a study using the video film
and projecting figures from the other turnstiles. This gave an assessment o f 7.494, with a m axim um o f 7,644
passing through A to G . Again, using the video, the HSE assessed the number who entered the ground whilst
gate C was open at 2.240 with a m axim um o f 2.480. Accordingly, the HSE's best estimate o f the total entering
through gate C and turnstiles A to G was 9.734 w ith a maximum o f 1 0 .1 2 4 .1 recognise that these can only be
rough checks because, for example, some with terrace tickets were allowed through turnstiles I to 16 and there
would be other sim ilar factors which have not formed part o f the assessment. Nevertheless, the figures d a
suggest that there was not a very significant body o f ticketless fans in the crowd which built up.

The “Conspiracy” Theory
  203. On behalf o f South Yorkshire police, the theory was advanced that the “ late” arrival o f so many
Liverpool supporters was planned to buck the system. The suggestion was that fans without tickets conspired
to arrive late and create such trouble as would force the police to adm it them to the match. The slender
evidence upon which this theory rested came from two sources: overheard conversations in public houses and
the antecedent history o f Liverpool supporters at away matches.

  204. One witness said he heard three Liverpool supporters saving, in effect, that they would manage to get
in without tickets by causing trouble so that police would open a gate, and that they had done this before.
Another witness heard two o f a group o f Liverpool supporters say they had no tickets, that they would go to the
ground just before kick-off. that no-one would stop them getting in and that they had not been stopped yet.
Statements were put in relating to two other small groups talking in sim ilar terms.

Liverpool S u p p o r te r s a t A w a y M a t c h e s
   205. The South Yorkshire police prepared a dossier o f reports on the behaviour o f Liverpool fans at away
matches with the object o f showing a pattern o f troublesome behaviour by large numbers either without tickets
or with forged tickets. W ithout settingout the whole history, it can be summarised as follows.

  206. On three occasions Liverpool fans without tickets were allowed into all-ticket matches upon payment.
I At Watford on 13 February 1988. 1,500 were admitted: at Southampton on 24 September 1988, 150 were
admitted: at Southampton again on 12 December 1988. 750 were admitted.) At Norwich on I A pril 1989,
Liverpool supporters arrived without tickets but 1.272 tickets had been returned and fans from both Liverpool
and Norwich were allowed to buy them for cash. A similar situation occurred at W im bledon on 13 M a y 1989.
There were six other occasions from 1986-to date, including the Cup finals o f 1986 and 1989, when numbers o f
Liverpool supportersTurned up without tickets or otherwise behaved badly.

   207 . Four points must be noted, however. On none o f the occasions when ticketless fans were admitted for
 payment was the match a sell-out. There was therefore room in the ground on each occasion. At a sell-out fans


                                                                            35
might not expect to be allowed in. even for payment. Secondly, no trouble o f the kind alleged was encountered
at the 1988 semi-final when Liverpool visited Hillsborough. Thirdly. Liverpool visited Hillsborough again in
January 1989 without any trouble. Finally, no forged tickets were in use on 15 A pril apart from three crude
photocopies.

N o C o n s p ir a c y
   208. 1 have already found that there was not an abnormally large number o f fans without tickets on this
occasion. W ith one or two exceptions, the police witnesses themselves did not subscribe to the “conspiracy”
theory. I am satisfied that the large concentration at Leppings Lane from 2.30 pm to 2.50 pm did not arrive
as a result o f any concerted plan. There were, I accept, small groups without tickets who were willing to exploit
any adventitious chance o f getting into the ground. They, together with the m inority who had drunk too much,
certainly aggravated the problem faced by the police. But that m ain problem was simply one o f large numbers
packed into the small area outside the turnstiles.

T h e P o lic e O p e r a t io n a t L e p p in g s L a n e
  209. The Operational O rder for 15 A pril followed closely that laid down for the 1988 semi-final. The
emphasis was on m aintaining law and order. Side roads were to be blocked o ff to prevent damage in residential
areas. Pairs o f officers were to patrol streets to prevent "clash o f rival supporters’*. Officers were to watch public
houses, shops and supermarkets “ where looting could take p lace”. Outside the turnstiles, officers were to ensure
supporters entering did not have banners, weapons, missiles or alcohol.

  210. Unfortunately, hooligan behaviour has made all these steps necessary. But the only written provision
aimed at effecting controlled entry to the turnstiles was one enjoining officers “ to ensure orderly queues are
formed". There was no provision for controlling the entry o f the crcwd into the turnstile area.

   211. As long ago as 1924. the Departmental Com m ittee on Crowds stated:-

   “The control o f crowds should begin at a point some considerable distance from the entrance to the ground.
   The advantages o f an arrangement o f this kind a r e ... in preventing congestion at the entrances to grounds."

This was particularly im portant at Leppings Lane where the turnstile area was so small and awkwardly laid
out. I f a large crowd was permitted uncontrolled entry through the perimeter gates, the forming o f queues at the
turnstiles and control by officers, whether on foot or mounted, would become impracticable. Those waiting at
the turnstiles would become a single growing mass. Once that happened, it would be difficult to retrieve the
situation.

  212. W hether steps were taken and what steps to avoid this happening was left to oral briefing and a d hoc
instructions on the day.

P r e v io u s E x p e r ie n c e
  213. The senior police officers said it had never happened before so there was no reason to foresee it. In fact,
the only two previous occasions when the Leppings Lane terraces had been used to till the whole o f the north
and west sides o f the ground were at the two semi-finals, in 1987 and 1988, In 1987. the match was on a Sunday,
scheduled for 12 noon, and kick-off was postponed for a quarter o f an hour because o f late arrivals.

P o li c in g in 1 9 8 8
  214. As to 1988. there was a very large and consistent body o f evidence that, on the day. the police in
Leppings Lane conducted an efficient filtering exercise designed to keep away those without tickets and
control the flow o f fans towards the ground. I do not believe that so many witnesses without either opportunity
or reason to put their heads together could be mistaken about what they experienced on that occasion. Yet, the
police m aintain that no filtering exercise other than on a random basis was conducted in 1988 and that their
policy and practice then were no different from those o f 1989.

  215. The answer to this conflict must. I think, be that whilst the policy may have been no different, in
practice the policing in 1988 was mote efficient and was not put to the same test and strain as a year later. There
was not so large a swell in numbers approaching the ground from 2.30 pm to 2.50 pm as in 1989.
Nevertheless, there had been warning signs in 1988. Detective Superintendent M cK ay gave the following
evidence:



                                                              36
    "Q Were you aware o f a build-up o f numbers last year towards the latter stages at the turnstiles?

   A      Yes. . . There was a huge build-up around 10 minutes to 3 when many, many Liverpool supporters
           came at that time. They had been drinking, the ones that I saw and there was quite a sizeable crush
           built-up - sizeable queue.

   Q      Queue or crush?

   A      Compacted queue, built-up in the area by the turnstiles which I believe are marked A to G . T h at crowd
           reached back almost to the gates. It never got any bigger than that and the turnstiles operated relatively
           freely and they dealt with that crowd. Fans were still arriving at about 10 past 3 but by then the . . .

   Q      This crowd that you have described o f the late arrivals at about 10 to - was it an orderly crowd?

   A      Oh no. N o. The orderly crowd had gone in. and when I say they were not an orderly crowd, obviously
          mixed amongst those people were . . .

   Q      O f course, but taking it generally?

   A      But by and large they had taken a lot o f drink on board and they were in such numbers that excluding
          them from the ground was completely out o f the question.

   Q      Were they standing in an orderly queue or was there some pushing and shoving?

   A       There was a lot o f pushing and shoving. There was an urgency to get into the ground.

   Q       But fortunately it does not appear to have been in nearly such numbers as this year.

   A      It wasn’t.”

P o lic e I n t e l l ig e n c e in A d v a n c e
  216. Apart from that experience in 1988. the tendency o f Liverpool supporters to arrive late was not
unknown. Witnesses said that they get through the turnstiles at their home ground. Anfield. quite quickly and
lend therefore not to arrive early. Indeed, a general recent tendency to postpone arrival was noted by the
Sheffield C ity Council Advisory Group, with police present, on 23 March 1988. The minute reads:-

   “As far as the turnstile question was concerned, a pattern has developed o f people arriving some 15 minutes
   before the start o f the game hoping to gain admission. This trend may be due to the banning o f alcohol at
   sports grounds which could lead to people going elsewhere for refreshment prior to the football match. As
   the available turnstiles operated quite effectively for the majority o f the time, and that the late arrival
   problem could perhaps only be dealt with by education o f the spect uors" {sic).

  217. In so far as Liverpool supporters’ behaviour at away matches may have been indicative o f what police
problems might arise on 15 A pril, most o f the facts should have been available at the planning stage. As in other
forces. South Yorkshire Police had a liaison officer whose jo b was to seek, receive and collate relevant
information as to the visiting supporters. The Association o f C h ie f Police Officers' G uide to Policing Football
highlights the importance o f such liaison:—

   " It is im portant that the officer responsible for policing the match determines the pre-match planning in the
   light o f the intelligence at hand. Whilst that intelligence can be obtained from a variety o f sources, the prime
   source for football intelligence is the Police N ational Intelligence System which is based on the network o f
   police liaison officers. Summaries completed by police officers o f the home club force are forwarded to the
   visiting club’s liaison officer making available intelligence about fans' behaviour at both home and away
   fixtures. This information will be collated and made available for future matches involving that club".

  218. The FA had also laid down in a m emorandum issued in the 1985/6 season measures to be adopted by
the away club which included the following:-

     "It is the responsibility o f the away club to advise the home club o f the recent behaviour o f their supporters
    at away matches, irrespective o f whether the behaviour has resulted in disciplinary action by the Football
    Association or not".

    219. It does not seem that information o f this kind was passed to the Sheffield Wednesday Club o r played


                                                           37
 any part tn the South Yorkshire Police plans. Had the latter been informed o f the history contained in the
 dossier and summarised above it may well-have influenced policc strategv in Leppmgs Lane.

  220. There is presently a proposal that a national computer-based police football intelligence system should       j
be set up to make the necessary inform ation readily available.                                                      i
                                                                                                                     <
P o lic e I n t e llig e n c e o n th e D a y                                                |
  221. The unfilled space in the Liverpool areas inside the ground, the figures for entry available from the         [
Club's computer and observations on the video screen should have enabled those in the control room to
m onitor the numbers arriving and still to arrive at Leppings Lane. Radio contact with mobile (Tango) patrols        i
detailed to m onitor licensed premises in the district could have indicated the numbers still to come. But at 2.30
pm when M r M u rray told M r Duckenfield they would "get them all in by 3 o’clock” he seems not to have             j
appreciated that in addition to those visible at the turnstiles there were many more still to come. Certainly. M r   ;
Marshall outside the turnstiles was not told and could not otherwise have known that there were still many           j
Liverpool ticket holders to arrive.                                                                   |

M r M a r sh a ll and M r G reenw ood                                                            !
   222. The division o f command between these two officers did not help. M r Marshall was in charge o f the         [
serials outside the perimeter gates in the Leppings Lane area and in the roads beyond. In practice he operated       f
inside and just outside the turnstile area. M r Greenwood's area as Ground Com m ander extended from the             j
pitch to theperimetergates. He in fact stationed himself near the players' tunnel. He was wholly unaware o f the     i
growing problems at the turnstiles and was in no position to exercise control over his officers who were under
pressure there. No-one in the control room thought to tell him.

C o n tr o l L o s t
   223. In the result, the large concentration o f arriv als from 2.30 pm to 2.40 pm pressed unrestrained into
the turnstile area through the perimeter gates which were fully open. When that area was full, later arrivals
swelled the crowd out to the forecourt and even into the road. As already recounted, the foot officers at the
turnstiles became trapped and endangered and retired through the turnstiles. The mounted officers could not
operate amidst such a dense crowd in a confined space. They came out o f the turnstile area. There were then
the belated attempts to close the perimeter gates and prevent more fans joining the mass until it had a chance to
diminish through the turnstiles', still later the attempt to put a cordon o f horses across the entrance.

   224. Despite knowledge o f the difficult layout, the very large number o f fans to be got through so few
turnstiles and the tendency o f fans to arrive in the last h alf hour, no contingency plans were made to avoid a
crush such as occurred. Even on the day. the need to close Leppings Lane to traffic before 2.30 pm and the
other available intelligence already summarised, should have prompted those in command to take precautions
against such a crush. I f some o f the perimeter gates had been closed and cordons o f mounted and foot officers
had been placed a little distance from those gates, the flow o f fans into the turnstile area could have been
controlled before that ;.*ea became engulfed. It was the crush itself w ^ ^ h produced the frustration and the

prevented the crush and maintained the good mood which had prevailed until 2.30 pm.

  225. It should moreover hav e been obvious by 2.40 pm. i f not earlier, that a large part o f the crowd could
not be admitted until well after 3 pm. Had a decision to postpone kick-off been made and announced much o f
the frustration and with it the impetus crushing the crowd would have been reduced. A combination o f
controlled filtering and a postponed kick-off would probably have obviated the need to open the gates.

   226. At various stages in his evidence. M r Duckenfield gave three accounts o f why he thought it too late to
postpone kick-off. Once it was that one o f the teams had alreadycome onto the pitch. Then it was that a group
o f photographers at the tunnel had wrongly led him to think that the teams were coming out. Finally, he did not
know why he thought the teams were coming out. They did not in fact come onto the pitch until 2.54 pm. two
minutes after gate C was opened. Police Constable Buxton had asked for a postponement o f kick-off before
gate C was opened. It should not. however, have needed a police Constable in the thick o f the crowd (and there
were others o f like m ind) to think o f postponing the kick-off. The need should have been clear in the control
room.

   227. The truth was that M r Duckenfield applied inflexibly the policy he had discussed with M r Murray.

Summary
   228.     The layout o f the turnstiles and the number they were required to serve left no margin o f safety against
an uneven flow o f fans. Because police strategv in advance and on the day did not cater for it. the arrival o f a
large number o f supporters between 2.30 pm and 2.40 pm created an unmanageable crush. The presence o f
a substantial m inority o f fans who had drunk too much aggravated that problem. Having lost control and
rejected the option o f postponing kick-off. the police were faced with a serious danger o f deaths or injuries.
They were left therefore with no alternative but to open the gaies. Superintendent Marshall was right at that
stage to ask for it and M r Duckenfield was right to agree. But the possible effects o f so dramatic a step required
other action.




                                                                                    39

   229. The decision to order the opening o f the gates was not accompanied or followed by any other order to
deal with the consequences. W hen gate C was opened, a steady stream o f about 2.000 fans poured through it
over some five minutes. Clearly they were going to go into the ground somewhere and unless they were diverted
their likeliest route was through the tunnel for reasons already given. No warning was issued from the control
room that the gate was to be opened. Serials on the concourse were not alerted. N either the Club control room
nor the C h ie f Steward at the Leppings Lane end was warned. N o t even M r Greenwood, the Ground
Commander, was informed. From 2.47 pm when M r Marshall made his first request until 2.52 pm when M r
Duckenfield acceded to it. there were five minutes in which orders could have been given as to how the influx
was to be absorbed. It was not done. In evidence. M r Duckenfield began by saying that no officer made any
wrong decision but he later conceded he had erred in this regard. He said he did not consider where the people
would go when the gate opened. Even after it opened, when he could see the influx on the television screen, no
order was given to steer the fans to the wing pens. M r Duckenfield said it did not cross his mind to detail
officers on the concourse to shut o ff the tunnel. Those officers could not have known from their position how
full pens 3 and 4 were. That was a matter for the control room to m onitor from its own observations and using
intelligence from around the ground.

  230. Since pens 3 and 4 were full by 2.50 pm. the tunnel should have been closed o ff whether gate C was to
be opened or not. The exercise was a simple one and had been carried out in 1988. AH that was necessary was
for a few officers to act as a cordon at the entrance to the tunnel and divert fans elsewhere. Unfortunately, the
1988 closure seems to have been unknown to the senior officers on duty at the tim e. It did not figure in the
debriefing notes. It therefore had no influence on the planning for 1989.

  231. Planning apart, however, it should have been clear in the control room where there was a view o f the
pens and o f the crowd at the turnstiles that the tunnel had to be closed. I f orders had been given to that effect
when gate C was opened, the fans could have been dn *cted to the empty areas o f the wings and this disaster
could still have been avoided Failure to give that order was a blunder o f the first magnitude.

  232. Significantly, when permission was given toopen gate A. M r Duckenfield did order serials to go to that
pan o f the concourse to monitor the influx towards the north stand. He did this because he feared that if fans
went to the north stand without tickets, they would not get seats and, there being no perimeter fences at the
north side, they might invade the pitch. This illustrates again the preoccupation with avoiding pitch invasion
as against safety and the risks o f overcrowding. Because those entering through gate C could not get onto the
pitch, it was not thought necessary to alert officers to m onitor them. The possibility of overcrowding simpiy
was not considered.

Barrier 144
   233. The removal o f barrier 144 in 1986 should have reduced the notional capacity o f pen 3 as already
mentioned. But it did more. In the absence o f barrier 144, the influx o f fans after 7.52 pm met no retarding
structure as it came into pen 3. The pressure created was free to push fans straight down by the radial fence to
the lowest line o f barriers. The pressure diagonally from the tunnel mouth down to barrier number 124a which
collapsed was unbroken by any intervening barrier. 124a was also vulnerable to pressure straight down the pen
through the gap in the barrier above it created in 1985.

  234. Inspector Bullas, positioned in the west stand, described what he saw looking down on the pens
around 3 pm,

   "... 1 saw from the direction o f the tunnel a kind o f movement down the terracing... the type o f thing that you
   see on the nature programmes, the molten lead flowing down the side o f the mountainside, the molten la v a ...
   a “river o f people’’ ...going directly towards the pitch but there again spreading... out.”

   235. D r Eastwood conceded in evidence that the removal o f barrier 144 was likely to have contributed to
the collapse o f 124a. Later, he sought to resile from that answer, but I th ink his earlier admission was correct. It
was argued that i f barrier 144 had remained, the influx from gate C would have built up further back and the
tragedy might have occurred in the tunnel or might have broken barrier 144 itself. This is speculative and I
think unlikely. W hat remained o f barrier 144 in pen 4 did not cause a build-up; nor did it collapse. But its
remaining in position may well have accounted for no barrier further down pen 4 collapsing and for the lesser
carnage in that pen.

W h e n d id B arrier 1 2 4 a F a il?
  236. Counsel for the South Yorkshire Police sought to argue that this barrier collapsed or may have
collapsed at about 2.47 pm. His purpose was to suggest that the opening o f gate C was not causally linked with
the crushing and fatalities resulting from that collapse. I have already found that whilst the evidence does not
permit the tim e o f collapse to be fixed with certainty, it was after 2.52 pm. 1 now give my reasons:

  (a) I have several times watched the BBC video tape on which Counsel relied. I do not find the incident he
      identifies at 2.47 pm suggestive o f a collapse at that time:

  (b) the evidence o f fans who were near or at the barrier was overwhelmingly to the effect that the collapse
      occurred at or after 3 pm:

  (c) the biggest group o f witnesses was that which related the collapse to the surge following Beardsley’s
      "near-miss” at the Kop end at 3.04 pm;

  (d) the appearance on video and photographs o f fans in the area o f barrier 124a after the incident at 2.47 pm
      and before the final crush is not consistent with it having collapsed so early:

  (e) it is highly unlikely that if so catastrophic an event had occurred as early as 2.47 pm. the police on the
      track and elsewhere would have taken until nearly 3 o’clock to realise something was seriously wrong.
      Indeed, if Counsel for the South Yorkshire Police were correct in his tim ing o f the collapse, the failure o f
      the police to respond for so long would expose them to even graver criticism than that made in this
      Report.

Dr Eastwood's Testing of the Barriers
  237. Two sections o f barrier 124a in pen 3 collapsed as a result o f the overcrowding. T h at collapse caused a
number o f deaths. D r Eastwood and his staff had undertaken the periodical testing o f crush barriers required
by the Green G u ide and by the Safety Certificate. Barrier 124a had been tested in July 1988 and passed.

  238. The test had been carried out in accordance with D r Eastwood’s interpretation o f Annex C to the
Green Guide. That requires an evenly distributed force o f 6.0kN /m etre width to be applied for 3 five minute




                                                          41
 periods, the interval between applications to be as short as possible. A record has lo be kept o f the amount of
 deformation during each loading and o f the percentage o f recovery. I f the recovery is less than 50% after the
 third application o f force, the barrier has failed the test. I f recovery is between 50% and 75%. there must be a
 re-test. The question is: 50% or 75% o f what? Is the recovery to be in relation to the position o f the barrier
 before the first application o f force or before the third? I f the former, a span o f 124a recorded 53% at the 1988
 test and should have been re-tested. I f the latter, it recorded 100% and passed. Unfortunately the Green Guide
 is unclear as to the correct interpretation. D r Eastwood took the latter view and so passed the barrier. He
justified his interpretation in evidence. He said failure to recover to the original position could be due to a
“shake-down” effect related to some giving in the ashes under the concrete or to some other extraneous factor
rather than to any defect in the material o f the barrier itself.

   239. I think, after consulting Professor Maunder, that safety ought to have dictated recovery should be by
reference to the position o f the barrier before the first application o f force. I accept, however, that the Green
G uide is ambiguous and D r Eastwood’s interpretation is tenable. It has some support from the British
Standards tests on steel structures. Clearly, howev er, for the future, the Green G uide should be clarified on this
point.

C o r r o sio n
  240. Inspection o f barrier 124a. and indeed other barriers at Hillsborough, by the HSE showed
considerable corrosion o f the metal at vulnerable points where water could accumulate. D r Eastwood agreed
that if a significant degree o f corrosion was observed on visual inspection, a barrier should be condemned.

   241. The Green G u id e does not specifically refer to corrosion. Paragraph 39 provides, in te r alia:

   “C rush barriers and balustrades should be examined for deformation or any other overt signs o f weakness".

Paragraph 6 o f Annex C provides:

   “ I f during any test, even though the b a rrie r... satisfies the above loading requirements, doubt should arise
   for any reason (including such matters as cracking o f the terracing or distortion o f connections) as to the
   safety o f the b a rrie r... a detailed investigation should be carried out. Unless the results o f this investigation
   remove the doubt as to safety o f the b a rrie r... (it) should be deemed to have failed the test".

  242. Since corrosion is a likely cause o f deterioration, a revision o f t h e Green G uide should make       S D e e if i e
reference to it.

Causation
  243. Tests done by the HSE suggest that although barrier 124a passed the loading test in 1988 and probably
would have been able to sustain a force which did not exceed the test load, it was unable to resist the load
imposed upon it by reason o f the numbers in pen 3. the excessive gap in the barrier higher up the pen and the
absence o f barrier 144. Corrosion probably played a part, but the effective cause o f the collapse was the
excessive and unanticipated pressure to which the barrier was exposed.

O b se r v a tio n from C o n tro l R o om
   244. As the stream from gate C flowed through the tunnel, the officers in the control room could be expected
to keep a close watch on pens 3 and 4. They had a direct view o f them from an elevated position through their
window. Although they had no field-glasses, there was the zoom facility on the T V camera. The radio was by
then working again and although reception was difficult due to crowd noise and possibly excessive air traffic
on channel 25. attempts could have been made to alert officers on the perimeter track to watch for
overcrowding and report their observations. In the event, pens 3 and 4 became more and more crowded, surges
took place, fans were showing and signalling distress. None o f this was seen or recognised in the control r<v'm

Officers on the Track
   245. The 20 officers detailed to the perimeter track were distributed round the pitch so that some five
officers were at the west end. T h e ir written instructions made no reference to the avoidance o r detection o f
overcrowding. The same applied to the officers in the west stand. M r Greenwood adm itted that his oral
briefings also contained no mention o f monitoring the pens for overcrowding.

   246. The Operational O rder for 1988 had instructed officers to forbid anyone “access to the track from the
terraces without the consent o f a senior officer (except to receive medical attention)” . At the end o f the 1988
semi-final, there was a m inor pitch invasion. Accordingly, that prohibition was emphasised in the 1989
Operational O rder by being put into capital letters. The combination o f no instructions as to overcrowding and
a strong prohibition on opening the gates was likely to make police recognition o f crushing slow and their
response reluctant. Small wonder that the growing pressure and congestion between 2.50 pm and 2.59 ~m
went unheeded or certainly unremedied. Even when officers recognised there was a problem, the rule required
consent o f a senior officer before a gate could be opened.

  247. “Senior officer" meant an officer o f Inspector rank or higher. The Inspector in charge o f the 20 officers
on the track was M r Darling. H e stationed himself by the players’ tunnel, the most central position for
supervising his men. In evidence he said:

  “ 1 would only take action i f 1 thought crowding had got to such a stage that the fans were in danger. I ’d then
  inform ground control and 1 would expect someone deployed to the back o f the stand."

  That underlines the inhibition against opening perimeter gates. So did the evidence o f one Constable who
said it had been so drummed into officers not to open the gates that when he saw distress in pen 4. he “debated"'
with himself before opening the gate, thinking: " I f I'm wrong. I'm going to get a right bollocking for this."
Naturally, one would hope that common sense and humanity would make some officers cut through the rules
and open a gate i f fans were clearly in distress.

  248. This is what happened, but not until officers recognised the distress and even then not immediately.
Hence, gates 3 and 4. having been opened, were shut again before they were finally opened and at first those
seeking to climb out over the fence were pushed back. This reaction o f the police did not go on for as long as
some witnesses believed. They probably misinterpreted the hand movements from M r Greenwood and others
aimed at persuading fans to move back and relieve the pressure as attempts to stop those climbing out at the
front.

  249. Nev ertheless, there was a period during which the failure to recognise the problem and the inhibition
against tackling it caused vital tim e to be lost.




                                                                  43

The Officers in Command
  250. Even when realisation o f the problem came to officers on the track, it was some minutes before it
reached the control room. W hen spectators first appeared on the track, the im m ediate assumption in the
control room was that a pitch invasion was threatened. This was unlikely at the beginning o f a match. It
became still less likely when those on the track made no move towards the pitch. M r Motson, the BBC
commentator, recognised and said, well before the match was stopped, that the trouble seemed to be
overcrowding and not misbehaviour. Still, the assumption to the contrary persisted in the control room. U n til
M r M u rray radioed for a fleet o f ambulances, about 3.06 pm, M r Duckenfield continued to treat the incident
as a threat to the pitch and to public order. The message calling up all available officers mentioned a pitch
invasion. Operation Support was initiated and dog handlers were requested.
   251. U n til C h ie f Superintendent Nesbit arrived, there was no effective leadership either from control o r on
the pitch to harness and organise rescue efforts. N o orders were given for officers to enter the tunnel and relieve
pressure. Some officers did this on their own initiative. Apart from the Tannoy request to d e a r the pitch, no
attempt was made to clear and mark o ff a casualty area where first-aid could be given without hindrance by
fans and photographers m illing about between the bodies. There was no co-ordination o f the early provision o f
first-aid or o f stretcher parties or o f the rescue effort through gates 3 and 4. N o request for help was broadcast to
doctors and nurses in the crowd until about 3.29 pm when it was too late. Probably, there was little that could
have been achieved in most cases however soon doctors had been summoned, but there were marginal cases
where earlier attention might have made a difference.
   2   52. The plight o f those behind the fencing and the existence o f injuries were known to officers at the scene
from 3 pm. But the M a jo r Disaster Plan was not started until 3.06 pm at earliest when the ambulance service
was called. N o request for cutting gear or for the fire brigade was made until 3.13 p.m. Again, it is unlikely that
these services could have saved lives i f they had been called promptly, but it is possible.
Police on the Pitch
   253. Despite the initial lack o f leadership, many officersdid all they humanly could to rescueand revive the
victims. M any supporters who gave evidence paid tribute to these efforts. It is also fair to say that the number
o f officers who could at first be usefully involved at the two open gates was necessarily lim ited.
   254. C h ie f Superintendent Nesbit’s action in deploying a line o f officers across the m iddle o f the pitch has
already been mentioned. I can well understand the resentment it caused. However, the police assertion that a
rush by some fans towards the Kop end raised fears o f conflict are well borne out by the video tape. In my
judgement, C hief Superintendent Nesbit was well justified in using some o f the many officers called up
pursuant to Operation Support to prevent possible violence. To have nad open tignting in a ground where
some 90 spectators already lay dead would have been an unthinkable and obscene development.
Fans on the Pitch
   255. M any fans who escaped onto the pitch alive were in a state o f collapse or close to it. Most o f those who
retained their strength strove magnificently to assist the victims. They helped pull them clear, they helped with
first-aid; they helped carry the improvised stretchers.
  256. There were fans, however, who were distraught, angry, drunk, or all three. T h e ir conduct in abusing,
assaulting and spitting at the police was disgraceful, the more so since earlier police failures had little to do
with those officers now doing their best for the injured. In addition, there were abuse and assaults on
ambulance men and firemen in the course o f their rescue work. This was probably because their sim ilar
uniforms caused them to be mistaken for police. However, although the abuse was widespread, the number o f
assaults and spittings was on the evidence comparatively small. In deploring them, one must recognise the
uniquely horrifying experience which those responsible had just suffered and were still suffering.
False Reports
   257. Before this Inquiry began, there were stones reported in the press, and said to have emanated from
police officers present at the match, o f “ mass drunkenness” . It was said that drunken fans urinated on the
police while they were pulling the dead and injured out, that others had even urinated on the bodies o f the dead
and stolen their belongings. N ot a single witness was called before the Inquiry to support any o f those
allegations although every opportunity was afforded for any o f the represented parties to have any witness
called whom they wished. As soon as the allegations I have mentioned were made in the press, M r Peter
Wright. C h ie f Constable o f South Yorkshire, made a dignified statement dissociating himself from such grave
and emotive calumnies. Those who made them, and those who disseminated them, would have done better to
hold their peace.

   258. The peri meter gates in the pens were not designed as exits. They were intended to afford access by the
police to cope with any local disorder or with an emergency. The kind o f emergency contemplated was not
massive crushing but, for example, the collapse or illness o f an individual. Emergency evacuation o f the pens
had been considered by the Officer Working Party. Although fire risk was m inim al since the terraces, west
stand and tunnel were o f concrete construction, the fire brigade were the principal arbiters o f evacuation
procedure. They aimed to be able to empty the pens in six minutes. The plan was to evacuate spectators via the
tunnel. I f for any reason that option became impr?.cticable, f^ d u e to a bomb threat, then the alternative route
would be along the back o f the terraces, through the gates in the radial fences and round the sides o f the west
stand. The fire brigade were satisfied that each o f these routes would enable the pens to be evacuated in less
than six minutes, without relying on the gates to the pitch. Those gates would also be available, but their use
was excluded from the calculation o f evacuation time.

  259. The need to provide for speedy and large scale evacuation from the front o f the pens to the pitch was
not anticipated. The Green Guide (1 98 6 ) provides as follows:

  “209. Access to the pitch must be made as difficult as possible in normal circumstances while at the same
  time ensuring that the police have effective access to the terraces for the purpose o f crowd control and
  enabling the pitch to be used (where appropriate) in the event o f serious emergency . . .

  214. . . . at some m ajor soccer stadia, where restriction on crowd movement forms a necessary part o f the
  safety measures, it may be necessary to have a fence which prevents access to the pitch in normal
  circumstances . . . but allows for access in emergency.

  215. For most m ajor stadia, whether used for association football or other sports, the pitch perimeter fence
  will be required either to prevent access to the pitch as mentioned above, o r at least to discourage attempts
  by spectators to enter the playing area. Gates or other access points (m in im u m width 1.1 metres) should
  nonetheless be provided for use in an emergency . . . Prov ision o f such gates or access points is particularly
  im portant to allow full access to the playing area (or track) where it is likely to be used as a place o f safety in
  an emergency.        Such gates or access points should be properly stewarded and                            clearly
  marked so that im mediate access to the playing area or perimeter track can be ensured”.

   260. Gate 3 was .82 metres in width: gate 4 was .79 metres in width. There were therefore clear departures
from the Green G uide standard.

  261. The Safety Certificate provided (by Schedule 2 Paragraph 24) as follows:

  The (club) shall arrange for the Stadium to be inspected by a suitably qualified Chartered E ngineer. . . at
  least once each period o f 12 months . . . and . . . shall as soon as possible after each inspection supply to
  the . . . Council a Certificate bvthe said Chartered Engineeras to the current compliance o r non-compliance
  with . . . the appropriate provisionsand recommendations o f the (Green) G uide o fa ll structural parts o f the
  Stadium . . .

  262. It was argued that there was no breach o f the Safety Certificate since the Green G uide specifically
provides for flexibility. However, in my view the Safety Certificate cannot and certainly should not be
interpreted so liberally as in effect to leave such basic requirements as the size o f exit gates to the total
discretion o f the club and its advisers. One o f the matters for consideration at stage two o f this inquiry w ill be
whether, and in what respects, the Green G uide needs to be clarified and toughened.

   263. D r Eastwood explained the small width o f the gates by reference to the dilem m a facing the police. They
wanted a gate sufficient for its intended purpose le police access and small scale emergencies. On the other
hand, they did not want a flood gate o f such size as to endanger the prim e principle o f preventing pitch
invasions. In the light o f Hillsborough, this is perhaps the most poignant example o f the difficulty o f achieving
a balance between stopping hooliganism and ensuring crowd safety.

  264. Even i f the width o f gates 3 and 4 had complied with the present Green G uide standard, they would
have been wholly inadequate to relieve pressure and release spectators swiftly on 15 April. Moreover, the
Green Guide says nothing about the number o f gates required for a pen o f given size. W hilst the Club,

D r Eastwood, the O fficer Working Party and the local authority can be criticised for failing strictly to conform
to the Guide, the real failure was common to all those who have been responsible for considering safety on the
terraces. The anxiety to protect the sanctity o f the pitch has caused insufficient attention to be paid to the risk
o f a crush due to overcrowding. Certain it was. that once the crush occurred on 15 A pril gates 3 and 4 were
wholly inadequate for rescue purposes.

                                     BRIEF SU M M A R Y O F C A U SE S

  265. The im m ediate cause o f the gross overcrowding and hence the disaster was the failure, when gate C was
opened, to cut o ff access to the central pens which were already overfull.

  266. They were already overfull because no safe m axim um capacities had been laid down, no attempt was
made to control entry to individual pens numerically and there was no effective visual monitoring o f crowd
density.

   267. When the influx from gate C entered pen 3, the layout o f the barriers there afforded less protection
than it should and a barrier collapsed. Again, the lack o f vigilant monitoring caused a sluggish reaction and
response when the crush occurred. The small size and number o f gates to the track retarded rescue efforts. So.
in the initial stages, did lack o f leadership.

  268. The need to open gate C was due to dangerous congestion at the turnstiles. That occurred because, as
both Club and police should have realised, the turnstile area could not easily cope with the large numbers
demanded o f it unless they arrived steadily over a lengthy period. The Operational Order and police tactics on
the day failed to provide for controlling a concentrated arrival o f large numbers should that occur in a short
period. That it might so occur was foreseeable and it dicLThe presence o f an unruly m inority who had drunk
too much aggravated the prooicin. So did the C lub’s confused and inadequate signs and ticketing.




                                                       47
                                                  CHAPTER 17
                                       T H E FA's C H O IC E O F G R O U N D

    269. The FA were strongly criticised by the Football Supporters' Association and others for having
imposed the Hillsborough venue on Liverpool for a second year running. The Liverpool supporters had to
travel much further to Sheffield than their Nottingham rivals. The police required that i f the match was to be at
Hillsborough at all, Liverpool would have to have the west and north side accommodation. The disadvantages
o f that and the disparate numbers o f home supporters o f the two clubs have already been set out. Liverpool had
had to knuckle under to the arrangement in 1988. They resented having it imposed in 1989. To hold the match
at O ld Trafford would have been a perfectly good and acceptable alternative. Indeed, the FA nominated Old
Trafford as the venue for the replay should there be a draw at Hillsborough.

   270. M r Kelly, the FA’s C h ie f Executive, sought to give reasons for preferring Hillsborough, but the only one
which seemed to have any validity was that the 1988 match had been considered a successfully managed event.
H e adm itted that a telephone call from the C h ie f Executive o f the Liverpool Club protesting and putting
Liverpool’s case had not been mentioned to the FA committee which finally decided the venue. M r Kelly
frankly conceded that “ there was an element o f unfairness" to Liverpool in choosing Hillsborough fo ra second
tim e. I think the decision was ill-considered. N o doubt in future the FA w ill be more sensitive and responsive
to reasonable representations.

  271. However, it was not suggested that the choice o f venue was causative o f this disaster. The only basis on
which that could be said would be that, because o f its layout, the Leppings Lane end was incapable o f being
successfully policed for this semi-final. I do not believe that to be so.




                                                         48
                                                 CHAPTER 18
                                                    POLICE

Choice o f Ends by the Police
   272. There was much bitterness amongst Liverpool supporters that they had to make do again for the
second year with the Leppings Lane end. But, cogent as their complaints were, they amounted to reasons for
choosing a different ground altogether. Given Hillsborough as the venue. 1 think the police were right to
allocate the sections o f the ground as tney did. The direction o f arrival and the need for segregation made it
sensible and to reverse the 1988 arrangements would have made for confusion. As with choice o f venue, I do
not consider choice o f ends was causative o f the disaster. H ad it been reversed, the disaster could well have
occurred in a sim ilar manner but to Nottingham supporters.

Police Planning
  273. The Operational O rder for 1989 left much unsaid. A part from the lack o f any provision for late or
congested arrivals, or any provision for the avoidance o f overcrowding on the terraces, there was a number o f
other omissions. For example, there was no specific deployment o f officers to man the perimeter gates. The
Order did not detail the duties o f the mounted officers deployed at the Leppings Lane entrance, who included
Liverpool officers to assist in marshalling their own fans. The duties o f Superintendents (especially M r
Greenwood and M r M arshall) were not defined so as to achieve clarity and efficiency. By an oversight, the
provision requiring mobile (Tango) patrols to assist the emergency services was omitted from the text.

   274. T h e 1988 Order was never substantially reviewed save to reduce the number o f officers deployed in
shopping areas and to emphasise in capital letters the embargo on fans having access to the pitch. Satisfaction
with the 1988 event led to complacency. T h at some thought the pens overfull in 1988 and that the tunnel was
closed o ff on that occasion did not figure in or influence the plan for 1989.

   275. M r Duckenfield was promoted and put in charge o f F Division only 21 days before this semi-final. The
pre-planning was already in progress under M r M ole who had been in command both in 1987 and in 1988. It
might have been wiser to have left M r M ole in charge o f this operation. O n the other hand, it is quite
understandable that M r Duckenfield should have been expected to take command o f events in his Division
from the date o f his promotion. In view o f his lack o f experience at Hillsborough and o f a semi-final match,
however, it was imperative that he be fully briefed and that he should also b rie f himself.

   276. He was not informed o f the crushing incident in 1981 nor did he make inquiries which would have
revealed it. He did not know the arrangement as between Club and police for monitoring the Leppings Lane
terraces. H e did not visit and tour the ground before approving the Operational Order. Although he attended a
match on 2 April, there was only a small crowd present and he left control o f the game to the Superintendents.

Policing on the Day
  277. One o f the regrettable features o f the football scene as it has developed is the enormous expenditure o f
money, tim e and effort in employing large numbers o f police all over the country to guard against the sort o f
disorder and misbehaviour which have become endemic. Police management o f a game o f football has become
a m ilitary operation. The problems faced and the responses received must be disheartening and may have
tended to harden police attitudes to supporters in general.

  278. It is fair to state that over many years the South Yorkshire Police have given excellent service to the
public. They have handled crowd problems sensitively and successfully at a large number o f football games
including major matches, during strikes in the coal industry and the steel industry, and in other contexts.
Unfortunately, their policing on 15 A pril broke down in the ways already described and, although there were
other causes, the main reason for the disaster was the failure o f police controL

   279. In all some 65 police officers gave oral evidence at the Inquiry. Sadly I must report that for the most
part the quality o f their evidence was in inverse proportion to their rank. There were many young Constables
who as witnesses were alert, intelligent and open. On the day. they and many others strove heroically in ghastly
circumstances aggravated by hostility to rescue and succour victims. They inspired confidence and hope.

  280. By contrast, with some notable exceptions, the senior officers in command were defensive and evasive
witnesses’ T h eir feelings o f grief and sorrow were obvious and genuine. N o doubt those feelings were
intensified by the knowledge that such a disaster had occurred under their management. But, neither their
handling o f problems on the day nor th eir account o f it in evidence showed the qualities o f leadership to be
expected o f their rank.


                                                        49
                28 i . M i Duckenfield leant heavily on M r Murray's experience. Between them they misjudged the build-up
             at the turnstiles and did little about it until they received M r Marshall's request to open the gate. They did not.
             for example, check the turnstile figures available from Club control or check with Tango units as to the
             numbers still to come. They did not alert M r Greenwood to the situation at the fringe o f his area o f command.
             They gave no instructions as to the management o f the crowd at Leppings Lane. Inflexibly they declined to
             postpone kick-ofT.

               282. When M r Marshall’s request came, M r Duckenfield’s capacity to take decisions and give orders
             seemed to collapse. Having sanctioned, at last, the opening o f the gates, he failed to give necessary
             consequential orders or to exert any control when the disaster occurred. H e misinterpreted the emergence o f
             fans from pens 3 and 4. W hen he was unsure o f the problem, he sent others down to “assess the situation"
             rather than descend to see for himself. H e gave no inform ation to the crowd.

                283. Most surprisingly, he gave M r Kelly and others to think that there had been an inrush due to Liverpool
             fans forcing open a gate. This was not only untruthful. It set o ff a widely reported allegation against the
             supporters which caused grave offence and distress. It revived against football fans, and especially those from
             Liverpool, accusations o f hooliganism which caused reaction not only nationwide but from Europe too. I can
             only assume that M r Duckenfield’s lack o f candour on this occasion was out o f character. He said his reason for
             not telling the truth was that i f the crowd became aware o f it there might be a very hostile reaction and this
             might impede rescue work. H e did not wish to divulge what had happened until he had spoken to a senior
             officer. However, reluctance to tell M r Kelly the truth did not require that he be told a falsehood. Moreover,
             although Assistant C h ie f Constable Jackson was at hand. M r Duckenfield did not disclose the truth to him
             until much later.

               284. The likeliest explanation o f M r Duckenfield's conduct is that he simply could not face the enormity of
             the decision to open the gates and all that flowed therefrom. T h at would explain what he said to M r Kelly, w hat
             he did not say to M r Jackson, his aversion to addressing the crowd and his failure to take effective control o f the
             disaster situation. He froze.

             T h e Police Case at the Inquiry
               285.     It is a matter o f regret that at the hearing, and in their submissions, the South Yorkshire Police were not
             prepared to concede they were in any respect at fault in what occurred. M r Duckenfield. under pressure of
             cross-examination, apologised for blaming the Liverpool fans for causing thedeaths. But. that apart, the police
             case was to blame the fans for being late and drunk, and to blame the Club for failing to monitor the pens. It was
             argued that the fatal crush was not caused by the influx through gate C but was due to barrier 124a being
             defective. Such an unrealistic approach gives cause for anxiety as to whether lessons have been learnt. It would
             have been more seemly and encouraging for the future if responsibility had been faced.

                        T H E CITY C O U N C IL A N D T H E SA FETY CERTIFICATE

   286. The performance by the C ity Council o f its duties in regard to the Safety Certificate was inefficient and
dilatory. The failure to revise or amend the certificate over the period o f three years preceding this disaster,
despite im portant changes in the layout o f the ground, was a serious breach o f duty. There were, as a result, no
fixed capacities for the pens. The certificate took no account o f the 1981 and 1985 alterations to the ground.

  287. A number o f breaches o f Green G uide standards were perm itted and persisted eg the spacing o f the
crush barriers, the width o f perimeter gates and the gradient in the tunnel (1 in 6 as against the Green Guide
maximum o f 1 in 10).

  288. The Advisory Group lacked a proper structure; its procedure was casual and unbusinesslike. Its
accountability to the General Purposes Panel was ill-defined. Decisions were taken inform ally and too much
was left to M r Bownes. In particular, the decision to remove barrier 144 was not referred to the Panel and ought
not to have been made.




                                                         51
                                                  CHAPTER 20
                                      T H E CLUB A N D DR EASTW O O D

   289. It should be recorded that in general the Club has over the years adopted a responsible and
conscientious approach to its responsibilities. It retained the services o f D r Eastwood as consultant engineer
and abided by his advice. For his part, D r Eastwood is skilled and experienced in this field, as already
indicated, and he sought 1 have no doubt to act efficiently and professionally in his advice and practical work.
The Club also retained M r Lock who had acquired great experience and knowledge o f Hillsborough during his
police service. A number o f witnesses described Hillsborough as a very good ground, “one o f the best in the
country” . The police agreed that relations between them and the Club were good. O ver the last four years, the
C lub had spent some £ 1'k m illion on ground improvements.

   290. Nevertheless, there are a number o f respects in which failure by the Club contributed to this disaster.
They were responsible as occupiers and invitors for the layout and structure o f the ground. The Leppings Lane
end was unsatisfactory and ill-suited to adm it the numbers invited, for reasons already spelt out. The Club was
aware o f these problems and discussed solving them in various ways between 1981 and 1986. In the result,
there remained the same num ber o f turnstiles, and the same problems outside and inside them. The plan for
this semi-final, involving as it did the loss o f 12 turnstiles for the north stand and large numbers to be fed in
from Leppings Lane, was one agreed between the Club and the police. T h e Club knew best what rate o f
admission the turnstiles could manage and ought to have alerted the police to the risks o f the turnstiles being
swamped.

   291. The alterations inside the turnstiles and on the terraces clearly affected capacity, but no specific
allowance was made for them. In that respect, both D r Eastwood and the C lub should have taken a more
positive approach. Either a scheme such as one o f those D r Eastwood put forward should have been adopted
giving more turnstiles and total separation o f areas o r at the very least the capacity o f the new pens and o f the
terraces as a whole should have been treated more cautiously. The police view in 19 8 1 that 10.100 was too high
a figure was known to the Club (although D r Eastwood says not to him ). Yet. despite that and the sub-division
into pens, the figure remained.

   292. Although the police had assumed responsibility for m onitoring the pens, the Club had a duty to its
visitors and the C lub’s officials ought to have alerted the police to the grossly uneven distribution o f fanson the
terraces. The C lub operated and read the closed circuit television and the computer totaliser. Liaison between
Club and police on the day failed to alert the latter to the number o f Liverpool supporters still to come. The
onus here was on the Club as well as on the police.

   293. The removal o f barrier 144 was the responsibility o f the Club although it clearly acted on the advice o f
D r Eastwood and the Advisory Group which in this instance was misguided.

  294. Likewise, the breaches o f the Green G uide were matters h > i :h ine Club should have appreciated and
remedied.

   295. Lastly, as already indicated, the poor signposting on the concourse tended to produce under-filling o f
the wing pens and over-filling o f pens 3 and 4. Poor signposting outside the turnstiles and the unhelpful form at
o f the tickets also led to confusion aggravating the build-up in the turnstile area.

    No Fault by the Emergency Services
       296. I say at the outset o f this chapter that no valid criticism can be made o f the response by the St John
    Ambulance Brigade, by S Y M A S or by the fire brigade on 15 April. Indeed, no represented party ventured any
    criticism o f them. The only attack :>n S Y M A S came from two Liverpool doctors. One claimed that ambulances
    did not arrive swiftly or with sufficient equipment and that there was a lack o f triage. H e was proved to be
    wrong in all three respects. Unfortunately he had seen fit to go on television on 15 A pril when he said more
    lives could have been saved i f staff and equipment had arrived earlier. Apart from being proved wrong in fact
    as to the times o f arrival o f ambulances, he conceded in evidence that it was not possible to say whether lives
    could have been saved. His comments on television were irresponsible. The other doctor complained o f the
    absence o f defibrillators. I am satisfied on overwhelming evidence that to attem pt to use a defibrillator on the
    pitch with people m illing about would have been highly dangerous owing to the risk o f injury from the electric
    charge.

      297. I find that all three o f the emergency services named above responded promptly when alerted, that
    they brought appropriate equipment and that their personnel operated efficiently.

      298. It would be unreasonable to expect, at any sports stadium, medical facilities capable o f dealing with a
    major disaster such as occurred. To have in advance at the ground, oxygen, resuscitators, stretchers, other
    equipment and medical staff sufficient to deal with over 100 casualties is not practicable.

      299. W hat is required is a basic level o f provision for first aid. for professional medical attention and for
    ambulance attendance, together with a system o f co-ordination with the emergency services which w ill bring
    them to the scene swiftly in whatever numbers are required. W hat w ill amount to an appropriate basic
    provision for the futures# the equipment in a first aid room, requires expert evaluation and advice.

      300. On the day, there was no clear understanding between the C lub and D r Purcell as to his role. He
    believed he was prim arily there to attend to the players. The Club regarded him also as the “ physician available
    toattend at the first aid room i f required”, as laid down in the Safety C ertificate.

      301. There was insufficiently close co-operation between the police and the emergency services. It is clear
    that S Y M A S and the fire brigade should have been called earlier than they were. However, in view o f the nature
    and extent o f the crushing, the tim e when police rescue began and the pathetically short period for which those
    unable to breathe could surv ive, it is improbable that quicker recourse to the emergency services would have
    saved more lives.

       302. Finally, there was ev idence that an advertising board had to be kno^' i down at the north-east corner
    o f the ground to allow an ambulance onto the pitch and that at the top o         remp leading to the pitch the
    access for ambulances was inadequate. There was also evidence that the pre-match arrangement for
    ambulances to use the two gates from Penistone Road at the north-east end o f the ground as in and out routes
    was frustrated by the presence o f vehicles just inside the ground. In the event, none o f these matters affected
    operations. The hoarding was quickly knocked down. The d ifficult access to the ramp was negotiated and
    ambulances used one entrance satisfactorily by backing out when loaded.




                                                            53

                                          C O M M U N IC A T IO N S

   303.      One problem which impeded police control and the gathering o f intelligence was the interm ittent
failure o f communication by radio. There was the period o f two or three minutes when the control room was
out o f radio contact. Even when that was remedied, it was only by using a hand set in the control room. This
meant that control could not override any other messages. N o effective radio communication seems to have
reached cor.'.roi from the perimeter track at the relevant time. M r Greenwood's request for the match to be
stopped and various messages from Constables reporting the distress in the pens did not register. Likewise,
communication from Leppings Lane to control was unreliable. Undoubtedly these breakdowns made it more
difficult for those in command to make ppoper assessments and exercise effective command.

Limited Objectives
  304. It is im portant to stress the lim ited objectives o f the interim recommendations 1 can make in this
Report. M y purpose is to propose instant measures capable o f being implemented forthwith and where
possible before the commencement o f the 1989/1990 season. They are designed to prevent overcrowding and
crushing on terraces in the short term and to improve safety procedures. They do not and cannot meet all the
problems or address all the issues o f post-Hillsborough football. W ider issues such as membership schemes,
identity cards, all-seater stadia, super-stadia and long term recommendations fall to be considered in my Final
Report. So do a number o f other specific matters such as a comprehensive review o f the Green Guide, the
problem o f excessive pre-match drinking, fans without tickets and ticket touts. I mention these matters lest it
be thought I have decided no recommendations need be made concerning them. I have not. But before
deciding what i f any recommendations to make about these and other matters, more evidence and study is
required.

  305. Accordingly, the main thrust o f these interim recommendations, as a holding exercise, is to reduce
numbers on the terraces, to increase vigilance and to achieve a proper balance in crowd control between
prevention o f disorder and maintenance o f safety.



Perimeter Fences
  306. It would be impractical and unwise to recommend works o f construction or radical structural changes
now. before completing the extensive study and consultation which w ill form stage two o f this Inquiry. Hasty
interim recommendations o f that kind might well prove to be ill-judged after further study and require to be
changed in a matter o f months.

  307. In particular. I do not at this stage make any recommendation as to removing perimeter fences or
replacing them with structures o f different design. Understandably, there was a wave o f popular feeling against
such fences in the im m ediate aftermath o f Hillsborough. The horrifying spectacle o f people being crushed
against the fencing focussed blame for the disaster on the fences themselves. There were pleas to dismantle
them and emotive references to the fans being treated like "caged animals". Some clubs removed their fencing
straightaway. It was therefore very tempting to consider at an early stage making a recommendation that the
fences should be removed. I confess to being so tempted.

  308. Regrettably, only a month after Hillsborough, there were incidents which showed that violence and
hooliganism are still liable to erupt at football grounds. On 13 M ay at Selhurst Park. Birmingham City
supporters invaded the pitch and fought with supporters o f the home club. Crystal Palace. Five police officers
and 16 supporters were ini"red and required treatment at a local hospital. On the same day at a match between
Bristol C ity and Sheffield I nited. spectators spilt onto the pitch and there ' n j i r ugon the i;rraces. At the
Cup Final between Liverpool and Everton on 20 May. there was a pitch invasion, albeit a comparatively
benign one.

  309. Even the Football Supporters' Association (F S A )fe lt it necessary to say in their final submission,

       "W ith some reservations, the FSA accept that perimeter fences are necessary for crowd control.”

   310. Bearing in mind those matters, and the need to consider further expert evidence, I have decided that it
would be unwise and premature for me to make any recommendations now either to remove or to preserve or
to alter the structure o f perimeter fences. 1 shall make recommendations about them in my Final Report.

   311. For the present. 1 would emphasise that, although the fencing prevented escape, the real cause o f the
Hillsborough disaster was overcrowding and it is against that danger that my interim recommendations are
prim arily directed. Whilst declining to recommend the removal o f the fences. I do considerthat thegates to the
pitch should be kept open whilst the terraces are occupied. This w ill have, I hope, three beneficial effects.
Obviously, an open gate is a more ready escape route than one which has to be locked. Secondly, the sight o f
open gates w ill be reassuring to spectators on the terraces. Thirdly, the existence o f gaps in the fencing by
reason o f the open gates will concentrate the minds o f police officers or stewards on the track to the need for
careful m onitoring o f those on the terraces.


                                                         55
  312. It w ill o f course be necessary to have a police presence sufficient to prevent pitch invasion for im proper
reasons through the open gates. However, I am encouraged to think that this is not an insuperable problem by
the fact that, for example at Anfield, Liverpool’s ground, there were no gates in the perim eter fencing before it
was taken down. There were instead gaps or “ access points” as they are called in the Green G uide (paragraph
215). T h e ir existence did not, so far as I am aware, prevent the authorities from m aintaining order. Also, the
gates were open throughout the replay o f this ill-fated semi-final at O ld Trafford on 7 M ay 1989.


Reduced Numbers
   313. In the assessment o f figures for capacity, the criteria in Chapter 16 o f the Green G u ide were not at
Hillsborough, and may not elsewhere, have been applied with sufficient rigour. Therefore, in addition to
reminding and enjoining local authorities and clubs to make all necessary deductions when assessing the
figure for m axim um capacity in accordance with the Green G uide. 1 recommend reducing that figure by a
further 15% as an interim measure.


Safety Certificate
  314. T h e Safety Certificate procedure should, i f it is properly administered and enforced, go far towards
achieving crowd safety. W hether it succeeds depends upon the vigilance and com m itm ent o f the local
authority issuing the Certificate. I do not know whether the poor performance o f the local authority at
Hillsborough was typical. Arguments have been put to me suggesting the need for some national oversight or
inspection o f local authority certification procedures. This raises complex issues which I shall want to consider
further at stage two o f the Inquiry. For the present. I make recommendations as to the content o f Safety
Certificates and arrangements for issuing, monitoring, enforcing, reviewing, amending and renewing them.




                                                          56
                                      CHAPTER 24 -THE RECOMMENDATIONS
   315. The recommendations which follow are the m inim um necessary to ensure that existing football
grounds can for the present be safely used, based upon the evidence which I have heard at Sheffield and other
information I have received. They complement the recommendations which M r Justice Popplewell set out
after his inquiry at Bradford.

   316. Those which are asterisked should be carried out before the 1989/90 season starts. T h e rest should be
started forthwith and completed as soon as possible.

Maximum Capacities for Terraces
*          1. W here a viewing terrace is divided into pens or areas which are self-contained, the Safety Certificate
        should specify the maximum number o f spectators to be admitted to each such pen or area.

        A pen or area is to be deemed “self-contained” notwithstanding that it has a gate or gates affording access to
        another pen or area and whether such gate or gates be open or shut.

*         2. Each figure for maximum capacity should be assessed in accordance with Chapter 16 o f the Green
        Guide (“the Green Guide figure") subject to the following qualifications:-

        (a) in arriving at “the Green Guide figure”, proper and realistic allowance must be made for all factors
            which should reduce the perm issible density in accordance with the range o f maximum figures specified
            in paragraphs 221 and 222 o f the Green Guide;

        (b) after assessin g “the Green Guide figure”, a deduction o f 15% should be made to improve the safety
            margin.

*          3. Arrangements should be m ade:-

        (a) to limit the number of spectators entering each self-contained pen or area to the maximum capacity
            figure assessed in accordance with Recommendation 2 above either electronically, mechanically, by a
            ticketing arrangement, by counting or otherwise, and

        (b) to close off further access to such pen or area when its maximum capacity is about to be reached.


Filling and M onitoring Terraces
★          4. There should be a written agreement between the club and the police setting out their respective
        responsibilities for crowd safety and control and in particular for the filling o f each self-contained pen or
        i ‘her terraced area and the monitoring o f spectators in each such pen or area to avoid overcrowding. Any
        variation of the agreement in respect of an individual match should be agreed in writing in advance.

★        5. At each match, there should be on the perimeter track, for each self-contained pen or other terraced
        area, a steward (if the club is monitoring that area) or a police officer (if the police are monitoring it) whose
        sole duty is to check crowd conditions in that area for possible overcrowding or distress throughout the
        period the area is occupied by spectators. Whoever is so appointed should be in addition to any other steward
        or police presence. H e should have ready access to the police officer authorised under Recommendation 9
        below, and by radio to the control room.


    Fences and G ates
           6.    All police officers and stewards with duties in relation to the terraced areas and especially those with
         duties under Recommendation 5 above, should be fully briefed and trained with regard to the recognition of
         crowd densities, to the recognition o f signs of distress and to crowd dynamics. Training should include
         demonstrations at the ground and photographs, designed to enable stewards and officers to recognise
         different crowd densities.

    ★      7. All gates in radial or perimeter fences of pens or other self-contained areas should be painted in a
         different colour from the rest of the fence and marked “ Emergency Exit” .



                                                             57
*    8. W here there are perimeter fences, all gates to the pitch should be kept fully open during the period
    when spectators are on the terrace.

*     9. There should be in respect o f each gate in a perimeter fence (or group of gates if they are close together)
    a police officer authorised to decide whether or not to allow spectators through a gate to relieve overcrowding.
    The officer so authorised in respect o f each gate should be identified for each match and know n to be so by all
    stewards and police officers in that vicinity. H e should be able to make radio contact with the control room
    either him self or via an officer close at hand.

*     10. Suitable and sufficient cutting equipment should be provided by the club at each ground where there
    are perimeter fences to permit the immediate removal o f enough fencing to release numbers of spectators if
    necessary. Agreement should be reached as to whether the equipment should be used by police, the fire
    brigade or stewards. W hoever is to use it should be trained to do so. W hether to use it should be a decision o f a
    nominated senior police officer at the ground.


C rush B arriers
*      11. All crush barriers should be visually inspected im mediately for signs o f corrosion. Any barrier found
    to be affected by a significant degree of corrosion should be repaired or replaced.

*      12. The layout of barriers in each pen or terraced area should be reviewed immediately to ensure that it
    com plies with the criteria contained in Chapter 9 o f the Green Guide. If it does not, the assessm ent of the
    maximum capacity figure for that pen or terraced area, in accordance with Recommendation 2 above, should
    reflect the fact.


Safety’ C ertificates
      13. There should be an immediate review of each Safety Certificate by the responsible local authority,
    which should consult the club in respect o f w hich the C ertificate is issued, the police, the fire service, the
    ambulance service and the building authority. Such a review should include an inspection o f the stadium. Its
    object should be to ensure that the operative conditions o f the Certificate are complied with and to add or
    substitute any condition shown to be necessary as a matter o f urgency following the findings and
    recommendations in this report.

      14. Any local authority within w hose area there exists a sports stadium designated under the 1975 Act for
    which no Safety Certificate has yet been issued should proceed forthwith to remedy the situation.

      15. Every Safety Certificate should be reviewed by the local authority' at least once annually and each
    Certificate should require to be renewed annually.


       16. Each local authority should review its arrangements for issuing, im aoring, enforcing, reviewing,
    amending and renewing Safety Certificates. Such review should require that there exists or is provided an
    accountable administrative structure whereby the functions o f the local authority' are regularly and
    effectively supervised by senior officers and elected members and decisions are properly taken in accordance
    with the local authority 's rules.

        17. To a ssist the local authority in exercising its functions, it should set up an Advisory Group consisting
    o f appropriate members of its own staff, representatives o f the police, o f the fire and ambulance services, of
    the building authority, of the club and o f a recognised supporters' club. The Advisory Group's terms of
    reference should encom pass all matters concerned w ith crowd safety and should require regular visits to the
    ground and attendance at matches. The Advisory Group should have a chairman from the local authority,
    and an effective procedure. Its resolutions should be recorded and it should be required to produce regular
    written reports for consideration by the local authority.


Duties of each Football Club
★     18. Each turnstile should be inspected and its potential rate o f flow measured. Thereafter, regular
    inspections should be made to ensure that each turnstile remains capable of admitting spectators at the rate
    anticipated.


                                                          58
*     19. The correlation between each viewing area in the stadium and the turnstiles serving it should be such
    as to ensure that all the spectators intended to be admitted to that viewing area can pass through the
    turnstiles within one hour. If that cannot be done, the capacity of that viewing area should be reduced
    accordingly.

*     20. Turnstiles should be closed when the permitted capacity o f the area served by them is about to be
    reached and arrangements should be made to ensure quick and effective communication with turnstile
    operators for this purpose.

      21.    Closed circuit television should be so installed as to enable crowd densities outside the ground, within
    concourse areas and in pens and other standing areas, to be monitored before and throughout a match.

*     22. A ll signposting for spectators both outside and inside the ground should be comprehensively
    reviewed. It should, in relation to the arrangements for each match, be unambiguous, eye-catching, sim ple
    and clear and should be designed to ensure the rapid movement o f spectators to their appropriate viewing
    area.

*     23. Information on tickets should be unambiguous, sim ple and clear and should correlate absolutely with
    the information provided in respect o f each match both outside and inside the ground. Retained ticket stubs
    should contain information necessary to guide spectators once inside the ground.

*    24. Information on tickets requesting spectators to be in position by a particular tim e should be reviewed
    by clubs in conjunction with the police to ensure that it corresponds with the planned arrangements for
    admitting spectators to the ground.

      25. Each club should consult with a recognised supporters' club as to the provision o f pre-match
    entertainment aimed at attracting spectators to the ground in good time.


Police Planning
*     26. The C hief Constable of each police force in w hose area there is on e designated stadium or more
    should nominate a chief officer to liaise with the management of each football club and local authority
    concerned in respect of the safety and control of crowds.

*     27. The Operational Order for each match at a designated stadium and the pre-match briefing of all
    officers on duty there should alert such officers to the importance of preventing any overcrowding and, if any
    is detected, of taking appropriate steps to remedy it.

*    28. The Operational Order for each match at a designated stadium should enable the police to cope with
    any foreseeable pattern in the arrival of spectators at a match and in their departure. It should provide for
    sufficient reserves to enable rapid deployment of officers to be made at any point inside or outside the ground.

*    29. The option to postpone kick-off should be in the discretion of the officer in command at the ground.
    Crowd safety should be the paramount consideration in deciding whether to exercise it.

       30.    There should be available in the police control room the results of all closed circuit television
    monitoring outside and inside the ground and the record of any electronic or mechanical counting of numbers
    at tum stiies or of numbers admitted to any area of the ground. Officers in the control room should be skilled
    in the interpretation and use of these data.


Com m unications
      31.     There should be sufficient operators in the police control room to enable all radio transm issions to be
    received, evaluated and answered. The radio system should be such as to give operators in the control room
    priority over, and the capacity to override, others using the sam e channel. Additional channels should be
    used, where necessary, to prevent overcrowding of the airwaves. Consideration should be given to
    sound-proofing the control room against excessive crowd noise.




                                                         59
          32.     To complement radio comm unications, there should be a completely separate system o f land lines
        with telephone links between the control room and key points at the ground.

          33. W ithin the control room, there should be a public address system to communicate with individual
        areas outside and inside the ground, with groups of areas or with the whole ground. Important
        announcements should be preceded by a loud signal to catch the attention of the crowd despite a high level of
        noise in the ground. T his arrangement should be prominently advertised on every programme sold for every
        match.

          34. U se should be made where possible of illum inated advertising boards to address the crowd.
        Consideration should also be given to the use by police officers of a sim ple code of hand signals to indicate to
        the control room the existence of certain em ergencies or requirements.


Co-ordination of Em ergency Services
★         35. The police, fire and ambulance services should maintain through senior nominated officers regular
        liaison concerning crowd safety at each stadium.

★         36. Before each match at a designated stadium, the police should ensure that the fire service and
        ambulance service are given full details about the event, including its venue, its timing, the number of
        spectators expected, their likely routes o f entry and exit, and any anticipated or potential difficulties
        concerning the control or movement of the crowd. Such details should be readily available in the control
        rooms of each of the emergency services.

★         37. Contingency plans for the arrival at each designated stadium of emergency vehicles from all three
        services should be reviewed. They should include routes of access, rendezvous points, and accessibility
        within the ground itself.

★         38. Police officers posted at the entrances to the ground should be briefed as to the contingency plans for
        the arrival of em ergency services and should be informed when such services are called as to where and why
        they are required.


F irst Aid, M edical Facilities and Am bulances
★         39. There should be at each stadium at each match at least one trained first aider per 1,000 spectators. The
        club should have the responsibility for securing such attendance.

          40. There should be at each stadium one or more first aid rooms. The number of such rooms and the
        equipment to be m aintained within them should be specified by the local authority after taking professional
        medical advice and should be made a requirement of any Safety Certificate.

★        41. The club should employ a medical practitioner to be present at e&ch match and available to deal with
        any medical exigency at the ground. H e should be trained and competent in advanced first aid. H e should be
        present at the ground at least an hour before kick-off and should remain until half an hour after the end of the
        match. H is whereabouts should be known to those in the police control room and he should be im m ediately
        contactable.

    ★    42. At least one fully equipped ambulance from the appropriate ambulance authority should be in
        attendance at all m atches with an expected crowd of 5,000 or more.

          43. The number of ambulances to be in attendance for matches where larger crowds are expected should
        be specified by the local authority after consultation with the ambulance service and should be made a
        requirement of the Safety Certificate.

M r Hicks' Evidence
   1. M r and M rs Hicks’ two daughters died in the disaster. They had arrived early en fam ille but had tickets
for different sections. Th e two daughters had standing tickets; they went into pen 3. Mrs Hicks had a seat in the
north stand. M r Hicks took up a standing position in pen 1just below and to the west o f the police box at about
2.15 pm From there, he had a view o f the centre pens. He kept an eye on them as they filled up since he knew his
daughters to be there.

  2. His evidence was that by 2.50 pm he could see people were in distress. A t about 2.55 pm he and others
called to a senior police officer at the top o f the steps to the control box to draw his attention to the crushing. M r
Hicks was only about 10 feet from the officer. He described him as wearing a flat cap with gold or silver braid
and a light coloured anorak. M r Hicks believed he was the officer who stopped the match. M r Greenwood, who
did stop the match, was certainly not wearing a light coloured anorak, as can clearly be seen on the video.

   3. M r Hicks says that he and others shouted several times to this officer in attempts to alert him to the
distress in the pens. There was no reaction although M r Hicks believes the officer must have been in earshot.

   4. T h at officer descended from the steps and two cameramen whom M r Hicks believed were from
television came and appeared to direct their cameras towards the pens. Another senior officer appeared two
steps down from the platform. H e was a stocky figure; he also wore a flat cap but w ith black braid. M r Hicks
says that he and two or three others tried several times to capture this officer’s attention without success. Then
M r Hicks says heshouted “ For Christ’s sake! Can’t you see what’s goingon?W ecan,andyou havecameras”.T h e
officer is said to have replied dismissively “Shut your fucking prattle”.

  5. W hen the disaster occurred the two Hicks girls were crushed. V ictoria was put in an ambulance and M r
Hicks accompanied her to hospital where she was found to be dead. Sarah died at the ground.

   6. M r Hicks was an impressive witness and, despite his grievous loss, remarkably stoical. H e gave his
evidence clearly and without rancour. H e was certainly mistaken about M r Greenwood being one o f those on
the steps and it has not been possible to identify either officer from M r Hicks’ descriptions. H e may well also
have been imprecise as to timings. Nevertheless. I see no reason to doubt that what he described d id occur in
relation to two officers. As M r Hicks generously said himself, the dismissive abuse from the second officer
(although reprehensible) may have been due to his being preoccupied with trying to see what was happening at
pens 3 and 4 around kick-off time.

The Goalkeeper and Gate 4
  7. M r Bambrock, a Liverpool supporter, said he went through the tunnel. H e would have liked to have
turned back when he saw how crowded the pens were. He went with his fa*1"“ ra n d 13 year old brother Stephen
towards the front o f pen 4. He saw the teams come onto the pitch. Condit n'-.s at the front were, he said, alright
until about 2 minutes to 3. Then the pressure in the pen increased and he and his father became separated. H is
feet came o ff the ground. H e shouted to police officers through the fence to get them out and help them. The
police did not react. The Liverpool goalkeeper, Bruce Grobbelaar. spoke to a policeman on the track. T h e gate
was then opened by a blonde policewoman and about 25 to 30 people went through it. They included the
witness’s father and his brother Stephen who had a broken arm . A police Constable shut the gate. It was then
reopened by the same policewoman, the witness thought, and he got out.

  8. M r Eccleston. a male nurse and an impressive witness, was sitting in the north stand. H e noticed pens 3
and 4 were full and realised something was wrong when fans started coming over the perimeter fence but did
not invade the pitch. He said the Liverpool goalkeeper appeared to notice this too.

 9. M r Grobbelaar was out o f the country during the Inquiry and was therefore not called. However, he
made a statement which was put in as his evidence. In the course o f it he said:-

  “ K ic k -o ff happened and we got into our stride pretty quickly - we forced a corner pretty early on and the ball
  came down to my end - I rolled it out tb the full back once and play went on until Peter Beardsley hit the
  crossbar o f the N ottingham Forest goal from a corner and came back into play. I remember just after that
  there were shouts and screams from the crowd just behind me, it was different; not the ordinary crowd noise
  and I turned around to look. W hat amazed me first was the concentration and squash o f fans in the centre



                                                           63
section, the end areas still had plenty o f space. It was only then I became conscious that the crowd was
squashing forward and wasn’t able to go sideways and that’s when I noticed the fencing alongside them
holding them in. I saw fans being pulled up into the stand above the terraces. I saw fans climbing over into the
empty areas at the side and I saw fans clim bing out over the front onto the pitch which was particularly
difficult because o f the spikes on the top o f the fencing but they were getting out.
   "Play was still going on and I was in a terrible position trying to concentrate on play and having my
attention taken by what was happening behind me. The ball came down to our end and Nottingham Forest
won a corner, it was taken and we cleared our box area and as play was going forward over the centre line I
heard a shout, ‘Bruce - please help’ - a desperate shout from a fan squashed up against the fencing to the
right o f my goal as I looked at Leppings Lane terraces. H e screamed, ‘Please get the fucking gate open - Help,
help’. All the people who could speak were pleading for help. There were two policemen near the gate right
alongside the fan who had shouted to me and so I shouted to them, ‘G et the gate open’. I was still trying to
concentrate on play and was still having my attention taken by what was happening behind me - there were
lots o f fans on the pitch behind the goal area by them too. I called again to the policemen, ‘Open the fucking
gate’ and one just turned away from me and looked back at the crowd but the other went to the gate and
opened it and it was like taking the top o ff a shaken coke bottle - people were everywhere on the play area
around my goal. Play was still going on and it came down towards me again for the left hand comer. I t was
a N ottingham Forest throw-in, away to my left, the ball was out o f play and a fan came up to me on the
pitch and said, ‘Bruce, they’re killing us’. I said ‘W h o ’s killing you?’, and he said ‘T hey’re crushing us-our
fans’. I said ‘G o and get some help’, and then a policeman came on and spoke to this fan. I don’t know
who the fan was, and then he led him o f f It was about this tim e I saw a policeman running onto the pitch
from my right across my box and to the referee who blew up, recovered the ball and told all players to clear
the pitch.”
    10. It is clear from the video that M r Grobbelaar's recollection o f the sequence o f events, even w ith regard
to the game, is inaccurate in a number o f respects. For example, the two Nottingham Forest com er kicks
occurred minutes before Beardsley struck the bar. Further, it seems highly probable from other evidence that
gates 3 and 4 were open continuously well before M r Grobbelaar says the fan asked him to get the gate open. It
seems surprising too that w ith all the noise M r Grobbelaar would hear the precise words o f an individual fan,
let alone respond twice to them, whilst the game was in progress.

   11. As to M r Bam brock’s account, the evidence o f PC Fiona Richardson was that she was the only
policewoman on the track in the early stages although others came from the seated area as the incident
developed. PC Richardson began at gate 1 and. although she did go and help people out through gate 3, she
did not go to gate 4, and did not open it twice or even once. The two officers who spoke o f opening gate 4 were
both male.
  12. I think M r Grobbelaar did become conscious o f distress in the crowd behind h im and did speak to a
police officer at some stage, probably earlier than he now thinks. N o t to reach that broad conclusion would
involve attributing his whole account to invention or fantasy and I see no grounds for doing so. However, his
detailed account was not tested in cross-examination and its inconsistencies and errors when compared with
other incontrovertible evidence would make it unsafe to derive more than the broad conclusion stated above.
The incident shows how honest witnesses can become confused and their evidence flawed when recollecting
events experienced under tension or emotion.
   13. As to the opening o f gate 4 there was an apparent conflict o f evidence. PC Illingw orth said that about
five minutes to 3 he opened it and guided fans emerging through it to gate 5. PC Hooson said that it was he
who opened gate 4 just before kick-off. I am satisfied from the evidence o f a number o f fans that, like gate 3,
gate 4 was opened more than once. The probability is. therefore, that whilst PC Illingw orth was shepherding
fans to gate 5, gate 4 had been closed again until it was re-opened by PC Hooson two or three minutes later.

Oxygen
   14. It was alleged by a doctor that an oxygen cylinder provided to him on the pitch was empty. D r Phillips, a
Liverpool supporter, had been in pen 3 with his brother and others. H e came under pressure and climbed into
pen 2. W hen the disaster occurred and gate 2 was opened, he went through it, injuring his head as he did so. He
came onto the pitch sometime after 3.10 pm and started resuscitation procedures. H e was given an oxygen
cylinder. He believes this was from St John Ambulance. It was, he thought, too early to be the fire service. The
cylinder was switched on but D r Phillips says it gave no oxygen since it was empty. There was one oxygen
cylinder on the St John’s ambulance which came to the scene. M r Wells, the Divisional Superintendent o f St
John, took that cylinder onto the pitch. He said it was effective. In particular, he recalls going to a patient being
treated by D r Phillips and says that oxygen was flowing into that patient. Moreover, M r Wells tested the
cylinder afterwards and found it was still h alf full. It has a capacity that will last for 5 hours 40 minutes on a
high setting.


                                                         64
   15. There was evidence from Assistant C h ie f Fire O fficer Hornsby that a M axam an resuscitator had failed
to work properly. It was delivering an oxygen flow appropriate to a “child” setting rather than a full “adult”
flow. On exam ination, it was found that a retaining nut in the control knob had worked loose, possibly due to
vibration in transit, and this had affected the flow o f oxygen. The device had last been tested on 10 A p r il! 989.

   16. I accept the evidence o f M r Wells that the St John Ambulance cylinder was charged with oxygen and
working properly. In my view, D r Phillips may have been mistaken as to the cylinder o f which he complains
being empty. He agreed he was under great pressure, in an awkward situation; his head was injured and he
became very angry at what he regarded then as wholly the fault o f the police. H e conceded that i f the cylinder
was not em pty there was a possible alternative - that the master tank top valve was shut. It seems unlikely that
he could have been referring to the fire service resuscitator as he was clear that the bottle he received was a
simple piece o f equipment not designed to breathe for the patient but merely to supply oxygen.

  17. I conclude that on a balance o f probabilities the evidence does not justify a finding that an empty
cylinder was brought to the scene.

C alling the Fire Service
   18. PC Bichard’s call to police Headquarters at 3.13 pm for the fire service to bring hydraulic cutting
equipm ent to cut metal fences (see paragraph 101 supra) was heard by C h ie f Inspector Edmundson. H e went
into the adjacent operations room to give instructions for the message to be passed to the fire service. There, a
tem porary control room assistant was already speaking to the fire service about a house fire. M r Edmundson
interrupted the call and asked the assistant to tell the fire service that cutting equipment was wanted at
Hillsborough. There followed a conversation between the assistant and Miss Davies at the fire service in the
following term s:-
  Police          Can we have cutting gear for Hillsborough, please - straight away?

  Fire Control    Just a minute. Right - what’s the address?

  Police          Cutting equipment for Hillsborough football ground - straight away.

  Fire Control    Hillsborough football ground?

  Police          Yes, Hillsborough football ground.

  Fire C ontrol   W hat road is that on? D o you know?

  Police          There has been a m ajor accident, all the ambulances are up there.

  Fire Control    W hat road is it on?

  Police          I have no idea; Hillsborough football          ground.

  Fire Control    W hat road is it on? D o you know?
  Police          “ Hillsborough football ground - what road is it on?” (this was said to someone in Police
                   Force Control) - “ Penistone Road” (to Fire Control).

  Fire Control     Penistone Road.

   Police          Penistone Road, O K .

   Fire Control    Penistone Road, just a m inute - what’s exactly involved?

   Police          It ’s football, a big match, Liverpool v Notts Forest.

   Fire Control    Yes, but why do you want us; you said it was an R TA [Road Traffic Accident],

   Police          N o, no, no; m ajor incident inside the ground.

   Fire Control    M a jo r incident inside - do you know exactly what it is?

   Police         No, 1 don’t; they want all the cutting gear.

   Fire Control    For what - do you know?

   Police          Hang on a sec.
   A t that poini C hief Inspector Edmundson intervened and spoke for the police. The conversation
 concluded:-

   Police          (M ale voice) - Hello!



                                                          65
  Fire Control    Hello! Now you wnt some cutting gear - what exactly is it for?

  Police          There has been a m ajor accident at Hillsborough football ground where the semi-final is:
                  the crowds have forced their way in, they have broken fences and gates down. I don't know
                  exactly what it is but there are people trapped.

  Fire Control    Right! O K - leave it with us.

  T h at conversation took 1 m inute 13 seconds. It was published in a number o f newspapers with strong
critical comment mostly against the fire service. The thrust o f the criticism was that valuable tim e was wasted
by the fire service asking unnecessary questions as to where and why cutting equipment was required.

   19. There was a meeting o f the emergency services in August 1988 to discuss procedure in the event o f a
m ajor disaster at Sheffield Wednesday’s ground. It was pointed out and minuted that “ It was im perative that
the Police C ontrol give the exact location o f any fire or incident and as much detail as possible. N o senior fire
officer is on duty at the match. . . Fire service w ill attend via Penistone Road or Leppings Lane as directed by
the police.”

   20. The message from PC Bichard contained all the necessary inform ation - Leppings Lane end, hydraulic
cutting equipment, to cut metal fences. Regrettably, it was not passed on by Headquarters in those terms. Miss
Davies had rightly been trained to require a precise location and needed to know the problem which would face
the fire service so that the appropriate response could be made. In fact, there are several football grounds in the
Hillsborough district although clearly Sheffield Wednesday’s ground is the principal one. In the result,
although C h ie f Inspector Edmundson clarified, to an extent, the nature o f the problem, the locus which
emerged in the course o f the conversation (Penistone Road) was not that contained in the original message
from ground control (ie “ Leppings Lane end.”) W hilst on the face o f the conversation the fire service may seem
to have been slow in the uptake o r perhaps pedantic, in my view the police ought to have been more specific.
They had the necessary inform ation to be so.

  21. I am satisfied, however, that the delay o f 1 minute 13 seconds over the call, and even the delay
occasioned by the cutting equipment going to Penistone Road rather than Leppings Lane, did not affect the
outcome. Even had those with cutting equipment gone directly after a briefer ’phone call they would not have
arrived at a stage early enough to make cutting the fencing a helpful exercise.

M r Kenny Dalglish
  22. When the Liverpool manager went to the control room and agreed to make the announcement
broadcast at 3.56 pm, he says in a statement that he could not get the Tannoy to work. Spectators could see
him trying to address them and indicated to him manually that nothing could be heard. An officer pressed
buttons on the machine and M r Dalglish says he tried again with sim ilar lack o f success. H e was then taken
under the police box to the room used by the disc jockey to broadcast pre-match music. There, the microphone
worked and he broadcast his message.

   23. M r Dalglish was not called. There was no other evidence about this incident. 1 accept it occurred as he
described. W hy the Tannoy could not at that tim e be successfully operated from the police box is, however,
strange and unexplained. U n lik e the radio, it had operated satisfactorily from the police box at the critical
times save that its messages may not always have been heard above the prevailing noise. It had worked at about
3.30 pm when it called for medical staff. I can see no grounds for criticising the police in regard to this incident
and certain it is that the b rie f delay in relaying M r Dalglish’s message can have had no significant effect.

                                         FIN A L REPORT O F INQ UIRY

                                                   IN TR O D U C TIO N

  1. On 17 April 19891 was appointed by your predecessor, the Rt H o n D ouglas Hurd CBE, M P to carry out
an Inquiry w ith the following terms o f reference:

  “To inquire into the events at Sheffield W ednesday Football G roun d on 15 April 1989 and to m ake
  recom m en dation s about the needs o f crowd control and safety at sports events.”

  2. Two Assessors were ap pointed to assist me: Mr Brian Joh nson CBE, Q PM , DL, C h ie f Constable o f
Lancashire, and Professor Leonard M aunder OBE, BSc, P h D , S cD , FEng, FI M ech E, Professor o f M echanical
Engineering at the U n iversity o f N ew castle upon Tyne.

  3. T h e first stage o f the Inquiry was primarily concerned with the investigation o f events at Hillsborough
Stadium on 15 April 1989 w hen 95 p eop le were crushed to death at a Cup sem i-final match between Liverpool
and N ottin gh a m Forest.

   4. O ver 31 days between 15 M ay and 2 9 June, I heard oral evidence from 174 witnesses at a public hearing
in Sheffield. I also received m uch written evidence by way o f su bm issions and letters.

  5. O n 1 August 1989 I presented an Interim Report setting out m y findings as to how and why the disaster
occurred. Also, in accordance with your predecessor’s w ishes, I m ade interim recom m en dation s a im ed at
preventing any further disaster and im proving safety in the short term.

   6. T he Interim Report and its reco m m en dation s had o f necessity to be m ade quickly so that action could be
taken before the start o f the new football season due to open in m id August. D esp ite all the speed I could
muster, the recom m en dation s left very little tim e for pre-season action, especially in Scotland where the
fixture list started earlier than in England and Wales. I m ust pay tribute to the clubs, local authorities, police
and other services for responding so prom ptly and for im plem en ting the recom m en dation s so wholeheartedly.

   7. In m y Interim Report I indicated that it w ould be necessary to conduct wider and deeper investigations
before delivering a Final Report on the needs o f crowd control and safety for the future. Accordingly, I invited
and have considered a large num ber o f written su bm issions describing present practices and problem s and
suggesting future changes. Th ose who have contributed are listed at Appendix 1 . 1 am extrem ely grateful to all
o f them for their tim e and their views. I expect there are a num ber o f contributors and correspondents w ho
m ay look in vain for co m m en t on each and every point they have raised. I hope they will understand that tim e
and space make it necessary to be selective and to have regard to the m ain issues.

  8. I have also had num erous informal m eetings with those representing relevant public bodies, clubs and
spectator interests. T h ese have been conducted as private d iscussion sessions rather than hearings o f oral
evidence thereby enabling controversial issues to be explored and theories tested.

  9. In all o f this I have co n tinu ed to be assisted by the two Assessors. Each holds a professional ap poin tm ent
carrying heavy responsibility and I am deeply grateful to both for devoting so m uch tim e to assisting me. Their
contributions have been o f the highest value. W hile the sole responsibility for this report is m ine, I am
com forted in the knowledge that both Assessors agree with it.

   10. At my request, Professor M aunder chaired a Technical Working Party to review the technical aspects o f
the H o m e O ffice G uide to Safety at Sports Grounds (1986 edition), “T h e Green G u id e”. Each m em ber o f his
team has m uch relevant experience and the team was well qualified for its task. I am m ost grateful for the
co-operation and efforts o f each member. T h e Report o f the Technical Working Party is at A pp en dix 3.

   11. In the course o f the Inquiry, the two Assessors and I have between us visited 31 sports grounds. T hey are
listed at A ppendix 2. O f those, 24 were soccer grounds, but we also attended at grounds featuring Rugby
U n io n , Rugby League, cricket, ten n is^ n d golf. I wish to record our thanks to the club officials who so readily


                                                            1
and hospitably facilitated our visits; also to the officers o f local governm ent, the police and the em ergency
services w ho together with club officials conducted us round the grounds, explained their operations and
answered our questions fully and frankly. Seeing crowd control and behaviour before, during and after a match
from various sections o f the view ing areas was an essential source o f first hand knowledge. It brought alive the
written and oral reports we received.

   12. I should like to express my thanks to the H o m e Office team w ho have staffed this Inquiry so well. Mr
Robert W halley was appointed as its Secretary. H e has handled all the adm inistrative arrangements
im peccably and has given m uch invaluable ad vice and assistance on every aspect o f the Inquiry. H e was ably
and diligently assisted by Mr Jonathan Sweet, Mrs Margaret Wither, Mr Tony M oore, Mrs Kate H um phries
from the H o m e O ffice and my own Clerk Mr Ernest Pott. I also renew m y thanks to the West M idland s Police,
and, in particular, to Mr Geoffrey D ear Q P M , D L , LLB, the C h ief Constable, and Mr M ervyn Jones MSc,
Assistant C h ief Constable in full-tim e charge o f the investigation, w ho have co n tinu ed to provide m e with
helpful inform ation at this second stage o f the Inquiry.

  13. H aving m ade my findings as to the events at Hillsborough, I do not in this report say any m ore about
them save by way o f illustration. I am aware that inquests are still to be held, civil proceedings are in m otion
and the possibility o f criminal charges is under consideration. However, those are not matters for m e. I
therefore turn now to broader issues as prom ised in paragraph 304 o f m y Interim Report.

   14. M y terms o f reference are extrem ely wide. T h ey em brace crowd control and safety at sports events o f all
kinds. However, crowd problems are directly related to the nature o f the event and the num bers attending it.
Realistically, this m eans that attention needs to be concentrated on events w ithin the scope o f the Safety o f
Sports G round Act 1975 and the Fire Safety and Safety o f Places o f Sport Act 1987. Even m ore specifically, the
em phasis in this Report is especially upon football. T h e Hillsborough disaster and indeed other disasters
before it occurred in crowded football stadia. T h e num bers and the atmosphere at a football match have
created special problems such as overcrowding and m isb eh aviour not, so far, to b e found to a like degree
elsewhere.

   15. That football is a special case has been expressly recognised by the G overnm ent in p rom oting the
Football Spectators Act 1989. The Bill received the Royal Assent on 16 N o v em b er 1989. It had c o m m en ce d its
course through Parliament before the Hillsborough disaster. Expressly because o f that disaster and the setting
up o f this Inquiry it reached the statute book under unusual con d itions. It was always to be an enabling Act
w hose im plem en tation would require a Statutory Instrument. In order to have the provisions o f the Act in
place as soon as possible, the G overn m ent decided to proceed with it forthwith, notw ithstanding Hillsborough
and this Inquiry. That d ecision was subject to an undertaking to bring the matter back before Parliament on
two separate occasions. First, before the ap poin tm ent o f the Football M em bership A uthority under the Act;
secondly, to debate the schem e which the Act provides should be drawn up by that Authority.

   16. I was expressly told by your predecessor u pon m y ap poin tm ent that my terms o f reference included
consideration o f the national m em bership schem e provided for in the Bill. That was confirm ed on num erous
occasions by M inisters in the course o f the Bill’s passage through Parliament. It was m ade clear that although
the Act would be on the statute b ook before m y Final Report, Parliament would have the opportunity to
consider any observations I might m ake, including any about the national m em bership schem e. Thus, to take
only two exam ples, Mr N ich olas Ridley, then Secretary o f State for the Environm ent, said on the Second
R eading o f the Bill on 27 June 1989:

  “I began by referring to Lord Justice Taylor’s inquiry. I will em phasise again now what I said at the
  beginning. Parliament will have not on e but two opportunities to debate and vote on the national
  m em bership schem e after we have received the report and in the light o f any co m m en ts that Justice Taylor
  m ay m ake on the scheme. By proceeding with the Bill now, we can put the framework for the schem e in place
  and m ake it possible to m ove on rapidly with the schem e, if Parliament agrees that we should do so w hen it
  has seen what Lord Justice Taylor has to say.”
  (Official Report, colum n 850).

Secondly, at the C om m ittee stage on 6 July 1989, M r C olin M oynihan, the M inister for Sport, said:

  “I am certain that Lord Justice Taylor will feel in no way inhibited by consideration o f the Bill in our
  suggested format, because we specifically a m en ded the Bill to provide for the Secretary o f State’s approval o f
  the schem e after the final report     the Bill is am en d ed to enable the H ouse to consider in detail the
  recom m en dation s before we establish the Football M em bership Authority to draw up the sc h e m e          To
  hypothesise on whether Lord Justice Taylor is in favour o f a national m em bership schem e or whether he


                                                          2
  m ay not even co m m en t on it, is totally irrelevant because the Bill provides for the H ouse o f C o m m o n s and
  H ouse o f Lords to consider the report before setting up a Football M em bership Authority.”
  (Official Report, colu m n 56).

   17. It m ust be a rare i f not unique situation for a judge, ap pointed to conduct an Inquiry, to have w ithin his
remit consideration o f the m erits and provisions o f an A ct o f Parliament already L. place. It cannot be for a
judge to opine upon the w isd o m or terms o f an A ct expressing the established will o f Parliament. But, where
Parliament has passed an Act in such terms and upon such undertakings as expressly to provide that the
Inquiry judge be uninhibited in com m en ting upon it and that Parliament should have the opportunity to
consider his co m m en ts in further debate, then I con ceiv e it to be his duty to express his views. M y doing so
should not be interpreted as showing any lack o f the respect and deference due to Parliament. N o t to do so,
against the background I have described, w ould surely be thought surprising i f not pusillanimous.

   18. In Part I o f this Report I state som e lessons to be learnt from Hillsborough, ex am in e the state o f football
today and propose a range o f measures to give it a better future. In Part I I I consider, in detail, measures to
improve safety at sports grounds. Part III is concerned with crowd control at sports grounds and various
strategies for dealing w ith hooligans. In Part IV I consider the provisions o f the 1989 Act regarding the national
m em bership schem e. Finally, at the end o f the text, I set o u t m y R ecom m en dation s. So as to avoid confusion, I
have not set out m y Interim R eco m m en dation s for the purpose o f com parison. Hardly any excisions have been
m ade. Where I have d ecided to repeat or a m en d the Interim R ecom m en d a tio n s, they are included in the single
list o f Final R eco m m en d a tio n s. I hope this Report and the Final R ecom m en d a tio n s m ay be instrumental in
prom oting better and safer co n d itions at sports grounds in the future.

                                                   CHAPTER 1


                          THREE SO M BR E L E SSO N S AFTER H ILLSBO R O U G H

i. Previous Reports Unheeded
   19. It is a depressing and chastening fact that m ine is the ninth official report covering crowd safety and
control at football grounds. After eight previous reports and three ed ition s o f the Green G u id e, it seem s
astounding that 95 people could die from overcrowding before the very eyes o f those controlling the event. In
January 1986, Mr Justice Popplewell, w hose report following the Bradford D isaster was the eighth in the
series, sum m arised those o f his seven predecessors. The Shortt Report o f 1924 followed disorder at the Cup
Final o f 1923. T he M oelw yn Hughes Report o f 1946 followed the disaster at Bolton Wanderers ground when
overcrowding caused 33 deaths. In 1966 the G overnm ent co m m ission ed the Chester Report on “The State o f
A ssociation Football”. The Harrington Report o f 1968 drew attention to problem s o f crowd behaviour and led
to the Lang Report o f 1969 on the sam e subject. In 1972, Lord W heatley’s Report on Crowd Safety at Sports
G rounds followed the disaster at Ibrox Park where 66 spectators died. T he M cElhone Report o f 1977 on
Football Crowd Behaviour o f Scottish supporters was co m m issio n ed by the Secretary o f State for Scotland. In
1984 an Official Working Group on Football Spectator V iolence set up by the D epartm ent o f E nvironm ent
presented a further report.

  20. As a result o f the W heatley Report, the first edition o f the Green G u id e was issued in 1973, and
Parliament passed the Safety o f Sports Grounds Act 1975. A secon d edition o f the Green G u id e was issued in
1976 and a third edition in 1986 incorporated recom m en dation s m ade by Mr Justice Popplewell.
V
    21. Introducing his excellent and concise sum m ary o f the previous reports, Mr Justice Popplewell said:

    “alm ost all the matters into w hich I have been asked to inquire and alm ost all the solutions I have proposed,
    have been previously considered in detail by m any distinguished Inquiries over a period o f 60 years”.

  Because his citations from those earlier reports are still highly relevant, I append his sum m ary o f them at
A ppendix 4.

   22. In m y Interim Report I set out what happened at Hillsborough and why. That it was allowed to happen,
despite all the accum ulated w isd om o f so m any previous reports and guidelines m ust indicate that the lessons
o f past disasters and the recom m en dation s following them had not been taken sufficiently to heart. I
appreciate how easy it is to criticise with hindsight and that a new situation can always arise in h um an affairs
which has not previously been envisaged. But m any o f the deficiencies at Hillsborough had been envisaged.

  23. T he M oelw yn Hughes Report in 1924 had stressed the need to start controlling the crowd well back
from the entrance to the ground. The Green G uide required that “Turnstiles should be o f such num bers as to
adm it spectators at a rate whereby no unduly large crowds are kept waiting for a d m issio n ” (paragraph 44).
Chapter 8 o f the G uide required “Arrangements should be m ade ... to contain pressures before they reach
dangerous proportions”. Chapter 16 laid down m ax im u m capacity w hich was grossly exceeded in the fatal
pens at Hillsborough. Both the Green G uide (Chapter 15) and Mr Justice Popplewell had stated the need for
gates in the perimeter fencing to be adequate to perm it escape on to the pitch in an emergency. W hy were these
recom m endations and others not followed? I suggest two m ain reasons. First, insufficient concern and
vigilance for the safety and well-being o f spectators. This was co m p ou n d ed by a preoccupation with measures
to control hooliganism . Secondly, com p lacency w hich led all parties to think that since disaster had not
occurred on previous occasions it would not happen this time. But there is no p oint in h olding inquiries or
publishing guidance unless the recom m en dation s are followed diligently. That m ust be the first lesson.

ii. “It Couldn’t Happen H ere”
  24. Amazingly, com placency was still to be found even after Hillsborough. It was chilling to hear the sam e
refrain from directors at several clubs I visite d :-

        “Hillsborough was horrible - but, o f course, it couldn’t have happened here.”

    Couldn’t it? T he Hillsborough ground was regarded by m any as on e o f the best in the country. It was selected


                                                          4
by the FA for the Cup sem i-final and thought by them to be entirely suitable. T he identical fixture had passed
o f f uneventfully the previous year. I have little doubt that if the disaster scenario had been described to the
m anagem ent at Hillsborough prior to 15 April, they too w ould have said “O f course, it couldn’t happen here”.
Yet so m ething like it had h appened at Hillsborough in 1981, albeit with less dire results. Moreover, I am
satisfied from eyewitness accounts I have received that there have been m any other occasions when
overcrowding has led, at various grounds round the country, to a genuine apprehension o f im pending disaster
through crushing, averted only by g ood fortune. I have heard from P olice C om m anders at a num ber o f the
grounds I have visited how relieved they are that capacities have been reduced in the interests o f safety.

  25. So, although the operational errors on 15 April were special to one ground and one day, the lack o f
precautions against overcrowding was not unique. I do not believe that sufficient safety measures were being
applied at all other grounds. The lesson here is that Hillsborough should not be regarded as a freak occurrence,
incapable o f happening elsewhere. All those responsible for certifying, using and supervising sports grounds
should take a hard look at their arrangements and keep doing so. C om placency is the enem y o f safety.

iii. A Blight on Football
  26. Football is our national game. We gave it to the world. But its image in our country has been m uch
tarnished. In m y Interim Report I concentrated on overcrowding because it was the cause o f the Hillsborough
disaster. But wider and deeper inquiry shows that overcrowding is only on e feature am ongst a num ber causing
danger or marring football as a spectator sport. T he picture revealed is o f a general m alaise or blight over the
gam e due to a num ber o f factors. Principally these are: old grounds, poor facilities, hooliganism , excessive
drinking and poor leadership. Crowd safety and crowd behaviour with w hich I am concerned are closely
related to the quality o f the acco m m od a tio n and facilities offered and to the standards which are encouraged
and enforced. So I think it necessary to consider all these aspects.

Old Grounds
   27. Because we were first into the field, m ost o f our football grounds are now elderly. Betw een 1889 and
1910, 58 o f the clubs belonging to the current League m oved into the grounds they now occupy.* M any o f
them are ill-placed on cram ped sites boxed into residential areas. W hen they were built, they were not intended
to cater for the stream o f coaches, vans and cars w hich now arrive and require parking space. Inside the
grounds decay and dilapidation are often extensive. The terrace a cco m m od ation, in particular, is often
uncovered and little has been d o n e to im prove the layout in accordance with m odern expectations. This is
chiefly because the safety and com fort o f those on the terraces has not been regarded as a priority. In fairness,
lim itations o f space at som e grounds make it very difficult to achieve a layout appropriate to present day
needs. By contrast, clubs in Europe and South A m erica have the advantage o f grounds built m ore recently on
m ore spacious sites and planned to m eet m odern conditions. W here im provem ents have been m ade to
our grounds they have often been patchy and piecem eal. This approach is itself a threat to safety. To build a
seated stand over a standing area, to enlarge or d ivid e a terrace, to rearrange exits and entrances or to m odify
turnstile areas - any o f these m easures is fraught with safety im plications. Yet often such changes have been
m ade to achieve one purpose w ithout sufficient thought about the adverse side-effects w hich cou ld result.

  28. This was exem plified by the sequence o f alterations at the Leppings Lane end at Hillsborough. Radial
fences were installed to d ivid e up the terraces; this led to a reduction in the system o f crush barriers. T he area
inside the turnstiles was altered for purposes o f segregation. Old signs were not removed; new signs were
inadequate. T he result was a bewildering com p lex w hich contributed to the delivery o f excessive numbers
dow n the tunnel into pens 3 and 4.

Poor Facilities
   29. Football spectators are in vited by the clubs for entertainm ent and enjoyment. Often, however, the
facilities provided for them have been lamentable. Apart from the discom fort o f standing on a terrace exposed
to the elem ents, the ordinary provisions to be expected at a place o f entertainm ent are so m etim es not merely
basic but squalid. At som e grounds the lavatories are prim itive in design, poorly m aintained and inadequate in
number. T h is not only den ies the spectator an essential facility he is entitled to expect. It directly lowers
standards o f conduct. The practice o f urinating against walls or even on the terraces has b ecom e en d em ic and
is followed by m en w ho w ould not behave that way elsewhere. T he police, w ho w ould charge a m an for
urinating in the street, either tolerate it in football grounds or do no m ore than give a verbal rebuke. Thus
crowd con d uct b ecom es degraded and other m isbehaviour seem s less out o f place.

   30. T he refreshments available to supporters are often lim ited and o f indifferent quality. T hey are sold in

surrounding streets from m obile carts and inside m any grounds from other carts or from shoddy sheds. Fans
eat their hamburgers or chips standing outside in all weathers. There is a prevailing stench o f stewed onions.
Adequate numbers o f bins for rubbish are often not available; so wrappings, containers and detritus are sim ply
dropped. This inhospitable scene tends to breed bad m anners and poor behaviour. T h e atm osphere d oes not
encourage pride in the ground or consideration for others. I accept that m any fans are quite con ten t to eat on
the h o o f w hen visiting a match, but there is no reason why the fare available should n o t be w h o leso m e, varied
and decently served from clean and attractive outlets. Fast food establishm ents m eeting these requirements
are readily to be found at railway stations and on high streets; why not at football grounds?

   31. At m ost grounds little attem pt has been m ade to provide pre-match entertainm ent. To do so could have
a double advantage. It w ould give the spectators m ore value for their money. It could also bring them in earlier
thereby avoiding congestion at the turnstiles in the last few m inutes before kick-off. Such entertainm ent as has
been tried has m ostly failed to appeal to the spectators. They do not seem drawn by the m usical offerings o f the
disc jock ey or by m arching bands. T he football supporters’ organisations co m p lain that supporters have not
hitherto been m uch consulted about this or about anything else affecting their well-being and enjoyment.

   32. In giving this dism al account o f the football scene, I have taken care to use the words “often ”, “at m ost
grounds” or “at m any grounds”. I acknowledge that there are notable excep tions where great im provem ents
have been effected and I do not suggest that every disagreeable feature I have described is to be found at every
ground. N evertheless, the overall picture o f co n d itions and facilities to be expected by a standing spectator is
depressing. It is in stark contrast to the different world, only yards away, in the Board R o o m and the lucrative
executive boxes. I appreciate that they cater for an affluent clientele and bring in m uch-need ed revenue. N o
one w ould expect or indeed want their plush carpeting or haute cuisine w hen visiting the terraces; but
a ccom m od ation and facilities have often been below the basic decent standard necessary to give spectators
dignity let alone comfort.

  33. It is small wonder that attendances at m atches gradually fell o f f from a peak o f 77 m illio n in the season
1949/50 to about 20 m illion in the late 1980s. N o doubt other reasons played their part; for exam ple, the
emergence o f other spectator sports and television. U n til the 19 60s m ost m en worked on a Saturday morning
and m any went straight to the m atch in the afternoon. But the 5 day week together w ith increased car
ownership m ade Saturday outings for the fam ily a popular activity. On top o f these factors, however, the
prospect o f attending football in the con d itions I have described clearly becam e unattractive to m any erstwhile
supporters. A dded to this was the fear o f disorder. So far, I have not m en tion ed the further indignities endured
by supporters as a result o f h ooliganism and the m easures taken to contain it.

Hooliganism
   34. D uring the 1970s, hooligan behaviour b ecam e a scourge at and around football grounds. Rival fans
abused and fought with each other on the terraces. T he pitch was invaded, so m etim es to facilitate the fighting,
som etim es in an attempt to abort a m atch by those w hose team was losing and on occasions to display anger
and seek to assault a referee o r a player w ho had incurred displeasure. Throwing m issiles, either at a player or a
policem an or at rival fans, becam e another violen t feature. W hen the police responded by searching fans for
m issiles on entry, the practice grew o f throwing coins (which could not be confiscated). S om etim es the coins
were sharpened in advance to make them m ore damaging.

  35. Mass singing o f traditional songs, so m e o f nation-w ide appeal, som e local to the area or the club, had
becom e a part o f the terrace culture. But the repertoire becam e augm ented and degraded by abusive and
obscene chants aim ed at the referee or the op posing fans. A further nasty addition was racist chanting aim ed at
any black player o f either team.

   36. H ooliganism outside the ground also becam e rife. Supporters o f rival team s abused and attacked each
other. H ooligan gangs caused dam age to trains, to buses, and to property on their route. S om e deliberately
went out o f their way to rampage through local shops, stealing, wrecking and intim idating as they w ent - an
activity known as “steam ing” . After a m atch, rival supporters w ould attack each other on the way h o m e in the
street, in public transport or in public houses.

Segregation
   37. To contain and control these m anifold form s o f anti-social and crim inal behaviour there is now an
elaborate co m p lex o f measures. T he policy o f segregation was born in the 1970s. Gradually, it has called for
more and m ore extreme and expensive strategies by the clubs and the police. As each m easure taken has been
circum vented by determ ined hooligans, further m easures have had to be grafted on to the system. W itnessing
the full florid exercise taking place every Saturday afternoon nowadays makes on e w onder how anyone could
have contem plated going to such lengths to facilitate the watching o f football. But nobod y did; it just grew.


                                                           6
   38. Clubs have sub-divided their grounds to keep rival fans apart by putting fencing and sterile areas
between them , by screening them from inciting each other, by separate entrances and exits and by perimeter
fences round the pitch. M any o f the fences are very high and are crowned with elaborate spikes and barbed
wire, the top sections being inclined inwards to prevent their being scaled. At som e grounds a telescopic tunnel
is extend ed on to the pitch to protect the team s from m issiles as they co m e on or go off.

   39. T h e police start and finish their segregation exercise well away from the ground. Typically, special trains
or coaches carrying the away supporters are m onitored en route. T he police m eet them and escort the fans with
m oun ted officers, dog handlers and foot officers, ensuring they go only to their allotted section o f the ground.
They are searched at the entrance for drink or weapons (as are the h o m e fans). T hey are then co n fined in an
area caged by fencing for the duration o f the match. W hen it ends, the away supporters are often held back for a
quarter to h a lf an hour whilst the h o m e supporters are dispersed. T hey are then escorted away in the sam e
m anner as they arrived and put back on to their trains or buses. Although the m ain body o f away supporters
can thus be p oliced as a group, those w ho arrive independently in cars or vans have freedom o f m anoeuvre.
O ccasionally trouble makers get into the w rong area and a v iolen t ep isod e occurs. Again, the further away from
the ground the spectators spread, the less the police can do to prevent sporadic confrontations. By and large
however, the police measures have worked to prevent v io len t outbursts in and around the ground.

  40. But at what a price! In addition to the poor facilities I described earlier (which are often worse for away
than for h o m e fans) the ordinary law-abiding football supporter travelling away is caught up in a police
operation rem iniscent o f a colum n o f prisoners o f war being marched and detained under guard. I w atched the
escort o f Arsenal fans after a m atch at Stam ford Bridge. T h ey were held in the ground for thirty-five m inutes
while the C helsea supporters left. T hey were then escorted by a substantial body o f p olice to Fulham Broadway
underground station. There, to avoid overcrowding on the platform, they were adm itted to the station only in
m easured groups. Special trains were run to take them non-stop into the centre o f the city to a void clashes at
nearby stations.

   41. Clearly, the p olice w ith their great experience o f controlling crowds at the ground considered this
strategy was necessary in the present climate. T heir views were confirm ed in that despite their efficient and
good hum oured m anagem ent o f th e m atch and its aftermath, scuffles took place when som e fans got into the
wrong section o f the ground. M oreover such police practice is not unique to our country. There are sim ilar
hooligan problem s for exam ple in Holland. I w itnessed a very sim ilar operation carried out by the D utch
police at U trecht to control a train load o f supporters from Eindhoven.

  42. N ecessary though such operations m ay presently be, they do nothing to enhance the image o f football as
a spectator sport followed for entertainm ent and pleasure. I know o f n o other sport or entertainm ent in a
civilised country in w hich it is necessary to keep those attending from attacking each other.

    43. Apart from their im pact on the spectator, operations to control football crowds have other serious
repercussions. T he cost in money, m anpower and disruption is enorm ous. Last year, the cost o f policing
football in L ondon was som e £ 1 0 m illion o f which only £1 m illion could be recovered from the clubs.
According to the Football Trust, w ho m eet one third o f the costs o f police charges incurred by clubs at m atches
for the Football League, Scottish Football League and G M Vauxhall Conference, the cost to clubs during
 1 9 88/89 was £ 4 .7 9 m illion. Since this relates only to costs inside grounds w hich can be recovered by the police,
the total cost to the p olice service is substantially more. H er M ajesty’s C h ief Inspector o f Constabulary for
England and Wales said, in his annual report for 1988, that:-

  “Football continues to be a focus for h o o lig a n ism ... d em a n d s on the police service con tinu ed at a high level.
  T yp ically 5 0 0 0 officers m ay be engaged on football duties on Saturdays during the football season.”

  T he H o m e Office estim ate that the total cost o f deploying these officers is perhaps £ 2 0 0 ,0 0 0 to £ 3 0 0 ,0 0 0
each football Saturday. At m any League m atches, policing requires som e 300 officers in the ground with many
m ore outside and others performing related traffic duties. At high risk m atches, Cup semi-finals and the like,
even greater numbers are deployed. At Hillsborough there were 800 officers in and around the ground.
O bviously officers deployed to football cannot be performing police duties elsewhere. Although m any are
brought in on an overtim e basis (at a con sequ en tly heavier cost) police com m itm en ts to the com m u n ity
elsewhere m ust be affected by the concentration o f such num bers in one place.

  44. W hen upwards o f 4 0 ,0 0 0 converge on a ground in a residential area the effect on the local com m u n ity is
very disagreeable. Large num bers o f fans chant in the streets, often offensively. T hey invade gardens to urinate.
Em pty cans and other garbage are dropped in gardens, yards and in the street. Shops m ay be pillaged. Traffic is


                                                              7
congested or diverted. Streets are filled w ith parked coaches and cars. Side-streets are cordoned o f f by p olice to
protect residents. Recently, a police cordon was thought necessary at a h a lf m ile radius round Highbury w hen
Liverpool visited Arsenal. Residents had to establish their identity. The operation was successful in preventing
disorder but the need to conduct such operations and the resultant disruption contributes to the p oor im age o f
football in the com m u n ity at large.

What does Segregation Achieve?
  45. Segregation, w hich is the m ain feature o f present crowd control policy, aim s only to contain and control
bad behaviour, n ot to elim inate it. Indeed, the very fact that rival fans are separated tends to increase and
polarise their hostility to each other. Segregation breeds an “us and th e m ” attitude. T he op posing supporters
can be seen as a physically distinct group upon w h o m a n im o sity can be focussed. Again, the knowledge that the
“en em y ” is physically restrained from v iolen t riposte m ay encourage baiting and abuse which caution w ould
otherwise deter. There is force too in the v iew that if people are herded and con fined as potential offenders,
that con cept m ay in so m e cases b ecom e self-fulfilling. So, although segregation m ay have appeared the only
way to m aintain the excitem en t o f the adversarial atm osphere at football grounds whilst keeping the peace, it
merely controlled the sym ptom s o f hooliganism . The disease rem ained and m ay even have been intensified by
the segregation. Other games have n ot resorted to it. For exam ple, there is no segregation at rugby league
m atches although the catchm ent sections o f population, from w hich support is drawn both to football and
rugby league, seem similar.

Who are the Hooligans?
    46. In chapter 5 o f his Final Report, Mr Justice Popplewell exploded three popular fallacies about
hooliganism . First that it is som ething new; secondly, that it is only found at soccer m atches and thirdly, that it
is a specifically English disease. H e went on to consider the nature o f football h ooliganism , the characteristics
o f the hooligan, possible causes o f hooligan behaviour and experience in other countries. I do n ot propose to
repeat his analysis. N o th in g has thrown any doubt on it in the four years since he reported although m uch has
been written by journalists, academ ics and others. I agree with him that there is no sim ple explanation for all
the m isbehaviour attached to football and there is no single remedy. It is important, however, to recognise the
clear distinction between quite different groups o f hooligans.

  47. There are those w ho m isbehave spontaneously in or around the ground in response to so m e perceived
grievance - a goal against their team , a doubtful decision o f a referee or taunting from others. But there are
other groups w ho go out bent on causing trouble for its own sake. T he latter were described by Mr Justice
Popplewell as “the new hooligans”. Often they hold down good jo b s during the week, dress stylishly and detach
them selves from those fans with club scarves w ho travel on official coaches or trains. They plan their v io len ce
as a recreation in itself to w hich the football is secondary or a mere background. Unfortunately, these groups
can fom ent trouble and galvanise support from fans w ho w ould n ot otherw ise m isbehave. Thus the effect o f
the “new hooligans” can grow out o f proportion to their numbers.

   48. Mr Justice Popplewell sum m arised his con clusions as to the nature and m otivation o f hooligan groups
at paragraph 5.90 o f his Final Report as follows:-

      “I (a) That there has always been a group, albeit a small group w ho find v iolen ce attractive; w ho
         currently find the football ground a con ven ient theatre for their vio len ce and the football m atch the
         occasion for the display o f their aggressive tendencies w hich on other days and at other tim es they will
         be exhibiting in public houses, the city centre or elsewhere. T heir m ain target at football grounds is
         op posing fans. They choose to exercise that violen ce at a football m atch for a num ber o f sim ple
         reasons. The date and place o f a m atch are fixed; the nature o f the op positio n is known; its presence is
         certain, so is that o f the police. Their own support is known. Its presence too is certain. The battle lines
         can be drawn. Thus plans can be m ade well in advance for the particular acts o f v iolen ce that they
         intend to create.

         (b) A nd w hile there is a good deal o f acad em ic support for the view that violen ce was at on e tim e the
         prerogative o f the so called “rough” working class that is no longer the com p lete picture today. A
         m ajority o f today’s hooligans no doubt do fit into that category, but som e do not. T hey co m e from a
         variety o f backgrounds, m any have reasonable jo b s and earn a proper living.

         (c) W hether they are m otivated by the sam e reasons as their predecessors can only be a m atter o f
         conjecture; there seem s little reason however to believe otherwise.

      II (a) A second group im itates the first elem ent I have identified. Thus those not particularly given to
         v iolen ce w itness violen ce in others and see it being exercised, w ith o u t let or hindrance. P eople expect


                                                           8
          the spectators on the terraces to behave in an aggressive way and to use foul language. It then
          beco m es accepted as the norm and thus b ecom es a part o f the pattern o f life w hich w ould not be
          tolerated elsewhere. This knock-on effect can be seen in v iolen ce in the streets o f our cities,
          u n conn ected w ith football.

          (b) T he feeling o f a n onym ity in the crowd gives rise to a loss o f inhibition and self-discipline. The
          association w ith those o f sim ilar disposition, the en thu siasm and th e partisan support for the team,
          w hich itself causes an atmosphere, all create a situation which can readily give rise to violence.

     III T h en there is a third group (not always separate from the other two groups) who cause v iolen ce for a
         reason, either real or supposed. It m ay be an inability quickly to get into the ground; it m ay be the
         presence o f rival spectators in a part o f the ground to which the fans think they have a claim.

     IV Finally there are those, the vast m ajority o f spectators, w ho abhor vio len ce and w ish only for an
        afternoon o f pleasure at a football m atch.”

  T h e oral and written evidence I have received, the studies and reports I have read on the subject and my
own observations lead m e to agree entirely with that summary. I w ould add only o n e further elem ent -
alcohol.

Alcohol
  49. There can be no doubt that an excited and volatile crowd is m ore difficult to control and m ore prone to
disorder if it includes num bers w ho have been drinking. D rink is n ot a m ajor factor affecting Mr Justice
Popplewell’s group I. Their v iolen ce tends to be planned coldly and soberly. But group II is often rendered
disorderly and m ore readily im itates the v iolen ce o f others because inhibitions are removed by drink.
Likewise, group III responds to a grievance, is readier to take offence and reacts m ore im pu lsively and
violently because o f drink.

   50. D rinking before m atches increased in parallel with the growth o f hooliganism . Before the 5 day week,
those co m in g straight from work to the football ground on a Saturday had little tim e to drink excessively.
During the 1960s and 1970s young m en in their twenties acquired a new affluence and spending on drink
increased. T he advent o f the supermarket with an off-licence provided num erous outlets for the sale o f
canned beer; so it becam e easy to have alcohol at the match and on the way to it, whether the local pubs were
open or not. Finally, apart from tim e and liquor being available, there has developed an attitude to drinking
in the U K n ot found to the sam e extent elsewhere - a cult o f drinking to excess. The spectacle o f young fans,
tanked up with beer, whether near our own football grounds or (m ore damagingly to our reputation abroad)
at foreign football stadia is all too familiar. Yet, for exam ple in Italy, the largest w ine producing country in
Europe, football fans and indeed people generally do not drink to get drunk. Although they have their own
brand o f h ooliganism (from the “U ltras” as they are known) alcohol is not a major factor. Here it certainly is
and it rem ains so despite legislation banning sales or possession o f alcohol in football grounds and the
carrying o f alcohol on public service and hired vehicles bound for such grounds.

Poor Leadership
  51. T h e hierarchy inside football has a num ber o f levels over and above the spectators. At the top is the
national m anagem ent o f the game. In England the Football A ssociation is responsible for the adm inistration
and welfare o f all football down to the lowliest am ateur club and football in schools. T he Football League is a
separate b ody with responsibility for the 92 professional League clubs. In Scotland and Wales there are
equivalent bodies. Below that top m anagem ent, each o f the League clubs has its own Board o f Directors.
Then there are the referees, the managers and the players. Finally there are organisations representing the
supporters - the Football Supporters’ Association and the N ational Federation o f Football Supporters’ Clubs.
One would have h oped that the upper echelons in this hierarchy would have taken a lead in securing
reasonable safety and com fort for the spectators and in enforcing good behaviour by precept and exam ple.
Unfortunately, these hopes have not generally been realised and indeed at tim es poor exam ples have been set.

  52. T he FA and the FL have n ot seen it as their duty to offer guidance to clubs on safety matters. In their
written subm ission they said:-

  “O f course, both T he FA and The Football League are concerned to ensure that crowd safety standards are
  the highest reasonably practicable. It is felt, however, that neither o f these authorities should be charged
  w ith the responsibility o f setting detailed safety standards or enforcing th em .”


                                                          9
T hey have been m uch concerned to avoid pitch invasions because they interfere with the sm o oth progress
o f the fixture list and incur criticism and penalties from the European football authorities. But advice, for
exam ple, as to turnstile lay outs, the d ivision o f view ing areas and, until recently, on ratios o f seating to
standing areas has not been forthcoming. As another specific exam ple, in selecting Hillsborough as the venue
for the Cup semi-final, the FA did not consider in any depth whether it was suitable for a high risk m atch with
an attendance o f 54,000 requiring to be segregated, all o f w hom were, in effect, away supporters lacking week
in week out knowledge o f the ground. N o special inspection was made; no consultation w ith Sheffield
W ednesday or the local authority took place.

   53. As for the clubs, in so m e instances it is legitim ate to w onder w hether the directors are genuinely
interested in the welfare o f their grass-roots supporters. Boardroom struggles for power, wheeler-dealing in
the buying and selling o f shares and indeed o f w hole clubs som etim es suggest that those in volved are more
interested in the personal financial benefits or social status o f being a director than o f directing the club in the
interests o f its supporter customers. In m ost com m ercial enterprises, including the entertainm ent industry,
knowledge o f the custom er’s needs, his tastes and his dislikes is essential inform ation in deciding policy and
planning. But, until recently, very few clubs consulted to any significant extent with the supporters or their
organisations.

   54. Encouragement and indeed requirement o f good behaviour by the fans should be a prim e aim o f club
m anagement. Here again positive leadership has often b een lacking and on occasions counter-productive. It
cannot help to prom ote good behaviour if a club chairman has his photograph in the program m e presenting a
cheque for £ 7 5 0 by way o f recoupm ent to a club player fined that sum by the FA for m isb eh aviour on the
pitch. The sam e applies to another chairman w ho extended a VIP w elcom e to h o m e co m in g “supporters”
convicted o f m isbehaviour whilst attending a m atch in Greece, even if he was sceptical as to the fairness o f
the crim inal process.

   55. T hen there is what happens on the pitch itself. Long departed are Corinthian Casual standards;
accepting decision s o f the referee w ithout demur; affecting a m odest diffidence on scoring a sensational goal.
For m any years now referees’ d ecisions have been regularly challenged by spread arm s and entreaties; even an
unsensational goal has caused the scorer to be hugged and embraced all the way back to the centre spot. The
cool self-control o f Corinthian Casuals will never return. Perhaps we should not lam ent its departure since
there is no harm in a reasonable show o f jo y in success. But, m ore recently, things have gone further. On
scoring a goal a player nowadays often rushes straight towards the perimeter fencing and either affects to
climb it or, with fists raised and shaking, goes on his knees to excite response from supporters. Little has been
done to stop such dem onstrations w hich are calculated to hype up the fans into hysteria.

   56. At the other extrem e from dem onstrations o f jo y and triumph, v iolen ce on the field o f play by tackles
aim ed at opponents’ legs, stamping, elbowing and holding is co m m o n ly to be seen. U n til lately, the FA’s
response to such violence am ongst players has been weak. N egligible fines on offenders, w ithout penalty to
the clubs either in fines or loss o f points, have tended to discredit the FA’s discharge o f its disciplinary role. In
the last couple o f m onths, prom pted by a series o f much publicised incidents and by m edia criticism , a firmer
line has at last been adopted. T h ese incidents have involved v iolen t conduct by players o f f the ball. At the end
o f the match between N orw ich City and Arsenal on 4 N o vem b er 1989, a num ber o f players on both sides
were in volved in an incident when punches were exchanged. T he referee said he was not going to m ake any
report on the matter. T he FA initially an nou nced that i f there was no report from the referee there was
nothing they could do. However, wiser counsels prevailed; officials o f the FA saw the incident on v id eo and
decided to take action. In the result N orw ich City were fined £ 5 0 ,0 0 0 and Arsenal £ 2 0 ,0 0 0 . Other incidents
occurred w ithin days at three other grounds in volvin g vio len ce on the field between players and, in one
instance, managers.

   57. To com p lete this survey o f the present football m alaise, it is necessary to m en tion the m edia. Football
is highly newsworthy. For the World Cup, provision is being m ade at the San Siro stadium , M ilan for no fewer
than 5 ,000 journalists. In the d om estic U K scene, the long haul throughout the season to b ecom e League
cham pion s or Cup winners is followed not only by the m illions w ho actually attend m atches but by many
m illions more via the m edia. T hey watch gam es and listen to the pundits endlessly d iscussing them on
television; they read about them in the newspapers and they fill in the football pool cou p ons. So players and
spectators are exposed to constant scrutiny. W hen scuffles or fights occur, whether on the field or on the
terraces, they are inevitably witnessed by m illions and such incidents o f bad behaviour are aggregated into a
reputation tarnishing the national gam e as a w hole. W hen our supporters go to Europe, they are preceded by
this reputation. It is expected they will behave badly, so w hether they do so initially or not they are likely to
m eet a hostile reception from their counterparts. T hus incidents are provoked and the syndrom e continues.


                                                          10
   58.    I have sought in the broadest terms to identify those features w hich disfigure football today. But
d espite them , and despite the d ecline in attendances from the peak years, the gam e still com m and s m assive
public support and interest. Indeed, in the last couple o f years there has been so m e increase in attendances
for reasons to be explored later. After the horror o f Hillsborough and the analysis o f football’s troubles w hich
it has prom pted, the lesson is surely that now is the m o m e n t for the fullest reassessm ent o f policy for the
game. Accordingly, before considering detailed reco m m en dation s for securing a basic level o f safety and for
im proving crowd control, I think it appropriate to consider how the low standards described in this chapter
could be raised.

                                    A BETTER FU TU R E FOR FOOTBALL

   59. It is not enough to aim only at the m in im u m measures necessary for safety. That has been, at best, the
approach in the past and too often not even that standard has been achieved. W hat is required is the vision
and im agination to achieve a new ethos for football. Grounds should b e upgraded. Attitudes should b e m ore
w elcom ing. T h e aim should b e to provide m ore m odern and com fortable acc o m m od ation, better and m ore
varied facilities, m ore consultation with the supporters and m ore p ositive leadership. If such a policy is
im plem en ted it will not only im prove safety. There will also b e an im provem ent in behaviour, m aking crowd
control easier.

   60. At so m e clubs changes have already been m ade towards realising this n ew concept o f how football
should be. For exam ple, at Ibrox Park, scene o f the appalling disaster in 1971, there has been a total
transformation. T he old m ain stand rem ains and still has so m e standing areas in front o f it. But three new
stands have been built round the rest o f the ground. They are colourful, co n ven ient and are all-seating. They
are constructed so as to provide a covered concourse at first floor level running the length o f the stand. At the
rear o f that concourse throughout its length are m odern lavatories for both sexes. At the front are attractive
fast food service points offering a good range o f food and drinks (but no alcohol). T h e walls are clean; the
flooring is o f studded rubber. M o u n ted overhead, at regular intervals o f a few yards along the w hole
concourse, are television sets tuned to a sports program m e giving inform ation on the day’s fixtures, excerpts
from previous m atches and general sports coverage. T hese arrangements encourage fans to arrive in good
time, to have w h o leso m e refreshments in a clean and pleasant setting, to enjoy on the television the kind o f
pre-match entertainm ent w hich genuinely interests them , to visit a decent toilet, and then to walk up a few
steps to take their seats for th e match. All o f this is under cover and it is enjoyed not just by the affluent but by
the ordinary supporter. Significantly, the facilities are not abused. O ccasional graffiti do appear but are
w ip ed away promptly and the overall im pression is that if spectators are offered civilised con d itio n s they
co m e to respect them.

All-Seating
  61. There is no panacea w hich will achieve total safety and cure all problem s o f behaviour and crowd
control. But I am satisfied that seating d oes m ore to achieve those objectives than any other single m easure.

  62. It is o b vio u s that sitting for the duration o f the match is m ore com fortable than standing. It is also
safer. W hen a spectator is seated he has his own small piece o f territory in w hich he can feel reasonably
secure. H e will not be in close physical contact with those around him. H e will not be jostled or m oved about
by swaying or surging. Small or infirm or elderly m en and w o m en as well as young children are not buffeted,
sm othered or unsighted by larger and m ore robust people as on the terraces. T h e seated spectator is not
subject to pressure o f num bers behind or around him during the match. H e will not be painfully bent d ouble
over a crush barrier. T h o se m onitoring num bers will know exactly how m any are there w ithout having to
count them in or assess the density by visual impression. There will still, o f course, be scope for crowd
pressure on stairways whilst entering and especially w hen leaving, but involuntary and uncontrolled crowd
m ovem en ts occasion ed by incidents in the gam e are effectively elim inated.

  63. It is true that at m o m en ts o f excitem ent seated spectators do, and m ay be expected to, rise from their
seats. But the m o m e n t passes and they sit down again. I also recognise that seating is only regarded as m ore
com fortable than standing if cover is provided. T h e consensus is that, although standing on an exp osed
terrace on a wet day is disagreeable, sitting in the rain is worse. So, increased seating d oes require that cover
be provided.

   64. Apart from com fort and safety, seating has distinct advantages in achieving crowd control. It is
possible to have disturbances in a seated area and they have occurred, but with the assistance o f CCTV the
p olice can im m ediately zo o m in with a camera and pinpoint the seats occupied by the trouble-makers as well
as the trouble-makers themselves. Moreover, if num bered tickets are issued to nam ed purchasers, the police
have a further aid to identifying miscreants.

  65. N um bered tickets m atching num bered seats also help to identify forgeries. Forged tickets for standing
areas may not b e discovered. In the past, they sim ply led to inflated num bers on the terraces at all-ticket
matches. But there can on ly be o n e valid ticket for each num bered seat and the existence o f a forgery is
im m ediately exposed.


                                                          12
   66. T he ev id en ce I have received has been overw helm ingly in favour o f m ore seating acco m m o d a tio n . At
present, the ratio throughout the 92 League clubs in England and Wales is about two thirds standing to on e
third seated. But whilst m ost are in favour o f reversing that ratio, there are those who w ish to retain a
proportion o f standing room . A m ongst them are the FA and the football supporters’ organisations.
Essentially they deploy three arguments.

  67. T he first is an em otion a l o n e based on a desire to retain the traditional culture derived from the close
contact o f th e terraces. “M y grandfather stood here; m y father stood here with me; why shouldn’t I stand here
with m y son?” is a co m m o n ly expressed view. Moreover, to m any young m en the cam araderie o f singing
together, ju m p in g up and down, responding in unison to the n am ing o f the players, their em ergence on to the
pitch, the scoring o f a goal, an unpopular d ecisio n - all o f these are an integral part o f enjoying the match.
They like b eing part o f an am orphous seething crowd and do not wish to have each his own place in a seat.

   68. T he secon d argument is that con version to all-seating will reduce the numbers o f fans w ho can be
adm itted to the ground; so, m any w ould-be spectators will b e disappointed. T h is assum es a significantly
greater density being perm itted for standing places than for seating. It also assum es that the size o f present
crowds regularly exceeds projected all-seated capacity. But the FA’s ow n ev id en ce showed that during the
1 9 88/89 season the num ber o f occasions w hen attendances at League clubs exceeded projected all-seater
capacity ranged from nil to 16. T h e 16 attendances were at Liverpool, w ho have accepted the need for
all-seating. For only three clubs in the first and second d iv isio n s did the attendance exceed the projected
all-seated capacity on m ore than 10 occasions, and for 21 out o f 44 clubs in these two d iv isio n s the
attendance never exceeded the projected all-seated capacity. In on ly o n e case (Liverpool) was the average
attendance during the season in excess o f the projected all-seated capacity.

  69. Finally, cost. Spectators do n ot want to pay and, it is argued, m any could not pay the substantially
higher price o f a seat as against the cost o f standing.

  70. I am not con vin ced that the cherished culture o f the terraces is w holly lost w hen fans are seated.
Watching the m ore boisterous and dem onstrative sections at all-seater grounds, I have noted no absence o f
concerted singing, chanting, clapping or gesticulating in unison. T h e com m u n a l spirit is still there and finds
ready expression. To such extent as the seating lim its togetherness or prevents m ovem ent, that price is surely
worth paying for the benefits in safety and control.

   71. Moreover, the m axim um d en sity which experience now shows to be acceptable in standing areas tends
to take the force out o f the first two arguments. If standing density is little more than seating density, the
m elded m ass previously found on terraces b ecom es more diffuse and the intensity o f the togetherness
b ecom es little greater standing than sitting. Likewise, at such a density, the difference between the adm issible
numbers standing and sitting b eco m e marginal. It can be m ade up by having two or more tiers o f seating
where previously there was only on e tier o f standing.

   72. As to cost, clubs m ay well wish to charge som ewhat m ore for seats than for standing but it should be
possible to plan a price structure w hich suits the cheapest seats to the pockets o f those presently paying to
stand. At Ibrox, for exam ple, seating is £6, standing £4 - not a prohibitive price or differential.

T he Trend in the UK
   73. The superior safety o f seating has already persuaded a num ber o f clubs in the U K to convert their
terraces to seating either totally or predominantly. Following Hillsborough, Liverpool have an nou nced their
intention to adapt their fam ous Kop to seating. In Scotland, Aberdeen’s ground at Pittodrie b ecam e all-seater
in 1978; Clydebank followed suit; St Johnstone’s new ground at Perth is all-seated. W em bley stadium will
early in 1990 accom m od ate 8 0 ,0 0 0 spectators, all-seated.

   74. T h o se opposed to all-seating point out that previous attem pts to introduce it have m et with spectator
resistance. Coventry City was the first English club to install seating throughout its ground in 1981. In 1983
the club reverted to allowing 2 ,0 0 0 to stand. In 1985, after visiting fans o f M anchester City tore up seats and
used them as m issiles, the ground reverted to standing. Q u een ’s Park Rangers also m oved towards all-seated
a cc o m m o d a tio n but removed so m e seats under pressure from supporters.

   75. Since then, however, Hillsborough has happened; thinking has changed; responsible co m m en t by
 governm ent, football authorities and m edia has prepared the way for change. Moreover, there are now seats
 available w hich cannot be m anually torn and used as m issiles. T h ose at Utrecht, for exam ple, have
 survived intact for seven years despite usage and deliberate experim ental tests o f their strength.
   76. It is possible that in the early stages o f con version there m ay be instances o f fans standing on the seats
or in front o f them because they are used to standing or in order to register a protest, but I am satisfied that in
England and Wales as in Scotland and abroad spectators will b eco m e accustom ed and educated to sitting.
The evidence I have received shows that m ore recently, where seating has been installed, the fans have co m e
to accept and like it. At Ibrox Park, for exam ple, the seated areas are the m ost popular and tickets for them
sell in preference to those for standing. Significantly, trouble from m isbehaviour and physical injuries have
been reduced since m ost o f the crowd becam e seated. Such trouble and accidental injuries as still occur are
primarily in the rem aining standing areas. It is planned to convert them to seating in the near future.

Sir Norman Chester Centre Research
   77. T he Sir N orm an Chester Centre for Football Research, attached to the U n iversity o f Leicester, is
funded by the Football Trust. In N o v em b er 1989 the Centre undertook a survey o f registered m em bers o f the
Football Supporters’ A ssociation to discover the views o f com m itted football fans on a num ber o f the issues
after Hillsborough w hich are covered in m y Report. T he extension o f seating was on e such issue. N u m ero u s
questions were asked on a num ber o f different hypotheses. The Report states that substantial m ajorities in
the sample were in favour o f m aintaining the status quo on the seats/terraces balance at their own clubs.
However, the Report continues:

  “ 53.6% claim ed they would actually support the drive for more seating (sic) if they were reasonably priced
  and covered. T he addition o f these last two points - co n cession s o n price and cover - also seem ed to have
  dram atic effects in reducing levels o f op positio n to the prospects o f all-seated facilities as we shall see
  later”.

W hen all-seating was put to the sam ple there was a m ajority against it, but the Report goes on:

  “Finally, and perhaps significantly, o p p o sitio n in our sam ple to the introduction o f all-seated facilities
  d im inishes considerably w hen o n e introduces provisos on price and protection from the elem ents. W hen
  this is d one, m ore people in our sam ple support all-seaters than op p o se th e m .”

Europe
  78. The trend towards seating is even stronger in Europe and is now being driven by decrees o f both
national and European football authorities.

   79. In Italy the im m in en ce o f the 1990 World Cup com p etitio n has forced the pace o f progress. T h e Italian
Ministry o f the Interior decreed on 25 August 1989 that for open air facilities with a capacity o f m ore than
10,000 spectators at football gam es and for covered o n es with a capacity o f more than 4 ,0 0 0 spectators no
standing will be allowed after 30 April 1990. T h o se facilities must have only num bered seats each not less
than 0.45 metres wide. The San Siro stadium in M ilan will by then seat 8 5 ,00 0 spectators; the O lim p ico
stadium in R om e will seat 87.000.

  80. In Holland, U trecht’s ground built in 1982 has seating for 12,000 and standing room for 8,000. The
club already intended to convert the latter to seating. However, on 6 D ecem b er 1989 the D utch equivalent o f
the FA (the K N V B ) agreed with the D utch clubs to cut the standing capacity o f football grounds by 10% each
year over the next decade so as to render football stadia in the N etherlands in effect all-seater at the end o f the
1990s.

  81. In following this phasing H o lla nd ’s policy is in accord with a resolution presently under consideration
by UEFA (U n io n des A ssociations Europeennes de Football). T he resolution proposes that for the 1990/91
season only 80% o f the standing tickets m ay be sold, that figure to be reduced every season by 10% until 1999.

   82. FIFA (Federation Internationale de Football A ssociation) passed a resolution on 26 July 1989
providing that as from the prelim inary co m p etitio n for the 1994 World Cup (starting in au tu m n 1992)
“m atches m ay in principle only be played in all-seater stadia”. T he resolution went on “as from 1993 it will
be the duty o f the C onfederations and N ational A ssociations to hold high-risk matches in their zo n es only in
all-seater stadia.” High-risk m atches are defined under UEFA Regulations as follows:

     “I All UEFA final and semi-final ties o f the UEFA club co m p etitio n s as well as final tournam ent
        m atches o f the European Football C ham pionship.

     II W hen declared as such by UEFA on the basis o f previous incidents o f supporters o f o n e or both
        team s or o f other exceptional considerations.


                                                          14
     III W hen it is expected that visiting team supporters will exceed 10% o f stadium capacity or will exceed
         3 ,0 0 0 persons.

     IV W hen full capacity stadium is expected or m ore than 5 0 ,0 0 0 spectators present.

     V   W hen th e match is likely to attract a large num ber o f em igrants/foreign workers originating from the
         country o f the visiting team , w ho live either in the country where the m atch is being played or in
         neighbouring countries.”

   Thus world and European football authorities are clearly determ ined to enforce the conversion o f stadia to
all-seating, so far as international matches and other matches under their control are concerned. It is true that
their resolutions will not be binding in regard to League or dom estic football m atches. But they are a pointer
in the direction o f safety and control and as such have been em ulated by Italy and H olland domestically.

   83. Furthermore, I am told by the FA that they regard them selves as duty boun d to follow, in the d om estic
football scene, any R esolution passed by FIFA although strictly such R esolution is binding only in
international m atches or m atches b etw een U K clubs and clubs from abroad. Thus, the FA regard the
R esolution o f 26 July 1989 as effective in relation to the League, Cup and other d om estic fixtures from 1993
onwards. T h e R esolution d oes not force clubs to install all-seating as a con d itio n o f staging high-risk matches.
There is still the option to use only those parts o f the ground w hich have seating. Clearly, unless these are
substantial, attendance will be m uch reduced. O ne w ould therefore expect the m ajor clubs to adapt their
grounds to a cco m m o d a te the m axim u m seating they can m anage by the tim e the R esolution takes effect.
Smaller and m ore im pecu nious clubs m ay prefer to p o stp one conversion. However, if a small club w ith little
seating a cco m m o d a tio n draws a large first d ivisio n club at h o m e in the Cup in 1993 (a high-risk match) it will
be able only to use its lim ited seating acco m m o d ation or the gam e will have to be played at a better equipped
ground elsewhere.

The Football Spectators Act 1989
  84. T h e intention to follow this sam e trend was stated by your predecessor, Mr D ouglas Hurd, in a
statement to the H ou se o f C o m m o n s two days after Hillsborough. H e a d d e d :-

  “This w ould involve the disappearance o f terraces at (major) grounds. It might also involve am en dm en ts
  to strengthen the Football Spectators Bill so that its provisions for the licensing o f grounds m atched this
  co n cept”.

  In the event, machinery for im plem en ting increased seating is to be found in section 11 o f the 1989 Act.
There, provision is m ade for the Football Licensing A uthority (set up under section 8) to be directed by the
Secretary o f State to include in any licence to adm it spectators a co n d itio n im posing requirements as respects
the seating o f spectators at designated football matches at the premises; “and it shall be the duty o f the
authority to co m p ly with the direction”.

Association Football only or D esignated Grounds?
   85. In considering seating and standing, I have concentrated so far on association football because it
attracts the largest and m ost volatile crowds and has been troubled with misbehaviour. But should
recom m en dation s about seating be con fined to association football or should they go further? W herever a
line is drawn com p lain t may be m ade that it is illogical, but two possibilities seem more logical than most;
either to con fine recom m endations to the 92 clubs in the Football League or to apply them to grounds
designated under the 1975 Act as am ended. T he latter course would include a num ber o f Rugby League,
Rugby U n io n and cricket grounds. I acknowledge that so far, happily, m isb eh aviour at those grounds has
been m inim al. However, even leaving aside possible m isbehaviour, where there are large numbers there is a
risk o f overcrowding. A well attended Rugby match o f either cod e m ay attract numbers in excess o f those
attending m any Football League m atches. There would seem little reason for requiring a fourth d iv isio n
League club to convert to seating whilst perm itting major Rugby clubs to keep their terraces indefinitely.

  86. On the other hand, proposals for all-seating would clearly be inappropriate in relation to sports events
at which spectators are accustom ed, and should be entitled, to m ove about. For exam ple, at horserace
m eetings, spectators m ay wish to view horses in the paddock, place bets, view races from different vantage
points and enjoy the other facilities o f what is a social occasion as well as a sports event. Other exam ples o f
events at which spectators m ove about and should b e free to do so are greyhound racing and g olf
tournaments.


                                                             15
  87. The criteria for designating a sports ground under the 1975 Act as am en ded are laid dow n in section
KD;
  “The Secretary o f State m ay by order designate as a sports ground requiring a certificate under this Act (in
  this Act referred to as a “safety certificate”) any sports ground which in his op in io n has a cc o m m o d a tio n for
  m ore than 10,000 spectators.”

  Section 1(1)(A) permits the Secretary o f State to substitute such other num ber as he considers appropriate
for the num ber 10,000.

   88. Clearly the purpose o f such designation is to bring safety o f grounds with capacity for substantial
numbers under the control o f the local authority. W hilst som e grounds with a capacity o f m ore than 10,000
may currently have an average attendance o f only say 3,000, there is always the prospect o f a visit from a large
club, an attractive Cup draw, or an upturn in fortunes bringing in larger crowds. Safety provisions m ust be
capable o f coping with such events. Indeed, danger is m ore likely to result if there is an occasional m atch with
a large attendance than if such m atches were regular since those controlling it and those attending it will be
inexperienced.

   89. For these reasons, I think recom m en dation s to increase seating should be applied to all designated
grounds. I appreciate that the m achinery provided in section 11 o f the Football Spectators Act 1989 can be
used only to regulate the extension o f seating at association football grounds. However, the Secretary o f State
has power under section 6(2) o f the 1975 Act, as am ended, to provide for securing safety by regulations and
may prescribe terms and conditions to be inserted in Safety Certificates under section 15 A as indicated in the
next chapter. These powers could be used, even without the provision in section 11 o f the 1989 Act, to
prescribe m andatory rules about seating. So, by a com b ination o f his 1989 Act powers and his 1975 Act
powers or solely by exercising the latter, the Secretary o f State can require the progressive extension o f seating
at designated grounds.

  90. I therefore conclude and recommend that designated grounds under the 1975 Act should be required in
due course to be converted to all-seating. I do so for the com pelling reasons o f safety and control already set
out; also, so far as association football is concerned, because the present trend at h o m e and abroad and the
rules o f the world and European football authorities make the m ove to all-seating irresistible.

Phasing
  91. U n less som e tim e factors are specified, progress towards all-seating may well be protracted. T his is
recognised in the phasing proposed in the UEFA R esolution quoted above and in the m achinery set up in
section 11 o f the Football Spectators Act 1989.

  92. For high-risk association football matches I welcome and endorse the adoption by the FA of the FIFA
Resolution requiring no standing tickets to be sold after 1993 and its application to domestic fixtures.

   93. As to other m atches, I consider that without the im petus locally o f the World Cup, w hich is the spur
for speedy change in Italy, and having regard to the present state o f our grounds, it w ould be asking too much
to require conversion in the U K in the next two or three years. For all grounds designated under the 1975 Act
except for first division and second division League grounds, and national stadia, 1 think a tim ing along the
lines suggested in the Resolution under consideration by U E F A (and now adopted in Holland) is reasonable ie
that standing tickets should be reduced by 10% per year starting with a 10% deduction effective from August
1990 and so be phased out by August 1999.

   94. However, I recommend that grounds in the first and second divisions of the League and national stadia
should be all-seated by the start o f the 1994/1 9 9 5 season. It is at those grounds that the larger crowds attend
and, in the interests o f both safety and crowd control, I consider they should have seating for all spectators in
five years rather than ten years. The reduction in standing tickets should therefore be at 20% per annum from
August 1990 and be complete by August 1994. Any club promoted to the second division o f the League should be
given a reasonable period in w hich to comply. A similar approach should be adopted in Scotland.

Planning Ground Improvements
   95. Increased seating and other ground im provem ents will require expert planning and m uch finance. As
to planning, it is crucial that before clubs embark upon major work, they should have the best inform ation
and ad vice on m odern ground design. C onversion to seating cannot necessarily be achieved merely by fixing
seating onto existing terraces. For exam ple, sight-lines, access to seats, gangways, ro o f cover and other factors


                                                            16
may require m ore extensive changes to the layout. S om e clubs may be able wholly to redevelop their existing
grounds; others may be lim ited by space, finance or crowd n eeds to more m odest alterations. In som e
instances, the best course w ould be to m ove to a new site either alone or in conjunction with another club.
U ltim ate decision s on these op tion s m ust be for the club m anagem ent. N o doubt, so m e o f the bigger clubs
will be able to engage the forem ost contractors in this field to advise them and carry out the work. But even
for them , and certainly for the lesser clubs, it w ould be o f great value to have a body fully apprised o f the latest
developm en ts in ground design, capable o f giving expert ad vice on possible schem es and on ways and means
o f achieving them.

An Advisory Design Council
  96. I therefore support the suggestion of Professor M aunder’s Technical Working Party that there should be
established an Advisory D esig n Council to fulfil this role. It should, in my view, be set up by the FA and the FL
whose functions should include offering a service of this kind to the clubs. By way o f analogy, in Italy this
function is exercised by the C om itato O lim p ico N a zio n ale Italiano (CO NI). After studying many grounds,
including those in Madrid, V ienna and Athens, C O N I produced an excellent pamphlet on “ D esign Criteria
for Safe Com fortable and Large Sports F acilities” supported by detailed studies showing how they can be
achieved. These, together with m odels which may be inspected at C O N I’s headquarters in R om e, show how a
modern stadium can be designed from car park to pitch so as to secure safety and crowd control.

Research
  97. It has co m e to my attention only recently that the Sports Council published in 1981 a “H andbook o f
Sport and Recreational Building D esig n ”, and in 1989, a work entitled “Arenas, a Planning, D esign and
M anagem ent G u id e”. T he 1981 work included, in v o lu m e three, studies on ou td oor sports stadia. The 1989
work concentrated on indoor stadia. It seem s that neither o f these works was sent to the FA or the FL, nor
have they acquired them . Again, in July 1986, the Institution o f Structural Engineers form ed an ad hoc
com m ittee “to bring together all current technical knowledge relevant to the appraisal o f sports grounds and
their individual elem ents. T he com m ittee’s task was to establish a fully referenced body o f knowledge within
three years w hich w ould be com plem entary to the ‘G u id e to Safety at Sports Grounds’.” T he ad hoc
com m ittee has prepared a fifth draft o f its report w hich will be finalised after the recom m endations in my
Report have been considered.

   98. It is highly desirable that such worthwhile research as I have m en tio n ed should all be brought together
to achieve m axim u m benefit. With a form idable building and conversion programme for football grounds
ahead, an A dvisory D esign C ouncil set up by the FA and FL could make the best use o f all available research
here and abroad to assist and advise clubs.

Finance
   99. The scale o f the changes I recom m end will necessarily require heavy expenditure, albeit over an
extended period. It is not my function to m ake detailed proposals for financing the work. That is for football
m anagem ent and essentially for the clubs. However, lest it be thought that I have m ade proposals regardless
o f feasible funding, I ought to indicate sources and m ethod s o f finance which should m ake the im provem ents
practicable, and som e o f the fiscal arguments w hich have been addressed to me.

The Football Trust (FT) and the Football Grounds Improvement Trust (FG IT)
   100. Assistance in financing safety measures is presently available from the FT and the FGIT. The former
is funded by the three major pools com p anies (Littlew oods, Vernons and Zetters) from the “Spot the Ball”
C o m p etition , at the rate o f 21 % o f turnover, yielding over £9 m illion a year. T he total given to British football
since 1958 now approaches £ 1 2 0 m illion. T he Trustees are em powered to use their funds to prom ote
measures for the control or suppression o f unruly beh aviour in relation to football; to assist clubs to m eet the
obligations o f the Safety o f Sports G rounds Act 1975; to improve grounds and facilities for those w ho play
and watch the game and for any other purpose they con sid er to be a benefit to the game o f football in Great
Britain and Northern Ireland. The FT allocates just over half its in com e (ie over £4.5 m illion) to assisting
expenditure by League clubs on ground safety and im provem ents. This is done through the FGIT, a second
independent trust. The FG IT was established in 1975, the arrangements being m odified later in 1979 when
the FT was brought into being.

     101. Although it helps to fund many other works, from those at international grounds down to those at the
 lowliest clubs, the Trust continues to give first priority to assisting expenditure essential to the grant o f a
 Safety Certificate for a designated ground. U nd er its trust deed, the F G IT is able to make grants o f up to 75%
 o f the total cost available to clubs carrying out work as a necessary con d ition o f their being given a Safety


                                                            17
Certificate under the 1975 Act. Accordingly, should my recom m endation o f m andatory increases in seating
be made a condition o f the Safety Certificate, the work would be eligible for a grant from the FGIT.

    102. However, even at £4.5 m illion a year, the F G IT fund w ould be insufficient. A dditional financial
requirements fell upon the League clubs on the im plem en tation o f the 1975 Act and still more after the fire at
Bradford C ity’s ground in May 1985. By February 1988 over £ 3 7 m illion had been paid out in grants.
Pressures on finance led to the suspension o f im provem ent grants in June 1987. The F G IT was able to
reintroduce im provem ent grant aid on a lim ited basis during the closed season o f 1988. However, the range
o f works required to upgrade the League grounds inevitably m eans that resources o f the F G IT w ould be
spread quite thinly. They will not be sufficient to finance the kind o f im provem ents I have suggested, but the
Trust provides a structure for doing so. By way o f exam ple, Sheffield Wednesday received a grant o f £5 9 5 ,0 0 0
for the im provem ent o f the Kop end at Hillsborough. This was in addition to so m e £ 4 3 1 ,0 0 0 given to the club
for a total o f 21 safety projects between Septem ber 1978 and October 1988. Even so, funds o f this order will
be insufficient to build new all-seated stands. How then, can additional revenue be generated?

Fiscal Considerations
   103. Three arguments have been addressed to m e by the football authorities suggesting alterations in tax
structure to m ake funds available for ground im provem ents. Fiscal policy is for governm ent and ultimately
Parliament to decide, not fo r a judge. All I can usefully do is to set out the arguments.

  (a) VAT on the Spot the Ball Competition
   104. T he Football Trust have suggested that if VAT were abolished on receipts from this com p etition,
som e £5 to £6 m illion w ould be available. This w ould am ount to a direct subsidy from the Treasury. It w ould
be contrary as I understand it not only to present government thinking but to long established principles o f
fiscal policy. If that is so, a different and perhaps m ore propitious approach w ould be for the FA to urge the
Pool Promoters A ssociation (PPA) to increase their contribution as part o f a strategy to ensure the healthy
developm ent o f the game from which the PPA makes its money.

  (b) Pool Betting Tax
   105. A secon d case m ade by the FA is for a reduction in Pool Betting Tax now standing at 42.5%. The
suggestion is a reduction to 40% w hich w ould yield so m e £ 1 6 m illion. This, it is said, could be passed on to
assist ground im provem ents in one o f two ways: either the G overnm ent could con tinu e to tax pool betting at
the current level but m ake a donation to football equivalent to 2.5% o f the tax recovered, or it could reduce
the tax rate to 40% on the strict understanding that present proposals as to how any reduction o f the 42.5%
might be used were a m en ded to allow football to derive the entire benefit from the m oney thus saved by the
pool com panies.

   106. The FA seek to support their argument by reference to the structure o f tax on horse racing. They
claim the com parison shows football to be unfairly treated. In horse racing, the duty on off-course betting is
8%; on-course betting is not now taxed. There is a Horserace Betting Levy w hich goes to the im provem ent
and m aintenance o f race courses. However, the com parison between football pools and racing is not o f like
with like. The relationship o f stakes to w innings is different. The Football League presently receives £14
m illion a year from the PPA for the use o f its fixture list. There is no paym ent sim ilar to this in racing. N o r is
there an equivalent in racing to the Football Trust or the FGIT. T he Horserace Betting Levy is essentially
based on voluntary agreement and is not regarded by the Treasury as a tax. There could be no basis for a levy
on football pools unless there were agreement between the PPA and the Football League.

   107. For these am ongst other reasons, the racing analogy m ay not add weight to the FA’s argum ent on pool
betting tax. However, apart from that analogy, the FA subm it there is a strong case for som e reduction o f the
42.5% tax. T he Chester Report o f 1968 recom m en ded the establishm ent o f a football levy. T h e R othschild
Royal C o m m ission on G am bling recom m en ded in 1977 a reduction in the pool betting tax from the level at
that tim e o f 40% to 37% to establish a levy board. T he FA and the FL do not favour the creation o f a football
levy board. They consider that the Football Trust and the F G IT are appropriate bodies to receive and
adm inister any m oney accruing to football were a reduction m ade in the pool betting tax. I can only say that
the case for a m odest reduction in the pool betting tax w hich con vin ced the R othschild C o m m issio n in 1977
is arguably stronger now that the rate stands at 42.5%. It m ust in general be for com m ercial undertakings to
be self-financing. This applies throughout the entertainm ent industry o f w hich football clubs are a part. The
football authorities appreciate and accept that they must find the necessary funding substantially from their
own resources. N evertheless, if grounds all over the country are to be upgraded and in so m e instances
re-located so as to achieve safety for spectators, im provem ent in the quality o f life for residents near grounds


                                                           18
and a reduction in the expensive police co m m itm e n t to controlling m atches, it can be argued there is a case
for financial assistance, if not by direct subsidy then by so m e tax reduction.

  108. W hether or not the FA’s argum ent for tax reduction finds favour, there m ay well be scope for
reassessing and possibly increasing the contribution m ade by pools to football. It w ould not m atter whether
such contribution is to be by voluntary levy, by an increase in the present percentage rate on receipts from the
Spot the Ball C o m p etitio n or by increasing the am oun t paid for the use o f the fixture list.

  (c) C apital Allowances
  109. C om p lain t is m ade that no capital allowances can b e cla im ed against tax in respect o f ground
im provem ents.

   110. W hen asked w hy they se em ready and able to spend large sum s, so m etim es into m illions o f pounds,
for a single player in preference to spending m o n ey on im proving their grounds, the clubs usually give two
reasons.

  111. First, the attendance and satisfaction o f their supporters d epends essentially on success; so buying a
brilliant player has priority over ground im provem ent.

Transfer Fees
   112. T hey say the popular perception o f transfer fees as excessive and extravagant is m istaken. T he
m oney, I was told again and again, sim ply circulates round the League clubs. It is calculated to bring on
budding players. T h e level o f paym ents is high, but it is forced up by prices continental clubs with huge
financial backing (like Juventus from Fiat) are able to pay.

    113. T he “circulation” argument runs like this. First d iv ision club A buys an ace player for £1 m illion
from club B. T h is enables club B to buy three players at, say, £ 2 5 0 ,0 0 0 each from three other clubs, C, D and
E. Clubs C, D and E each buy tw o up-and-com ing but not yet arrived players from lesser clubs for perhaps
£ 1 0 0 ,0 0 0 each. So the process and the prices con tinu e downwards eventually enabling the poorer clubs to
keep going by cashing in on players they have trained from scratch. M eanwhile, to finance their £1 m illion
purchase, club A may sell two or three players w ho are past their best to lower d ivision clubs. T h is analysis
may well have so m e validity, but there are notable exceptions. For exam ple, w hen a French club bought a
player from an English club for over £ 4 m illion the m oney had not been circulating round the League clubs.

A Levy on Transfer Fees?
   114. Even if the “circulation” argum ent has so m e validity, the fact rem ains that transfer fees have reached
a level w hich m any regard as grotesque and certainly o u t o f all proportion to the am ounts spent on ground
im provem ent. There is a case for the football authorities im posing a levy on such fees, the proceeds going to
the FG IT to fund ground im provem ents. I suggest consideration be given to this.

Tax “Anomaly”
   115. Secondly (and this is the tax argument) football clubs have a strong fiscal in du cem ent to spend on
players rather than ground im provem ents. Paym ents for players are allowable revenue expenditure.
Im provem ents to the ground are not. In Brown (Inspector o f taxes) v Burnley Football and Athletic Com pany
L td 1983 AER 244, it was held that expenditure on a new stand to replace an old unsafe on e did not qualify as
an allowable ded uction whether as a repair or as provision o f plant. It is arguable that a fiscal provision w hich
penalises the redevelopm ent o f grounds whilst encouraging the p aym ent o f huge transfer fees is an anomaly,
that it sends the wrong signals to clubs, and that it encourages th em to neglect questions o f safety in favour o f
prom oting success on the field. To accede to this argument m ight fall foul o f the m axim that hard cases make
bad law. But as a matter o f policy, it is argued that the encouragem ent o f expenditure on ground
im provem ents by a fiscal co n cessio n m ay well bear re-exam ination.

Club Financing
   116. W hatever m ay co m e from the Pool Prom oters A ssociation via the two Trusts, or from any tax
 concession, in the end the bulk o f the finances for ground im provem en t m ust be raised by the clubs
 them selves. Here, clubs are at a disadvantage com pared w ith their European counterparts. On the continent
 m ost grounds are ow ned by local authorities w hich lease them to the clubs. They are regarded as providing a
 com m un al facility and often the stadium is available for a variety o f sports and other functions; sports
 facilities and offices are built in to the stadium com plex.


                                                          19
   117. N evertheless, there are ways o f financing im provem ents if the club m anagem ent is enterprising and
resourceful. Sponsorship is one. Presently it brings £17.5 m illion into football annually. Advertising on
electric score boards and on hoardings round the ground as well as on tickets, program m es and m em bership
cards is another. A ssociated co m p anies marketing sports wear and other m erchandise with the club’s logo,
the sale o f television rights, the issue o f debentures, and the sale o f shares to the public are other m ethods
w hich can be and have been used. In particular, I w ould expect the football authorities to seek the highest
possible price for television rights. U n d er current contractual arrangements, the Football A ssociation
receives som e £6 m illion pa from the sale o f television rights for d om estic broadcasts, o f w hich so m e £2.5
m illion is distributed to clubs. T hey also receive between £ 0 .7 5 m illion and £1 m illion for the sale o f
television rights overseas. Separate arrangements apply at Wembley. T he Football League contracted so m e
two years ago to sell the television rights for League m atches for £11 m illion, linked to the Retail Price Index.
T he television co m p anies know that football on the screen has a vast following. T h ey should be expected to
pay a substantial price for the rights to relay popular m atches. For their part, the football authorities should
ensure that this valuable source o f revenue is directed towards im proving stadia as a high priority.

   118. T he cost o f covered seating throughout the 92 clubs in the Football League has been investigated by
the FA. W hilst the assessm ent can only be a rough estim ate and is subject to fluctuations due to inflation and
other factors, the consultants suggested that to install seating throughout all the grounds m ight cost about £ 30
m illion. To provide cover over all th o se areas could cost a further £ 1 0 0 m illion. It should be noted, however,
that n o breakdown o f that figure is given. Moreover, it assum es “all existing uncovered standing capacity
should b eco m e covered”. G iven current attendances, it would seem unnecessary that all that capacity should
be covered. In m any instances, attendances are always well below the perm itted capacity o f the ground. In
those cases, a m uch smaller scale solution in volving the rebuilding or redevelopm ent o f only part o f the
ground would be sufficient. There w ould be little p oint in providing covered seating acco m m o d a tion
throughout a ground if there is no realistic possibility o f m ore than half o f it being used. C osts m ay therefore
be less daunting for the smaller clubs than the consultants’ estim ates suggest.

Upgraded Stadia or N ew Stadia
   119. At m ajor grounds where substantial resources can be generated, vast im provem en ts can be m ade on
existing sites i f there is sufficient space. I have seen a num ber o f im aginative exam ples o f ground
redevelopm ent. It has been achieved at Ibrox Park and is in the course o f being ach ieved at O ld Trafford,
W hite Hart Lane and H a m p d en Park, to give only four exam ples.

   120. However, I agree with the evidence from the Sports C ouncil as to the need for space to facilitate car
parking, external and internal circulation and sufficient exits and entrances to the spectator areas. T hey
said:-

  “T he location o f m any existing football grounds in central city or town sites precludes this provision (o f
  space) w hich im plies the adoption o f a gradual but progressive policy o f disposing o f grounds in densely
  developed areas and replacing the facility on the urban periphery. T he C ouncil b elieves that opportunities
  exist for such developm en ts on a self-funding basis in m any instances. T h is w ould also provide the
  opportunity for more than on e club to be based at new ly developed stadia constructed to a high
  specification and built to m eet new d em ands for safety and com fo rt”.

St Johnstone
   121. I was im pressed by the way this had been done at three particular grounds. At St Johnstone in
Scotland, the solution has been to in volve private capital directly. T h e A SD A superm arket chain bought the
site o f the old St Johnstone Football Club in the centre o f Perth, redeveloped it as a supermarket, and built
the club a brand new all-seated stadium for 10,000 spectators on the outskirts o f the town. T h e site was, in
effect, donated by a local farmer. It is close to a m otorway exit and provides for extensive car parks. I accept
that this confluence o f factors m ight not be easy to reproduce elsewhere. In particular, land prices in som e
areas would be prohibitive and planning perm ission very difficult to obtain. A greenfield site is likely to be in
a conservation or green belt area and the ch oice o f sites is lim ited by the need to m ake the ground accessible
to townsfolk albeit outside the town.

U trecht
   122. I saw two exam ples abroad where these problem s had been tackled resolutely. At U trecht an old
stadium on the outskirts o f the town was totally redeveloped on the sam e site ostensibly at nil cost. T he
contracting com p any which rebuilt the stadium (Ballast N ed a m ) is now in consultation w ith 11 clubs in
England and Scotland with a view to building sim ilar projects in partnership with the Football A ssociation


                                                         20
and British A erospace o f w hich it is a subsidiary. T heir co n cept involves the recognition that in the past, for
all but a handful o f days in the year, a stadium com p lex has usually and wastefully lain deserted. At Utrecht
the stadium is ow ned by the municipality. T h e space underneath the stands and in the corners o f the ground
has b een d eveloped to provide a cco m m o d a tio n for com m ercial use. T h e rent provides the m unicipality with
sports a cc o m m o d a tio n w hich pays for itself. S om e 6 ,0 0 0 square metres o f com m ercial working areas and
2 4 ,0 0 0 square metres o f com m ercial offices have been incorporated into the com plex. T he com m ercial uses
o f this a cc o m m o d a tio n include office a cco m m o d a tio n , snack bars, sports facilities, p hotocopying and office
eq u ipm en t services, a driving school and a hairdresser. T h e large parking area is used except on m atch days
as a “park and ride” facility for those working in the m ore congested areas o f the city. T he advantages for
business are that shops and offices enjoy a prestigious high profile address with all necessary services and
facilities. For the com m unity, the com m ercial stadium serves as an arena both for trade and recreation.
A ppendix 5 is a photograph showing the stadium with the com m ercial infill in the corners and out into the
car park.

N im es
   123. T h e stadium at N im e s in Southern France is also ow ned by the m u n ic ip a lity . It was built recently on
the outskirts o f the town with extensive parking and good access to road com m u n ica tio n s. T h e cost was som e
£17 m illion o f w hich £ 1 6 m illion cam e from the m unicipality itself. T he justification for this expenditure o f
public funds is the b elief that the stadium is a com m u n al asset. It provides not only a stadium for football or
rugby but an extensive range o f other sports facilities built into the com plex. T h ese include a gym nastic hall
capable o f hosting international m atches, an “om nisport” hall for tennis, basket-ball and volley-ball, a ju d o
hall, facilities for fencing and billiards, and a large exh ib ition hall which, at the tim e o f our visit, had just
been used for a car sales exhibition.

Local A uthority Assistance
   124. All these three stadia are on a com paratively sm all scale. St Johnstone seats 10,000. U trecht
accom m o d ates 2 0 ,0 0 0 and N im e s about 28 ,0 0 0 . I accept that in the current financial clim ate and with our
different approach to com m u n a l funding, local authorities are unlikely to be able to provide subsidies for
such stadia, although local authorities do subsidize, for exam ple, sw im m in g baths, theatres and other leisure
facilities w hich m ay serve fewer o f their citizens. However, clubs which w ish to m ove from centre town sites
to new sites on the outskirts o f town m ay well be able to find a purchaser as St Joh nstone did with ASD A .
Likewise, those who wish either to build a new stadium on the outskirts or to redevelop their stadium in town
m ay be able to do so in a way w hich incorporates space for com m ercial lettings.

    125. In such situations, although the local authority m ay be unable to assist with finance, it could play a
useful role in bringing parties together and as planning authority. It could take a favourable view, for
exam ple, o f a planning application w hich in v olved the provision not only o f a com m un al sports stadium but
o f further facilities, w hether for sport or otherwise, benefitting the co m m u n ity as a whole. There has recently
been a num ber o f attem pts by clubs to find greenfield sites for new grounds only to be turned down at each
attempt on planning grounds. Clearly, an application for a football ground in a conservation area or green
belt poses planning problems. But, although the protection o f such areas is an im portant principle, two other
considerations m ay also carry weight. First, that the quality o f life o f residents living adjacent to a football
ground in a town w ould be m uch im proved by resiting it elsewhere. Secondly, that if we want safety and
im proved standards at grounds there are so m e clubs w hich will need a new site at w hich to achieve them. To
this end, local authorities should surely give what assistance they properly can. O n e useful exam ple o f the
mutual assistance w hich a club and a local authority can give each other is an agreement m ade between
Millwall and the London Borough o f Lewisham. T h e latter agreed to pay £ 7 0 ,0 0 0 a year to the club w hich for
its part agreed inter alia to m ake the ground available for various activities beneficial to the local com m unity.

Ground Sharing
    126. W hether or not incom e-earning facilities are incorporated into a sports ground, it seem s u n econ om ic
that the stadium itself should be used by only one club, in effect once a fortnight. T he cost to each club both
o f upgrading or building a stadium and o f m aintaining it could be halved if sensible sharing arrangements
could be m ade. But there is resistance to this. A num ber o f cities have two clubs, each with its own ground.
Such is local rivalry that the idea o f ground sharing seem s anathem a to many. Yet, faced with the expense o f
seating and ground im provem ent, it w ould m ake financial sense. O p po sitio n to sharing an entirely new
ground m ay be marginally less than to on e club sharing another’s existing ground. Recently Mr Peter
R obinson, C h ie f Executive o f Liverpool FC, was quoted as saying:

   “If so m eo n e were to build a high-quality stadium on Merseyside, we and Everton w ould be quite happy to
   share it - even though the idea might not appeal to the fans at first”.


                                                             21
  If two clubs could sell their inner city grounds with planning perm ission, the resultant capital w ould go a
long way to building a modern shared stadium on a more suitable site.

  127. It works abroad. AC Milan and Inter Milan share the San Siro stadium . In Turin, Juventus and
Torino also share. Genova and Sampdoria provide a third exam ple.

  128. As long ago as 1981, in the Sports C oun cil’s H a n d b o o k o f Sports and R ecreational B uilding Design,
Volume Three (O utdoor Sports), ground-sharing was considered in a technical study o f stadia. T h e author,
Mr Faulkner Brown, wrote at page 2 4 :-

  “Several courses w ould appear to be open to football clubs. O ne is that they might rationalise their position
  and, wherever possible, jointly use a single stadium . T h is could happen at Sheffield, N ottin g h a m and
  Bristol. Fulham could m ove in with Chelsea and Brentford with Q ueen’s Park Rangers. Inter-Milan and
  AC Milan, for all their deep rivalry, do live happily enough together in the giant San Siro stadium . The
  British clubs could all retain their identity, halve their overheads and realise h and som ely the value o f their
  freehold properties, if they could cope with their fiercely held view s o f club in dividu ality and club pride.

     A nother alternative w ould be, where possible, for clubs to offer unused land adjacent to the stadium for
  d evelopm ent and, in realising the assets from the land, to plough them back into the cost o f stadium
  reconstruction. This, o f course, has h appened at Lord’s and is having so m e noticeable effects at the Oval
  and in other county cricket grounds.

    A further alternative is to build additional sports facilities alongside the stadium , not necessarily in
  em ulation o f the ancient Greek exam ple (but nevertheless there is a parallel), so that a large num ber o f
  sports clubs could use all the facilities. T h is schem e has been developed to so m e extent both in the U nited
  States and on the con tinent.”

Super-Stadia
  129. So far, I have referred only to club grounds. But there is a case for having a sm all num ber o f
super-stadia capable o f accom m od ating very large crowds for international m atches or m ajor Cup ties. At
present, the only such stadium in the U K is W em bley w hich will accom m od a te 8 0 ,0 0 0 all-seated. Like
Wembley, any other stadia o f large capacity could be available not only for football but for other sports, for
pop concerts and other large events.

   130. A consortium com prising British Aerospace, the FA and Ballast N ed a m (who built the Utrecht
stadium) is presently considering the building o f a new national stadium at Birm ingham to accom m od ate
100,000. There is a suggestion that this project, i f carried through, w ould provide a replacement for
Wembley. However, it m ay well be that there is room for both. This w ould give a ven u e in L ondon and a
venue in the M idlands for major events. H am pd en Park has served as Scotland’s international football
ground for m any years and when planned im provem ents are com plete it should con tinu e to do so. It is
arguable that on e more large stadium m ay be required in the north o f England but the upgrading o f a ground
such as Old Trafford might well suffice to achieve this purpose.

Leadership and Exam ple
   131. I turn from stadia and m on ey to on e aspect o f football w hich gives w id e scope for im provem ent at
very little cost. M uch is written about the m isb eh aviour o f spectators; but m isb eh aviour is often imitative.
H ooligans in the crowd find others w ho will copy them. Similarly, incitem ent from the pitch or bad
behaviour by players has asmalign influence on the crowd. For m any fervent followers, the m en on the pitch
are heroes to be revered and em ulated. After a goal, w hen the scorer d em onstrates to the fans behind the
fencing, the resultant surge forward and hysteria is bad for safety and bad for crowd control. It should not
occur. Worse still, w hen players fight, the fans follow suit. Lest anyone doubt this, the recent exam ples o f
fighting between players bear it out. In two o f the four incidents in N o v em b er 1989, crowd m isbehaviour
resulted directly from fighting between players. At Highbury, fans cam e out on to the pitch to join in. At
U pton Park, scuffles between W im bledon and West H am players provoked surging, fighting and coin
throwing on the terraces.

   132. It is in the first instance up to the players them selves, then the referees, the managers and the club
directors to stop both incitem ent and vio len ce by players whether on or o f f the ball. The referees, managers
and directors have power to do this. If and w hen they fail to use it, the FA must take a firm disciplinary line
using their very full powers to fine those in v o lv ed including the clubs and to penalise the clubs in points. I f all
else fails, there is no reason w hy violen ce on the pitch should have any im m u n ity from the law o f the land or
from police action.
   133. On the p ositive side, m anagem ent could do much to create a better atm osphere in the grounds by
what they say and what they write in program m es and m agazines. B y consulting with supporters they could
enlist the goodw ill and help o f the decent majority to isolate and rebuff m isbehaviour from the m inority
rather than im itate it. A cam paign for better behaviour could b e launched by the clubs through their
literature and backed by managers and players using their popular hero appeal.

    134. I should add that vio len ce on the pitch is not con fined to soccer. There has been a growing incidence
o f stam pings and punchings in Rugby U n io n games even at the highest level. R eaction from referees, clubs
and even international selectors has tended to play such incidents down. Although spectator b eh aviour has
not, as yet, been adversely affected by such incidents, the authorities ought to deal firmly with them before
that happens and in any event, sim p ly because v io len ce should be put down.

Fam ily and M em bership Areas
    135. M uch progress has been m ade at a num ber o f clubs recently in bringing w om en and children back to
watching football by creating separate fam ily areas. Similarly, partial m em bership schem es have enabled
clubs to reserve parts o f the ground exclusively to mem bers. T his has had the dual advantage o f creating areas
o f reliable go o d behaviour and offering discounts, favourable travel facilities and other benefits to mem bers.
T he go o d behaviour depends on those who pay for m em bership b ein g m ore likely to be responsible and upon
their risking loss o f m em bership i f they transgress.

   136. At a num ber o f grounds, fam ily areas have been de-segregated in the sense that fam ilies drawn from
away supporters have been perm itted to share fam ily areas with h o m e supporters. I have already indicated
how segregation has tended to worsen hostility between rival fans. It is difficult on ce segregation has been
practised to dispense with it, certainly at a stroke. These jo int fam ily areas m ay prove to be the first step in a
retreat from segregation. If the process can be extended gradually to allowing m em bers o f the v isiting club to
share the m em bership area o f the h o m e club, useful progress will have been m ade. It will be m ade easier if
there is seating rather than standing.

T h e Disabled
   137. I received evidence from the Royal A ssociation for D isab ility and Rehabilitation (R A D A R ) and the
A ccess C om m ittee for England drawing attention to the opportunity which redevelopm ent o f grounds
presents to m ake better provision for disabled people. M any clubs already m ake provision for the disabled
but this is by no m eans universal. Particular attention is needed to the provision o f safe and adequately
spacious view ing areas for w heelchair users, with a seat alongside for a com panion, protected from the
weather, accessible to toilet facilities designed specifically for the disabled, and easily reached from a car park
(with reserved car spaces for Orange Badge holders) by m eans o f ramps. T he needs o f other disabled peop le -
those w ho have difficulty walking, the partially sighted, and those with im paired hearing - require special
attention, for exam ple by the provision o f handrails, clear signposts, steps painted in bright colours, and the
use o f electronic scoreboards to supplem ent loudspeaker annou ncem en ts, i f these people are to b e able to
attend sporting events enjoyably and safely. I endorse the im portance attached to these suggestions and I
hope that the com prehensive im provem ents which I am proposing will include careful attention to them.
Clubs should regard them as integral to their planning, not as an op tion al extra.

Conclusion
  138. I hope in these two chapters I have m ade it clear that the years o f patching up grounds, o f having
periodic disasters and narrowly avoid in g m any others by m uddling through on a wing and a prayer m ust be
over. A totally new approach across the w hole field o f football requires higher standards both in bricks and
mortar and in hum an relationships.

M in im u m Standards of Safety
   139. It is a truism that safety and crowd control are inter-dependent. If a crowd gets out o f control safety
will be in jeopardy. M easures to control the crowd, such as fencing, alm ost always have an im pact on safety.
Nevertheless, I shall seek to treat each separately. In this Part I shall deal with m anagem ent and features o f
the ground affecting safety.

    140. I have already stressed the need for football m anagem ent to give higher priority to the safety and
well-being o f spectators. Clearly, the cost o f safety measures and im provem ents can m ore easily be borne or
raised by the successful clubs than by those struggling to keep going. But the safety o f spectators in vited to a
ground cannot be left to depend upon the affluence o f the club. There must be prescribed m in im u m
requirements which have to be fulfilled at any ground if spectators are to be adm itted there. The ev idence o f
practice pre-Hillsborough and indeed post-Hillsborough, right up to D ecem ber 1989, con vin ces m e that the
provisions presently in place, statutory and otherwise, have not b een strong enough to enforce that basic level
o f safety.

Legislation for Safety
   141. T he principal instruments a im ed at achieving a framework for safety are the Safety o f Sports
G rounds Act 1975 as am en ded by the Fire Safety and Safety o f Places o f Sport Act 1987 and the H o m e Office
G uide to Safety at Sports Grounds (Green Guide).

    142. The 1975 Act, as am ended, requires a Safety Certificate to be issued by the local authority in respect
o f designated sports grounds. It is an offence (Section 12(l)(d)) to contravene any term or con d itio n o f the
Certificate. Thus the requirements o f the Certificate are mandatory but what those requirem ents should be is
in the discretion o f the local authority.

  143. Section 2(1) o f the 1975 Act provides:-

  “A safety certificate shall contain such terms and con d itions as the local authority con sid er necessary or
  expedient to secure reasonable safety at the stadium when it is in use for the specified activ ity or activities,
  and the terms and con d itions m ay be such as to in volve alterations or additions to the sta d iu m .”

  144. Originally, certain obligatory terms had to be inserted in Safety Certificates. Section 2(2) p rovid ed :-

  “ W ithout prejudice to subsection (1) above, a safety certificate -

    (a) shall specify the m axim u m num ber o f spectators to b e adm itted to the stadium;

    (b) m ay specify the m ax im u m num ber to be ad m itted to different parts o f it; and

    (c) shall include terms and co n d itio n s:-

        (i) as to the number, size and situation o f entrances to and exits from the stadium or any part o f it
        (including m eans o f escape in case o f fire or other emergency) and the m eans o f access to any such
        entrances or exits;

        (ii) requiring those entrances, exits and m eans o f access to b e properly m aintained and kept free
        from obstruction; and

        (iii) as to the number, strength and situation o f any crush barriers.”

   However, w hen the Fire Safety and Safety o f Places o f Sport Act 1987 extended the application o f the 1975
Act from sports stadia to all sports grounds, there was substituted for section 2(2), by section 19 o f the 1987
Act, a new section 2(2) and a new section 15 A giving power to the Secretary o f State by order to lay down what
terms and con d itions a Safety Certificate shall intrude. N o order has yet been m ade but guidance from the
H om e Office has recom m en ded local authorities to approach their function under section 2(1) in accordance
with the criteria in the superseded section 2(2). (See H o m e O ffice Circular 7 1 /1 9 8 7 dated 25 N o vem ber
 1987, A nnex A, paragraph 6.)


                                                         24
    145. So, presently, local authorities are not bou n d to include terms or con d itions on any particular aspect
o f safety in the Certificate. In practice, they no doubt follow the H o m e O ffice guidance. T h ey also take
account o f the Green G u id e s

Green Guide
  146. T h e latter, however, is by way o f guidance only. It provides as follows:-

  “ 6. D ev ia tio n s from individual guidelines are possible w ithout necessarily detracting from the overall
  safety o f the ground. T h e variety o f type, function and layout o f sports grounds and the inter-relationship
  o f the different parts o f them m eans that a flexible approach should be m aintained to take account o f the
  particular circum stances at individual grounds” .

   Such flexibility is ob v iou sly highly desirable in relation to so m e aspects o f the guidance. But flexibility can
b eco m e degraded. Where a local authority has chosen to incorporate the criteria o f the Green G uide into a
Safety Certificate there has been scope for considerable deviation from provisions w hich ought to co m m and
standard adherence. Thus, for exam ple, at Hillsborough where the Safety Certificate required com pliance
with certain Green G u id e recom m en dation s and a departure was shown to have occurred, the defence was
that the G uide expressly provided for flexibility so that a d eviation from its provisions was a matter o f
legitimate discretion.

   147. In v iew o f this and evidence I have received suggesting that the Green G uide m ay not be followed as
closely as is desirable, I consider that when it is revised it needs to be given more effect. At present there is a
risk o f slackness developing in the absence o f any m andatory provisions. There w ould appear to be two
alternative courses open. It w ould b e possible to m ake the terms o f the Green G u id e m andatory throughout.
However, I think that this could be too rigid and in relation to so m e peripheral matters impractical. The other
course is to m ake so m e o f its provisions obligatory inclusions in the Safety Certificate. I prefer this.

   148. There are som e requirements o f such crucial importance to safety that it should be mandatory for
Safety Certificates to specify them. I consider those specified in the original section 2(2) o f the 1975 Act fall
into this category. Moreover, so far as the original section 2(2)(b) is concerned “s h a ll” should be substituted
for “m ay”. This is critical to ensuring that no discrete area b eco m es overcrowded.

   149. Accordingly, I recommend that the Secretary o f S tate exercise his specific powers under section 15A
or his general powers under section 6(2) by order or regulation to achieve this. In specifying the requirements
in the Certificate, for a particular ground, the local authority should follow the Green G uide criteria; but
once that is done and the appropriate figures and terms for that ground have been d ecided no room should be
left for flexibility. By the stage when the local authority has specified the requirem ents in the Certificate,
flexibility has been exhausted.

   150. W here a local authority incorporates any other provision of the Green Guide into the Safety
Certificate it should m ake it clear whether that provision is to be complied with absolutely or with
discretionary flexibility. For exam ple, paragraph 88 o f the Green G u id e provides that a ramp subject to
heavy crowd flow should preferably not exceed a gradient o f 1 in 10. Should a local authority require in a
Safety Certificate that a club com ply with a Green G u id e recom m endation as to gradients it should make
clear whether it restricts gradients to a m axim u m o f 1 in 10 or whether it leaves flexibility to the discretion o f
the club.

  151. In putting the responsibility for the Safety Certificate upon the local authority, Parliament no doubt
had two sound reasons; first, since all sports grounds differ in their layout and environs, local knowledge
ought sensibly to be utilised in laying down and m onitoring terms and conditions; secondly, a local body can
respond quickly to any problem which may arise. N evertheless, there are two aspects o f such local
administration w hich can cause problems.

   (i) The Advisory Group
   152. T he issue, review and enforcem ent o f Safety Certificates should be based upon efficient professional
inspection and op in io n and should be conducted in a businesslike manner. In Sheffield, the Safety
Certificate procedure both for Hillsborough and for Sheffield U n ite d ’s ground at Bramall Lane was
unsatisfactory as 1 indicated in paragraphs 150 to 158 o f m y Interim Report. 1 hope that this was exceptional.
It is important that there should be a safety team consisting of appropriate members of the local authority’s own
staff, representatives o f the police, of the fire and ambulance services and of the building authority'. What nam e
is given to this group does not in the end matter. At Sheffield it began by being called the Officer Working Party.


                                                           25
W hen Sheffield City C ouncil took over from South Yorkshire County C ouncil, the n am e was changed to the
“Safety o f Sports Grounds Advisory G roup ”, or the A dvisory G roup for short. In my interim
recom m endations (N u m b er 17) I said an A dvisory Group should be set up. I had in m ind the type o f safety
team already referred to. Apparently, in so m e quarters, it was thought that 1 was suggesting a second body
called an A dvisory Group to advise the safety team. This was not so. Also, in that recom m en dation , I
suggested that representatives o f the club and o f a recognised supporters’ club should be m em bers o f the
Advisory Group. I have reconsidered this in the light o f evidence and advice received. The responsibility for
the Safety Certificate is exclusively that o f the local authority. I therefore think that the correct course is that
representatives of the club and of a recognised supporters’ organisation should be consulted, since they may
have relevant suggestions or criticism s to make, but they should not be full m em bers o f the team.

  153. I repeat my recommendation that the Advisory Group’s terms o f reference should encom pass all
matters concerned with crowd safety and should require regular visits to the ground and attendance at m atches.
There should be a chairman from the local authority, and an effective procedure. R esolutions should be recorded
and regular written reports should be required for consideration by the local authority.

  (ii) A Review Body
   154. T he other disadvantage o f Safety Certificates being issued locally is that different standards m ay be
applied by different authorities even in practically identical situations. A safety team , or so m e very
influential m em ber o f it, may be m uch stricter in on e place than the com parable authority elsewhere. I have
had com plaints that since Hillsborough measures appropriate to a larger ground have been rigidly and
inappropriately enforced at grounds with negligible attendance. Conversely, it is possible that too indulgent
or lax an approach may be adopted or d evelop in a particular locality. Again, sim ply left to solve their own
problems, there would be little opportunity for local authorities to learn from com parison with solutions
adopted elsewhere. In these circumstances, it has been suggested that there should be a N ational Forum in
which local authority team s could m eet periodically to discuss and com pare their procedures, and that there
should be a national overseeing and inspecting body to m onitor and review the consistent discharge by local
authorities o f their certificating duties. H aving discussed this with local authority representatives both in
England and in Scotland I am satisfied that two approaches are not necessary. The better course is to have a
National Inspectorate and Review Body. T h is is now' provided for in the Football Spectators A ct 1989 by section
13. It is there laid down that the Football Licensing Authority shall have the function of keeping under review
the discharge by local authorities of their functions under the 1975 Act. T he FLA may, having consulted the
local authority and certain local officers, require terms and con d itio n s to be included in any Safety
Certificate. The section em powers any inspector appointed by the FLA to m ake inspections and inquiry as
necessary. T he local authority may by notice be required to furnish the FLA with inform ation regarding its
discharge o f its 1975 Act functions.

   155. I warmly welcome the appointment of a national body to conduct these inspecting and reviewing
functions. Assum ing it successfully discharges those functions, the effect should be to improve the efficiency
and consistency o f practice with regard to the issue and review o f Safety Certificates. T his w ould be enhanced
if the review body were to circulate, to all local authorities from tim e to tim e, advice based upon their
experience o f problem s and solutions at various grounds. (See also R ecom m en dation 16 o f the report o f the
Technical Working Party at A ppendix 3).

   156. Because the Football Spectators Act 1989 applies only to association football, the inspecting and
reviewing role of the FLA would be exercisable only in relation to Safety Certificates at football grounds.
N evertheless, this remit of the FLA should be extended to cover all grounds designated under the 1975 A ct and
indeed all grounds requiring Safety Certificates or licences under Parts III and IV of the 1987 Act. Should Part
I of the 1989 Act either not be im plem ented or be substantially delayed, the sam e functions should be given to
another suitably constituted body to cover all sports grounds.

   157. It has been suggested that the Health and Safety Executive could fulfil this function if necessary or
indeed that it could m onitor spectator safety under the provisions o f the Health and Safety at Work Etc Act
1974. However, its resources would need to be increased. Moreover, until now the Health and Safety
Executive, being primarily concerned with the safety o f em ployees pursuant to the 1974 Act, has not
extended its surveillance to include spectators at football grounds. T he H o m e Office evidence on this point is
as follows:

  “The Health and Safety at Work Act could also be used to enforce general spectator safety at sports grounds.
  Section 3 o f the Act is w id e ranging in that it places a duty on an em ployer to conduct his undertaking in
  such a way as to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that persons not in his em p loym ent w ho m ay be
  affected thereby are not exposed to risks to their health or safety. A sports or other entertainm ent


                                                         26
“undertaking” would fall within this category. However, it is the stated policy o f the Health and Safety
C om m issio n that, as a general principle, they and the Executive wish to avoid duplication o f enforcem ent
with other authorities. The HSE would not therefore generally attempt to enforce the requirem ents o f
Section 3 o f the 1974 Act when they overlap with duties im posed by other more specific legislation where
other authorities have responsibility for policy and enforcem ent. T he Safety o f Sports Grounds A ct 1975
represents m ore specific legislation and the Health and Safety Executive does not enforce Section 3 o f the
1974 Act to secure the safety o f spectators at sports grounds. T h is arrangement is agreed between the
Health and Safety Executive and the H o m e O ffice.”




                                                     27

   158. H aving considered the framework for safety provided by the statutory provisions and the Green
G uide, I m ust now deal with certain key substantive provisions.

Capacity
   159. I accept the Technical Working Party’s statem ent that “the safe allowable capacity o f any view ing
area whether seated or standing is the least o f (i) its holding capacity, (ii) the num ber o f persons who can leave
through a norm al exit system w ithin a prescribed tim e at the end o f an event, (iii) the num ber o f persons who
can leave through an em ergency exit system w ithin a prescribed tim e and (iv) the num ber o f persons who can
be adm itted through the turnstiles serving that area within one hour.” T he “prescribed tim e ” for norm al exit
is said in paragraph 2 3 0 o f the G u id e to be 8 m inutes. T he “prescribed tim e ” for em ergency exit is not
definitively fixed in the G u id e as it will vary from area to area. It will need to be determ ined by the local
authority on advice from the A dvisory Group and especially the fire service.

  160. Subject to factors (ii), (iii) and (iv), where there is a properly designed seating area, capacity is sim ply
determ ined by the num ber o f seats. Increasingly, therefore, problem s o f m axim u m capacity will fade out as
seating is phased in. But, as long as we have standing areas, grounds will be vulnerable to overcrowding and
m axim u m lim its must be set and achieved.

   161. The Green G u id e provides in paragraphs 221 and 222 for a m ax im u m density o f 54 persons per 10 sq
metres assum ing a terrace or view ing slope in good co n d ition. For so m e reason, not easy to understand, the
G u id e also provides the lower figure o f 27 persons per 10 sq metres w hen the slope or terrace “materially
deviates from the recom m ended guidelines, so as to constitute a possible hazard to in dividu als closely
packed”. This might be taken to im ply that whatever the hazards there is no need to reduce capacity below
27. In the heading to Chapter 16, the Green G uide em phasises that “account should be taken o f the features
o f the individual ground, its configuration, general con d ition, use and any d ev iation s from the G u id e’s
provisions.”

   162. It becam e clear from evidence before m e at both stages o f this Inquiry that not only was the
m axim um o f 54 per 10 sq metres grossly exceeded at Hillsborough; insufficient was being d on e generally to
ensure either by counting or by inform ed assessm ent that the Green G uide criteria were observed.
Accordingly, I reaffirmed the advice in the G uide and recom m ended that a reduction o f 15% be m ade as an
interim measure to improve the safety margin. The question now is what should be the final recom m endation
on this difficult subject.

   163. I entirely agree with the Technical Working Party that there is no benefit to be gained from retaining
the lower figure o f 27 or any other m in im u m figure. Indeed, it could be a dangerous suggestion. The scale of
permissible density' should be from 0 up to the maximum figure applicable only in good conditions. I note
the Technical Working Party’s view that “ a uniformly distributed density o f 5 .4 /m 2 should be safe in static
conditions in full compliance with the Green Guide". However, the words in italics are crucial to their view.
It is on e thing to place 54 d ocile p eople evenly in an area o f 10 sq m etres on a terrace and say they should be
safe. It is quite another if they are excited, if they sway or surge to and fro, if one end o f the area is a better
viewing point than the other and if account is taken o f possible incidents in the crowd eg a scuffle or a
firework. Any o f those factors can cause bunching; bunching can quickly b ecom e crushing.

   164. M ost clubs have responsibly applied the recom m en ded 15% reduction. S om e have jibbed at it;
understandably, in view o f its im pact on revenue. On the other hand, as I have already observed, som e Police
C om m anders expressed relief that num bers have been reduced. I m ust also point out that, even whilst the
reduction has been in force, events have shown how easy it is for crushing to occur.

   165. At the start o f the 1 9 8 9 /9 0 season, on 19 August, Coventry were at h o m e to Everton. There were
com plaints afterwards o f congestion and crushing before the m atch outside the turnstiles and after the match
as spectators pressed to get out.

  166. Even m ore worrying was an incident on 9 D ec em b e r at A yresom e Park when M iddlesbrough were at
hom e to Leeds. I have not con d ucted a full inquiry into the incident having no remit to do so. But I have
received a full report from the police. I have also view ed m ore than on ce a video film o f what happened. It
was horribly reminiscent o f Hillsborough.


                                                          28
   167. The following facts are clear. Leeds supporters had been allocated, as a standing area, a wedge-shaped
pen “D ” at the south east corner o f the ground. It was flanked by a narrow sterile area on each side. There was
a broad gangway running from top to bottom o f pen “D ”. The perimeter fencing at the front o f the pen was
topped with spikes. There was not a single gate to the pitch. T h e only way out for those at the front was by a
gate at each side into the sterile area and thence through another gate to the pitch. T h ose gates were closed
during the m atch. T he capacity o f the pen in accordance with my interim recom m en dation was 2108. Leeds
supporters were adm itted to the pen, fam ilies with very young children being put at the front. The gangway
was not kept clear. S om e Leeds supporters m anaged to get tickets for the op posite h o m e end o f the ground
causing apprehension o f trouble. A num ber o f them were taken out and m oved into pen “D ” from the pitch
side. Other Leeds fans with tickets for the wrong end were also allowed into pen “D ” from the back. Shortly
after the m atch started, there was distress am on g those at the front o f the pen. After two surges down part o f
the pen where there were no barriers from front to back, the police had to assist in getting spectators,
especially children, out o f the pen. This was done principally over the fencing although the side gates were
op en ed and shut a num ber o f times. In the event, 14 people had to be treated for m inor injuries in the
am bulance room. Five spectators, three o f them children aged 10, 11 and 12, were taken to hospital with
chest injuries, lacerations and bruising.

   168. T he local authority, the police and the club were clearly shocked by this incident and have taken
prompt rem edial action. A dd itional crush barriers are to be installed, additional gates are to be provided
including o n e for pen D , the capacity o f that pen is to be halved. A dm ission to all parts o f the ground, save the
visitors’ section (pen D), is to be for m em bers only to prevent away supporters buying tickets for the h om e
end. Finally, there is to be a phased programme which will extend seating to all spectators by 1991/1992.

  169. This incident and its aftermath prompt the query: d oes there have to be a disaster or near-disaster at
each ground to trigger radical action? I hope not.

   170. T he perm itted capacity o f the pen was exceeded, although it is not clear to what extent. The police
view is that it was only by about 60 persons. In a sense, the smaller the excess the m ore the point is m ade that
danger can occur very quickly on a standing terrace even with m oderate numbers. S o m e argue that reducing
numbers and giving spectators m ore room sim ply enables a surge to gather greater m om entum ; that the
tighter people are packed together the less the scope for surging or misbehaviour. This was the philosophy
which allowed excessive num bers to be packed into pens prior to Hillsborough. T he only sensible conclusion
is that unless both numbers and terrace layouts are strictly controlled, there will always be a risk o f crushing
on a standing terrace. The com b in a tio n o f numbers, excitem ent and partisanship, even leaving aside
misbehaviour, has a potential for danger.

   171. C om parison with criteria adopted abroad is instructive. France and Belgium adopt the Green G u id e
figure o f 5 .4 /m 2. But in H olland, the m ax im u m standing capacity is 4 /m 2. In Italy, the rule varies between
m unicipalities. In M ilan the figure is 2 /m 2. In R o m e it is 4 /m 2. But in Italy little difference is recognised in
principle between the figures perm issible for standing and those for sitting.

   172. Weighing all these factors I do not think it would be right to recom m end a substantial departure from
the effect o f the 15% interim reduction. Now, rather than take a figure and deduct a percentage from it, what
is required is a specific figure for maximum standing density when terrace conditions are good by Green Guide
criteria. I recommend that that figure should be 47 per 10 sq metres and I would substitute 47 for the figure of
54 in the Green Guide. The effect is approxim ately a 13% rather than a 15% reduction from the former figure
o f 54. I wish to stress as forcefully as I can, however, that this figure is a maximum and it is for the local
authority acting on the recommendation of its Advisory Group to make necessary and realistic reductions from
that figure in respect o f any feature o f the terrace which deviates significantly from Green Guide criteria or has
any other significant shortcoming.

Counting Them In
   173. It is no use fixing a m a x im u m capacity for a pen or enclosure unless there are reliable m ean s o f
ensuring it is not exceeded. I therefore repeat my recommendation that the number of spectators entering each
self-contained pen or other standing area m ust be lim ited electronically, m echanically, by a tick etin g
arrangement, by counting or otherwise. The best arrangement is o n e which m akes all facilities for a single
viewing area self-contained; access should be through turnstiles solely serving that area via a concourse doing
likewise with its own toilets and refreshment points. This point has already been clearly m ade in paragraphs
101 and 206 o f the Green G u id e:-

   “Each section should ideally be self-contained and should be serviced by its own entrance/exits,
   refreshment facilities and toilets. .


                                                           29
  That way the numbers can be accurately recorded at the turnstiles on entry and no extra spectators can get
into the area from elsewhere at half-time or after visiting co m m o n toilets or snack-bars.

  174. Arrangements must be made to close off further access to each pen or area when m aximum capacity is
about to be reached and to close the turnstiles leading to the relevant area.

Gangways
  175. The Green G uide, in paragraphs 97 to 99, m akes recom m endations as to gangways as follow s:-

  “Spectators should be discouraged from standing in lateral gangways because this disrupts free m ovem ent
  about the ground (or within sections o f it). Also, spectators on the terrace steps behind the gangway m ay
  have their view obstructed, which will cause them to stretch and strain, and so generate dangerous
  pressures within the crowd. Spectators would be discouraged from standing in these gangways if they were
  sunk from 100m m to 2 0 0 m m and if crush barriers were provided behind but not im m ediately in front o f
  them.

     Similarly, spectators should be discouraged from standing in radial gangways. T hese are relatively long
  and uncontrolled downward paths through terraces, and are difficult to keep clear, especially when sited in
  popular view ing areas, eg behind the goal area at a football ground. It is helpful to sink them 150m m to
  2 0 0 m m and to interrupt an otherwise con tinu ously d escending gangway by turns along, say, lateral
  gangways.

    Where sinking gangways, lateral or radial, is not thought to be practical, their boundaries should be
  highlighted with paint and spectators advised by signs not to stand there. Stewards m ay be needed to
  enforce this instruction.”

   176. In m y view these provisions need to be m uch tougher. I agree with the Technical Working Party that
gangways should be kept clear. There is no point in having them , in calling them gangways and in excluding
them from the area used to calculate capacity under paragraph 221 if spectators are allowed to stand in them.
The whole point o f crush barriers on terraces is to prevent unrestrained m ov em en t o f large m asses o f fans
from back to front down the terrace. It they are allowed to stand in the gangways where there are no barriers,
such m ovem en t can occur without inhibition. The incident at A yresom e Park on 9 D ecem b er 1989 involved
just that. Two surges causing crushing against the fence cam e down the terrace unrestrained by barriers.

   177. W hilst paragraph 98 o f the G u id e notes the difficulty o f keeping radial gangways clear, it can be done.
One way is to fix a radial rail on each side o f the gangway and parallel to it, inhibiting lateral m ovem en t into
the gangway from the standing areas. A nother surprisingly effective m ethod w hich I saw used successfully by
Millwall is to put red and white tapes in the sam e position to indicate the gangway as a no-go area for
standing.

  178. Gangways should be painted in a conspicuous colour (yellow is used m ost co m m o n ly ) whether they are
sunk or not. The Safety Certificate should require that no standing is allowed in gangways and that they be
painted.

Fencing
   179. Perhaps the most em o tiv e and disputed topic in this field is what should be done about perimeter
fences. T hey were installed at many grounds to prevent pitch invasions during the 1970s. After Hillsborough
there was a strong clam our to take them down. S o m e clubs did. Within weeks o f Hillsborough, however, there
were unruly incidents involving pitch invasions at m ore than one ground, as 1 noted in paragraph 308 o f my
Interim Report. 1 deferred making any interim recom m en dation involving structural alterations at the
interim stage, confining m yself to saying that gates to the pitch ought to be kept fully open.

   180. Since then, whilst visiting grounds, 1 have seen a full range o f practices from on e extrem e to the other.
There is no consensus. At so m e grounds eg Highbury, there have never been perimeter fences. At others, like
Anfield and W hite Hart Lane, there were fences but they have been taken down. At other grounds the fences
vary in height and design. S o m e are fearsome high structures with florid arrangements o f spikes, redolent o f
m edieval weaponry. They look more suited to a prison than a sports ground. C om ing down the scale, there
are high fences with only vertical spikes and lower fences without spikes; fences o f wire m esh and fences o f
strong metal; fences with a good provision o f gates directly to the pitch, fences w ith only o n e gate per large
pen (like Hillsborough), and som e with no gate at all (as in pen D at A yresom e Park). Again, so m e clubs have
left their gates to the pitch fully open as 1 recom m ended. S om e have taken the gates out and left blank spaces;


                                                         30
som e have o p en ed the gates but put red and white tape across the gap; others have kept the gates open during
the match, but closed them towards its con clusion to stop pitch invasions at the final whistle. Others again
have kept the gates closed and bolted but m a n n ed individually. At M illwall’s ground, an effective procedure
is followed before each m atch whereby it is an nou nced over the public address system that stewards will
dem onstrate the gates affording escape to the pitch. T h e stewards then do so in the m anner o f an air
stewardess dem onstrating em ergency procedures. T h e gates are then closed to, but not locked.

   181. T h is w id e variety o f practices is surprising. If a club were concerned only with its own supporters,
divergence o f practice w ould be readily understandable. Club A m ight say: “Our supporters can be trusted
not to invade the pitch; so no fencing”. Club B m ight say; “S o m e o f our supporters have shown that given the
chance they will invade the pitch, so we m ust have high fences to stop th em ”. But all the clubs in any division,
including clubs o f type A and B, visit each other; so on e has fans o f club B, used to being caged in at hom e,
being given the chance when visiting club A to invade the pitch. They do not seem to make a point o f doing so
with any frequency. H ow ever instances do occur, as I have m entioned; they are unpredictable and may
happen at any tim e d epending probably upon the occurrence o f som e incident thought to be provocative.
When they occur, they can cause serious danger. There is risk o f injury to players, to the referee and to the
police, quite apart from the risk o f injury through fighting between fans. It is true, as is often said, that so far
no fatality has resulted from a pitch invasion, whereas 95 p eople died against a fence installed to prevent such
invasion. But if fighting between fans starts on the pitch area, it is difficult to stop and injuries can be caused.
A tSelhurst Park on 13 May 1989, five police officers and 16 supporters required hospital treatment.

   182. Since each club in a League d iv isio n has to cope during the season with at least so m e o f the
supporters o f all the other clubs in the div ision , the widely differing solutions to the fencing problem m ust be
due to different attitudes rather than objectively different needs. T h e different attitudes taken by clubs or
local authorities stem from the difficulty in balancing or deciding the priority o f three crucial considerations:

    i.    Fences, especially high, spiked fences, are intim idating, ugly and demoralising.

    ii.   A dequate measures m ust be taken to prevent pitch invasions for the reasons already given.

    iii. W hatever the m easures taken to prevent pitch invasions, there m ust be adequate provision for
         escape in emergencies.

   183. At so m e grounds, p oint ii. has been regarded as param ount so that i. has had to give way. At others,
either p oint i. or, especially after Hillsborough, p oint iii. have carried greatest weight so as to rem ove or
greatly reduce the fencing.

  184. Is there any way o f achieving a satisfactory balance o f all three considerations? 1 believe so: that it is
possible to have sufficient obstacles to pitch invasion w ithout prison-type fences and also to provide for
escape in emergency. I deal with the three considerations in turn.

  i. H igh Spiked Fences
   185. I agree with the view that high, prison-type fences with spikes and overhanging sections should go. The
spectacle o f these huge cage-like fences is inconsistent with a sports ground being for pleasure and recreation.
Moreover, I believe such intim idatory fences have an adverse affect on both the morale and the behaviour o f
fans. T hey feel badly treated. Having to stand in a cage for your Saturday afternoon recreation inevitably
causes resentm ent. R esentm ent often results in hostility to those controlling the match. A sour relationship
develops and continues between the fans and those in authority, m aking the jo b o f p olice and stewards much
more difficult. Being inside the cage provokes so m e to hurl abuse or m issiles at those outside, rival fans,
players or police. T h e security o f the fencing (in that the rival fans cannot penetrate it) encourages bravado to
indulge in such activity. T he spiked fences im ply an expectation that trouble will or may occur. T hey also
hamper a clear view o f the game. To rem ove them w ould signal the advent o f a new future for football and
especially a new attitude from the authorities to the spectators. Accordingly, I consider that w hen perimeter
fencing is used it should not exceed a prescribed m ax im u m height and all spike arrangements and top
sections angled inwards should go. This view is in accord with the recom m en dation o f the Technical Working
Party (A ppendix 3 paragraph 20). But what should be the prescribed m a xim u m height? That leads to
consideration ii.




                                                          31
  ii. Adequate M easures to Prevent Pitch Invasions
  186. UEFA regulation B6 o f 1988 requires as follow s:-

  “Protection o f the playing field by m eans o f

  (a)   a fence o f at least 2.2 metres in height or a m oat or else

  (b)   a barrier with adequate policing so as to make it im possible for spectators to enter the field o f play.

  Fences m ust have sufficient security gates op ening towards the playing field and in the case o f m oats or a
com b ination o f m oats and fences adequate other security passages should be p rovided”.

   187. Inquiries show that the figure o f 2.2 metres was chosen sim ply by reference to the height o f existing
fencing at various grounds especially in West G erm any and the need to choose a height o f fence which would
am ount to “a real obstruction” to pitch invasion. As to the word “im possible” sim ilar inquiries suggest that
the intention was to leave it to the police co m m and er to decide what resources he m ight need. Should a pitch
invasion occur, UEFA would consider all the circum stances before d eciding what if any action to take.

   188. In my view a fence should be o f sufficient height to be a serious obstacle to pitch invasion. It should
provide sufficient obstruction to enable the p olice to take tim ely action should pitch invasion be attem pted
without being so high as seriously to interfere with v ision or to give a feeling o f im prisonm ent. Although I
appreciate the U EFA regulation says “at least 2.2 m etres”, these criteria lead me to recommend that
perimeter fencing should be no higher than 2.2 metres. T hat m easurement I take from ground level at the
front o f the terrace to the top o f the fencing ie the 2.2 m etres m ay consist entirely o f fencing or partly o f wall
and partly o f fencing m o un ted on the wall. For exam ple, at Ibrox Park the fencing is about 1.45 metres high
but it is m oun ted on a wall and the total height o f wall and fence is 2.2 metres.

  189. In making this recom m en dation I am merely indicating a m ax im u m height should perim eter fencing
be used. I do not suggest there must be such fencing or indeed any fencing. Th ose clubs w hich presently have
no perimeter fencing m ay well think it safe to con tinu e that way. Others may em ulate them . Still m ore may
consider that they can dispense with fencing or bring it to a lower level than 2.2 metres in front o f their family
areas or their seated areas. As the seating areas increase it should progressively be foun d possible to achieve a
corresponding reduction in fencing. T h ese options, subject to the m ax im u m height o f 2.2 m etres w hich I
have indicated, should be left to the discretion o f local authorities acting on the ad vice o f their A dvisory
Group which will have consulted the club and supporters.

  190. I should m ake clear that I have thus far referred only to perimeter fencing at the pitch side o f viewing
areas. Different considerations m ay well apply to the height o f radial fencing used to segregate rival fans. T he
m axim um height o f such fences should be a matter for local decision and may d epend for exam ple on
whether there are sterile areas between pens o f rival fans; but I still recommend that no spikes be used.

   191. S om e may feel I am being naive or over-optim istic in recom m ending that fencing be brought down to
a lower level. Hooligans m ay take advantage o f this relaxation to have, literally, a field day. However, I draw
attention to those grounds where fences have already been brought down to or below the level I recom m en d
and others where there are none at all. If we wish to m ake progress, so m e initiative m ust surely be taken to
stop the cycle o f bad behaviour met with repression inducing worse behaviour.

   192. Besides, there are other ways o f deterring pitch invasions than by dauntingly fortified fences. O ne is
to balance the lowering o f the fences with a prohibition against going on to the pitch w ithout reasonable
excuse. I shall deal with that in the next chapter. T he other is by alternative physical means.

Safety Corridors
   193. One m ethod has been adopted, so far successfully, at Anfield, G o o d iso n Park and W hite Hart Lane.
It involves reserving a safety corridor or dry m oat between the front row o f standing spectators and a
perimeter fence or wall o f moderate proportions. T h e two photographs A ppendix 6 illustrate the Liverpool
and Everton versions o f it. T he front few steps o f the terrace are sacrificed as a view ing area and left as a
sterile strip. Behind that area, the front row o f crush barriers is filled in and m ade co n tinu ous with no gaps.
T he Everton version has no fence above the perim eter wall. At A nfield there is a low red rail fence. That
arrangement does not absolutely prevent pitch invasion, but it inhibits it. Moreover, anyone or any group
m inded to get to the pitch has first to get over the front crush barrier, then cross the corridor, then get up the
steps or over the wall onto the perimeter track. At W hite Hart Lane there is finally a line o f advertising
hoardings to be scaled. By that tim e the police should be able to intervene. At high-risk m atches no doubt
police could patrol the sterile area.


                                                          32
M oats
   194. The safety corridor at these three grounds is not truly a dry m oat. But I have seen exam ples both in
Holland and Italy o f a concrete dry m oat providing a total obstacle to pitch invasion. At Utrecht, there is a
deep broad moat; provision is m ade to enable spectators to descend into the m oat and use it as a passageway
for entrance and exit. A photograph is at A ppendix 7. At the San Siro stadium in M ilan, there is a similar
m oat at one side o f the ground w hich will be extended all round. At present there is no provision for access to
it or across it to the pitch but I was told in R om e that access to the pitch by bridges will have to be provided to
accord with the Italian regulations.

   195. To interpose a full scale m oat o f the U trecht or M ilan type between the spectators and the pitch
requires considerable space. It is easier to provide it as an integral part o f the design o f a new stadium than to
introduce it as a m odification o f an old one. At m ost U K grounds the space between pitch and spectators is
very lim ited and to introduce a m oat would involve a large loss o f view ing area. N evertheless, it is a solution
worthy o f consideration and especially so fo r a new stadium . Its advantage is that it effectively prevents pitch
invasion without im peding vision or im porting a prison atmosphere. A few rows back from it, you are not
even aware o f its existence. Its disadvantage, apart from the space it requires, is the difficulty o f co m b ining it
with access to the pitch in emergencies.

  iii Emergency Escape
   196. Hillsborough showed conclusively that, if there are to be perimeter fences, there m ust be sufficient
gates to perm it escape to the pitch and they m ust be im m ediately available in an emergency. That lesson was
reaffirmed by the recent incident at Ayresome Park. I know there is a school o f thought opposed to access to
the pitch in any circumstances, preferring that alternative evacuation routes should all be away from the
pitch. Thus, at som e grounds (Hillsborough was one) em ergency plans d id not require gates to the pitch or
take any such existing gates into account in calculating the tim e required for alternative routes o f evacuation.
At Hillsborough, evacuation was to be via the central tunnel, or alternatively through the radial gates at the
back o f the terrace and round the ends o f the west stand. But, if the em ergency arises at the front o f the
terraces (as it did) those alternative routes cannot and d id not afford tim ely relief. Presently, although
emergency access to the pitch could readily be gained at both A nfield and G oo d iso n Park, the plans do not
rely on em ergency evacuation in that direction. The tragic Bradford City disaster, in w hich fire swiftly
engulfed a stand, w ould have caused m uch greater loss o f life had there not been ready access to the pitch. It
can no doubt be argued that inflam m able stands with neglected underspaces should not recur, that with
m odern stands constructed o f non-inflam m able m aterials there should be no risk o f another Bradford, and
that if capacities and safety measures are observed no Hillsborough situation should recur. The solem n fact is
that those two disasters d id occur. One cannot predict what em ergency m ay arise to m ake evacuation away
from the pitch either w holly impractical or too slow.

  197. T h e U EFA regulation cited above recognises that where there are fences access to the pitch should be
preserved. I agree with that view and recommend that emergency access to the pitch should be provided.

   198. How should this be done? There is no significant problem where there are either no fences or none
higher than crush barrier level. At Anfield or G o od iso n Park, for exam ple, it w ould not be difficult to get over
the front crush barrier into the “dry m o a t” and thence to the pitch. That arrangement could be m o d ified to
include radial gangways at intervals running straight down to the “dry m o a t” through gaps in the front
barrier. This w ould give even readier access. It m ust be for local jud gem en t to balance the need for ready
access to the pitch in em ergencies with the need to deter such access otherwise.

   199. T he m ore difficult problem arises at grounds where fences o f up to 2.2 m etres are d eem ed necessary.
In such fences there must, in my view, be sufficient gates not less than 1.1 metre in width as approved by the
Green Guide. It is no use seeking to specify how m any gates will be required by reference to the length o f
fencing at the front o f a given pen or other enclosure. T he length o f the frontage is only one factor. Much will
d epend on the depth o f the terrace and the num bers it is perm itted to hold. I prefer, in concurrence with the
Technical Working Party (A ppendix 3 paragraph 22) to say that the gates should be sufficient in number to
enable the pen or other enclosure to be evacuated in the time required for any other emergency evacuation route.
Such gates should be evenly spaced along the frontage of the pen to avoid congestion on exit.

The G ates at N im es
   200. O n e solution to this problem is the system installed in the new stadium at N im es w hich I visited
together with the Assessors. There, the fence consists o f a num ber o f electrically operated panels w hich open
as gates to the pitch, as shown in A ppendix 8. There are six sections o f the ground. T he fencing in each section
is governed by a trigger gate which may be operated electrically or manually. The post upon w hich it is


                                                          33
m oun ted has an electro-magnet which holds the m echan ism inside the post in a position keeping the gate
shut. W hen a button is pressed, the m agnet is de-activated, the gate descends in its m o u n tin g and is free to
swing towards the pitch. As it does so, it releases the next gate which is also m oun ted on a sw ivelling device
within its post, operating by gravity to open the gate. This d o m in o effect continues throughout the section. It
can be arrested by som eo n e leaning against on e o f the gates from the pitch side but how far anyone there
could withstand substantial crowd pressure is doubtful. The trigger gate can be operated m anually but this
seem ed to require considerable force. To shut the gate again seem ed to require considerable force and a lifting
m otion. T he gates are about nine inches higher than the front floor o f the terrace, but there is no sum p such as
often exists in grounds in the U K . The system could be adapted to U K grounds but there are a num ber o f
factors upon which greater reassurance m ight be required. If the gates were fixed on top o f a low wall such as
that at Leppings Lane, there would be a danger o f crushing in the sum p or at least o f broken lim bs as people
tried to get out. The system has been in operation at N im e s for only a few m onths and has not been severely
tested to show that it would be effective under crowd pressure. Although a firm is licensed to market the
system in 34 countries worldwide, our inform ation is that so far they have been fitted only at N im e s and
Toulon although one or two other French clubs are interested. In these circum stances the robustness o f the
fencing and the effects o f English w eather upon it are as yet unproved. At N im es the system operates with a
level walkway on the spectators’ side o f the fencing. Apart from a very small step, the pitch is at the sam e
level. To achieve this arrangement w ould require considerable alteration to the layout o f m any U K grounds
involving in particular raising the lower part o f terraces to m ake them level with the pitch and with the
bottom o f the fencing.

Gates Unlocked
   201. I m ade an interim recom m endation to leave gates fully open when the pen or enclosure was
occupied. This was for three stated reasons; first, to afford instant access to the pitch; secondly, to provide
visual reassurance to fans after Hillsborough that there was an escape route and thirdly, to keep police and
stewards alert to con d itio n s inside the gateway. I also had in m ind that the num bers and size o f gates might at
so m e grounds be inadequate and I was not m aking any recom m en dation for structural change at that stage.
Along with reduced capacities, provision o f sufficient gates and lower fences, I m ust now consider whether to
keep or m od ify my recom m en dation to leave gates fully open. I know that so m e Police C om m and ers have
been anxious that to d o so is an invitation to pitch invasion; hence the practice at so m e grounds o f closing the
gates near the end o f the game or keeping them shut but not locked. I would still hope that gates would be left
fully open wherever those in command feel this can safely be done. However, I recommend that whether they be
fully open, partially open or closed they be kept unlocked throughout the period when the pen or enclosure is
occupied. They should thus be easily available for em ergency exits and spectators should be confident o f this.

   202. I repeat my interim recommendation that all gates in radial and perimeter fences of pens or other
self-contained areas should be painted in a different colour from the rest o f the fences and marked “Emergency
Exit”.

Authorising Access to the Pitch
  203. Interim recom m endation num ber 9 provided as follow s:-

  “ * 9. There should be in respect o f each gate in a perimeter fence (or group o f gates if they are close
  together) a police officer authorised to decide whether or not to allow spectators through a gate to relieve
  overcrow ding. . .”

    D espite the much greater alertness to the possibility o f an em ergency which now exists, following
Hillsborough, I still believe it necessary to m ake a recom m en dation to ensure that proper provision is m ade
for swift action to authorise the opening o f gates in the event o f an emergency. However, it has been drawn to
m y attention that strict observance o f this interim recom m en dation verges on the absurd where a pen
contains only a handful o f spectators. Moreover, to be boun d to provide a police officer at each gate or group
o f gates in all circum stances involves a heavy co m m itm e n t o f police m anpow er which would be even heavier
with an increase in the num ber o f gates. Accordingly, I have decided to recommend that although each gate
should be manned when the enclosure is occupied, whether such manning should be by a police officer or by a
steward is for the Police Commander to decide. In either event plans should ensure that the police can authorise
access through gates to the pitch immediately in the event o f an emergency.

Monitoring Crowd Density
  204. It is con ven ient to m en tion a m odification I think sensible regarding interim recom m en dation 5.
That p rovided:-


                                                          34
  “ * 5. At each match, there should be on the perimeter track, for each self-contained pen or other terraced
  area, a steward (if the club is m onitoring that area) or a police officer (if the p olice are m onitoring it) w hose
  sole duty is to check crowd con d ition s in that area for possible overcrowding or distress throughout the
  period the area is occupied by spectators. W h oever is so ap poin ted should be in addition to any other
  steward or p o lice presence. H e should have ready access to the p olice officer authorised under
  R eco m m en d a tio n 9 below, and by radio to the control ro o m .”

  I repeat that recommendation (with a slight change o f wording to achieve clarity) but qualify it to avoid
absurdity w hen numbers are sm all. T he recommendation need not be applied to any self-contained pen or other
standing area where the spectators present, or reasonably to be expected, during a particular match do not
exceed one third o f the area’s m aximum permitted capacity, or 2,000, whichever is the lower.

Cutting Equipment
  205. In the im m e d ia te aftermath o f Hillsborough, I reco m m en ded that suitable and sufficient cutting
equ ipm en t should be provided to enable spectators to be released from behind perim eter fencing. A ssu m in g
the recom m en ded m ax im u m capacities are observed, that fences are lowered, that sufficient gates are
provided and left unlocked, cutting eq u ipm en t should not be necessary. Som eth in g in these provisions w ould
have to go badly wrong for such eq u ipm en t to be required. N evertheless, I recommend that the equipment
should be m aintained in case o f som e unforeseen emergency.

Functions o f P olice and Stewards
   2 0 6. W hich functions should be discharged by the police and w hich by the club’s stewards is on e o f the
m ost vexed questions. To describe the background to the argument I can do no better than repeat what I said
in my Interim Report at pages 28 and 29.

  “W h o should M on itor the Terraces?

     161. Shou ld it be the host club via its stewards? Should it be both? Or should it be by arrangement,
  d epending upon the ground or section o f the ground in question?

    162. In principle, a football club which invites the public to a match on its prem ises for reward is
  responsible for securing safety at that event. T he Green G u id e (1 9 8 6 ) provides:


    “23. T he safety o f the public inside the ground is the responsibility o f those who stage the event and
    adm inister the ground in w hich it is held, ie the “m anagem ent”. This responsibility applies in both
    normal and emergency s it u a tio n s . . .

     195. . . . there are five basic duties which stewards are called upon to carry out. T hese are:

         (a) controlling or directing m em bers o f the public who are entering or leaving the ground, to help
         achieve an even flow o f people to the view ing areas and safe dispersal o f spectators on the terraces or
         v iew in g slopes;

         (b) patrolling the ground to deal with any em ergencies, eg raising alarms or extinguishing fires;

         (c) m anning entrances, exits and other strategic points, especially exit doors and gates which are
         continuously open whilst the ground is in use;

          (d) assisting police as appropriate or as requested with crowd control; and

          (e) undertaking specific duties in an emergency.”

   T he Interim Popplewell Report
      163. There was considerable controversy in the course o f the public inquiry held by Mr Justice
   Popplewell in 1985 as to the responsibility o f the club and the police. In paragraph 3.6 o f his interim report,
   M r Justice Popplewell quoted from a report produced for the M inister o f H o u sin g and Local G overnm ent
   in 1969 as follow s:-

     “T he responsibility for controlling crowd behaviour is d ivid ed between the police and the club operating
   the ground. T h e broad line o f d iv ision being that p olice are responsible for m ovem en t o f spectators in
   public thoroughfares and from public thoroughfares into the ground, while the club is responsible for the
   control o f spectators once they are on the club’s prem ises . .


                                                           35
  Mr Justice Popplewell said he did not quarrel with that view and went on to observe that in practice the
  p olice have to take charge and be responsible for controlling crowd behaviour. He then said (paragraph
  3.8):

    “It follows, therefore, that as a m atter o f practice, while the physical safety o f the building and the
    m aintenance and good housekeeping o f the ground m ust always be the responsibility o f the club, the
    p olice have to take the de facto responsibility o f organising the crowd, with all that entails, during the
    gam e...”

  Mr Justice Popplewell went on to instance evacuation o f the ground as a procedure in which only the police
  could bear the responsibility o f supervising the organisation o f the crowd.

  T he Final Popplewell Report
      164. H e harked back to this subject in chapter 4 o f his Final Report. There, he cam e down m ore firmly
  in favour o f holding the club responsible for crowd safety. At paragraph 4.13 he said “Because, as a matter
  o f practice, police officers have regularly attended in large num bers at football grounds, it has som eh ow
  been assum ed by the clubs that the responsibility for control o f what goes on inside the ground has passed
  from them to the police. A police presence is there to assist in the enforcem ent o f law and order. Th ose
  responsible for organising a private function, however, have the primary and continuing obligation and
  responsibility to ensure reasonable safety for those who are in vited on to their prem ises.” Mr Justice
  Popplewell end ed that section as follows: “It cannot be too strongly em p hasised that it is upon the club, or
  the occupier o f the ground w ho is putting on the function, that the primary and con tinu in g obligation
  rests.”

     165. There remains, however, the question whether there are so m e grounds or parts o f grounds where
  the club m ay n eed to rely upon the police (w hom they pay to attend) to control filling o f pens and
  m onitoring them for overcrowding. In other words, whilst the duty in law to ensure safety rests upon the
  club, they m ay need, and by agreement be entitled, to em ploy the police to act as their agents in certain
  circum stances. This very difficult and grey area as to club and police responsibility will need to be reviewed
  in greater depth at stage two o f this Inquiry.”

  Since Hillsborough was concerned with a disaster on the terraces, I headed that passage “W h o should
m onitor the terraces?” . But the w ider question is: w ho should control the entry o f spectators, their placing
and m ovem en t whilst in the ground and their exit from it? It is undisputed that the club, as a matter o f law,
has a duty to take reasonable care for the safety o f the spectators invited to its premises. There have, however,
been two practical difficulties about the club, rather than the police, being de facto in charge.

   207. First, the club discharges its duty through stewards. T hey are part-time em ployees or assistants whose
duties are con fined to match days. M any o f them are seasoned supporters o f the club and som e tend to be
elderly: others are keen young supporters. D u e either to age or youth, m any therefore lack the physique to
cope with awkward customers. They are usually not well paid, part o f their “rem uneration” (indeed all o f it at
som e clubs) consisting o f the opportunity to see the game. As the subm ission from the A ssociation o f C h ief
Police Officers o f England, Wales and N orthern Ireland (ACPO) puts it:

  “(Stewards) are at best casual workers (usually working one day in two weeks), they are probably not people
  w ho have a supervisory role in ordinary life and are not always equipped or used to giving directions or
  facing obstruction. Many are retired people and pay is not so attractive as to guarantee c o m m itm e n t.”

  W hilst there are exceptions, I have frequently been told that the stewards presently em p loyed at m any
clubs are o f lim ited capacity and reliability.

  208. Secondly, there has to be a police presence at a m atch to m aintain law and order. Police are trained to
give and enforce instructions. This, together with the uniform they wear and the respect for and fear o f the
law which the majority o f spectators have, gives the police far m ore authority than stewards. Moreover, if
trouble arises, whether from m isbehaviour or from any other cause, the police will inevitably be drawn into
assum ing control. T hey have all the m eans to do so at their disposal - the control room, the CCTV, the
planned d eploym ent o f serials o f officers round the ground, a co m m u n ica tio n s system to co-ordinate them
and reserves on call. The su bm ission from A CPO suggests that in these circum stances, and to avoid
confusion, the police ought to accept prim e responsibility for controlling the crowd. I quote two passages
from their argument:


                                                        36
                                                                                                   T                     -




 “It m ay be that the am biguous position o f the p olice is part o f the problem - that is acknowledging the
 club’s responsibility for safety on the o n e hand, whilst routinely assum ing all those tasks o f stewarding
 w hich the stewards cannot do, either because o f the truculence o f supporters or the lim ited talents o f the
 stewards them selves, on the other. It has to be said that the present lack o f clarity in these arrangements can
 lead to som ething o f a ‘dog’s dinner’. In so m e clubs the police actively control the stewards, in others the
 stewards are quite independent and, despite so m e im provem ents, standards o f stewarding vary
 considerably with many being too old or sim ply unreliable...

    ... It m ay be better to acknowledge that if trouble is anticipated or if crowd control is going to test the
  ground capacities then, in the interests o f public safety, police should take control over the stewards
  through their supervisory chain” .

    “As to the question o f ‘responsibility’, the m atter o f civil liability should not cause us to resile from our
  decision s if they are necessary. D ual responsibility for safety is a recipe for confusion. T he police are always
  going to seize the initiative in a crisis; crowd control is always going to be inextricably linked to criminal
  hooliganism : the police are never going to accept direction from stewards; stewarding will never (at least
  not in the foreseeable future) be able to cope w ithout so m e law enforcem ent backup; and finally p olice do
  ‘own’ m ost o f the m eans o f control. In these circum stances the police m ust accept a leading role and,
  despite the requirements and civil liabilities o f football clubs, them selves take on supervision o f the overall
  conduct o f events wherever crowd safety is an issue.”

   209. T h e question is on e o f balance. Carrying delegation to its ultimate, clubs could lean back and leave it
to the police to take over the m anagem ent o f spectators from street to terraces and back again, with stewards
performing a m in im a l role. This w ould in v o lv e a very heavy p olice co m m itm e n t and in deed the
co m m itm e n t at present is very substantial. As already indicated, so m e 5,000 officers or m ore are deployed
every Saturday at football matches.

Costs of P olice and Stewards
  210. T h e tem ptation to the clubs to leave it all to the police is stronger if they are not required to m ake
realistic p aym ent for police services. N o charge is m ade for officers outside the ground since m aintaining law
and order in the streets is a normal public function o f the police. At the present time, the practice as to
recovering costs o f policing inside the grounds from clubs varies greatly from place to place, different
formulae being used. In som e areas, the charge m ade is the actual cost o f the officers attending in the ground.
At others, it is m ade on a sliding scale dep en dent on w hether the match is category A (high-risk) B or C. At
others it is dep en dent on the size o f the crowd attending. At som e, it appears to be entirely arbitrary and at
on e ground it is said to be nil. In my view a more consistent and b usinesslike approach should be made to such
charges. If clubs were to find it more econom ical to recruit efficient stewards than to delegate duties to the
police, there could be a significant reduction in the num ber o f police deployed at football grounds to the
benefit o f the com m u n ity at large. If this is to happen, stewards must be fit, active and robust. I would suggest
they should be between the ages o f 18 and 55. They must also be fully trained. Som e clubs presently have
efficient stewards w h o m they recruit individually and train fully with the assistance o f the police. Others hire
security firms to bring in a well-trained team o f stewards.

D ivision o f Functions
  211. There are clearly many aspects o f crowd control and m anagem ent w hich are capable o f being carried
out by efficient stewards. M anning gates, directing spectators to the correct areas and to their seats, keeping
gangways clear, m onitoring the density o f packing in pens or enclosures - indeed, the duties specified in
paragraph 195 o f the Green G uide, as already quoted. At m ost grounds, and in m ost parts o f each ground,
these duties ought to be capable o f being performed by properly trained stewards. W here that is so, clubs
should require stewards to perform the duties and should not take the op tion o f leaving all to the police.

  212. However, I accept that there m ay well be particular areas o f a ground, perhaps on visitors’ terraces
and particularly at high-risk matches, which call for the greater authority and resilience o f the police. What
the d iv isio n o f functions should be must be a matter for local decision and in the last resort for the Police
C om m and er to determine.

Written Statem ent o f Intent
  213. I therefore repeat my recommendation that there should be a written document setting out the
respective functions o f club and police for crowd safety and control “and in particular for the filling o f each
self-contained pen or other terraced area and the monitoring o f spectators in each such pen or area to avoid


                                                          37
overcrowding.” (Interim recom m en dation 4). T he aim should be for the club through its stewards to perform
all those functions o f controlling spectators o f w hich they are capable having regard to the quality o f the
stewards, the layout o f the ground and the nature o f the match. W here they are not able to discharge any such
function the police should perform it. As the proportion o f seating at grounds increases, control by stewards
should b eco m e the norm.


  214. In making interim recom m en dation 4, I used the phrase “written agreem ent”. This led to anxiety
that what was required was a binding legal contract which would deprive the police o f any flexibility in
response to circum stances o f the day. M y intention was not to shackle either party by a b inding contract; it
was sim ply to have a d ocu m ent setting out how functions were to be divided so that no m isunderstanding
could arise whereby o n e party thought the other had undertaken som e duty and v ice versa. I am content that
the document be referred to sim ply as a “statement o f intent”, so that it can be subject to alteration without
breach o f contract should circum stances so dem and.


Police Commanders
   215. The ultimate control at any match m ust b e that o f the Police Comm ander. H e has authority to decide
how many officers he needs and to deploy them in and outside the ground. H e has, if necessary, to take such
d ecisions as to postpone kick-off, to stop the m atch, to evacuate the ground or any area o f it. Police
C om m anders tend to remain in post for lengthy periods. T hey thus acquire skill, experience and special
knowledge o f the problems at their particular ground. However, there m ust com e a tim e for change. It is then
essential for the new C om m and er to have adequate tim e and training to acquaint h im s e lf w ith his functions
and the problems o f policing peculiar to the ground. Training for such functions should be the subject o f a
specific course to be attended by senior officers presently acting as Police Commanders and those in line to do
so. Such a course would give induction training in the basic strategy o f policing football m atches and would also
give opportunity for the pooling o f experience and the solution o f co m m on problems.


Rate o f Adm ission
   216. An important causative factor at Hillsborough was the congestion w hich built up outside the
turnstiles in the last 20 m inutes before kick-off. Twenty-three turnstiles were required to adm it 2 4 ,2 5 6
spectators; only seven turnstiles were available to adm it the 10,100 with tickets for the west terraces. Much
was m ade in evidence o f the late arrival o f the Liverpool fans. However, further ev idence at stage two o f the
Inquiry suggests that the late arrival o f large num bers is a co m m o n feature at m any grounds. Apart from
those wishing to drink as long as possible (w hom I consider in chapter 6) there are m any w ho do not care to
stand or even sit for a long period in addition to the 90 m inutes o f the match. Moreover, at all-ticket matches
or to those with tickets in seated areas, there seem s little reason to arrive early since places are assured. The
absence o f any attractive pre-match entertainm ent is a further d isincentive to early arrival. W hilst measures
should be taken to encourage earlier entry to the ground, it is essential that turnstiles or other entrances can
cope safely and efficiently with spectators as and w hen they arrive. To do this requires sufficient turnstiles or
other entrances to admit, if necessary, a large late influx w ithout dangerous congestion. That involves
assessing the rate o f flow through turnstiles or gates and the tim e w ithin w hich they should be capable o f
adm itting all the spectators they are intended to serve.


   2 17. I accept the view o f the Technical Working Party that the Green G uide figure o f 7 50 persons per hour
is too optim istic a turnstile flow-rate. It m ay be achieved or even bettered in ideal co n d itions. But as soon as
there is a build-up, the flow-rate will dim inish. There are also delays caused by those with no tickets, those
with wrong tickets or other problems. I accept the recommendation that 660 should be the m aximum notional
rate. The Green Guide should be amended accordingly.


  218. I repeat my interim recommendation that the turnstiles serving a discrete area should be capable o f
admitting its holding capacity within one hour. U n less this can be done, there will be a risk o f serious
congestion in the last half or quarter o f an hour. I f it cannot be done, the permitted capacity o f the area must be
reduced accordingly. T h is recommendation relates to one o f the crucial matters contained in the original section
2(2)(c)(i) o f the 1975 Act and should therefore be a requirement o f the Safety Certificate.


C ommunications
  219. The efficient deploym ent and co-ordination o f police and stewards d epend upon effective systems o f
com m un ication . R adio system s are susceptible to two problems; excessive air traffic on the channels in use
and the vo lu m e o f n oise from the crowd.


                                                         38
  220. If large numbers o f officers are issued with radios and are all entitled to use the sam e channel,
confusion m ay result should a m ajor incident occur. In such an event, m any officers m ay wish to speak
simultaneously. Especially if the channel is used on “talk-through” (whereby all officers including those in
control give and receive m essages w ithout priority) the C om m a n d er in the police room m ay be unable
effectively to issue orders. Again, i f the level o f crowd n oise is high, as it often is, an officer on the perimeter
track m ay have great difficulty in hearing m essages. Although ear pieces are o f so m e assistance, they are not
totally successful in excluding crowd noise and are not usually issued to every officer carrying a radio.

  221. M r Justice Popplewell in his Interim Report recom m en ded that “early attention should be given by
the H o m e O ffice Directorate o f Telecom m unications to consider the practicality o f producing a more
suitable personal radio for the p olice” . In his Final Report, he returned to the subject at paragraphs
4.1 0 2 -1 0 4 . By that time, he reported that “a detailed study is being co m m issio n ed by the H o m e Office
Directorate o f T elecom m u nications into the problem o f personal radios”.

  222. T he Directorate produced an upgraded specification. As a result, supplies o f two new m odels have
been m ade available. T h ey are the Philips P F X and the M otorola M T 6 0 0 E . T h ese radios have greater range
and clarity than those previously used. T h ey also give access to m any m ore channels. To take advantage o f
this, the police have been allocated eight additional U H F frequencies.

  223. Police C om m anders have told m e that, in ad dition to any other channel or channels in use, there
should always be a command channel reserved solely for the Police Commander to communicate with h is senior
officers round the ground. T h is is o f the first im portance since it enables the C om m a n d er to use the
information com ing to him in the control room to deploy his forces prom ptly and effectively at any part o f
the ground w ithout radio interruption. I recommend this should be done.

  224. As suggested by the Technical Working Party, I repeat the recommendations I made in my Interim
Report as to communications, with one exception. A sentence in on e recom m endation suggested that
“consideration should also be given to the use by p olice officers o f a sim ple code o f hand signals to indicate to
the control room the existence o f certain emergencies or requirem ents.” I am persuaded by evidence from the
police that the use o f hand signals could create a risk o f confusion and I do not therefore repeat that suggestion.

Other Topics in the Green Guide
  225. 1 have in this chapter considered specifically a num ber o f key safety factors covered by the Green
Guide. I have suggested respects in w hich the G uide should be strengthened or am ended. In addition to those
topics, the Technical Working Party considered a number o f further aspects of safety - crush barriers, stands,
ingress and egress, stairways and ramps, inspections and testing, fire safety, emergency power and disabled
spectators. I accept and adopt the Technical Working Party’s Report and recommendations on those matters
(Appendix 3). W ithout repeating them in this text, I add only a few additional com m ents.

   226. A s to crush barriers, paragraphs 25 to 28 o f their report recom m end a sim pler and clearer test
procedure than that in the current G uide. In particular, the values to be achieved by way o f percentage recovery
after the required loading test will depend upon the material from which the barrier is constructed eg concrete,
steel or wrought iron. W hen the Guide is revised, acceptable values for various materials should be specified.

   227. T he Green G u id e does, in paragraph 6 o f A nnex C, refer to the possibility o f doubts arising as to the
safety o f a barrier “for any reason (including such matters as cracking o f the terracing or distortion o f
co n n ection s)”. It does not, however, presently m ake any special m en tion o f the need to inspect crush barriers
for possible corrosion. T he evidence from the Health and Safety Executive after their inspection o f barriers
at Hillsborough suggests that corrosion is a serious threat to the safety o f metal barriers. W hen the Green
Guide is revised, the need to inspect for possible corrosion should be specifically mentioned and emphasised.

Co-ordination of Emergency Services
  228. It is vital that adequate provision should be m ade for possible em ergencies arising from fire or
accident and from illness or injuries however caused. I repeat the recommendations I made in my Interim
Report regarding co-ordination o f the emergency services. In addition, although it is m en tion ed in paragraph
176 o f the Green G uide, I em phasise that “jo in t consultation between m anagem ent, police, fire, am bulance
and other emergency services should take place in order to produce agreed plans o f action for all foreseeable
types o f em ergency/1 Such plans should include, for exam ple, contingency arrangements for a d m issions to
particular hospitals in the event o f a num ber o f casualties and consideration o f possible casualty clearing
areas at the sports ground. Lines o f communication, w hether by telephone or by radio, from the police control
room to the local headquarters o f all emergency services should be maintained at all times so that emergency
calls can be made instantly.
First Aid, M edical Facilities and Ambulances
   229. T he scale o f available medical facilities has been the subject o f controversy. After Hillsborough, there
were com plaints o f insufficient basic equ ipm en t such as stretchers. I repeat what I said in my Interim Report
at paragraphs 298 and 2 9 9 :-

  “298. It w ould be unreasonable to expect, at any sports stadium , m edical facilities capable o f dealing with
  a m ajor disaster such as occurred. To have in advance at the ground, oxygen, resuscitators, stretchers, other
  equ ipm en t and medical staff sufficient to deal with over 100 casualties is not practicable.

    2 99. W hat is required is a basic level o f provision for first aid, for professional m edical attention and for
  a m bulance attendance, together with a system o f co-ordination w ith the em ergency services w hich will
  bring them to the scene swiftly in whatever numbers are required. W hat will am oun t to an appropriate
  basic provision for the future eg the equ ipm en t in a first aid room, requires expert evaluation and a d v ice”.

  2 3 0. The Scottish ambulance service has developed a “major incident equipment vehicle” designed and
equipped to deal with up to 50 casualties. It is packed with 50 stretchers, blankets, and medical supplies and is
in effect a travelling storehouse for such equipment. A vehicle o f that type is deployed in addition to other
ambulance attendance at m atches with crowds over 25,000. T h is provision goes a long way towards m eeting the
criticism raised after H illsborough and I recommend that it be adopted elsew here.

  231. I repeat the Interim Recomm endations I made under this heading subject to two variations. First, it has
been sensibly urged that it is unreasonable to require a m edical practitioner to be present throughout a match
where attendance is very small. At such a m atch it is suggested that to have a m edical practitioner on call
would be sufficient. I agree with this and recommend that the full-tim e presence o f a doctor should not be
required where there is no reasonable expectation o f more than 2,000 spectators attending.

   232. Secondly, so m e clubs have told m e that they can secure private am bulance services m ore
econom ically than those from the appropriate am bulance authority. T hey accordingly wish to have freedom
to choose. I modify my Interim Recommendation in deference to th is argument by requiring at least one fully
equipped ambulance from, or approved by, the appropriate ambulance authority should be in attendance at all
m atches with an expected crowd o f 5,000 or more.

Status o f the Green Guide
  233. I have recom m ended that so m e safety factors covered by the G uide should be m ade m andatory
requirements in Safety Certificates. T h ose apart, I consider the G u id e should remain a non-m andatory set o f
guidelines. Sports grounds vary greatly in their layout and fixtures. It m ust be open to a local authority to
judge the propriety o f deviating in so m e respect from the Green G u id e recom m en dation s at a particular
ground. However, I agree with the Technical Working Party that where there is a departure from a specific
recom m en dation o f the Guide, the local authority should be aware o f it and should be satisfied that such
departure is justified for good reason.

Revision o f the Green Guide
  234. N eith er I nor the Technical Working Party have sought to revise or redraft the specific wording o f the
G uide. We have sim ply indicated where and to what effect it should be altered. D etailed consideration o f the
revision m ust be for a suitably qualified body to be set up by the H o m e O ffice for the purpose. T he Technical
Working Party, in addition to their report, have prepared detailed supplem entary notes on so m e aspects o f
the G u id e which will be available and I am sure useful to those revising it. Accordingly, I recommend that the
H om e O ffice set up a body to revise the Green Guide as a matter o f urgency.

Sports Grounds W ithin Part III o f the Fire Safety and Safety o f P laces of Sport Act 1987
   235. This Part o f the 1987 Act applies in relation to a sports ground w hich is not a designated sports
ground but w hich provides covered acco m m od a tio n in stands for spectators. A Safety Certificate is required
where such a stand provides covered accom m o d a tio n for 500 or m ore spectators. By section 27(1) the Safety
C ertificate:-

  “shall contain such terms and con d itio n s as the local authority con sid er necessary or expedient to secure
  reasonable safety in the stand when it is in use for view ing the specified activity or activities at the ground,
  and the terms and co n d itions m ay be such as to involve alterations or additions to the stand or any
  installations in or serving the stand.”


                                                        40
  23 6 . T h ese provisions apply to a variety o f sports such as tennis, golf, horseracing, greyhound racing or
m otor racing.

   237. I have received a num ber o f com plaints that local authorities, perhaps in response to Hillsborough,
have sought to apply the full rigour o f m y Interim R ecom m en d a tio n s to sports grounds requiring a Safety
Certificate under these provisions, not being designated sports grounds under the 1975 Act. On occasion this
has been d on e w ithout regard to the Green G u id e or to H o m e O ffice guidance. Exam ples given are
requirements in relation to greyhound stadia regarding the presence o f a m edical practitioner, the size o f a
first aid room , and capacity o f parts o f the stadium other than the covered stand itself.

  238. T h e Green G uide provides at paragraph 5 as follow s:-

  “T he G u id e is intended to cover grounds where sporting events o f all kinds are held and where the
  gathering o f large crowds is likely to present a safety problem . However, much o f the guidance has
  particular application to football stadia and this should be borne in m in d w hen applying the G u id e to
  grounds used for other sports and m o d ifications m ay prove necessary, because the measures to m eet
  problem s o f stadia used for association football m ay not always be necessary at other grounds used for
  other types o f sports. For exam ple, if a ground has no terraced or sloped view ing areas, crush barrier
  requirements are unlikely to be o f concern”.

  A sim ilar approach is appropriate in relation to m y Final R ecom m en d a tio n s. T hey are essentially directed
towards designated sports grounds. M any are relevant to other sports grounds but will need to be applied
with due regard to the different circum stances at those other sports grounds.

  239. O ne appropriate function o f the inspecting and reviewing body, w hich I propose should cover all
certificating and licensing o f sports grounds, w ould be to ensure that recom m en dation s in the Green G u id e
and those m ade in this Report are applied sensibly across the varied range o f sports grounds.

Sports Grounds W ithin Part IV o f the Fire Safety and Safety o f P laces of Sport Act 1987
   240. T h is Part o f the 1987 Act relates to in door sports licences. It introduced am en dm en ts to the
London G overn m ent Act 1963 and the Local G overn m ent (M iscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982 requiring
a licence to be granted by the relevant local authority where prem ises are to be used for “any entertainm ent
which consists o f any sporting event to w hich the public are invited as spectators” (a “sports
entertainm ent”).

  241. U n d er this legislation, the relevant local authority

  “may grant to any applicant, and from tim e to tim e renew, a licence for the use o f any prem ises specified
  in it for any sports entertainm ent on such terms and co n d itions and subject to such restrictions as may be
  so sp ecified ” .

  242. I have received evidence from a num ber o f b odies com p lain ing that the procedure followed in
pursuance o f these provisions often requires different applications to be m ade by different applicants for
different “sports entertainm ents” at the sam e premises. Apart from the expenditure o f tim e and effort, such
multiple applications tend to be expensive to am ateur sports organisations w hich are often im pecunious. The
suggestion is m ade that a procedure should be available whereby a licence for a range o f “sports
entertainm ents” at the sam e prem ises could be obtained by a single operator periodically. This matter
merits review by the appropriate authorities.
                  PART III - CR O W D C O N T R O L A N D H O O L IG A N IS M

                                                  CHAPTER5

                                   P O L IC E P L A N N I N G A N D C O N T R O L

  243. The role o f the police is crucial to crowd control. In m y findings as to what happened at Hillsborough
and why, I criticised the police operation on the day and especially so m e senior officers. I did, however,
recognise that the South Yorkshire Police had a g ood record, that day apart, for handling difficult crowd
problems successfully. I also co m m en d ed m any ju n io r officers for their efforts to rescue and assist those
crushed or trapped at Hillsborough.

  244. I should like here to pay tribute to police forces generally for their invaluable work in m aintaining
order at sports events and especially in and outside football stadia, Saturday after Saturday. W ithout them ,
sports events w ould be chaotic and indeed m any could not be perm itted to take place. Their service is often
thankless and not infrequently they are subjected to abuse and worse from those they are there to serve.

  2 45. They w ould be superhum an i f on occasions they did not react, at any rate verbally, to the stress and
provocation they have to endure. This leads m any fans to feel the police are against them. Moreover, it is
often difficult in the confusion o f a crowded scene for firm police action against miscreants not to im pinge
also, or focus by mistake, on the innocent. The latter then feel aggrieved and others b ecom e aggrieved on
their behalf.

  246. It is therefore vital that police discipline and self-control be o f the highest standard and that friendly
relations with supporters are cultivated. I know and have m yself seen that this is achieved at m any grounds.
But there are reports that, at so m e places, som e police treat supporters, especially away supporters, with a
measure o f contem pt. W hen this happens it unfortunately sours the attitude o f the supporters towards all
police.

  247. Accordingly, Police C om m anders should in their briefings stress the need to balance firm control
with good hum our and patience.

  248. As to the planning o f police operations and the techniques to be considered, I repeat my interim
recommendations (numbers 6 and 26 to 30) which are now recommendations 1 6 ,4 4 to 4 6 ,4 9 and 51.

Police Control Room
   249. It is essential to efficient police operations that their control room inside the ground should be well
placed, of sufficient size and well equipped. A num ber I have seen have been very good. S o m e are too small,
however. There should be room for at least the Commander, his deputy and enough officers to man the radios,
telephones and CCTV screens. The room should leave space for others who may need from time to time to visit
the room eg other senior officers, club management or a member o f the emergency services. The room should
command a good view of the whole pitch and of the spectator areas surrounding it. It should where necessary be
sound-proofed against excessive crowd noise. Failure to provide the p olice with a satisfactory control room is
m isguided thrift.

                                                   ALCOHOL

   250. There can be no doubt that excessive drinking by fans significantly aggravates problem s o f crowd
control. Because alcohol tends to rem ove inhibitions and se lf control, those who have drunk too m uch may
b eco m e aggressive and even violen t especially when provoked. Short o f this, however, alcohol can m ake fans
resistant to sensible and reasonable instructions, m ore im patient and less considerate o f others. All o f this
increases the problem s for p olice and stewards in m anaging large num bers which is difficult enough even
with co-operation.


Legislation
   251. In Scotland, serious crowd m isbehaviour, much o f it drink-related, led to the a p p oin tm ent in 1976 o f
the Working Group chaired by M r Frank M cElhone MP. T he recom m en dation s o f his report were followed in
the Crim inal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980 which m ade it an offence to be in, or to attem pt to enter, a
designated ground w hile in possession o f alcohol or to be in, or to attem pt to enter, the ground whilst drunk.
It also banned the possession o f alcoholic liquor on public service veh icles carrying passengers to or from a
designated sporting event and by a m en d m en t this ban was extended to vehicles adapted to carry n ine or
m ore passengers.


  252. I am in no doub t after discussions with senior Scottish police officers that this m easure has greatly
reduced the problem o f m isbehaviour at Scottish football grounds. Sectarian violen ce still has to be
contained, especially at Rangers and Celtic matches. There is still trouble from the “new hooligan ” groups,
known in Scotland as “casuals”. But much o f the m isb eh aviour o f groups II and III in the Popplewell
classification has abated due to the firm enforcem ent o f the 1980 Act by the Scottish police.


 253. In England and Wales this lead was followed in the Sporting Events (Control o f A lcohol etc) Act 1985
which m ade sim ilar provisions.


   254. There is, however, an im portant difference b etw een the Scottish provisions and those applying in
England and Wales. In Scotland, the ban on alcohol is absolute. N o sales o f alcoholic drink are perm itted in
the ground. In England and Wales, section 3 o f the 1985 Act permits Licensing Justices to grant exem ption
from the ban on sales in the ground. This is subject to alcohol not being sold or con su m ed at any part o f the
ground from which the sporting event may be directly view ed and to other con d itio n s im posed by the
Justices. It is open to the Justices to revoke or vary an order and the police have power to shut down the sale
o f alcohol at a particular event if they consider it would be detrimental to orderly conduct or safety.


A lcohol S a les in Grounds?
  255. It is against this background that I must consider the subm ission o f the FA and others that sale o f
alcoholic drink in football grounds should be generally perm itted without need to obtain an ex em p tio n order.
The argument is that the ban on such sales does not prevent fans from drinking. It merely drives them to
drink in public houses until a short tim e before the match. They then arrive late, often inebriated and
truculent, thereby causing congestion and other problem s at entrances. Far better, it is said, to m ake alcoholic
drink available at the ground so as to bring them in earlier. Since service o f drink inside the ground is slow
and selling points are crowded it is argued that the visitor will be lucky to buy more than on e round. He is
therefore unlikely to b eco m e drunk from drinking inside the ground.


  256. Ideally I accept that people attending a football m atch should be able to buy refreshments including
alcoholic drink just as they can at the theatre or other places o f entertainm ent. I hope, in halcyon days ahead,
a better atm osphere at football grounds m ay justify bans being relaxed. I do not, however, think the present
tim e is ripe for such relaxation.


  257. I have m en tion ed the great im provem ent o f crowd behaviour in Scotland where the ban is absolute
and has been in force now for nearly 10 years. N o doubt other factors such as increased seating have played
their part in this. T he im provem ent has been recognised by the G overnm ent, and is the m ain reason why the
Football Spectators Act 1989 has not been applied to Scotland. Thus Mr Moynihan, the M inister for Sport,
said on the Third D ay o f the C o m m itte e Stage (Official Report, colum n 83):
  “There has been a marked im provem ent in the behaviour o f football crowds in Scotland, which is accepted
  by all parties and the Scottish Football A ssociation. T he Scottish O ffice is m onitoring developm en ts
  closely and . . . it does n ot believe that it is necessary to legislate for a national m em bership schem e in
  Scotland. However, it will be able to take action in the future should the position deteriorate”.

  In England and Wales, the ban has had only four and a h a lf years to operate and is watered down by the
availability o f exem ptions. Where it is thought appropriate, there is nothing to prevent clubs from applying
to their local justices for an exem ption. There m ay regrettably be places where the local circum stances,
known to the justices, warrant refusal o f an exem ption. At m any others, it will be granted as indeed it has
been already at a num ber o f grounds.

  258. W hen such exem p tio n s exist, there is no clear ev idence to suggest that late arrivals are greatly
reduced. Indeed, the argument that n o -o n e can get drunk in the ground because o f the problem s o f getting
served or because only low alcohol beer is available, seem s to m e contradictory to the m ain argument. Those
who w ish to drink full strength beer in quantity will not be m uch attracted by the service offered inside the
ground.

  2 59. In these circum stances I consider it would be a retrograde or at least premature step at this tim e to
restore a blanket licence to sell alcohol at designated sports events. I do not go so far as to suggest that the
total ban applicable in Scotland should be extended to England and Wales ie that no exem p tio n s should be
available. But I do n ot believe it appropriate to relax the present restrictions.

  260. Are there other steps which could and should be taken to reduce problem s from excessive drinking?

Arrests
   261. I have referred to the provision in Section 2 o f the 1985 Act m aking it an offence to be in, or to
attempt to enter, a designated sports ground whilst drunk or in p ossession o f intoxicating liquor. The im pact
o f these provisions clearly depends upon enforcem ent. Here again there is a contrast between Scotland and
England. In England, although arrests are m ade, there is a tendency to eject m any offenders w ithout arresting
them. In Scotland the police take a firm line. They do not eject offenders; they arrest them . T he English
approach m ay partly be due to a com m en da b le desire not to be seen as hostile to football spectators.
However, it is also a matter o f expediency. M aking an arrest requires the arresting officer to take the offender
to a police room and go through the prescribed procedure and paperwork. This takes the officer away from
his post for a m inim u m o f a quarter o f an hour. At so m e grounds (Hillsborough was one) ev id en ce suggests a
m uch lengthier absence is co m m o n . Clearly, if a serial o f eight officers is posted to a bank o f turnstiles, three
or four arrests m ay greatly reduce the team for a significant period. There is a tendency, therefore, to avoid
making arrests save in the worst cases. I do not wish to advocate repressive measures which would be counter
to all I have said about the need for a new attitude towards spectators. On the other hand, it cannot be a good
ground for declining to m ake an arrest that on e cannot spare an officer to do it. I therefore recommend that
consideration be given to streamlining arrest procedures so as to divert an arresting officer from his post for
the minimum time. O ne m ethod I have seen adopted is for the officer to give only basic details o f the arrest
and be photographed with the offender before resuming his duties. H e can then return after the m atch to
com plete the docum entation.

Closing Bars
   262. In so m e areas, bars in the vicin ity o f the ground are closed either throughout a m atch day or between
certain hours. This m ay be required by the Justices or it m ay be the result o f agreement betw een p olice and
publicans. Such a measure m ay however have lim ited effect. To close the pubs in a radius o f o n e or two miles
o f the ground sim ply diverts drinkers to bars outside that range and m ay aggravate late arrival. Moreover,
beer from shops with off-licences probably accounts for as m uch pre-match drinking as that bought in bars.
This said, it may well be sensible to lim it the availability o f alcohol especially before a high-risk match. How
effective the measure can be depends on the locality. In L ondon or other large cities it could have little
impact; in a m ore isolated town it could be very effective.

Early Kick-Offs
   263. Traditionally, kick-off at football m atches has been at three o ’clock. That m ay formerly have been to
accom m o d ate those who worked on Saturday mornings. By another tradition, perm itted hours in pubs led to
a recognised drinking period from m id-m orning until three o ’clock. T he com b ination o f these two traditions
often brings fans to a match with too m uch drink on board. There is therefore much to be said for an early
kick-off especially in a high-risk match. It gives less opportunity for prolonged drinking session s im m ediately
before the gam e. A m id-day kick-off gives tim e for away supporters to reach the ground but less tim e for early
arrivals to kick their heels and lift their elbows in bars.

  2 64. It is true that an early kick-off will discharge the fans earlier at the end o f the match. S om e anxiety
has been expressed as to whether drunkenness avoided before and during the match m ay have m ore hours to
build up after the gam e causing problem s for the p olice and the local com m u n ity in the evening. This could
be so, but there are two m oderating factors. First, drunken behaviour in the town, although a problem for the
police, is less likely to cause serious danger to m any p eople than at a match where it m ay be co m p oun ded by
excitem ent, partisanship and incidents o f the gam e and where large num bers are in a confined space.
Secondly, the segregation exercise often results in the bulk o f away supporters being escorted back to their
road or rail transport as soon as the match is over rather than lingering in the town.

Sunday M atches
   265. Sunday m atches ought also to be a considered option. On a Sunday, there is less traffic, especially
com m ercial traffic, to com p ete with those arriving for the match. Arrival, parking and departure are
therefore easier for them in private coaches and cars. It is true that public transport generally on a Sunday is
less plentiful but special arrangements are often m ade for major events. Again, bars and indeed many places
o f entertainm ent being closed on Sundays, there is less incentive to have a night on the town after a Sunday
game.

                                           T IC K E T S A N D T O U T S
Information on Tickets and Signs
   266. It is vital to good crowd control that those attending a sports event should have clear directions where
to go. It m akes for con fusion and hence added problem s for stewards and p olice if spectators are m illing
about looking for their appropriate entrances. T he congestion at Hillsborough was aggravated by poor
information on the tickets and poor signposting outside and inside the turnstiles. I therefore repeat my
recommendations that tickets and sign s should provide simple, clear and consistent information to
spectators.
  2 67. All available measures should be taken in the printing o f tickets to prevent forgeries being produced.
Computer Record o f Tickets
   268. It would greatly help to defeat forgery and theft o f tickets as well as assisting in the apprehension of
those m isbehaving in the ground, if clubs maintained a record on computer of ticket sales. This is done in
Italy where season tickets and tickets for all-ticket m atches in seated areas are num bered and a record is
m aintained o f the n am es and addresses o f purchasers. Such inform ation is o f great value to the police in
identifying forgeries and tracing offenders. Clearly, season tickets for seats could be m ade attractive if
favourable terms were offered (especially to young supporters). This would enable the authorities to know for
a w hole season who was occupying a particular seat. As seating acco m m od a tio n increases this would give
greater inform ation and control.
Fans Without Tickets
   269. O ne problem which creates difficulties for the police is the arrival o f would-be spectators without
tickets at an all-ticket match. Although I found there was not a large body o f such fans at Hillsborough there
undoubtedly were som e. At other matches the num bers have not only been large; they have been determ ined
to gain entrance by on e m eans or another. If they could not acquire tickets at the ground they have created so
much trouble that the police have judged it best to let them in. S om etim es this has been for payment; on
occasions, even free. T he rationale has been that it is better to have troublemakers inside the ground where
they can b e m onitored than roaming round the town at large. Obviously, the practice o f adm itting fans
without tickets has a bad knock-on effect. Bands o f fans unable to get tickets believe that if they turn up and
create sufficient cla m o u rth e police will adm it them.
Police Policy
  270. T his m ust not be allowed to continue. It is intolerable that those with no tickets should be able to
blackmail their way into a ground. “If you don’t let us in we’ll force the gates or wreck your tow n”, is not a
threat to w hich a police force should submit. T he policy o f adm itting such people is also unfair to those who
have taken the trouble and spent m on ey to buy tickets. It further involves, at a capacity match, letting in fans
for w hom there m ay be insufficient space. It may also create problems o f segregation. Above all, it is allowing
the m o b to rule.

   271. True, 1 held that in the crisis w hich developed at the Leppings Lane turnstiles o n 15 April 1989,
o pening gate C was justified since life would otherw ise have been at risk outside the ground. However, that
was a matter o f life and death. It arose because o f inadequate facilities and inadequate crowd control. 1 would
hope such a situation will never recur. If anything like it should recur, preservation o f life m ust clearly be
paramount. But when the police have an option to let fans without tickets in or keep them out, their policy
must clearly be to exclude them. U nless that rule is firmly and universally applied and known the problem
will grow.

All-ticket M atches
   272. All the evidence 1 have received suggests that great caution should be exercised before m aking a
match all-ticket. To do so can assist in achieving segregation. In general, it should however be done only
where a capacity or near capacity crowd is expected. There should then be little difficulty in selling all the
tickets in advance. T h e point o f m aking such a m atch all-ticket is to prevent the arrival o f greater numbers
than the ground can accom m odate. However, if a less popular m atch is m a d e all-ticket, it m ay turn out that
only a m o dest proportion o f the tickets is sold in advance. If then fans arrive w ithout tickets, they will be
aggrieved at being turned away w hen there is space available. Moreover, the club will be tem pted to give in to
them and sell tickets on the day. T his discredits the all-ticket policy and m ay cause breaches o f the
segregation strategy. I therefore recommend that all-ticket matches should be confined to those at which a
capacity or near capacity crowd is expected and that, having so designated them, clubs maintain a firm policy of
not selling tickets at the match.


                                                        46
Touts
   2 7 3. T h e recom m en dation s in the last two paragraphs are designed to deter those w ithout tickets from
turning up at matches and so ob viating any trouble they may b e tem pted to cause. However, many fans
w ithout tickets turn up at the ground in the hope o f buying them from touts.

   274. D uring my visits to sports grounds I have found universal co n d em n a tio n o f touts by all involved in
organising and m anaging large stadium events. Apart from the obstruction they them selves cause, touts
attract fans w ithout tickets to attend at grounds in the h o p e o f getting in. Moreover, they sell tickets to all
com ers regardless o f their allegiance. T hus tickets for the h o m e area at a soccer match fall into the hands o f
away supporters and v ic e versa. T he result is to frustrate the efforts o f clubs and police to achieve peaceful
segregation. Pockets o f alien affiliation planted am ongst h o m e supporters form a focus for hostility and often
v io len ce results. Apart from these objections, voiced by the FA, the FL, the p olice and the clubs, m ost
supporters also detest touts because they often corner the market for a popular m atch and offer tickets at
grossly ex cessive prices.

   275. From all these quarters the plea is to take p ositiv e action against ticket touts at football matches.
I am m indful o f the need for caution before advocating a law lim iting liberty to conduct o n ese lf and on e’s
business freely and according to established practice. I likewise accept that market forces should, in general,
operate freely in the com m ercial field. N evertheless, I am satisfied from what I have read, heard and seen
that o u tside football grounds the presence and activities o f touts have a grossly anti-social effect leading both
directly and indirectly to disorder. Directly, through obstruction and the attraction o f numbers without
tickets. Indirectly, because o f trouble from those so attracted who, in the end, cannot or do not buy tickets
and from th o se w ho buy their way into an o p position enclave.

   276. Touts operate, o f course, at places other than football grounds. T hey are to be found, for exam ple, at
national rugby stadia, at the All England Lawn Tennis Club at W im bled on and at countless other sporting
events. D ep en d in g on how o n e defines “touting”, the activity could include selling unwanted tickets for the
opera, the theatre or concert halls. Touting usually m eans, however, not just selling at face value a ticket you
cannot use, but selling numbers o f tickets at an inflated price as a com m ercial venture. There is a clear
distinction between the im pact o f touting at football grounds and elsewhere. Football is the only sport at
which segregation is practised to prevent violence. This is because it is the sport where v io len ce inside and
outside the ground is, at present, m ost prevalent. There are therefore strong grounds for regarding football as
a special case as the G overnm ent has recognised by prom oting the Football Spectators Act.

  277. W hatever the policy merits o f freedom to trade and market forces, they m ust surely yield to the
m ainten an ce o f safety and the prevention o f disorder. Touts at football m atches put both at risk. At other
sports and in other leisure fields the tout does not endanger safety or order to the sam e extent. Accordingly,
whatever view one takes o f him, he can be left to ply his trade there. But so far as football is concerned, in my
view touting should be m ade unlawful. T he fast buck should stop here.

  278. At present, police can deal with touts only by som ew hat strained and stretched use o f existing laws.
They arrest them for obstruction even if the physical obstruction caused is m inim al. Alternatively, they make
an arrest on the grounds that they suspect the tout o f carrying forged tickets, although the suspicion o f forgery
may m erely be co n ven ient conjecture. After holding the tout during the match the police release him and the
now valueless but genuine tickets are returned to him. Growing wise to this, m any touts now carry only two or
three tickets at a tim e, relying on a runner to bring up m ore from a “banker“ standing o f f with perhaps
hundreds o f tickets in his possession. If the salesm an is arrested the m erchandise is not all lost. Police should
not have to stretch the law to deal with a public m ischief. There should be a specific prohibition which police
can then enforce.

   279. H ow to formulate a prohibition against touting at football grounds will require careful consideration
and drafting. It could be made an offence to sell tickets for and on the day of a football match without
authority from the home club to do so. A nother way would be to prohibit such sales within a specified radius
o f the ground on the day o f the match. Yet another would be to prohibit sales o f tickets for a football match at
m ore than face value. This third alternative would permit any genuine purchaser o f a ticket who found he
could not use it to recoup his outlay by selling his ticket outside the m atch. Its disadvantage would be the
difficulty o f proving a tout had sold at more than face value; ways would also be devised to evade the
prohibition. I tend to favour the first alternative which is sim ple and capable o f easy proof. T he genuine
ticket holder, finding h im self unable on the day to use his ticket, and not perm itted to sell it outside the
ground, should be permitted to return it to the club and recover his money. Clubs should be prepared to
accept such tickets in the interests o f fairness and o f having a law w hich defeats touts. If touting outside the
ground is banned, fans with no tickets for an all-ticket match could have no excuse for turning up outside
hoping to get in.

Cautious Optim ism
  280. I turn now to ways o f curbing m isbehaviour and dealing w ith hooligans. At the outset, I m u st record
that there are grounds for cautious op tim ism about m isbehaviour inside football grounds although the sam e
cannot b e said o f behaviour outside and en route. Evidence I have received from various p olice forces, from
ACPO, from the football authorities and from the clubs suggests that measures taken in the last co u p le o f
years have reduced incidents o f violen t m isbehaviour inside grounds. Also, for th e first tim e for decades,
there has been a small but steady increase in attendances at m atches in each o f the last three years. This has
occurred d espite reductions in capacity. It is attributed by p olice and football authorities and by supporters’
organisations to greater con fidence by the decent majority o f spectators that v io len ce in the ground is under
control.


  281. T h ese w elco m e signs m ust be seen in perspective. D isorder in the ground has been, for the m ost part,
controlled n ot elim inated. There have still been occasional outbursts o f v io len ce in recent m onths. All that
can be said with confidence is that the police are now m uch better equipped and inform ed to deal with
hooligans than they were three years ago and their operations have been m ore successful in controlling
disorder.

CCTV
  282. In particular, the installation o f C C T V has greatly im proved police surveillance o f the crowd both
inside the ground and at the turnstiles.

   283. In 1985, after the Bradford Disaster, the Football Trust m ade funds available to install C C T V at all
first and second division football grounds. Unfortunately, the system s initially installed, although the best
available at the time, proved to be o f inadequate quality for identification purposes. Moreover, operators
initially lacked the training and expertise necessary to make effective use o f the equipm ent.

  284. A num ber o f clubs now have better equ ipm en t and m ost o f the rem ainder o f the 92 clubs in the
League have applied to the Football Trust for funding to enable them to do likewise. T he Football Trust, not
unnaturally, wish to be sure the m oney will be well spent. T hey have therefore asked that an agreed
specification should be laid down as to the quality o f the C C T V to be installed. A CPO hope to provide this as
soon as possible.


  285. In the two years ending June 1989, about 2 0 0 operators were trained in the use o f C C T V at matches.
A training v id eo is also available to all police forces.

  286. Already, C C T V has had a major im pact on the hooligan problem inside football grounds as well as
proving extrem ely useful to m onitor safety measures. If any trouble appears on the screen or is reported from
any quarter o f the ground, the C C T V can z o o m in on the incident. The police can then record what occurs on
colour v id eo and on hard copy prints. Individuals can be picked out by facial appearance and the colour o f
their clothing. T h e evidential effect o f such a v id eo recording has proved formidable. It has persuaded
hooligans, w ho would previously have sought to challenge oral evidence o f identification, to plead guilty.
H ooligans know cameras are keeping a roving watch and their activities in the ground are inhibited by that
knowledge. Police evidence suggest that as a result o f C C T V surveillance and the police strategies it
facilitates, the m ore com m itted hooligans now concentrate their activities outside the ground, attacking
op posing fans on their way to or from matches.

National Football Intelligence Unit
   287. ACPO have for so m e years encouraged the developm en t o f an intelligence network nationw ide. A
national index o f football liaison officers was set up to collect, record and pass on inform ation about the
behaviour, past and anticipated, o f club supporters, especially the hooligan elem ent. Thus, before a match,
the p olice responsible for it can receive inform ation from the football liaison officer in the visiting club’s area
as to the propensities o f the visiting supporters and any known plans any elem en t am ong them m ay have.
Although this schem e has proved useful, the need was recognised for a central unit equipped with a com puter
to gather, record and d issem in ate intelligence. ACPO, in their written subm ission, say:-


                                                         48
  “H ooligan gangs operate across a w id e area and may o f course be involved in crim inal escapades in any
  town b etw een their point o f departure and the ven u e o f the fixture. Furthermore, in recent tim es there is
  good ev id en ce that they will often plan criminal v io len ce w hich has nothing whatever to do with football.
  There is a n eed to overview such events to identify patterns and recognise what is behind seem ingly
  unconnected events.”

  288.       T h e N a tional Football Intelligence U n it has now been set up. It is based in London; staff are in post;
the U n it is being funded by the H o m e Office. It is hoped the com puter will be installed shortly. T h e U n it will
then be o f great value in dealing not only with d om estic football-related crim e but also with hooligans
travelling to m atches abroad.

   289. Although incidents o f physical v io len ce inside grounds are now m uch fewer, there rem ains an
undercurrent o f unruly behaviour w hich can and occasionally does result in disorder. Three activities in
particular have this potential: (i) throwing coins and other m issiles (ii) chanting obscene or racialist abuse
(iii) going onto the pitch without reasonable excuse.

    i.    There can be no possible excuse for hurling m issiles at a sports ground. It is not only dangerous in
          itself. It may and often d oes incite others to do likewise; that m ay and often d oes provoke retaliation.
          V iolence m ay then escalate.

    ii.   N o -o n e could expect that verbal exchanges on the terraces w ould be as polite as those at a vicarage
          tea party. But shouting or chanting gross obscenities or racialist abuse ought not to be permitted. If
          o n e starts, others jo in in, and to the majority o f reasonable supporters, as well as to those abused, the
          sound o f such chants from num bers in unison is offensive and provocative.

    iii. R unning on the pitch often provokes and is the prelude to disorder. T his is not just because it
         interrupts the gam e or because it invades the hallowed turf. It is often d o n e with the intention o f
         attacking som eon e. Even if the invasion is not with intent to attack the referee, a player or opposing
         fans, it tem pts others to follow suit. If rival fans co m e onto the pitch v iolen ce will probably break
         out. Even i f they do not, there m ay well be violent exchanges with police seeking to repel the
         invaders. A fan m ay run onto the pitch merely to congratulate a goal scorer. But his action could well
         provoke o p posin g fans (displeased by the goal anyway) to invade the pitch with less benign intent.

  290. Ought not these activities therefore to be m ade criminal offences? T h is has been raised before. Mr
Justice Popplewell considered the sam e three activities. After discussing whether they should be m ade
separate offences, he concluded, on analogy with the Scottish “breach o f the p eace”, that a sim ple offence o f
disorderly conduct at a sports ground would sweep up not only the three activities m en tion ed above but other
disorderly activities too. H e concluded, at paragraph 4.7 4 o f his Final Report, as follows:

  “4 .7 4 Q uite clearly a new offence in England and Wales o f disorderly conduct or breach o f the peace on
  the lines o f the Scottish co m m o n law offence, would be o f substantial assistance in dealing with
  hooliganism . It would avoid the problem o f trying to d efine all the different types o f behaviour w hich give
  rise to disorder at football m atches and would undoubtedly enable the police to take action m uch earlier
  than they can under the present law. This offence should be con fined to sports grounds where the
  disorderly conduct is likely to have such a devastating effect on crowd safety. D isorderly conduct would
  clearly include throwing a missile, running o n to the pitch, seeking to clim b over or to pull down a perimeter
  fence, shining a mirror towards a batsm an, throwing bottles or cans onto the field o f play, or interfering
  with a greyhound or horse race. I suggest that it should be triable sum m arily and there should be a power o f
  arrest. I recommend, therefore, that consideration should be given to creating an offence o f disorderly
  conduct at a sports ground."

  291. This recom m endation was not taken up. At the tim e Mr Justice Popplewell reported, the Public Order
Act 1986 was in preparation. It created new offences relating to public order but none specifically related to
conduct inside sports grounds. Evidence from the H o m e Office gives two reasons for this. First, it was thought
wrong in principle to treat football or sports grounds as a special case. Secondly, it was apparently thought that
the provisions o f the 1986 Act, especially section 5, sufficiently covered the field.

  292. As to the first reason, one must surely look at the nature o f the m ischief. T he three sp ecified activities
would, o f course, be an anti-social nuisance anywhere. But at a designated sports ground they are fraught
with potential disorderly consequences. There is good reason therefore to treat as a special case the
prohibition o f these activities at such grounds. By analogy, having alcohol in o n e’s blood over a fixed lim it
has been m ade an offence only in relation to driving, because it is dangerous to the public in that special
context.

  293. T h e second reason requires an exam in ation o f sections 4(1) and 5(1) o f the 1986 Act. So far as is
relevant, these provide as follows:-

  “4( 1) A person is guilty o f an offence if he -

     (a) uses towards another person threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour . . .


                                                          50
         with intent to cause that person to b elieve that im m ediate unlawful violen ce will be used against him
         or another by any person, or to provoke the im m ediate use o f unlawful vio len ce by that person or
         another, or whereby that person is likely to believe that such v io len ce will be used or it is likely that
         such v io len ce will be provoked . . .

  5(1) A person is guilty o f an o ffence if he -

   (a)   uses threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour, or disorderly behaviour . . .
         w ithin the hearing or sight o f a person likely to be caused harassm ent, alarm or distress thereby”.

   294. Throw ing m issiles could only be caught under section 5 as “disorderly behaviour” if the additional
elem en t were proved that it was “w ithin the hearing or sight o f a person likely to be caused harassment, alarm
or distress thereby”. To adduce ev id en ce o f this last elem en t may be very difficult indeed. It should surely be
sufficient to show that the accused threw a m issile at a football match.

    295. As to o b scene or racialist chanting sim ilar difficulties arise. Although the chanting m ay be proved
abusive or insulting it w ould also have to be shown, under section 4, that it was used “towards another person
. . . with intent to cause that person to believe that im m ediate unlawful vio len ce will be used against him etc”.
P ro o f o f those elem ents m ay not be possible.

  296. U n d er section 5, whilst again the chanting m ay be proved to have contained “abusive or insulting
words”, it m ay b e difficult to show that this was d o n e “w ithin the hearing or sight o f a person likely to be
caused harassment, alarm or distress thereby”. T h e words m ay cause nothing other than disgust.

  297. N o r d oes section 18 o f the A ct help. U n d er the heading “Acts intended or likely to stir up racial
hatred”, the section provides as follows so far as is relevant:-

  “ 18( 1) A person w ho uses threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour . . . is guilty o f an offence
  if-

    (a) he intends thereby to stir up racial hatred, or

    (b) having regard to all the circum stances racial hatred is likely to be stirred up thereby”.

  298. Racialist abuse o f the kind chanted at football m atches is probably not intended to stir up racial
hatred. N o r could it readily be proved that racial hatred was likely to be stirred up. T he effect o f such
chanting is to give cheap and ignoble am usem ent to those participating whilst causing offence and
embarrassment to those abused and to the decent m ajority o f fans.

  29 9 . For these reasons, I do not consider that the activities which Mr Justice Popplewell concluded should
be the subject o f a crim inal offence are covered by the 1986 Act. H e set out the arguments for and against
legislation to prohibit them at paragraphs 4.42 to 4 .7 4 o f his Final Report. I do not rehearse those arguments.
I agree with his conclusion that on balance, despite the difficulties o f drafting and enforcem ent, these
activities should be prohibited. Mr Justice Popplewell concluded that a “catch-all” offence o f disorderly
conduct at a sports ground should be considered. I appreciate the force o f his reasoning. However, I would
prefer to see separate offences in respect o f each o f the three activities I have m entioned. T he object o f the
legislation m ust be not merely to prosecute offences when they occur but to deter them . If there is a specific
offence o f throwing m issiles at a designated sports ground, a separate specific offence o f chanting obscene or
racialist abuse there and a third specific offence o f going on the pitch without reasonable excuse there and, if
full publicity is given to the legislation, hooligans will know precisely what is prohibited and that they do
those things at their peril.

   300. As to going on the pitch, I have a reason for recom m ending prohibition additional to those which
co n v in ced Mr Justice Popplewell. I have recom m en ded lowering the level o f fences and rem oving spikes and
overhanging sections. That relaxation is m ade in the interests o f the decent majority o f supporters w ho have
no yen to invade the pitch. To back up the lesser deterrent effect o f lower fences I think it prudent to have a
crim inal sanction against pitch invasion.

   301. I appreciate that at so m e sports grounds there is a tradition o f running onto the pitch when the gam e
is over sim ply from jo ie de vivre or to pat players on the back. At Murrayfield, for exam ple, schoolboys sit on
forms on the pitch side o f the perimeter fencing and run on harmlessly at the end o f the game. Again, going
onto the pitch to escape so m e hazard on the terraces in an em ergency should, o f course, be legitimate.
Accordingly, the offence should be aim ed at prohibiting invasion o f the pitch without goo d reason or
reasonable excuse. T he police will in this as in many other situations have to exercise sensible discretion and
judgm ent.

  302. Various club schem es to exclude hooligans have been undertaken or suggested.

Luton
  303. In March 1985, Millwall visited Luton with a large contingent o f “supporters”. W idespread disorder
broke out causing injuries to both fans and police. Serious dam age was also done in and outside the ground as
well as to trains returning to London.

  304. Following this episode, Luton FC decided to ad opt a H o m e Only Supporters S chem e excluding away
supporters and allowing only Luton m em bers and their guests to attend matches. I am grateful to the
m anagem ent o f Luton FC and to the Bedfordshire police w ho explained to m e the history, operation and
merits o f this scheme.

   305. Applicants for m em bership norm ally reside w ithin 25 m iles o f Luton. Th ose further away m ust
justify why they wish to join. A m em bership card entitles the m em ber to buy a ticket for entry, either in
advance or on the day, and to bring in with h im up to three guests. T he card has a bar-coding and m ust be
presented to obtain a ticket in advance. To buy a ticket on the day, the card is “sw ip ed ” through a
com puterised reader by the m em ber at an outer set o f turnstiles at the Kenilworth Road end o f the ground.
P ayment for a ticket is then m ade at another inner set o f turnstiles. T h ose m em bers w ho m isbehave are
deprived o f mem bership. A banned list is m aintained on the computer. It consisted, at the tim e I received
evidence, o f only six names. If entry is attem pted by using a banned card, a red light shows and the turnstile
will not open. A steward then escorts the holder to an office outside th e turnstiles where the problem is
investigated.

   306. T he schem e started in August 1986. T h e equ ipm en t installed initially proved unsatisfactory. S om e o f
the problem s were: failure through condensation, delay whilst the reader checked the card’s validity, and the
fact that a Barclaycard could do the trick. After a num ber o f attem pts at rectification, this eq u ipm en t was
ab andoned and a different firm o f suppliers was engaged. I should m en tio n that eq u ipm en t from the first
source was installed at P lym outh where it also failed after a num ber o f attem pts and the experim ent was not
pursued further.

  307. The second system at Luton has proved effective after so m e teething troubles. It has been working
satisfactorily now for nearly two seasons.

Benefits of the Schem e
   308. Both the club and the police are happy with the effects o f the schem e. T he exclusion o f away
supporters naturally excludes the hooligan elem ent w hich they w ould have included. But it also rem oves the
focus for the aggression o f any h om e hooligans. With no visitors to attack or bait, it is said that the hooligan
elem ents in Luton have faded away. T hey have not sought to jo in the schem e, nor do they seem to travel to
away games. T he town has also benefitted. Shops which previously had to board up their window s now enjoy
a peaceful Saturday trade w hich has increased by 40%. Arrests at m atches have dropped from over 100 per
season before the schem e to nil. Police costs have been greatly reduced. The club accepts that initially there
was a fall in attendances, but claim s they are rising again. In 1985/6, average attendance was 11,100, in
1986/7 it was 10,300, in 1987/8 it was 8,038 and in 1988/9 it was 10,039.

  309. T he list o f benefits is im pressive and there can be no doubt that the schem e has been a success for
Luton. But w ould it be successful elsewhere?

  310. Luton is, in the football context, som ew hat isolated geographically from other clubs, their fans and
their catchm ent areas. In this, its situation differs greatly from, for exam ple, London clubs or those on
Merseyside, Greater M anchester or the Midlands. H ence the assum ption that those within 25 m iles o f Luton
are likely to be natural Luton supporters. Luton also differs from clubs in the larger conurbations by size o f
crowds, their average numbers being only about one-quarter o f those at large clubs. T h e banned list is tiny. An
im portant feature o f the Luton schem e is the use o f outer and inner turnstiles for w hich the ground has am ple
room . Many other grounds do not.


                                                          52
  311. At Luton, the card-holder h im s e lf “sw ip es” his card through. The club and the police acknowledge
that, if the card had to be passed to a turnstile operator to “sw ip e” it through, entry w ould be considerably
retarded. T hey also accept that the essential feature o f Luton’s success has been the ban on away supporters
rather than the m em bership card schem e itself.

Ban A ll Away Supporters?
  312. I f this is the touchstone o f success in elim inating hooliganism , why not introduce it generally and
have no away supporters at any football m atches nationw ide? T h is has been considered before and rejected.
Mr Justice Popplewell in his Interim Report recom m en ded that:

  “ Urgent consideration should be given to introducing a m em bership system in England and Wales so as to
  exclude visiting fans”.

  However, in his Final Report he m od ified this and reco m m en ded that:

  “C onsideration should continue to be given to som e form o f m em bership schem e for Football League
  clubs in England and Wales”.

  313. Clearly the G overn m ent has rejected the idea o f a ban on all away supporters w hich forms no part o f
the schem e o f the Football Spectators A ct 1989.

  314. To exclude all away support w ould be a draconian step. It w ould halve the num ber o f m atches fans
could attend. It w ould seriously d im inish clubs’ revenue and deprive football grounds o f a healthy
atmosphere o f rivalry, w hich so m e say is a casualty o f the Luton schem e. But perhaps the conclusive p oint is
that it w ould be im practical and possibly counter-productive in the cam paign against hooliganism .

  315. To exclude away supporters from Luton is on e thing. T h o se excluded can at least go at present to any
other match instead. But to exclude all away supporters from all m atches and especially to exclude them from
“local derby” m atches or m atches in large cities could cause serious disorder. If M anchester City supporters
could not go to Old Trafford w hen their team plays there, or Chelsea supporters follow their team to
Highbury or to their neighbours Q ueen’s Park Rangers, trouble could result. There w ould be attem pts and
devices to defeat the schem e and get into the ground in defiance o f it. There could well be disorder outside
grounds. T he m ore fanatical supporters and the hooligans w ould be unlikely to stay h o m e and play patience.

Away M em bers Only
  316. There is a halfway house between freedom for all com ers and a ban on all away supporters. This is to
make entry to sections o f the ground for away supporters by ticket only; tickets to be allocated strictly to
m em bers o f the away tea m ’s travel club and no tickets to be available on the day o f the match. T h is schem e
builds on an existing practice ad opted at som e grounds for key m atches, for exam ple the Liverpool v Arsenal
match in May 1989 to decide the cham pionship. It also builds upon existing club m em bership schemes.
Most clubs have a club m em bership schem e o f so m e sort following an agreem ent between the football
authorities and the G overn m ent in February 1987, whereby all clubs were to introduce schem es covering at
least 50% o f each ground’s capacity by the beginning o f the 1987/8 season. C om p lian ce was patchy and
varied from a m em bership o f over 4 0 ,0 0 0 at M anchester U n ited to on e or two clubs which did nothing at all.

    317. The away m em bers only solution encourages the p rom otion o f m em bership schem es offering
discounts, favourable travel facilities and other benefits. It aim s to lim it away supporters to those, in effect,
vouched for by the away club. M isbehaviour would result in loss o f m em bership and thus exclusion from
future away m atches as well as loss o f other m em bership privileges. T he schem e has the u nan im ou s approval
o f the 48 third and fourth d iv ision clubs, given at their annual general m eeting in June 1989.

  318. As with any proposed solution to the hooligan problem, this schem e cannot be watertight. It has to be
recognised that any m em bership schem e is vulnerable to abuse arising from the loss or theft o f cards and
from the determ ined activities o f those w ho, for whatever reason, do not possess them . The away m em bers
only schem e d oes at least hold out good prospects o f im proving behaviour in the away supporters’ enclosure
since only those vetted by the away club will be allocated tickets there. That may deter others from travelling
but there may still be so m e w ho are determ ined to travel and get in. On occasion, the FA has ordered that a
club’s supporters having a bad record for causing disorder can be adm itted at away m atches only if they are
accredited m em bers o f their own club. Leeds U n ited is an exam ple. T h is has, on the whole, proved beneficial.
However, on occasions, Leeds n on-m em ber supporters - perhaps those living near the ground Leeds U n ited


                                                         53
are due to visit - m anage to get tickets intended for h om e supporters at or from the ground. They then get
into the wrong end and cause trouble. This seem s to be what happened at A yresom e Park on 9 D ecem ber
1989. Much therefore depends upon the care and scrutiny given to ticket allocation by the h o m e club. Often
it is too easy for segregation plans to be thwarted by ready availability to all o f tickets from the h om e club
whether at the box office or even by credit card over the telephone. I appreciate the difficulty o f identifying
surely h om e and away supporters but clubs should review their procedures with a view to tightening them.

  319.    D esp ite its im perfections, I consider the away m em bers on ly solution has som e merit both in
excluding undesirables from away supporters’ enclosures and in encouraging the growth o f club m em bership
schem es conferring real benefits on m embers. It should be given further consideration.




                                                       54
                                                 CHAPTER 11

                        OTHER POSSIBLE MEASURES AGAINST HOOLIGANS

Exclusion Orders
   320. At present, pursuant to Part IV o f the Public Order A ct 1986, a court, on convicting a person o f an
offence con n ected with football has power, in addition to im posing a sentence, making a probation order or
discharging him , to m ake an exclusion order prohibiting him from entering prem ises to attend any football
match. The exclusion order must be for not less than three m onths. I f a breach is proved, the offender is liable
to im p rison m ent for o n e m onth, to a fine or to both.

  321. This provision has not m ade m uch impact. It has not been greatly used by the courts. W hen orders
have been m ade they have tended to be for too short a period. On on e occasion, absurdly, Justices im p o s ed a
three m o n th exclusion order on an offender appearing before th em in May! A great weakness o f a bare
exclusion order is the difficulty o f discovering whether it is being obeyed or flouted.

  322. By section 27(5) o f the Football Spectators A ct 1989, the provisions o f the Public Order A ct 1986
relating to exclusion orders shall cease to have effect w hen the Secretary o f State, by Statutory Instrument,
brings the 1989 Act into effect. So exclusion orders will go, to be replaced by expulsion from the national
m em bership schem e under Part I o f the 1989 Act and restriction orders under Part II, as I shall explain in the
next Chapter.

Enforcing Exclusion by Attendance Centre Order
  323. Were exclusion orders to be retained and used m ore realistically there are two additional measures
which could be taken to enforce them . First, there could be provision for attaching to an exclusion order a
requirement to attend at an appointed centre on the o ccasion s o f designated football matches. Failure to
attend w ould im m edia tely be detected and w ould render the absentee liable to further penalties including
im prisonm ent.

   324. Such a m easure w ould have a num ber o f merits. A mere ban on entering grounds m ay be flouted
w ithout detection and in any event does not ban presence near the ground. An attendance centre order w ould
provide a m ean s not m erely to ban a hooligan from entry to a ground but to keep him physically from going
there. H e w ould thus be prevented from causing trouble outside or near the ground as well as inside it. This
would be ach ieved without adding to the prison population, unless he defaulted, and without any elaborate
schem e im pinging on spectators generally. T he provision would be the logical counterpart in the d om estic
scene to the provisions o f Part II o f the 1989 Act relating to foreign matches.

Is it Practicable?
   325. I appreciate that detaining con v icted hooligans during designated matches in the d o m estic football
programme is a bigger undertaking and w ould im pose a m ore restrictive penalty than requiring them merely
to report on the occasions o f English m atches abroad. It is necessary, therefore, to consider the present
structure o f attendance centres, what extension o f it m ight be necessary, the resource im plications and the
fairness o f such a measure.

Attendance Centres
  326. At present section 17 o f the Crim inal Justice Act 1982 em powers courts to m ake attendance centre
orders for young people under 21 who:

     (a) have been co n victed o f an im prisonable offence;

     (b) have defaulted on paym ent o f their fines etc; or

     (c) have failed to com ply with the requirements o f a probation or supervision order.

  Attendance centre orders m ay not be used for those w ho have previously been given a custodial sentence
except in special (undefined) circum stances. The m in im u m length o f an order is 12 hours, except for those
under 14. T he m ax im u m is 24 hours under 17, and 36 hours for those aged 17 to 20.



                                                        55
  327. At present there are 137 centres: 111 ju n io r centres for those aged under 17, and 26 senior centres for
those aged 17 to 20 (males only). The senior centres are, for the m ost part, in the larger conurbations. The
H om e O ffice has recently reviewed the use o f the jun ior centres and som e with low attendance figures are
being closed.

  328. M ost centres are in school prem ises. They are normally open for 2 (ju n ior) or 3 (senior) hours every
other Saturday, usually, but not invariably, in the afternoon. Each centre is staffed by an officer in charge,
norm ally an off-duty or retired p olice officer, assisted by other instructors. R egim es include physical
education and at least one other activity.

  329. Subject to these factors, attendance centre orders can be m ade at present against those co n victed o f
football related offences. They cannot however be im posed on anyone over 21, or anyone w ho has had a
custodial sentence.

  330. Effectively to exclude the offender from football grounds, it w ould be necessary to have the centre
open at least on every Saturday afternoon during the season. To try to include week-day evening m atches
would create difficulties in m aking centres available and might be thought too oppressive on the offender. If
power to’m ake orders were extended to cover those over 21 and those w ho have served a custodial sentence,
the centre w ould have to provide for a m ore challenging type o f offender. It w ould probably be thought
inappropriate to m ix 17 to 20 year old attenders with more hardened hooligans.

Resource Implications
   331. Such an extension w ould probably involve an increase in the num ber and calibre o f staff. Presently,
as indicated earlier, staff include retired and off-duty police officers. More such personnel w ould be required.
However, such increases might be m o dest in com parison with the police resources likely to be required to
im plem en t the national m em bership schem e (see paragraphs 4 2 0 to 42 3 infra).

Fairness
  332. I w ould not suggest that the im p o sitio n o f an attendance order should be a mandatory
accom pan im ent to an exclusion order. It w ould be a discretionary power available to the courts to be used in
accordance with the sam e criteria as apply in Part II o f the 1989 Act, ie no such order could be m ade unless
the court was satisfied that m aking it in relation to the accused w ould help to prevent vio len ce or disorder at
or in co n n ection with designated football m atches (cf section 15(2) o f the 1989 Act). T h is w ould enable the
courts to keep the numbers o f orders w ithin m anageable lim its and to apply them only in serious cases where
the offender might otherwise be in danger o f a custodial sentence.

  333. In such situations, i f the offender were judged by the court to be a com m itted football hooligan, and
were required to attend for say two hours each Saturday in the football season, to a m a x im u m o f 36 hours (ie
nearly half a season) or even 72 hours, he could not surely have any just grievance. The order w ould be less
harsh than even the shortest prison sentence and, from the public’s point o f view, m uch m ore effective.

   334. I recognise the practical difficulties in im plementing extended attendance centre orders but, if those
difficulties can be overcome, the schem e would have considerable merits. I accordingly recommend that
consideration be given to implementing it.

Tagging
  335. A second possible measure to enforce exclusion from the ground and its environs is electronic
m onitoring or tagging. T his device is used successfully in the U n ite d States. Pilot schem es are presently being
run here by the H om e Office. A ccused persons on rem and are kept under supervision using anklets with
small radio transmitters linked to a central computer. D esp ite reports o f so m e difficulty with the pilot
schem es, Mr John Patten in an answer to a Parliamentary Q u estion on 10 January 1989 stated:-

  “It is already clear that the technology can be put to practical use and that the procedures for fitting the
  eq u ipm en t and m onitoring defendants are practicable. It w ould now be desirable to test the use o f
  electronic m onitoring on a trial basis in an area in w hich substantial numbers are likely to be eligible for its
  application as a con d ition o f bail.”

Moreover, you are reported as having said to the Bow Group on 11 D ecem b er 1 9 8 9 :-


                                                         56
 “There is a need for courts to have powers to m ake curfew orders, confining offenders to their h o m es at
 certain tim es. This should not be a 24 hour house arrest. They need to be able to go to work i f they have a
 job, attend training courses or probation centres, or receive treatm ent for alcohol or drug misuse. But som e
 types o f crim e - pub brawls, for exam ple, or car thefts - could be reduced by curfew orders. I very much
 hope that our experim ents with electronic m onitoring will enable it to be extended from defendants on
 rem and to sentenced offenders, so as to m ake a curfew order properly enforceable”.

  336. If the experim ents do enable the tagging to be extended to sentenced offenders, it w ould be a m ost
useful and effective way o f ordering con victed hooligans, excluded from grounds, to rem ain at h om e during
designated matches. Their ob ed ien ce to the orders could be m onitored w ithout excessive resource
requirements.

   337. I therefore recommend that consideration be given to using this technology in the sentencing of
offenders convicted o f football-related offences.

                                                  CHAPTER 12

                                 O BJECT A N D PR O V ISIO N S OF TH E ACT

  338. T he principal object o f the Football Spectators Act is to break the link between football and
hooliganism . It aim s to do this by a national m em bership schem e requiring spectators to purchase and hold
m em bership cards without which they will not gain adm ission. T h ose who co m m it relevant offences or
otherwise m isbehave in a football context will be deprived o f m em bership and thus be excluded from
attending m atches. It is h oped that by this strategy hooligan activity will be elim inated both inside and
outside football grounds. Thus, Mr Ridley, then Secretary o f State for the Environm ent, said at the launch o f
the Bill on 17 January 1989:—

  “ For the first time, there will be an effective and com prehensive procedure to keep hooligans away from
  football m atches. O f course there will be attempts to abuse the system but if the schem e is effective, those
  attempts will fail. W e believe that it offers the real prospect o f ending football hooliganism both inside and
  outside grounds. If hooligans know that they will not be allowed into football m atches, they will have no
  incentive to travel to them . T he link between football and hooliganism will be broken and football will
  cease to be a focus for v io len ce.”

Provisions of Part I
  339. The Statute is an enabling Act and permits the Secretary o f State to m ake an order by Statutory
Instrument to bring it into operation (section 27(2)). I do not propose to set out all the provisions o f the A ct in
every detail. In the broadest terms, however, Part I o f the Act is to the following effect.

  340. Section 1(5) provides for a national m em bership schem e (“the sch em e”) to restrict “the generality o f
spectators attending designated football m atches to persons who are m em bers o f the schem e” . Section 1(2)
gives the Secretary o f State power to designate football m atches or an individual match.

   341. Two new bodies are to be appointed by the Secretary o f State. T he first is the Football M em bership
Authority (FM A ), a corporate body with articles o f association. T he FM A is to be responsible initially for
drafting the schem e (section 4(1)). The Secretary o f State is em powered to approve the schem e, again by
Statutory Instrument (section 4(3)). The FM A is then to be responsible for the adm inistration o f the schem e
(section 3(1)). Section 7 disqualifies from b eco m in g or continuing to be a m em ber o f the schem e anyone
subject to an exclusion order under section 30 o f the Public Order Act 1986 (after conviction o f an offence
connected with football) whilst he is so subject. Also, anyone con victed o f a relevant offence, being on e o f
those listed in Schedule 1 to the new Act, is likewise disqualified. A nyone so co n victed is disqualified for five
years if he receives an im m ediate prison sentence and for two years i f not.

   342. T he second body is a quango to be called the Football Licensing A uthority (FLA) (section 8). The
FLA is to be responsible for the grant (section 10( 1)) or refusal (section 10(3)) o f a licence to adm it spectators
to any prem ises to watch any designated football m atch there. It has power to im pose con d itio n s on the
licence (section 10(4) to (7)), to m ake inspections and inquiries (section 10(8)) and to vary a licen ce (section
10( 10)), suspend or revoke it (section 12). In m aking decision s under section 10, the FLA is to have regard to
whether the equipm ent, the prem ises and the responsible persons there are such as to secure com p lian ce with
the scheme.

   343. The FLA also has ancillary functions, as noted earlier; first, to include in a licence, if the Secretary o f
State so directs, a co n d ition as to seating (section 11); secondly, to keep under review and oversee the
discharge by local authorities o f their 1975 Act functions regarding football grounds and Safety Certificates
(section 13).

Contents of the Scheme
  344. Section 5(2) prescribes as follow s:-

  “T he schem e must include provision -

    (a) securing that the only spectators perm itted to attend at designated football m atches are authorised
        spectators;
   (b) provid in g for tem porary m em b ersh ip o f the schem e, in clud ing (in particular) the tem porary
       m em bership o f football club guests;

   (c) provid in g for the a d m is sio n as spectators at d esign ated football m atches, w ithout their b eing
       m em bers o f the schem e, o f -

          (i)   disabled persons, and

          (ii) a ccom pan ied children,

          in such circum stances and subject to such co n d itions as are specified in the scheme;

   (d) securing that persons who are disqualified under section 7 below are excluded from m em bership
       w hile so disqualified;

   (e) providing for the exclusion from m em bership, for an appropriate period not exceeding two years
       determ ined under the schem e, o f persons who are, by reference to circum stances specified in the
       schem e, determ ined under the schem e to be unfit for m em bership and for notifying persons who are
       excluded from m em bership o f the grounds for the exclusion;

   (f)    im p o s in g pecuniary p en alties on any persons h aving fu n ctio n s under the sch em e for failure to
          discharge those functions;

   (g) im posin g requirements as respects the procedure to be followed in dealing with applications for
       m em bership o f the schem e and requiring that in Wales any application form for m em bership o f the
       schem e shall also be available in Welsh;

   (h) im p o sin g requirem ents on responsible persons as respects the procedure to be follow ed and
       eq u ipm en t to be used in relation to any designated football m atch to secure that, except in an
       emergency, the only spectators adm itted to and perm itted to remain on the prem ises are authorised
       spectators;

   (i)    to such effect, in relation to the adm ission o f spectators to the premises, as the Secretary o f State may
          specify in writing;

   (j)    establishing and m aintaining a central register o f m em bers o f the scheme:

    (k) regulating the form and contents o f m em bership cards; and

    (1)   establishing procedures for the making and consideration o f representations against decision s m ade
          under the schem e refusing or withdrawing m em bership o f it and for the independent review o f the
          d ecision s in the light o f the representations;

and in this subsection “accom pan ied children” m eans persons under the age o f 10 years in the charge o f an
authorised spectator.”

  345. Section 5(3) prescribes, inter alia, that the schem e may m ake provision for the im position o f charges
for m em bership cards (section 5(3)(b) and by section 5(3)(c)):-

  “for the adm ission as spectators at designated football m atches, without their being mem bers o f the
  schem e, o f descriptions o f person specified in the schem e in such circum stances and subject to such
  con d itio n s as are so sp ecified ”.

  346. My short sum m ary o f Part I o m its a num ber o f provisions eg the constitution o f the FMA and o f the
FLA, details o f offences, defences to them and appeals, D ata Protection Act 1984 im plications etc.

Provisions of Part II
  347. Before proceeding to discuss the im plications o f Part I o f the Act, which are highly controversial, I
should refer to the provisions o f Part II which are not. Although I assum e my remit is lim ited to sports events
within the jurisdiction to which Part I applies, the schem e o f Part II is, I think, relevant.


                                                          59
  348. T he aim o f Part II is to prevent convicted hooligans from travelling to m atches abroad including
m atches in Scotland and there by m isb eh aviour causing trouble and dam aging our national reputation.

   349. T he schem e, again stated in broad terms, is to give courts power to m ake a restriction order after a
conviction for a relevant offence, in addition to any other sentence (section 15). Such an order is to be for five
years if it accom panies an im m ediate sentence o f im prisonm ent; otherw ise for two years (section 16(1)). It
im poses a duty to report at a police station (unless exem pted) on the occasion o f designated football m atches
abroad. Failure so to report is an offence punishable on sum m ary conviction by up to o n e m o n th ’s
im prisonm ent, by a fine or by both (section 16(5)). There is provision in section 22 for m aking restriction
orders consequent upon con victions in countries other than England and Wales for “corresponding o ffences”
to those listed in Schedule 1.

   350. Even those implacably hostile to the provisions o f Part I are m ostly in favour o f Part II. In my view it
is a sensible and practicable m easure to take against a persistent m isch ie f practised by a small m inority but
with national repercussions. To adapt a fam ous dictum , never in the field o f sport has so m uch o d iu m been
brought upon so m any by so few. T he schem e is aim ed directly and solely at the few w hose m isbehaviour
abroad brings such od iu m upon English football supporters generally. I w elcom e it.




                                                        60

                                 TH E NATIONAL M E M B E R S H IP SC H EM E

   351. Returning to Part I, it is crucial to a full evaluation o f its likely im pact to know the terms o f the
schem e to be approved. At present there is no approved schem e, nor even a draft scheme, since the FM A has
not yet been appointed, although the FA and FL have been offered “first refusal” for appointm ent as such. I
do not know therefore how and in what terms such a schem e would com ply with the requirements o f section 5
set out above.

   352. The only guide presently available is the Invitation To Tender (ITT) and the Statem ent O f
Requirem ents (SO R ) prepared by Ernst & Young, M anagem ent Consultants, in conjunction with the
D epartm ent o f the Environm ent. This d o cu m en t is directed to com p anies which have shown interest in
tendering for the contract to-supply the relevant technology. T he ITT was dated 1 D ecem ber 1989 and
required tenderers to respond by 19 January 1990. As I write this report that date is still ahead and so the
response is not known. Presently there are seven potential tenderers.

General Requirements of the ITT and SO R
  353. The successful tenderer will be required to set up, manage and operate a company, the “schem e
operating co m p a n y ” (SOC) to run the entire schem e. It w ill work under the overall policy, supervision and
control o f the FM A. At the outset o f the ITT, certain key objectives have been identified as follows:-

  “ 1. M in im ise the turnstile process tim e and the queuing problem s that might occur in large crowds close
    to kick-off and keep them within acceptable limits.

   2. Fund the schem e, taking account o f its costs and also the possible disin centive effect to supporters o f
   paying m em bership fees.

   3. Ensure the application process, card production and issue procedures m eet the requirements within
   acceptable turnaround tim es to spectators.

   4. Deal with invalid card holders at entry points and ensure that offenders against the m em bership rules
   are dealt with fairly and that any pun ishm ent can be enforced.

    5. Keep within m anageable lim its the size o f the referral file containing banned m em bers to ensure that
    speed o f access to it is acceptable and still have sufficient protection against the use o f lost, stolen, forged
    cards and pass-backs on match days.”

  354. T he SOR provides as follow s:-

  “ Apart from ensuring financial integrity and acceptability o f the m arketing strategy, the FM A will be
    concerned to ensure that:

     1.   the num ber o f supporters is m a x im ised while recovering the cost o f the schem e

     2.   the schem e does not add to problem s outside grounds

     3.   the schem e assists in reducing h o oligan ism .”

   That the schem e must be self-funding is further stressed in the ITT as follow s:-

   “T he Football M em bership Schem e will be self-funding, that is, the SOC will be responsible for all costs
    and expenses (including set-up costs) incurred in carrying out its obligations under the contract and
    shall reimburse the F M A for expenditure incurred by the FM A both on the SOC ’s b eh a lf relating to the
    schem e and in respect o f the FM A fulfilling the requirements o f the Act.

    T he costs o f running the FM A will also need to be recovered from the in co m e generated by the SOC.

    The levels o f m em bership fees including any variations over the period o f the contract, will be subject to
    the prior approval o f the F M A ”.


                                                              61
Ground Modifications
  355. As to the cost o f ground m odifications, the IT T notes:

  “It is anticipated that there could be a significant cost involved in a ccom m od ating the m em bership
  validation system at som e grounds. Therefore any m odifications to be m ade to the existing turnstile
  equipm ent and the inclusion o f any new turnstiles should be entered against this item .”

Applications for Membership
   356. A pplications for m em bership o f the schem e m ust be m ade in person, not by post, using a standard
application form. T h e form will include personal particulars and the type o f application. This may be for
adult m em bership, renewal, replacement, change o f details, temporary, junior or senior m em bership. The
form will state the m em bership period (normally two seasons), the applicant’s n om in ated club allegiance,
second club allegiance and national allegiance. It will include a b ox to allow exclusion from any m ailing lists.
T h e Post Office and the clubs will act as collection points for handling applications and carrying out an initial
verification process. This will require the applicant to produce evidence to prove identity and on e or m ore
passport standard photographs. T he collecting agent will be responsible for checking the form, the
acceptability o f the photographs and their general likeness to the applicant as well as the other evidence o f
identification. H e will also accept the fee.

  357. T h e SO R provides:-

    Vetting o f applications at the point o f presentation in a collection agency m ust be consistent and m ethod s
  to ensure that vetting procedures are followed m ust be em ployed. T he integrity o f the system as an
  anti-hooligan measure will depend on this vetting procedure.”

  358. The SOR states that the m ajor problem in handling the application will be to ensure that the attached
photographs are linked to the application details to enable the subsequent correct printing o f m em bership
cards.

Validation Procedures
   359. I concentrate on applications for adult, jun ior or senior m em bership. In these cases, the SOR
provides two basic validation procedures which m ust be followed. The first is a “person check”, explained as
follow s:-

  “T he purpose o f this check is to stop supporters getting m ore than on e m em bership card. The reason being
  that a ban on on e m em bership registration w ould still leave the supporter in possession o f another
  m em bership card. Therefore there will be both a nam e and an address check against the m em bership
  registration database (postcoding o f all addresses will obviously m ake this procedure a lot faster and it may
  be necessary to insist upon postcodes from the start). Also it is not sufficient to undertake a straight nam e
  and address check due to different ways to spell nam es and addresses. The prim e contractor should
  propose m ethod s to ensure that adequate checking is undertaken against deliberate m ultiple applications.”

   360. Secondly, there m ust be a “referral file check”. T he referral file will contain particulars o f the
following:

  “ - persons banned from m em bership (existing m em bers)

    - persons who are considered to be undesirable due to their past record who have not yet applied for
      m em bership (this will include those with existing exclusion orders against them )

    - lost/stolen m em bership cards either by direct notification or due to an application for a replacement
      card

    - fraudulent cop ies.”

Provision and Updating of Information to Clubs
  361. T he national referral list will be co m m un icated to all 92 League clubs. Moreover, the list will have to
be updated weekly during the football season to add fresh instances o f any o f the four categories o f exclusion
m en tion ed in the last paragraph; also, to remove from the list those no longer excluded eg after a successful
appeal.


                                                        62
  362. Each club will also be given the n am es o f those successful applicants who have claim ed allegiance to
the club. From this inform ation the club will be required to keep a register o f its own m embers.

Exploitation of the System
   363. T he ITT provides for the F M A by itself or a designated agent to be responsible for approving and
co-ordinating the SOC’s com m ercial exploitation o f the N a tional M em bership File and extracts from that
file. This is said to be “in order to protect and prom ote the reputation o f football to avoid any possible
conflict w ith existing and future com m ercial activities at a club and national level”. T he F M A may also
licence clubs to use data relating to m em bers w ho express allegiance to that club o n terms and con d itions to
be agreed.

Membership Cards
  364. It is m andatory that the m em bership card must carry a photograph o f the m ember, the m em b er’s
name, full m em bership number, the expiry date, club allegiance if any and national allegiance. The
m em bership num ber m ust be in a “m ach ine readable form on the card as it is the only m eth o d o f rapidly
enough m atching the card against the national referral file”.

  365. The card will need to m eet standards for size and durability; it will need to last for m ore than the
normal m em bership period (two years) as this may be increased later.

  366. T he security level m ust ensure that:

  “ - cards are not forgeable

    - photographs cannot be replaced

   - m ach ine readable m em bership num bers cannot be changed

    - printed details on the cards cannot be changed

    - supplies o f blank cards are held in a secure en v iro nm en t.”

  All o f this assum es that the m em bership cards “will be the ‘plastic credit-card’ type” .

Entry Checking Procedures
  367. I now co m e to requirem ents having a critical bearing on safety and crowd control. They concern the
checks and procedures at turnstiles. T he following six provisions are mandatory:

    i      A spectator must present a valid current m em bership card to the turnstile operator.

     ii    “A spectator m ust be authorised to hold the m em bership card and be perm itted to attend the
           designated m atch. (Note: it has been accepted that the turnstile operator will not be able to compare
           the photograph on the card with the person presenting the card as well as undertaking electronic
           checking).”

     iii   T he card m ust not be “present on the referral file” and

     iv    can only be used “once per designated m atch.”

     v     “T h e turnstile operator must not let any person into the m atch w ithout them (sic) producing a
           m em bership card and validating that card using the procedures and eq u ipm en t provided.”

     vi    “T h e system should be capable o f directing m em bers into their perm itted sections o f the ground,
           using the primary and secondary club allegiance field (unless playing each other) in the m em bership
           num ber to determ ine through which entry points the m em ber may pass.”

Turnstile Alarm
   368. If a card fails any o f the six basic checks sum m arised above, the system m ust alert the officials
(stewards and/or police). It m ust also be capable o f alerting the turnstile operator but not alerting the
spectator w hile in the turnstile.


                                                           63
  369. Three types o f failure are envisaged.

    (1) Referral file check shows the card is subject to a ban; card notified as lost or as stolen; alternatively,
        the card has been used previously at that m atch (pass-back).

    (2) Equipm ent/card m alfunction, m em bership expired,tem porary card not valid for match.

    (3) Card being presented at the “wrong” turnstile or no card at all.

Detection
  370. The procedure to be followed in relation to each o f these three types o f failure is m andatory and
im portant in the evaluation o f the schem e for safety and crowd control.

  371. If the failure is o f type (1):-

  “The suspect should be apprehended and taken to an investigation area either inside or outside the ground.
  These will be situated at con ven ient places around the ground. It is anticipated that there will need to be
  one investigation area on each side o f the ground, although this is likely to depend on ground co n d itio n s”.

  If the failure is o f type (2 ):-

  “The card will be retained at the entry point and a receipt for the card given to the spectator. This receipt
  will contain either the m em bership num ber or so m e m ethod to identify the retained card later. The
  spectator will be advised to contact the club afterthe m atch when the problem may have been resolved” .

  If the failure is o f type (3):-

  “The spectator is turned back from the entry p o in t”.

System Contingency
   372. Systems at turnstiles m ust be capable o f operating “a degraded service” in the event o f system
m alfunction. This m ust include replacement o f any m alfunctioning unit within five m inu tes and alternative
power supplies if the system relies on external power. I f cabling is used it m ust be tamper p ro o f and m ore than
on e route m ust be provided between “every turnstile installed unit” and the processing unit. Turnstile
systems must not depend on a single club com puter system.

Performance and Environmental Conditions
  373. Finally, two m andatory provisions are laid down w hich are o f great im portance to safety and crowd
control.

  374. As to performance the SOR provides:-

  “It is critical that the conducting o f the six basic checks and any follow-up procedures described in this and
  the next section m ust give rise to no significant delays to ground entry' at turnstiles. T h e m axim u m
  additional tim e w hich will be considered will be no m ore than 1 second per entry to the norm al ground
  entry rate for a particular turnstile and ground configuration at all tim es” .

  375. As to environm ental conditions, the provision is:-

  “Any systems installed at turnstile locations will have to operate reliably in the co n d itions experienced in
  an outdoor, all-weather, all-year environm ent. Power supplies to turnstiles will be unreliable.”

Summary
  376. As with m y analysis o f the statutory provisions, this sum m ary o f the contents o f the ITT and SOR is
not exhaustive. It seeks only to indicate how the schem e is intended to work and what is expected o f it.




                                                         64
                                                   CHAPTER 14

                          A R G U M E N T S R AISED BY CRITICS OF TH E SC H E M E

  377.     H a v in g sum m arised the intended objects and benefits o f the schem e and the m eans by w hich it is
required to achieve them , I turn now to the arguments against the schem e raised by its critics.

  (i) Disproportionate?
  First, it is said that the schem e with all its co m p lex ram ifications is out o f proportion to the problem .
  Setting up the technology and m aintaining it secure and in working order; adapting grounds to install it;
  dealing with m illions o f applications swiftly; issuing m illions o f cards, renewing them , coping w ith lost and
  stolen cards; setting up a referral list, distributing it and updating it; training staff; coping with banned
  cards and other failures at the turnstile; processing offenders; dealing fairly with appellants - these, and
  other ancillary measures, am oun t to an en orm ou s undertaking. It is aim ed principally at keeping hooligans
  out o f the ground, but, so it is said, the problem inside grounds is less than it was and could be m et by other
  less co m p lex and less am bitiou s strategies.

  (ii) Unfair?
  In aim in g to exclude a m inority o f hooligans from the football scene, it is com plained that the huge
  majority o f decent spectators are to be put by the schem e to trouble and expense. Each fan will have to go
  through the application procedures, presenting his form, proving his identity, purchasing and producing
  photographs. He will have to pay between £4 and £ 1 0 a year to jo in the schem e in addition to paying for
  m atch tickets. H e will have to keep his card, rem em ber it on m atch days, guard it from loss and theft, and
  renew it from tim e to tim e for further paym ents. Should he forget it, or lose it, should it be stolen or b eco m e
  damaged, he will be put to trouble to replace it and to gain entry to m atches m eanwhile. It is argued that
  measures against hooligans should target the hooligans only, not in co n ven ience m illions o f spectators in
  the hope o f w eeding out a few.

  (iii) Casual Spectators
  There is anxiety that the schem e will, in effect, exclude from football the spectator who attends only on a
  casual basis or for a rare m atch w hich takes his fancy. Such a spectator, it is argued, would not go to the
  expense or trouble (especially the latter) o f buying a m em bership card sim ply to attend an occasional
  match. This category o f spectator is thought possibly to account for som e 20% o f present attendances -
  sizeable num bers to be deprived o f their present freedom to watch football.

  (iv) Dim inished Club Revenue
  Taking these lost casual visitors together with former regular attenders who may also find the schem e a
  disincentive, the clubs fear their revenue will be severely reduced. For this reason, inter alia, they have been
  strongly o p p o sed to the scheme.

  (v) Danger o f Congestion and Disorder
  There is concern that the am bitious technology, w hich is yet to be produced and tested, m ay fail.
  Alternatively, that even if, by persistence and through trial and error, it could in the end be m ade to
  function reliably, there may be serious failures in the teething period. In either o f these events the fear is
  that congestion at the turnstiles could cause serious danger or disorder.

  (vi) Will the Scheme Defeat Hooligans?
  Even if the technology works according to plan, will it (a) exclude determ ined hooligans from inside the
  ground and (b) also induce them to stay away from the environs o f the ground? T he criticism is that it
  may do neither o f these things, especially not the latter.

   (vii) Police Resources
  There is concern, especially from the police them selves, as to the numbers o f p olice to be deployed and the
  facilities they will need at the ground to cop e with problem s arising from the schem e at the turnstiles.
  These will involve b anned cards, lost cards, stolen cards, unreadable cards and determ ined hooligans
  trying by various m eans to buck the system.

In short, critics say the schem e proposes a sledgeham m er to crack a nut; a sledgeham m er w hich m ay not
swing at all but, if it does, m ay not swing safely or even reach the nut.

Arguments Relevant to this Inquiry
   378. O f the seven arguments I have just briefly sum m arised, the first four do not bear directly upon safety
or crowd control. T hey m ay have considerable force and (ii) and (iii) do bear upon matters considered in Part
1 o f this Report (especially better treatm ent o f spectators). However, they raise issues o f policy w hich are
essentially for Parliament. Accordingly, I say no more as to those four points.

  379. O n the other hand, arguments (v), (vi) and (vii) do bear very relevantly upon safety and crowd
control. T h ey are therefore within m y rem it and I shall explore them in turn.

                                D A N G ER O F C O N G ESTIO N OR DISORDER

Present Risk of Congestion
   380. C ongestion outside turnstiles and consequent injuries or disorder are already recognised risks. Those
risks are aggravated by the lim ited num ber o f turnstiles available and the lim ited scope for increasing them at
m any old grounds. T hey are also increased by the late arrival o f a large proportion o f the crowd, w hich is a
co m m on occurrence.

  381. D uring the last busy 20 m inu tes before kick-off, queues, or som etim es a phalanx, o f waiting
spectators, tend to build up. If the delivery through the turnstiles is delayed or slowed down, that build-up
grows and its pressure further retards the turnstile operation. T h e next stage is that those waiting becom e
restive, fearing they will not get in for the kick-off. Crowd noise from the ground, denoting that the team s are
out, increases im patience. There is then real danger o f pressure towards the turnstiles causing injuries and
panic causing disorder. This is w hat happened at Hillsborough. It is said that it nearly happened again,
despite H illsborough and the interim recom m endations, at Coventry on the first day o f the new season.

Additional Time to Check Cards
  382. T h ese risks have existed even w ithout a national m em bership scheme. Since the schem e requires
that all spectators passing through the turnstiles m ust produce their m em bership cards for checking, it is
inevitable that som e additional tim e will be taken for each spectator.

  383. In realistic acknow ledgem ent o f the risk this might create, the ITT states as its first key objective:-

  “M inim ise the turnstile process tim e and the queuing problem s that might occur in large crowds close to
  kick-off and keep them within acceptable lim its”.

  The SOR likewise requires the F M A to ensure:-

  “T he schem e does not add to problem s outside grounds”.

  More specifically, 1 repeat the m andatory provision o f the SO R as follow s:-

  “It is critical that the conducting o f the six basic checks and any follow-up procedures ... m ust give rise to
  no significant delays to ground entry at turnstiles. T he m a x im u m additional tim e w hich will be considered
  will be no m ore than 1 second per entry to the normal ground entry rate for a particular turnstile and
  ground configuration at all t im e s”.

  384. Even if this is achieved, it would reduce the num bers per hour adm issible through a turnstile from
the norm o f 500 (m ention ed in A ppendix 3 at paragraph 33) to about 436.

  385. But can it be achieved? T h is depends upon two factors: (i) what has to be done at the turnstile; (ii)
whether the technology can achieve the required rate; not on ly in favourable co n d itions but in real life and
despite attem pts to defeat it.

     (i)   Procedures at the Turnstiles
  386. T he six entry checks w hich have to be undertaken at the turnstile (see supra paragraph 367) require
the spectator to “present a valid current m em bership card to the turnstile operator”. So, in the norm al case,
there will be a passing o f the card to the operator, a validation o f it by him, and a return o f the card to the
holder - all o f this to be additional to buying a ticket or (at an all-ticket match) presenting a ticket and having
the stub returned.

   387. T h e system as prescribed in the ITT d epends upon the operator getting possession o f the card
because it has to be “retained” at the turnstile if there is a failure o f type (2) eg m alfunction or card expired.
T his requirem ent is significant when one is dealing with a tim e factor not to exceed 1 second. T he schem e is
unlike that at Luton, for exam ple, which m ust be quicker since (a) there are tw o sets o f turnstiles with an
operator only at the inner set and (b) the m em ber sw ipes his own card through at the outer turnstile. If the
ITT were to be changed to follow the Luton exam ple, however, what w ould happen at grounds where there is


                                                          67
insufficient space for two sets o f turnstiles and how w ould the operator get possession o f the card so as to
“retain” it if there were a malfunction?

  388. If the turnstile alarm alerts the operator to a failure o f type (1) - a banned, lost or stolen card or
pass-back - the suspect is to be apprehended. T he turnstile operator will therefore have no m ore to d o with
him; but how long it will take to have the suspect apprehended inside or outside the turnstile will d epend on
the police presence to w hich I shall turn later.

  389. If the failure is o f type (2), apart from retaining the card, the operator is required to give the holder a
receipt for it w hich “will contain either the m em bership num ber or so m e other m eth od to identify the
retained card later”. Since the operator will be unable to anticipate the card numbers o f those which fail for a
type (2) reason, he cannot have a receipt ready in advance. If he has to m ake on e out, hand it to the entrant
and explain the procedure for redeem ing the card later, the exercise w ould take considerably longer than 1
second - especially if, as w ould be likely, there is som e backchat.

   390. It is true that the SO R requirement that the schem e m ust add no m ore than 1 second to the turnstile
time, although said to be m andatory and critical, could be changed. However, in my v iew the authors o f the
SOR were right to choose 1 second as “the m ax im u m additional tim e w hich will be co n sid ered ”. At 500 per
hour, each entrant has 7.2 seconds to go through the turnstile. Any additional tim e could cause difficulty; 1
second is an addition o f nearly 14% to the existing 7.2 seconds and m ore than 1 secon d w ould, as the SOR
says, be unacceptable.

  391. If the failure is o f type (3) - wrong turnstile: no card - the ITT requires that “the spectator is turned
back from the entry p oin t”. The evidence I heard at Sheffield from m any police witnesses, and all I have seen
and read since, m akes it clear that where there are queues, let alone a phalanx, trying to get so m eo n e w ho is
wedged in the narrows o f a turnstile back through those waiting is at best a slow, laborious and unpopular
exercise. At Hillsborough, the crush m ade it im possible.

    (ii) The Technology
  392. It has yet to be shown that a com puterised system can be produced w hich is capable, even in
favourable conditions, o f achieving reliably the requirem ents o f the ITT. So far as I am aware, nowhere has a
com puterised system been installed to cope with the m assive numbers o f people, in the short period o f tim e
and in the all-weather context which will be required by this schem e, quite apart from the added problem s o f
attempted disruption. The schem e therefore invites tenderers to break new ground. The fact that it has not
been done before does not, o f course, show that it cannot be done. But it does require greater caution and a
m ore extensive testing procedure than if there were a successful precedent.

  393. The only com parable exercise which has been attem pted was a Football Identity Card Schem e in
Holland. That failed in its early stages and has been shelved. However, I should stress that the D utch schem e
was very different from that proposed under the 1989 Act. It involved only five clubs with a bad history o f
hooliganism and it applied only to the away m atches o f those clubs. Only 2 5 ,0 0 0 cards were issued. M uch
depended on careful control o f ticket sales. The schem e was introduced at the start o f the 1 98 9 /9 0 season.
Unfortunately, the op ening m atches o f the season featured two o f the five clubs hosting two o f the others.
Ticket sales were n ot controlled effectively, the clubs were hostile to the schem e, away supporters were
adm itted w ithout tickets and supporters on both sides com b ined to defeat the experim ent.

  394. In these circumstances, I do not think that the failure o f the D utch schem e can found a fair argument
against the totally different schem e proposed in the 1989 Act. What it does show is the need to m ake any such
schem e p roof against wrecking tactics.


Demonstration
  395. One o f the seven potential tenderers gave a dem onstration to a Parliamentary group using a
laboratory prototype to show the technology they could deploy. That being so, a sim ilar dem onstration was
arranged for m e and m y Assessors. We were shown a “smart-card” and how it could be program m ed and used
as a football m em bership card. Each “smart-card” contains its own m ini-com puter. M uch inform ation can
be stored inside it. T he dem onstration showed the holder passing the card over a reader and the possible
responses o f red, am ber or green light, d epending on w hether the card was valid, doubtful or invalid.
Advertising possibilities and other packages o f benefits were also explained and illustrated.


                                                        68
  396. I was extrem ely impressed by w hat we were shown. However, this was a single card, at a single
simulated turnstile, in warm, dry, indoor con d itions, w ithout a large national referral file to be searched and
without anyone trying to circum vent or wreck the system.

Police Apprehensions
  397. I quote from the written evidence subm itted by A C P O :-

  “T he q uestion, however, w hich m ost concerns police officers relates to the efficacy o f the technology. The
  (Act) naturally does not detail how it will work or what is required o f it but, it is clear that, unless it is robust
  and virtually trouble-free, it will be counter-productive. In the worst case it could be m assively
  counter-productive. At the least each turnstile m ust have access to a national database and m ust be able to
  survey that database alm ost instantaneously. T h e m ach ine itself m ust be durable against sabotage . . . and
  m ust work w ithou t persistent f a u lt .. . .

  All our experience to date has been that com puter salesm en have offered m uch and delivered little. The
  police feel that they must be in volved in the specification for any technology and would need to be satisfied
  that it works before support could be given to this schem e. T he consequ en ces o f repeated failure, hostile
  queues, interm inable delays and the rest, are u nthinkable”.

Computer Reliability
   398. T he concern expressed in that passage about com puter performance is not unduly cynical. Many
people have personal experience o f com puter failures in on e field or another. The com puter “going d ow n ” at
an airport causing delays at check-in, com puter errors in banks, problem s w ith com puterised entrances to the
London U nderground, and, recently, com p uter “viruses”, are m erely a few exam ples. These problems
continue to occur from tim e to tim e even with com puter system s w hich have been thoroughly tested, which
are w idely used and have long ago passed through what was thought to be the teething period. In m any cases
such failures cause delay or annoyance but not danger. T he technology for the present schem e, however, has
not yet been through the stage o f teething troubles. Moreover, the schem e could cause dangerous build-ups if
the technology either failed w holly or failed to work at the stipulated rate. In the London Underground,
where build-ups were occurring, a m anned entrance channel has had to be provided at m any stations
alongside those which are com puterised, as a safety valve. To have to open extra non-com puterised entrances
at football grounds would (unlike the Underground) scupper the system. Its w hole and sole point is to exclude
hooligans by com puter checking.

  399. In fact, the Act seem s to leave it open to the FM A to include in the schem e power for a person in
authority to open gates and let spectators in, whether they have m em bership cards or not, should an
em ergency arise (section 2(2), section 5(2)(h), section 5(3)(c) and section 10( 12)(a)). If the exercise o f that
power should have to be considered, all the problems w hich arose outside Hillsborough w ould arise again
- deciding whether the power should be exercised or not ; if so, at what m o m en t and by whom ; m aking a clear
decision and com m un icatin g it; coping with the in-rush and the loss o f control and o f segregation it may
cause. If the power had to be exercised, the schem e w ould be discredited at that place on that day and perhaps
generally.

Relaxation in an Emergency
  4 00. I said in the last paragraph that the Act “seem s to include power” to relax the turnstile requirements
in an emergency. But the power is only to be inferred by im plication from the four sub-sections I have cited.
N owhere is the power expressly given; nor is it said w ho shall exercise it or how “an em ergency” is to be
interpreted. T he adm ission o f authorised spectators only, and only by production o f their m em bership cards,
seem s to be fundam ental to the scheme. Yet there is no stipulation in the Act that cards have to be produced.
N o doubt this could be provided for in the approved schem e. But since anyone other than an authorised
spectator c o m m its a criminal offence by entering the ground, adm itting a non-authorised spectator is a
serious m atter and could am ount to aiding and abetting a criminal offence. It is therefore surprising that the
Act does not indicate who is to have power to declare an em ergency so as to adm it all and sundry and in what
circumstances.

 Tests
    401. W hat testing >s envisaged? The ITT provides for a “system testing strategy”. This is d ivid ed into
 “laboratory11 prototypes and pilot system tests. Two clubs have volunteered and been accepted to be the pilot
 sites for the latter form o f testing. T hey are Derby C ounty and Reading. It is envisaged that at least four
 different levels o f test will be carried out at each o f the two clubs. These four levels are likely to be:


                                                           69
    i     issue m em bership cards to existing members;

    ii    issue cards to all h om e or away supporters;

    iii   small all-ticket match (hom e and away supporters);

    iv    large (near capacity) all-ticket match.

  402. The ITT provides:

  “Each test will try to sim ulate as close (sic) as possible the live situation with problem cards being used at
  random ” .

   403. I foresee two problem s w hich beset this testing procedure. First, the difficulty o f m aking the test
con d itions truly sim ulate those which will obtain when the schem e is working nationw ide. For exam ple, only
two clubs are to be used for the tests “with problem cards being used at ra n d om ”. U nless the com puters at the
two clubs have to search a referral list (whether real or sim ulated) as long as the national referral list m ay turn
out to be, they will not have been adequately tested for capacity and speed. T he estim ated vo lu m e o f
“banned” cards, according to the SOR, is between 5,000 and 2 0 ,0 0 0 per annum . T he estim ate o f stolen and
lost cards is between 2 0 ,0 0 0 and 8 0 ,0 0 0 per annum . It is not clear w hether “per a n n u m ” refers to the
numbers on the referral file in any given year or to the num ber o f fresh bannings, losses and thefts each year.
Taking the m ore conservative approach, however, they could join tly am ount to 1 0 0,000 per annum .
Accordingly, for a realistic test, the com puters at the two clubs would have to be able swiftly to pick out the
“problem cards” from a list o f up to 1 00,000 - som ew hat different from the Luton list o f six.

  404. T he size o f the referral list m ay have an im portant bearing on the speed at w hich the technology can
work. I repeat that key objective num ber 5 in the ITT stipulates:-

  “Keep w ithin m anageable limits the size o f the referral file containing banned m em bers to ensure that
  speed o f access to it is acceptable etc” .

    How is the referral file to be kept “w ithin m anageable lim its11? Its size will surely depend upon the num ber
o f cards banned, lost or stolen. There can be no m anagem ent control o f the numbers lost and stolen and the
num ber banned will depend on the num ber o f con v ictio n s or acts o f m isbehaviour meriting a ban. The only
way o f keeping the num ber banned “within m anageable lim its” would be not to ban all those w ho m ay
deserve it, w hich would bring the schem e into disrepute.

  405. The SOR estim ates that the num ber o f cards w hich are unreadable or otherwise require investigation
may be up to 3% o f the cards being checked. So at a capacity m atch with 5 0 ,0 0 0 present, the test would
require 1,500 m alfunctioning cards to be randomly issued. Presumably, the num ber o f unreadable cards
would tend to grow during the first two years o f the schem e as the first issue o f cards accum ulates damage
from rough treatment.

  406. Again, with pilot tests at only two clubs, the hooligans’ response will be unpredictable. T hey m ay try
to sabotage the schem e at the pilot clubs w hich would really put the technology to the test. T hey may,
however, prefer to m isbehave at som e other ground where no tests are in progress. W hen the schem e is
im plem ented generally, they will be unable to go to any such “other ground” and m ay only then m ake their
attempts to sabotage the scheme.

Human Guinea-pigs
  407. T he second problem is that tests can only be carried out by using real spectators. Bank com puters and
other com puter technologies can be tested by putting through figures, data and print-outs. This system can
only be tested by putting through people. So in the very testing o f whether the system m ay cause danger,
danger m ay be caused.

Disruption and Sabotage
   408. T he w hole raison d ’etre o f the schem e is the perceived need to elim inate from football a hooligan
elem ent so substantial, and so determ ined to make trouble, as to justify this en orm ous undertaking, Since the
schem e seeks to defeat such determ ined hooligans, it m ust be assum ed that the hooligans will seek to defeat


                                                          70
fa y -




         the schem e. They will see it as a challenge. Wrecking or circum venting it will add a new piquancy to the
         perverse pleasure they derive from their activities. Mr Rid ley recognised this on the launch o f the Bill, in the
         passage I have quoted, w hen h e sa id :-

           “O f course there will be attem pts to abuse the system but if the schem e is effective, those attempts will
           fail”.

           409.     Accordingly, the technology will not only have to be capable o f fulfilling the requirements o f the
         schem e w ithout m alfunction, in all weathers and at the stipulated speed. It will also have to be resistant to the
         ingenuity and determ ination o f those w ho m ay seek to sabotage it or find a way round it. It will need to do
         these things not just m ost o f the time, but all o f the tim e. T h is is a very tall order, and for the reasons I have
         set ou t above, I have the gravest doubts if it can be m et. Should it not be m et in full, the safety im plications
         would be serious indeed.




                                                                   71
                                                      CHAPTER 16

                                 WILL THE SCHEME WEED OUT HOOLIGANS?

  410. Even assum ing that the technology can be m ade to work reliably and is not disrupted or sabotaged,
two q uestions still arise on whether the schem e is likely to achieve its objects, (i) Will the schem e in fact weed
hooligans out o f the ground and (ii) will they also be deterred from causing trouble outside the ground or at
places en route?

(i)     Exclusion from the Ground

  411. T he strategy depends first upon the court banning the hooligan after co n viction o f a relevant offence
or the FM A banning him after so m e m isbehaviour. But to im po se a ban is o n e thing; to enforce it is another.
True, the banned hooligan will not lawfully be able to enter by presenting a valid m em bership card o f his
own, o n ce he is on the referral list. But he may still enter by other means.

   412. A serious defect in the schem e is the acceptance that the entry procedure will not involve checking
the photograph on the card against its presenter. Such checking is precluded by the need for speed. But the
m ain rationale o f having a photograph o f the m em ber on his card is defeated if it cannot be relied upon to
exclude so m eo n e else from using the card and will be checked only should the user later be apprehended for
an offence. So if a banned hooligan can get hold o f a valid card he could gain entry. N o t being scrupulous by
nature, he m ay steal one, borrow on e or even buy one, for it is not unlikely that a black market in cards will
develop. D esp ite requirements in the ITT to prevent such abuses, m ultiple applications and forgeries may
also be successfully made.

   413. It is nothing to the point to say that if a b anned hooligan enters the ground by using a stolen or
borrowed card and is there arrested for an assault, he will have com m itted not on e but two offences, the
assault and the unlawful entry. H e could be charged with the assault even w ithou t the 1989 Act, and w ithout
his com m issio n o f the assault, the unlawful entry is likely to go undetected. N or does it seem sound to say
that i f he so enters and is not seen to co m m it an offence in the ground, all is well. At the very least, the system
is brought into disrepute when he brags to his mates that he has beaten it. Police evidence suggests, moreover,
that the m ore sinister m em bers o f hooligan gangs often do not use v io len ce them selves, but, from a vantage
point in the ground, direct the activities o f others.

  414. I refer again to the subm ission from ACPO, a body with special knowledge o f the hooligan problem
and o f how hooligans are likely to react:-

      “T he success o f the proposals will eventually be judged at two levels.

      First, there is the question as to whether this legislation will:—

        (a) progressively remove hooligans from the football grounds and

        (b) deter the allegiance o f those w ho are involved in trouble and v iolen ce but do not necessarily attend
            matches.

      Second, and in a sense more fundamentally, the question rem ains whether or not the sim ple m echanics o f
      processing mem bership cards through turnstiles can actually be achieved.

      T he police view over a long period o f tim e has been that these provisions are, to a great extent, marginal to
      the problem, if for no other reason than they cannot exclude the possibility o f fraud by p eop le w ho are, by
      definition, hell bent upon defeating the system, and because it will take a very long tim e before a significant
      num ber o f potential hooligans are excluded by the scheme. There are som e countervailing advantages:

        (i)   the deterrent effect m ay be considerable;

        (ii) the club disciplinary system m ay well be able to take strong action on the evidence o f C C T V alone;

        (iii) the gam e will be able to exclude m any o f the very worst offenders.

      N oneth eless, the police view is that m any o f the measures that we have already taken        .. . are having a
      significant effect and are far more critical to the problem o f h oolig an ism ”.



                                                             72
(ii)   Elim ination from the Area and Routes Near the Ground
  415. I have already noted that hooligan ism inside the ground has been reduced, largely by CCTV, but has
been transferred outside the ground. I refer again to the subm ission o f ACPO:

   “Two aspects o f control have d o n e m uch to change the nature o f hooliganism . T he legislation which
   prevented the general supply o f alcohol in transit and the universality o f CCTV have m ade a major impact.
   Taken together the effect has been that displays o f wild aggression from hordes o f drunken supporters are
   m uch less frequent. T he hooligan has m oved out o f the camera’s range and in a word, there has been
   “d isp la cem en t” away from the terraces to the darker confines o f the stadium or to other venues such as
   public houses and to the transit system ” .

   416. This, together with other police evidence I have received, shows that although football generally and
a m atch in particular provide the occasion and the focal point for hooligan activity, many hooligans do not
regard it as essential to be able to enter the ground. They need the converging crowds and the inter-club
rivalry or en m ity o f a match to set the scene for their violence. They do not need the football itself. Mr Ridley,
in his observations quoted above (paragraph 338) sa id :-

   “If hooligans know that they will not be allowed into football m atches, they will have no incentive to travel
   to th em ”.

  However, exclusion from the ground d oes not necessarily rem ove the incentive for hooligans to turn up
there.

   417. I fear it m ay be merely wishful thinking to assum e that football hooligans, banned from inside
grounds, will not, if they are free to do so, turn up and cause trouble outside, in public houses or in the town.
It w ould be surprising if hooligans o f Mr Justice PopplewelFs group I (paragraph 48 supra) were totally to
abandon their activities o f attacking and baiting away supporters just because they could not them selves get
into the ground.

  418. It is argued by advocates o f the schem e that elim inating hooligans from outside the ground, as well as
inside it, has been achieved at Lutcn. However, the success at Luton d oes not in my view bear directly upon
the likely o u tco m e o f the national schem e. T he m ain factor in Luton’s success has been the ban on away
supporters w hich removes the focus for violence. There are also the other factors already noted, the
geographical p osition o f Luton, the com paratively small attendances and the fact that the Luton schem e has
operated at only on e club.

  419. I therefore have grave doubts w hether the schem e will achieve its object o f elim inating hooligans
from inside the ground. I have even stronger doubts as to whether it will achieve its further object o f ending
football h ooliganism outside grounds. Indeed, I d o not think it will. I fear that, in the short term at least, it
may actually increase trouble outside grounds.

                                                 CHAPTER 17

                                            POLICE RESO URCES

   420. The schem e envisages that the checking procedure at turnstiles will let valid card holders through but
will produce the three types o f failure already described. Each o f those three types o f failure m ay involve an
offence by the person presenting the card and the first type is quite likely to do so. There will therefore have to
be police present to apprehend the suspect, investigate the circum stances and, it m ay be, m ake an arrest. I
have already quoted the estim ated failures o f types (1) and (2) anticipated in the SOR. Even assum ing the
estim ates are correct for the grounds as a whole, there will be no m eans o f knowing how m any “problem
cards” will be presented at any particular bank o f turnstiles. There will need to be enough police to be able to
m onitor each turnstile throughout the adm ission period. If a banned card is presented, the entrant will need
to be taken by an officer to “an investigation area” . T he SOR anticipates there will need to be one
investigation area at each side o f the ground. Presumably, staff there will be equipped with the m eans to
investigate the problem card fully. It m ay then be necessary for the suspect to be arrested and processed.
W hilst the officer w ho has apprehended him is away from the turnstile through w hich the suspect came,
further card holders should be co m in g through the sam e turnstile at a rate o f about 1 per 8 seconds or faster.
There will therefore need to be enough officers to cope with further problem cards. Even if the apprehending
officer merely takes the suspect to an investigation room and hands him over to officers stationed there
before returning to his post, the turnover rate at the turnstiles w ould need a substantial num ber o f officers.
Requiring stewards to do the job m ay be inappropriate since arrests may have to be made. Again, if the
suspect realises he m ay be about to be arrested, he m ay seek to rush o f f and lose h im s e lf in the crowd. So
dealing with presenters o f “problem cards” may have to be done solely by the police. I f the schem e showed,
after an initial period, that the incidence o f “problem cards” had settled down to a m o dest number, the police
co m m itm en t could be reduced. But initially, considerable numbers will be needed to perform these functions
in addition to those habitually undertaken.

  421. Police anxiety about this co m m itm e n t o f resources is sum m arised as follows by ACPO:

  “T h e second level at which the technology causes concern relates to procedures following a “red light” at
  the turnstiles. Policing at turnstiles at present is very selective and the Police Service could not
  countenance providing the sort o f cover which w ould allow for a quick response to each turnstile in the
  event o f a problem. The only powers conferred in the Bill are on the police and on the face o f it every
  attempt to enter w hich activates a “red light” suggests an offence is being co m m itted. At M anchester
  U n ited for exam ple 3 0,0 00 people will pass through the turnstiles in just over 20 m inutes before kick-off.
  There are about 100 turnstiles and the prospects o f policing this system are absolutely daunting”.

  422. The exam ple o f Manchester U nited in that passage is confirm ed by the club itself in a paper on the
national m em bership schem e entitled “A U nited Perspective”. At page 3, the club says:

  “We have yet to be shown the com puter hardware that will do the work successfully. M anchester U nited
  has run a com puterised b ox office for m ore than 15 years now and it is well known that what is prom ised by
  com puter com panies rarely, if ever, performs to anything like its supposed potential in “real” situations
  where they m ay have had no experience. Average attendances at Old Trafford are around 4 0 ,0 0 0 but on
  occasions this figure can go as high as 56,000. Experience shows that around 50% arrive in the last 30
  m inutes before kick-off and this num ber increases substantially for evening m atches.”

   423. There is a risk therefore that, at big m atches, p olice control o f procedures at the turnstiles during the
last 20 m inutes before kick-off, in addition to their present duties, may create serious problem s. Apart from
the numbers o f officers needed, space will have to be found for investigation rooms. It is doubtful whether
one “investigation area” at each side o f a ground like Old Trafford will suffice. I therefore have strong doubts
about the practicality o f policing the schem e effectively.

                       STRATEGIES AGAINST HOOLIGANISM - CONCLUSIONS

  424. I fully understand and respect the reasons w hich prom pted the prom otion and en actm ent o f the
Football Spectators Act 1989. However, it follows from my co m m en ts in the last three chapters that I have
grave doubts about the feasibility o f the national m em bership schem e and serious m isgivings about its likely
im pact on safety. I also have grave doubts about the chances o f its achieving its purposes and am very anxious
about its potential im pact on police co m m itm e n ts and control o f spectators. For these reasons, I cannot
support the im plem en tation o f Part I o f the Act.

Suggested Strategy
  425. As has been said m any tim es, there is no single measure w hich will defeat football h ooliganism and
even a package o f measures will take tim e to have effect.

  4 26. That said, the strategy I w ould suggest is to consider relying upon a co m b ination o f all or so m e o f the
following m easu res:-

    (i)   D ev elo p in g the detection and evidential potential o f C C T V and the new N ational Football
          Intelligence Unit;

    (ii) Prohibiting, by creating criminal offences, three specific activities in the ground:

          (a) throwing a missile;

          (b) chanting obscene or racialist abuse;

          (c) going on the pitch without reasonable excuse;

    (iii) Extending the courts’ power to m ake attendance centre orders, in conjunction w ith exclusion orders,
          for football related offences on occasions o f specified m atches so as to keep hooligans away from
          football grounds;

    (iv) U sin g electronic m onitoring (tagging) for the sam e purpose.

   427. These four measures are all a im ed solely at the hooligans and will im pinge only on them. Moreover,
(iii) and (iv) are the only measures, other than im prisonm ent, a im ed not only at banning hooligans from the
ground but also at preventing them from getting into it or near it during matches. Put together with progress
towards all-seating, im proved acco m m od a tio n , better facilities, im proved arrangements for crowd control
and better training o f police and stewards to achieve it, I believe these measures w ould give the best chance o f
elim inating or m inim isin g football hooliganism .

D ear Sir Peter

You invited the Technical Working Party “to review technical aspects o f the guide to Safety at Sports
Grounds; identify areas requiring clarification or am endm ent; and recom m end accordingly.” I have pleasure
in subm itting its Report, w hich has been agreed by all m em bers. D etailed supplem entary notes dealing with
certain o f the technical features will be available for your use in due course.

We note that the G u id e is not con fined to football grounds and stadia but includes guidance on all sports
grounds, and we have borne this in m ind in our considerations. Although not within our terms o f reference,
and for that reason not addressed in our Report, we recognise that efficient and effective stewarding is an
integral elem en t o f crowd control and safety. Our reco m m en dation s com plem ent, rather than supplant, the
need for such stewarding.

The Technical Working Party m et first o n 18 October and held five formal day-long m eetings supplem ented
by many working papers and informal discussions during the period available for report. The heavy pressures
o f the tim etable could not have been acco m m od a ted without the fullest co-operation o f those concerned, and
I record my thanks to all m em bers o f the Technical W orking Party and to its Secretary for the integrity,
co m m itm e n t and enthusiasm with which they approached the task.

                                                                                          LEONARD M A U N DER




                            R E P O R T O F T H E T E C H N IC A L W O R K IN G PARTY

The Green Guide
   1. T he Technical Working Party recognises the valuable contributions o f successive editions o f the G uide
to Safety at Sports Grounds, co m m o n ly known as the Green G uide. Its scope and status are described in its
introduction as follows: “This booklet provides guidance to ground m anagem ent, local authorities and
technical specialists such as engineers on m easures for im proving spectator safety at existing sports grounds.
It is a voluntary guide and has no legal force".

   2. In view o f the variability o f existing sports grounds in function and in scale, there are serious difficulties
in establishing com prehensive and general regulations, backed by legal force, to cover all the co m p lex details
o f design and construction. A dherence to the standards set by Building Regulations should provide a
measure o f uniform ity in respect o f new work at sports grounds. Nevertheless, the Technical Working Party is
strongly o f the op in io n that a m uch higher degree o f standardisation than presently prevails should be sought
in practice.

  3. It considers that a revised issue o f the Green G uide should form the basis on which a designated ground
or stand is certified by the certifying authority, and recom m en ds that any departures from its guidance on
technical provisions that m ay arise from local circum stances should be fully defined and should be subject to
approval in writing by the certifying authority.

A Centre o f Expertise
   4. T he Green G u id e covers a w ide range o f material, m uch o f w hich concerns the physical characteristics
o f grounds. Its successive issues have been published in response to a num ber o f serious accidents at football
grounds. This process has led to incremental advances in the G u id e as experience has grown, but the
Technical Working Party d oes not believe that such a process, although essential, is by itself sufficient to cope
with present-day requirements.

  5. M any British football grounds were first constructed a long tim e ago, and im provem ents have been
introduced largely on an individual basis. A central body o f knowledge applicable to the co m p lex design o f



                                                          89
such grounds has been consp icu ously absent although a start has now been made. A s a result, progress has
been piecem eal.

   6. The Technical Working Party considers that this is a serious defect. A con tinu ous and expanding body
o f public knowledge, drawn from the relevant professional fields, is required to provide a basis for good
individual designs at m odern standards. At a tim e w hen substantial im provem ents are under consideration,
including a higher proportion o f seated acco m m o d a tio n , it is im perative to establish and to dissem inate
rigorous standards o f design if expectations are to be fulfilled. The work o f organisations in other countries,
including the C om itato O lim pico N a zio n ale Italiano (CO NI), can provide a valuable reference. The
Technical Working Party recognises, too, the important work undertaken in this country by the Sports
Council. Its recent guide to the planning, design and m anagem ent o f indoor arenas is a noteworthy attempt
to draw together a considerable body o f research and practical experience. Similarly, other work on outdoor
stadia has taken place and is currently proceeding under the C oun cil’s aegis. It is important that resulting
p ublications should be widely d issem in ated and that any guidance on outdoor stadia should m ake particular
reference to the structural aspects o f safety, com fort and crowd control.

   7. The Technical Working Party therefore recom m en ds the form ation o f a central body, under a title such
as the A dvisory Council for Sports G rounds, to provide an authoritative source o f knowledge for all those
involved in the design and construction o f outdoor stadia. A detailed specification o f its structure and
funding is not proposed at this stage but, as envisaged, its m em bers w ould be drawn from the relevant
professional fields and would com m ission specialist ad vice when necessary. It w ould be independent o f any
Inspectorate. T h e relationship o f such a body to other organisations is a m atter for further discussion, but it
is suggested that the Football A ssociation and the Sports C ouncil might w ish to play leading roles.

S e a tin g an d S ta n d in g
  8. T he Technical Working Party notes that FIFA has agreed regulations on seating for certain classes o f
football m atches, and that the regulations are to be im posed within a short time-scale. It also recognises that
the British tradition o f standing on terraces runs counter to these international requirements.

   9. It is clear that if British clubs are to con tinu e w ithin the international com m unity, they will be obliged
to close their standing accom m o d a tio n for m atches that fall w ithin the FIFA definition. For other matches,
the Technical Working Party recognises that, whilst standing a cc o m m od ation is not intrinsically unsafe, the
benefits to spectator com fort and crowd control brought about by all-seater stadia are likely to accelerate the
m ove towards such venues. The Technical Working Party accepts, however, that although the introduction o f
all-seater stadia for leading, well-supported football clubs m ay be both beneficial and practical, clubs in the
lower d ivisio n s m ay find it less so and the removal o f all standing accom m o d a tio n at these grounds may
affect their viability. Alterations to seating from standing arrangements at existing grounds m ay have both
design and cost im plications through the im pact on such matters as spectator sight-lines and crowd density.

  10. In addition, it must be recognised that there are many sports (horse, greyhound, m otor racing and car
rallying for exam ple) where the nature o f the sport favours the m obility o f large sections o f the crowd and
where view ing from standing areas is an essential elem ent. Any recom m en dation s towards all-seater stadia
must therefore be carefully worded.

C a p a cities
   11. T he Technical Working Party recognises that the safe allowable capacity o f any view ing area, whether
seated or standing, is the least o f (i) its holding capacity, (ii) the num ber o f persons w ho can leave through a
normal exit system w ithin a prescribed tim e at the en d o f an event, (iii) the num ber o f persons w ho can leave
through an em ergency exit system w ithin a prescribed tim e, and (iv) the num ber o f persons w ho can be
adm itted through the turnstiles serving that area within one hour.

   12. The theoretical holding capacity o f a seated viewing area is sim ply the num ber o f seats in good
con d ition which com ply with the relevant Green G u id e recom m en dation s including th ose relating to
distance from exits and gangways and size and spacing. D eterm ination o f the holding capacity o f a view ing
terrace or slope is not so simple; factors that must be taken into account include the strength and spacing o f
the crush-barriers, the position o f gangways, the d im e n sio n s and physical state o f the steps, the effective
standing area, and the acceptable packing density.

   13. A packing density o f 5.4 /m 2 is recom m en ded in the current Green G uide as the m ax im u m allowable
figure for terraces and viewing slopes that m eet all the specified guidelines. A reduced figure o f 2 .7 /m 2 is



                                                         90
presently reco m m en d ed for areas deviating materially from the guidelines. The Technical Working Party sees
no p oint in retaining reference to the lower figure and reco m m en d s that there should be no lower limit to the
reduction; ie if the enclosure had such poor safety standards that it was totally unfit as a view ing area the
figure should be zero.

  14. As to the m a x im u m figures, the Technical Working Party concludes that a uniform ly distributed
density o f 5 .4 /m 2 should be safe in static con d itions where the terraces are in full com p lian ce with the Green
G uide. It recognises, however, that there will be variations o f density w ithin a given enclosure, and allowance
should be m ade to acco m m o d a te this factor in the final determ ination.

   15. T he Technical Working Party recom m ends that the m a x im u m allowable average packing density
d eterm ined by the Inquiry should establish a general reference for certifying authorities. For an individual
ground, the packing density applicable to a given standing area should be derived from this figure, the full
figure for areas in goo d con d itio n and reduced figures for areas in poorer condition. D etailed calculations o f
holding capacities should then be determ ined on the basis o f the agreed packing density for that specific
enclosure or other relevant factors. T h ese calculations should take into account specific features o f the
crush-barriers and fences and o f step d im en sio n s as illustrated in the Green G uide. T he Technical Working
Party recom m ends a thorough review o f the exam ples currently con tained in Chapter 16 o f the Green Guide,
and the inclusion o f appropriate diagrams.

S tr u c tu r a l E l e m e n t s
   16. It is a fundam ental requirement o f safety that structures at grounds should provide spectators with
safe acco m m o d a tio n and safe m eans o f ingress and egress. They should also enable p olice and stewards to
exert proper control over crowd m ovem ents. I f a conflict should occur between these objectives, a substantial
re-arrangement m ay be required; in no circum stances should safety standards be com prom ised. The
Technical Working Party recom m en ds that references to sub-divisions in Chapter 14 o f the Green G u id e be
reviewed with these considerations in m ind, and that the Chapter as a w hole should reflect these principles
m ore positively.

S e p a r a tio n o f V ie w in g A r e a s a n d P itc h
   17. T he Technical Working Party recognises the im portance o f physical barriers as deterrents to pitch
invasions. It also recognises that not all view ing areas present the sam e risk, and recom m en ds that
consideration be given to differentiating those areas requiring higher levels o f security from other areas, such
as seated a cco m m o d a tio n and m em bers’ enclosures, where a lesser degree o f security might be acceptable.

   18. T he general principle o f separation endorsed by the Technical Working Party is that the m eans
adopted should provide sufficient security against pitch incursions to enable the p olice to take tim ely and
effective action should such incidents occur. Clearly a balance has to be struck between crowd control and
safety.

    19. A configuration reco m m en ded for w ider consideration consists o f a perimeter barrier on the
pitch-side backed by a parallel and con tinu ous crush-barrier on the terrace-side, set back from the perimeter
barrier so as to provide a clear walk-way between the two; except in em ergencies, spectators w ould not be
allowed to enter the walk-way. Such an arrangement w ould reduce the risks associated with a co m m o n feature
o f British grounds, nam ely that the front steps o f terraces are substantially lower than the level o f the pitch:
im m ediate attention should be given to the elim ination o f this hazard.

  20. T he Technical Working Party recom m ends that the m axim u m height o f perimeter fences should be
determ ined in relation to the UEFA standard o f 2.2m . It also recom m en ds the removal o f overhanging
sections and spiked or barbed-wire attachm ents at the tops o f fences.

   21. A form o f separation increasingly adopted in new stadia is the dry moat. To be effective, a dry m oat
m ust be sufficiently w id e and deep, and should be protected by fences on both sides to ensure that spectators
and players do not fall into it. W here enough space is available, a m oat may offer an attractive solution, but
its application to older grounds is likely to be restricted by lim itations o f space.

E m e r g e n c y A c c e s s to P i t c h
   22. T he Technical Working Party recom m ends that emergency access to the pitch should be provided
 from all adjacent view ing areas. It considers the provision o f gates or gaps in any formal barrier to be in all
 cases advantageous for the evacuation o f adjacent enclosures and essential except where adequate, safe


                                                            91
alternative arrangements exist. W here fences, barriers or m oats are installed the majority view o f the
Technical Working Party is that there should be clear gangways leading to em ergency exits on to the pitch.
Such gangways m ust be properly identified and kept clear at all tim es. The exit gates or gaps should be at least
1.1 metres w ide or as w ide as the gangways feeding into them , w hichever is the larger and should be sufficient
in d im en sio n s and spacing to allow evacuation o f the enclosure within a prescribed tim e. T he Working Party
recorded a m inority view that the need to p olice gangways exacerbated friction on terraces, and that
gangways were not always essential for proper crowd control and safety.

C r u s h B a r r ie r s
   23. A review o f the procedures for inspection and testing o f barriers is recom m en ded. T he Technical
Working Party considers that greater em phasis should be given to thorough recorded and certified annual
visual inspections o f all crush barriers. Particular attention should be given to the developm en t o f corrosion.

  24. It is further recom m en ded that 25% o f barriers, evenly spaced through each enclosure as designated by
a com petent engineer, con tinu e to be tested each year. In addition, all barriers w hich the inspection has
identified as o f possibly sub-standard condition should also be tested.

   25. The adopted test m ethod should be capable o f applying to barrier rail, post and foundation anchorage,
a loading equivalent to a uniformly distributed load 1.20 x the design load o f the barrier as at present.

   26. T he test procedure should be revised in line with current practice for structural testing to incorporate
(i) a detailed visual inspection o f the barrier, (ii) a bedding-in cycle taken to a percentage o f the design loading
and (iii) a single cycle o f p ro o f testing taken as at present to 1.20 x the design loading. D eflections at all
significant points should be recorded.

  27. After the full p ro o f load has been held for a m in im u m o f five m inutes the deflections should be
recorded prior to release o f loading and the perm anent residual unloaded deflections recorded after the load
has been released.

  28. T he Technical Working Party recom m en ds the adoption o f two criteria for acceptable structural
performance (i) that no significant defects, including corrosion, are revealed by inspection and (ii) that the
percentage recovery o f deflections after release o f the load during proof-testing achieves acceptable values.
The specific values required will d epend on the materials o f construction.

  29. T he Technical Working Party recom m en ds that the distinction currently drawn in the Green G uide
between “peak” and “non-peak“ viewing areas for the purpose o f assessing barrier spacing should be
abolished. All areas should co m p ly with the peak view ing specifications.

Stands
  30. A substantial part o f Chapter 10 o f the Green G uide, ‘R oofed Stands with Seated A cc o m m o d a tio n ’,
deals with temporary structures. It is recom m en ded that this material should be placed in a separate Chapter,
and that it should give explicit references as required to British Standards and to applicable regulations.

   31. The remainder, which might be called ‘Covered Standing and Seated A cc o m m o d a tio n ’, should clarify
the special requirements for safety that are involved, noting that fire risk is not the only hazard and that
statutory control o f the requirements m ay be vested in different authorities. Appropriate references to
Building Regulations should be m ade. It is im portant to ensure that all spectators can be cleared into safe
protected escape routes w ithin prescribed tim es, although such routes need not be exits from the stand as a
whole.

I n g r e ss /E g r e ss
   32. The current Chapters on Ingress and Egress in the Green G uide (Chapters 5 and 6) contain m uch
useful inform ation, but are nonetheless in need o f so m e revision. Consideration was given by the Technical
Working Party to the possible am algam ation o f features co m m o n to both ingress and egress, but despite the
co m m on ground it is recognised that em p hases might well differ. The Working Party does not therefore
recom m end am algam ation o f the individual Chapters.

In gress
  33. The Technical Working Party felt that Chapter 5 needed expansion to incorporate additional clauses
on (a) the p ositive counting and recording o f those passing through each turnstile; (b) the location o f


                                                         92
a m en ities inside the ground to avoid obstructing or disrupting the flow between turnstile and enclosures; (c)
the su b-division o f enclosures; (d) the adequacy o f well distributed entrances into large enclosures to
facilitate even packing; and (e) the design o f entrances so as to avoid local pressure on spectators caused, for
exam ple, by downward ramps. Inform ative diagrams should be adopted and general principles laid down,
wherever possible. T he Technical Working Party would not favour the introduction o f num erical exam ples
w hich m ight, in any event, be difficult to establish. It views the current m ax im u m notional flow rate per
turnstile o f 750 persons per hour (as set out in paragraph 47 Green G u id e) as too high, and recom m en d s a
figure o f 500 as the m edian for a norm al turnstile. Furthermore, it recom m en ds that variations up or down
be approved by the certifying authority, subject to a m a xim u m upper lim it o f 660 persons per hour.

Egress
  34. Greater cross-referencing with other Chapters is required, and the Technical Working Party favours
expansion or am en dm en t o f a n um ber o f paragraphs. In particular, the density figure set out in paragraph 54
in respect o f reservoir areas is felt to be too high, and the m em bers o f the Technical Working Party
recom m end that, where reservoir areas cannot be removed from egress routes, a lower density o f 35-40
persons per 10 sq metres be substituted. T he Technical Working Party favours greater em p hasis on
networking, and believes that the Green G uide should include a stipulation that each ground produce proper,
networked plans, delineating all aspects o f ingress/egress.

Enclosures/Turnstiles
   35. T h e Technical Working Party strongly recom m en ds that there should be a direct one-to-one
relationship between banks o f turnstiles and enclosures in order to m aintain accurate counts o f entries. A
review o f the current state o f League grounds had shown that su b-division s such as had occurred at
Hillsborough were uncom m on, and had generally been initiated by p olice for crowd control. W here such
su b-division s do exist, it is im perative that the total num ber o f spectators entering each sub-division should
be counted separately.

Stairways and Ramps
  36. T he Technical Working Party notes the dangers presented by stairways and ramps, particularly those
used by the public in large num bers, and recom m en ds extensive redrafting o f the Green G u id e to present
m ore sharply the hazards involved. It recognises that the standards o f safety required for stairways and ramps
which form part o f the access between enclosures and an exit and those which exist as gangways w ithin
enclosures differ and recom m en ds that the differences be explained in more detail. Particular attention
should be given by certifying authorities to acceptable upper lim its on the gradients o f ramps and stairways.
The m a x im u m gradient for ram ps set out in the current Green G u id e was felt acceptable.

  37. Similarly, the Working Party believes that the channelling o f flows by the provision o f handrails should
be given greater em phasis. T he recom m en ded width o f channel for both stairways and ramps should not
exceed three persons (unit w idths) in line abreast, and the width o f up to 1.8 metres permitted by paragraph
76 should therefore be reduced accordingly. Handrails should extend, by at least 3 0 0 m m beyond the top and
bottom o f any stairway or ramp.

  38. T he difference between handrails, balustrades and barriers on or near the top and bottom o f stairways
and ramps, and their appropriate strength requirements, needs to be clarified.

  39. T he Technical Working Party recom m en ds the inclusion in the Green G uide o f a greater num ber o f
diagrams illustrating the potentially hazardous situations in relation to stairways and ramps and o f the
principles behind the provisions.

Inspections and Tests
   40. Inspection and tests o f all equipm ent and structures at grounds are vital features o f good operation.
T heir range is wide, extending from visual inspection before and after each event to regular testing o f
structural com ponents. It is a m atter o f serious concern that the interpretation o f requirements by those
responsible is unacceptably variable. T he Technical Working Party considers that action should be taken to
ensure that co m m o n high standards o f inspection and test are realised, and m akes the following
recom m endations.

  (i)    T he Green Guide should include a com prehensive tabulation o f inspections and tests covering the
         essential technical features o f grounds. It should prescribe the m in im u m frequencies at w hich the
         inspections and tests should be conducted.


                                                        93
  (ii) T he required levels o f co m p eten ce o f those carrying out the inspections and tests should be defined.

  (iii) Records o f the results o f in spection s and tests, including the identification o f defects and the rem edies
        adopted, should be certified by those carrying out the work.

  (iv) A national Inspectorate should be established to oversee the ad option o f co m m o n standards o f
       inspection and test. Its terms o f reference should include the com pilation and m a inten an ce o f a
       national register o f organisations em ployed to carry out inspections and tests; central recording o f the
       extent and type o f the inspections and tests adopted at individual grounds; and the provision o f advice
       on inspection and test for those responsible for carrying out the work and for certifying authorities. It
       would be in the interest o f co m m o n standards if an Inspectorate o f this kind dealt with the grounds o f
       all relevant sports, and consideration should be given to its form ation through an a ssociation o f their
       governing bodies.

Fire Safety
  41. There is general recognition am ongst Technical Working Party m em bers that the current Chapter on
Fire Safety (Chapter 11) is well-defined. It contains m uch useful ad v ice on egress and m ea n s o f escape,
application o f which is not restricted to fire risks and which would bear repetition in other Chapters.

   42. The Technical Working Party considers that it is essential to m aintain sim ple, clear lines o f authority
and com m unication; in depend en t input from individual b odies is to be avoided. With that in m ind, its
m em bers believe that consultation on all safety matters should be directly with the certifying authority who,
in turn, would consult with the fire, police, and other authorities.

Emergency/Auxiliary Power
  43. T he Technical Working Party considers that the current Green G uide con ta in s insufficient
information on auxiliary power. It recom m en ds a separate chapter on the topic with a requirem ent that
emergency power should be sufficient to m aintain an adequate level o f lighting, and public address system
and to operate any electronic gates, alarms etc for a period o f three hours from the tim e o f failure o f the
normal supply.

Communications
  44. T he Technical Working Party considers that too little weight has in the past been attached to the need
for a com prehensive co m m u n ication s system, capable o f reaching both inside and outside the ground.

   45. Chapter 12 o f the Green G uide therefore requires substantial a m en d m en t to reflect the im portance o f
effective com m un ica tio n s systems, the need to make use o f high-technology equipm ent, and the value o f
closer co-operation between club and police personnel. T he Technical Working Party considers that Interim
R eco m m en dation s 31-34 should be retained perm anently and incorporated into the Green Guide.

Disabled Spectators
  46. The current Green G uide fails to address the specific problem s encountered by disabled spectators
and the Technical Working Party recom m en d s the introduction o f a Chapter to cover these aspects. It should
deal in particular with Ingress and Egress and with the provision o f self-contained viewing areas.

The Green Guide
  1. A higher degree o f standardisation in stadia design and construction is required. An updated and
revised Green Guide should form the basis on which a designated ground or stand is certified. It should
incorporate appropriate diagrams and refer to relevant Building Regulations.

Advisory Body
  2. There should be a single, central b ody (called perhaps the A dvisory Council for Sports G rounds) to
provide an authoritative source o f knowledge for all those involved in the design and construction o f stadia.


                                                          94
S e a tin g /S ta n d in g
  3. W hilst standing a cco m m o d a tio n is n ot intrinsically unsafe, all-seater stadia bring benefits to spectator
com fort, safety and crowd control. The im plem en ta tio n o f higher proportions o f seated a ccom m od ation
should be governed by c o m m o n high standards o f design and construction.

C a p a cities
   4. C apacity dep en ds on standards o f ingress, egress and safety generally as well as the acceptable packing
density and the effective area o f the a ccom m o d a tio n . T h e current m a x im u m packing density o f 5 .4 /m 2
recom m en ded in the Green G u id e for standing terraces should be safe in static con d itio n s where the terraces
are in full com p lia n ce with the Green G uide. It should be recognised, however, that densities normally vary
over an enclosure, and an allowable average figure should reflect this consideration. T h e reduced figure o f
2 .7 /m 2 should be abolished and there should be n o specified lower limit. I f an enclosure has such poor safety
standards that it is totally unfit as a view ing area, the figure should be zero.

S e p a r a tio n o f V ie w in g A r e a s an d P itc h
  5. C onsideration should be given to different perimeter arrangements appropriate for different areas o f a
ground.

   6. T he m ean s o f separation adopted should provide sufficient protection against pitch incursions without
com p rom isin g spectator safety. T he m a x im u m height o f fences should be determ ined in relation to the UEFA
standard o f 2.2 metres. Overhanging sections and spiked or barbed-wire attachm ents should be removed.

  7. A ttention should be given to the elim ination o f spectator view ing from front steps o f terraces w hich are
substantially lower than the level o f the pitch.

E m e r g e n c y A c c e s s to t h e P i t c h
    8. Emergency access to the pitch should be provided from all adjacent v iew ing areas.

   9. Exit gaps or gates should be at least 1.1 m etres w id e or as w ide as the gangways feeding into them,
w hichever is the larger. All gangways m ust be clearly identified and must be kept clear o f spectators in normal
circumstances.

C r u s h B a r r ie r s
  10. A review o f the procedures for inspection and testing o f barriers is recom m en ded. Greater em phasis
should be given to thorough recorded and certified annual visual inspections o f all crush barriers, and to the
establishm ent o f an unam biguous testing procedure.

Stan d s
   11. T he Green G u id e should con tain a separate C hapter on tem porary structures, w ith appropriate
references to applicable regulations and British Standards.

In gress
   12. T he current m a x im u m notional flow rate per turnstile o f 750 persons per hour is too high. A figure o f
500 should be adopted as the m edian with a m a x im u m upper lim it o f 660 persons per hour. Variations from
the m ed ian m ust be approved by the certifying authority.

 E gress
   13. W here reservoir areas cannot be rem oved, a lower density o f 35-40 persons per 10 sq metres should be
 adopted. Each ground should produce networked plans delineating all aspects o f ingress and egress.

 E n c l o s u r e s / T u r n s t il e s
    14. There should be a direct one-to-one relationship between banks o f turnstiles and corresponding
 enclosures. Where sub-divisions exist, it is im perative that the totals entering each sub-division are counted
 separately.

 S ta ir w a y s and R a m p s
    15. T he recom m en ded width o f channels should not exceed three persons (unit widths) in line abreast.
 Handrails should extend by at least 3 0 0 m m beyond the top and bottom o f any stairway or ramp. T he design
 and strength o f handrails, barriers and protection on or near stairways or ram ps should be clearly defined.
 R am ps should not produce dangerous crowd pressures.


                                                           95
Inspection and Tests
   16. A ction should be taken to ensure that c o m m o n high standards o f inspection and test are realised. A
national Inspectorate should be established to oversee the adoption o f such standards. Its terms o f reference
should include com p ilation and m ainten an ce o f a national register o f organisations em ployed to carry out
inspections and tests; central recording o f the extent and type o f inspections and tests at individual grounds;
and the provision o f advice.

C om m unications
  17. T he Green G uide should be am en d ed substantially to em phasise the im portance o f effective
com m un ication s system s capable o f reaching both inside and o u tside the ground.

D isab led Spectators
   18. T he Green G uide should contain a separate Chapter to cover this subject.

  2.1 W hen m y Interim Report was published, it m ight have been thought by so m e that the suggestions
w hich I set ou t had only recently been considered. It w as said to be unfair to expect the football clubs to have
taken earlier steps to arrange their affairs. It w as urged that they sh ould now be entitled to m ore tim e and
m ore m oney in order to deal w ith the problem s o f crowd control and safety at their grounds. T h e problem o f
crowd control and safety had, so it was said, suddenly arisen. I have to say that alm ost all the matters into
w hich I have been asked to inquire and alm ost all the solu tions I have proposed have been previously
considered in detail by many distinguished Inquiries over a period o f sixty years.

T h e S h o rtt Report
   2.2 O n 11 June 1923, the then Secretary o f State for the H o m e D ep artm ent asked the Rt H o n Edward
Shortt KC to form a C om m ittee to inquire, am ongst other things, in to arrangements m ade to deal w ith the
abnormally large attendances o n special occasions, especially attendances at athletic grounds. T his arose
from disorder w hich occurred at W em bley Stadium on the occasion o f the first Cup Final on 28 April 1923.
T h e C o m m ittee reported on 13 March 1924. T he Report was presented to Parliament and published as
C o m m and Paper 2 0 8 8 at the princely sum o f 6d.

T h e M o elw y n H u g h es Report
  2.7 The next report (published as C m n d 6 846) arose out o f the disaster at B olton Wanderers’ Football
G round on 9 March 1946. Mr R M oelw yn H ughes KC was ap pointed by the then H o m e Secretary to conduct
an enquiry into the circumstances o f the disaster w hich arose by the presence o f som e 8 5 ,0 0 0 spectators.
50.000 had been expected. Because o f the press o f people in an enclosure two barriers collapsed and 33
people were killed.

   2.8 It is interesting to observe that the previous best attendance at Bolton in the 1945-46 season had been
4 3 .0 0 0 and it was amply policed by a force o f 60. On this occasion there were 103 p olice to control 8 5 ,0 00
spectators, w hich is about 1/10th o f the present ratio o f police to spectators at football grounds both inside
and outside the ground.

  2.9 Mr Hughes m ade a number o f recom m endations. H e said:

  “B u r n d e n P a r k i s ty p ic a l o f m o s t h o m e g r o u n d s o f t h e l e a d in g fo o tb a ll t e a m s in t h e co u n tr y . T h e y h a v e g r o w n

  2.10 T he recom m endations included inspections o f the enclosures, scientific calculation o f the m ax im u m
num ber to be allowed entry, counting those entering the ground by m echanical m eans and central
co-ordination o f the system, all to ensure the adm ission o f a safe num ber o f spectators.

T h e W h ea tley Report
  2 .2 7 On 4 February 1971 the Rt H on Lord W heatley was asked by the then Secretary o f State for the
H o m e Departm ent and the then Secretary o f State for Scotland to m ake an in depend en t appraisal o f the
effectiveness o f existing arrangements for crowd safety at sports grounds in Great Britain, and o f the
im provem ents which could be brought about w ithin the present framework o f the law, and to consider the
nature o f any alterations in the law which appeared to be needed. This arose from the disaster at Ibrox Park
where 66 spectators died.


                                                                                         100
  2 .28 On 16 March 1972 Lord W heatley com p leted his Report and it was presented to Parliament and
published by H M SO as Cm n d. 49 52.

  2.29 T he Report co n tained a technical A ppendix. Following the Report, the Safety o f Sports Grounds Act
1975 was passed. A licensing system in volvin g the issue o f a safety certificate for designated grounds was
introduced and supporting guidance (the Green Guide) was published. In his Report Lord W heatley said:

T h e M c E lh o n e Report
 2.32 In October 1976 the then Secretary o f State for Scotland asked Mr Frank M cE lhone M P to chair a
Working Group on Football Crowd Behaviour.

  “ to c o n s i d e r t h e p r o b l e m s c a u s e d b y s o m e S c o t t i s h f o o t b a ll s u p p o r t e r s a n d to m a k e r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s to

  A m on g the m em bership o f the Working Group were representatives from the football authorities, from the
football clubs and the Strathclyde Police.

   2.33 In the introduction to the Report2, Mr M cE lhone said:

   “ T h e r e is n o s i m p l e s o l u t i o n to t h e p r o b le m ; it is b u t o n e o f t h e m a n i f e s t a t i o n s o f a n t i - s o c i a l b e h a v io u r

   2.34 T h e Report observed that:

   M r M cElhone saw the problem as one o f trying to reduce, or at least contain, the incidence o f hooliganism
at football m atches w ithout restricting the pleasure o f the majority o f supporters.

                                                                                            101
   2.35 So far as drink was concerned, the Report recom m en ded that it should be an offence for a spectator
to carry or attem pt to carry alcohol into a football ground; that is should be an offence to be in possession o f
alcohol w ithin the ground or to attempt to gain a d m ission w hile drunk. T he Report recom m en ded that m ore
people who were physically capable o f carrying out the duties o f enforcem ent w ould have to be recruited and
suggested that, in their recruitment o f stewards, clubs should look to their supporters’ clubs to assist in
providing the kind o f m en required for the job. So far as transport was concerned, the Report recom m en ded
that it should be an offence for anyone to be in p ossession o f alcoholic liquor on a vehicle hired specifically
for the purpose o f carrying passengers boun d for a football match; or to allow any alcoholic liquor to be
carried on a public service vehicle being used for the purpose o f carrying passengers to football matches; or to
allow the carriage o f any drunken person on such a vehicle bound for a football match.

  2 .36 So far as the separation o f supporters was concerned the Report recom m ended:

  “ T h a t in t h e i n t e r e s t s o f c row d c o n tr o l a n d s a fe ty , s e p a r a t i o n o f rival s u p p o r t e r s at t u r n s t il e s s h o u l d be

  “ I n o r d e r to p r o te c t p la y e r s , m a t c h o f f i c i a l s a n d t h e p i t c h , a c c e s s to t h e p l a y i n g a r e a s h o u l d b e m a d e a s

  2.37 A further recom m endation was that:

  “ t h e C o u r t s s h o u l d m a k e fu ll u s e o f t h e h i g h e r f i n i n g p o w e r s u n d e r t h e C r i m in a l L aw A c t 1 9 7 7 i n r e s p e c t o f

  n o r m a lly i m p o s e i m p r is o n m e n t w ith o u t o p t i o n . ” (R ecom m en dation 19).

  2.38 T h e Report recom m en ded that:

  “T h e p o l i c e s h o u ld h a v e sta t u to r y p o w e r s to s e a r c h for a n y c o n t a i n e r s ... in t h e p o s s e s s i o n o f a n y p e r s o n
  e n t e r in g or a t t e m p t in g to e n te r fo o tb a ll g r o u n d s . ” (R ecom m en d a tio n 24).

but went on to point out that the clubs m ust bear their share o f the responsibility for the behaviour and
conduct o f their staff at all levels:

  2.39 A m on g other observations the Report says this:

  “ W e r e c o g n i s e t h a t m a n y fo o tb a ll g r o u n d s in S c o t l a n d a r e very old ; s o m e c o u ld e v e n b e d e s c r ib e d a s p r im itiv e

The Report therefore recom m ended:

  “ t h a t c lu b s s h o u ld c o n s i d e r t h e p r o v is io n o f a d d itio n a l s e a t i n g a c c o m m o d a t i o n . In a d d itio n c lu b s m u s t

  (Paragraph 88).

  2 .4 0 T his Report also recom m en ded that:

  “ p la y e r s s h o u l d b e e n c o u r a g e d by t h e c l u b s to e x t e n d t h e ir v o lu n ta r y p u b lic r e l a t i o n s w o r k in t h e c o m m u n i t y

C CTV was recom m en ded and supporters’ clubs encouraged. T he Scottish Football A ssociation was
recom m en ded to take appropriately firm action against clubs.


                                                                                         102
D e p a r tm e n t o f th e E n v iro n m en t W o r k in g G roup
  2.41 T h e m o st recent G overn m ent publication on the subject o f football is the Report o f an Official
Working G roup on Football Spectator V iolence set up by D ep a rtm ent o f the Environm ent, w hich was
published by H M S O in 1984. T h e Working G roup was set up following incidents o f v io len ce involving
British supporters at England’s soccer m atches in Luxem bourg and France in N o vem b er 1983 and February
1984 respectively. It dealt party with problem s arising out o f international football.

   2.42 However, as regards do m estic football the Report said:

   “ t h e G r o u p r e a ff ir m e d t h e im p o r t a n c e o f c o n s i s t e n t p l a n n i n g , p r e p a r a tio n a n d c o -o r d in a tio n ; o f b u i ld in g o n

   i m p r a c t i c a l or u n n e c e s s a r y .” (Paragraph 5.1).


   “ W e r e c o m m e n d th e r e fo r e t h a t t h e F A r e v ie w s a n d b e tt e r d e f i n e s i t s p o w e r s a n d p r o c e d u r e s a n d t h e

   e n h a n cin g th e m .”


T h e Report w ent on:

   “ T h i s w o u ld b e tte r e q u ip t h e FA to i m p l e m e n t s o m e o f t h e r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s . ” (Paragraph 5.5).


  2.43 T h e Football A ssociation had issued a “blueprint” detailing the precautions w hich league clubs
should take against violen ce, w hich was circulated to clubs at the beginning o f the 1983-84 season. The
Working Party Report said that it:

   “ ... h a s n o t b e e n r ig o r o u s ly a d o p te d b y a ll c lu b s . S i n c e it r e p r e s e n t s t h e c o ll e c t i v e w i s d o m o f f o o t b a ll c lu b s ,
   m a n y o f w h o m h a v e s u c c e s s f u l l y c o u n te r e d s e r io u s t h r e a t s o f v i o le n c e , i t s i m p l e m e n t a t i o n s h o u l d h a v e
   p r e v e n te d s o m e o f t h e v i o le n c e in g r o u n d s l a s t s e a s o n . ” (Paragraph 5.7).


  2.44 T h e Report observed that the enforcem ent by the Football A ssociation o f its “blueprint” occurs after
the event w hen the d eficiencies in a club’s planning has b eco m e apparent. T h e Report recom m en ded that:

   “ im p r o v e d m e a n s s h o u l d be fo u n d fo r e n s u r i n g t h a t c lu b s a d o p t t h e p r o v is io n s o f t h e “ b lu e p r in t ” in a w a y
   a p p r o p r ia t e to t h e i r o w n g r o u n d s a n d m a t c h e s . ” (Paragraph 5.7).


T he Report went on to recom m end that each club should produce a detailed set o f plans to be subm itted to
the football authorities for endorsem ent. This would prevent so m e clubs from avoiding their responsibilities
and might ensure also a m ore co-operative and com m itted response.

   2.45 T h e Report recom m ended that m atches between high risk clubs should be programmed so that the
risk or threat o f violen ce could be reduced. T h e Report said:

   “ It i s m o r e l i k e l y to t a k e p la c e at t h e b e g i n n in g a n d e n d o f t h e s e a s o n a n d a t h o l i d a y p e r io d s , p a r tic u la r ly at

   (Paragraph 5.13).

   2.46 T h e Report went on to recom m end the introduction o f club m em bership, the introduction o f C CTV
 and closer links with the com m unity. It did not recom m end that alcohol should be banned in grounds and
 concluded that in the absence o f clear evidence that the introduction o f legislation along the lines o f the
 Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980 w ould reduce v iolen ce at English soccer matches, it could not
 recom m en d such action. Furthermore, said the Report:

    “ l e g i s l a t i o n o f t h i s k in d w o u ld b e u n w e lc o m e t o m an y ; t h e m a jo r ity o f f o o t b a ll c lu b s a r e u n tr o u b le d by

 T h e Working Group did not recom m end additional measures for banning alcohol on trains or on football
 coaches.


                                                                                          103
         Conclusion
           2.47      A study o f all these reports (and there are num erous reports and d iscu ssion papers by other bodies)
         shows that the following are m easures w hich have been frequently recom m ended:

           2.   M em bership Cards
           3.   Segregation

  1. On 17 April 1989 I was appointed by your predecessor, the Rt H on Douglas Hurd CBE, M P to carry out
an Inquiry with the following terms o f reference:

  “To inquire into the events at Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground on 15 April 1989 and to make
  recom m endations about the needs o f crowd control and safety at sports events.”

  2. Two Assessors were appointed to assist me: Mr Brian Johnson CBE, Q P M , DL, C h ief Constable o f
Lancashire, and Professor Leonard Maunder OBE, BSc, P hD , ScD, FEng, FI Mech E, Professor o f Mechanical
Engineering at the U niversity o f N ew castle upon Tyne.

  3. The first stage o f the Inquiry was primarily concerned with the investigation o f events at Hillsborough
Stadium on 15 April 1989 when 95 people were crushed to death at a Cup semi-final match between Liverpool
and N ottingham Forest.

   4. Over 31 days between 15 May and 29 June, I heard oral evidence from 174 w itnesses at a public hearing
in Sheffield. I also received much written evidence by way o f subm issions and letters.

  5. On 1 August 1989 I presented an Interim Report setting out my findings as to how and why the disaster
occurred. Also, in accordance with your predecessor’s wishes, I m ade interim recom m endations aim ed at
preventing any further disaster and im proving safety in the short term.

   6. The Interim Report and its recom m endations had o f necessity to be made quickly so that action could be
taken before the start o f the new football season due to open in m id August. D espite all the speed I could
muster, the recom m endations left very little tim e for pre-season action, especially in Scotland where the
fixture list started earlier than in England and Wales. I must pay tribute to the clubs, local authorities, police
and other services for responding so promptly and for im plem enting the recom m endations so wholeheartedly.

   7. In my Interim Report I indicated that it would be necessary to conduct wider and deeper investigations
before delivering a Final Report on the needs o f crowd control and safety for the future. Accordingly, I invited
and have considered a large number o f written subm issions describing present practices and problems and
suggesting future changes. Those who have contributed are listed at Appendix 1 . 1 am extrem ely grateful to all
o f them for their tim e and their views. I expect there are a number o f contributors and correspondents who
may look in vain for com m en t on each and every point they have raised. I hope they will understand that time
and space make it necessary to be selective and to have regard to the main issues.

   8. I have also had numerous informal m eetings with those representing relevant public bodies, clubs and
spectator interests. These have been conducted as private discussion sessions rather than hearings o f oral
ev idence thereby enabling controversial issues to be explored and theories tested.

  9. In all o f this I have continued to be assisted by the two Assessors. Each holds a professional appointm ent
carrying heavy responsibility and I am deeply grateful to both for devoting so much tim e to assisting me. Their
contributions have been o f the highest value. W hile the sole responsibility for this report is mine, I am
comforted in the knowledge that both Assessors agree with it.

   10. At my request. Professor Maunder chaired a Technical Working Party to review the technical aspects o f
the H o m e Office G u id e to Safety at Sports Grounds (1986 edition), “The Green G u id e”. Each m em ber o f his
team has m uch relevant experience and the team was well qualified for its task. I am m ost grateful for the
co-operation and efforts o f each member. The Report o f the Technical Working Party is at A ppendix 3.

   11. In the course o f the Inquiry, the two Assessors and I have between us visited 31 sports grounds. They are
listed at A ppendix 2. O f those, 2 4 were soccer grounds, but we also attended at grounds featuring Rugby
U nion, Rugby League, cricket, tennis and golf. I wish to record our thanks to the club officials w ho so readily


                                                          1

    and hospitably facilitated our visits; also to the officers o f local government, the police and the emergency
    services who together with club officials conducted us round the grounds, explained their operations and
    answered our questions fully and frankly. Seeing crowd control and behaviour before, during and after a match
    from various sections o f the viewing areas was an essential source o f first hand knowledge. It brought alive the
    written and oral reports we received.

       12. I should like to express my thanks to the H o m e Office team who have staffed this Inquiry so well. Mr
    Robert Whalley was appointed as its Secretary. H e has handled all the administrative arrangements
    im peccably and has given much invaluable advice and assistance on every aspect o f the Inquiry. H e was ably
    and diligently assisted by Mr Jonathan Sweet, Mrs Margaret Wither, Mr Tony Moore, Mrs Kate Hum phries
    from the H o m e Office and my own Clerk Mr Ernest Pott. I also renew my thanks to the West M idlands Police,
    and, in particular, to Mr Geoffrey Dear Q PM , DL, LLB, the C h ief Constable, and Mr M ervyn Jones MSc,
    Assistant C h ief Constable in full-time charge o f the investigation, w ho have continued to provide me with
    helpful information at this second stage o f the Inquiry.

       13. Having m ade my findings as to the events at Hillsborough, I do not in this report say any more about
    them save by way o f illustration. I am aware that inquests are still to be held, civil proceedings are in m otion
    and the possibility o f criminal charges is under consideration. However, those are not matters for me. I
    therefore turn now to broader issues as promised in paragraph 304 o f my Interim Report.

       14. My terms o f reference are extremely wide. They embrace crowd control and safety at sports events o f all
    kinds. However, crowd problems are directly related to the nature o f the event and the numbers attending it.
    Realistically, this m eans that attention needs to be concentrated on events within the scope o f the Safety o f
    Sports Ground Act 1975 and the Fire Safety and Safety o f Places o f Sport Act 1987. Even more specifically, the
    em phasis in this Report is especially upon football. The Hillsborough disaster and indeed other disasters
    before it occurred in crowded football stadia. The numbers and the atmosphere at a football m atch have
    created special problems such as overcrowding and m isbehaviour not, so far, to be found to a like degree
    elsewhere.

       15. That football is a special case has been expressly recognised by the G overnm ent in prom oting the
    Football Spectators Act 1989. The Bill received the Royal A ssent on 16 N ovem ber 1989. It had co m m en ce d its
    course through Parliament before the Hillsborough disaster. Expressly because o f that disaster and the setting
    up o f this Inquiry it reached the statute book under unusual conditions. It was always to be an enabling Act
    w hose im plem entation would require a Statutory Instrument. In order to have the provisions o f the Act in
    place as soon as possible, the G overnm ent decided to proceed with it forthwith, notwithstanding Hillsborough
    and this Inquiry. That decision was subject to an undertaking to bring the matter back before Parliament on
    two separate occasions. First, before the appointm ent o f the Football Membership Authority under the Act;
    secondly, to debate the schem e which the Act provides should be drawn up by that Authority.

       16. I was expressly told by your predecessor upon my appointm ent that my terms o f reference included
    consideration o f the national membership scheme provided for in the Bill. That was confirm ed on num erous
    occasions by Ministers in the course o f the Bill’s passage through Parliament. It was m ade clear that although
    the Act would be on the statute book before my Final Report, Parliament would have the opportunity to
    consider any observations I might make, including any about the national m em bership scheme. Thus, to take
    only two examples, Mr N ich olas Ridley, then Secretary o f State for the Environm ent, said on the Second
    Reading o f the Bill on 27 June 1989:

      “I began by referring to Lord Justice Taylor's inquiry. I will em phasise again now what I said at the
      beginning. Parliament will have not one but two opportunities to debate and vote on the national
      m em bership scheme after we have received the report and in the light o f any com m en ts that Justice Taylor
      may make on the scheme. By proceeding with the Bill now, we can put the framework for the schem e in place
      and make it possible to m ove on rapidly with the scheme, if Parliament agrees that we should do so when it
      has seen what Lord Justice Taylor has to say.”
      (Official Report, colum n 850).

    Secondly, at the C om m ittee stage on 6 July 1989, Mr Colin Moynihan, the Minister for Sport, said:

      “I am certain that Lord Justice Taylor will feel in no way inhibited by consideration o f the Bill in our
      suggested format, because we specifically am ended the Bill to provide for the Secretary o f State’s approval o f
      the schem e after the final report     the Bill is am ended to enable the H ouse to consider in detail the
      recom m endations before we establish the Football M em bership Authority to draw up the sc h em e           To
      hypothesise on whether Lord Justice Taylor is in favour o f a national m em bership schem e or whether he


                                                            2
  may not even com m ent on it, is totally irrelevant because the Bill provides for the H ouse o f C o m m o n s and
  House o f Lords to consider the report before setting up a Football Membership Authority.”
  (Official Report, colum n 56).

   17. It must be a rare if not unique situation for a judge, appointed to conduct an Inquiry, to have within his
remit consideration o f the merits and provisions o f an Act o f Parliament already i.. place. It cannot be for a
judge to opine upon the w isdom or terms o f an Act expressing the established will o f Parliament. But, where
Parliament has passed an Act in such terms and upon such undertakings as expressly to provide that the
Inquiry judge be uninhibited in com m enting upon it and that Parliament should have the opportunity to
consider his com m ents in further debate, then I conceive it to be his duty to express his views. My doing so
should not be interpreted as showing any lack o f the respect and deference due to Parliament. N o t to do so,
against the background I have described, would surely be thought surprising if not pusillanimous.

    18. In Part I o f this Report I state som e lessons to be learnt from Hillsborough, exam ine the state o f football
today and propose a range o f measures to give it a better future. In Part I I I consider, in detail, measures to
improve safety at sports grounds. Part III is concerned with crowd control at sports grounds and various
strategies for dealing with hooligans. In Part I V I consider the provisions o f the 1989 Act regarding the national
membership scheme. Finally, at the end o f the text, I set out my R ecom m endations. So as to avoid confusion, I
have not set out my Interim R ecom m en dation s for the purpose o f comparison. Hardly any excisions have been
made. Where I have decided to repeat or am end the Interim R ecom m endations, they are included in the single
list o f Final R ecom m endations. I hope this Report and the Final R ecom m en dation s m ay be instrumental in
promoting better and safer conditions at sports grounds in the future.




18 January 1990                                                                                    PETER TAYLOR

i. P r e v io u s R e p o r t s U n h e e d e d
   19. It is a depressing and chastening fact that m ine is the ninth official report covering crowd safety and
control at football grounds. After eight previous reports and three editions o f the Green G uide, it seems
astounding that 95 people could die from overcrowding before the very eyes o f those controlling the event. In
January 1986, Mr Justice Popplewell, w hose report following the Bradford Disaster was the eighth in the
series, summ arised those o f his seven predecessors. The Shorn Report o f 1924 followed disorder at the Cup
Final o f 1923. The M oelwyn Hughes Report o f 1946 followed the disaster at Bolton Wanderers ground when
overcrowding caused 33 deaths. In 1966 the Governm ent com m issio n ed the Chester Report on “The State o f
Association Football”. T he Harrington Report o f 1968 drew attention to problems o f crowd behaviour and led
to the Lang Report o f 1969 on the sam e subject. In 1972, Lord W heatley’s Report on Crowd Safety at Sports
Grounds followed the disaster at Ibrox Park where 66 spectators died. The M cElhone Report o f 1977 on
Football Crowd Behaviour o f Scottish supporters was com m ission ed by the Secretary o f State for Scotland. In
1984 an Official Working Group on Football Spectator Violence set up by the D epartm ent o f Environm ent
presented a further report.

  20. As a result o f the Wheatley Report, the first edition o f the Green G u id e was issued in 1973, and
Parliament passed the Safety o f Sports Grounds Act 1975. A second edition o f the Green G u id e was issued in
1976 and a third edition in 1986 incorporated recom m endations m ade by Mr Justice Popplewell.

   21. Introducing his excellent and concise summary o f the previous reports, Mr J ustice Popplewell said:

   “almost all the matters into which I have been asked to inquire and almost all the solutions I have proposed,
   have been previously considered in detail by many distinguished Inquiries over a period o f 60 years”.

  Because his citations from those earlier reports are still highly relevant, I append his summary o f them at
A ppendix 4.

   22. In my Interim Report I set out what happened at Hillsborough and why. That it was allowed to happen,
despite all the accumulated w isdom o f so many previous reports and guidelines m ust indicate that the lessons
o f past disasters and the recom m endations following them had not been taken sufficiently to heart. I
appreciate how easy it is to criticise with hindsight and that a new situation can always arise in hum an affairs
which has not previously been envisaged. But many o f the d eficiencies at Hillsborough had been envisaged.

  23. The M oelwyn Hughes Report in 1924 had stressed the need to start controlling the crowd well back
from the entrance to the ground. The Green G u id e required that “Turnstiles should be o f such numbers as to
admit spectators at a rate whereby no unduly large crowds are kept waiting for a d m issio n ” (paragraph 44).
Chapter 8 o f the G uide required “Arrangements should be m ade ... to contain pressures before they reach
dangerous proportions”. Chapter 16 laid down m axim u m capacity which was grossly exceeded in the fatal
pens at Hillsborough. Both the Green G uide (Chapter 15) and Mr Justice Popplewell had stated the need for
gates in the perimeter fencing to be adequate to permit escape on to the pitch in an emergency. Why were these
recom m endations and others not followed? I suggest two main reasons. First, insufficient concern and
vigilance for the safety and well-being o f spectators. This was com pounded by a preoccupation with measures
to control hooliganism. Secondly, com placency which led all parties to think that since disaster had not
occurred on previous occasions it would not happen this tim e. But there is no point in holding inquiries or
publishing guidance unless the recom m endations are followed diligently. That m ust be the first lesson.

ii. “ I t C o u ld n ’t H a p p e n H e r e ”
  24. Amazingly, com placency was still to be found even after Hillsborough. It was chilling to hear the same
refrain from directors at several clubs I v isited :-

        “Hillsborough was horrible - but, o f course, it couldn’t have happened here.”

   C ouldn’t it? The Hillsborough ground was regarded by many as on e o f the best in the country. It was selected


                                                                       4
by the FA for the Cup semi-final and thought by them to be entirely suitable. The identical fixture had passed
o ff uneventfully the previous year. I have little doubt that if the disaster scenario had been described to the
management at Hillsborough prior to 15 April, they too would have said “O f course, it couldn’t happen here”.
Yet som ething like it had happened at Hillsborough in 1981, albeit with less dire results. Moreover, I am
satisfied from eyewitness accounts I have received that there have been many other occasions when
overcrowding has led, at various grounds round the country, to a genuine apprehension o f im pending disaster
through crushing, averted only by good fortune. I have heard from Police Com m anders at a number o f the
grounds I have visited how relieved they are that capacities have been reduced in the interests o f safety.

  25. So, although the operational errors on 15 April were special to on e ground and one day, the lack o f
precautions against overcrowding was not unique. I do not believe that sufficient safety measures were being
applied at all other grounds. The lesson here is that Hillsborough should-not be regarded as a freak occurrence,
incapable o f happening elsewhere. All those responsible for certifying, using and supervising sports grounds
should take a hard look at their arrangements and keep doing so. C om placency is the enem y o f safety.

iii. A B l ig h t o n F o o tb a ll
  26. Football is our national game. We gave it to the world. But its image in our country has been much
tarnished. In my Interim Report I concentrated on overcrowding because it was the cause o f the Hillsborough
disaster. But wider and deeper inquiry shows that overcrowding is only o n e feature amongst a number causing
danger or marring football as a spectator sport. The picture revealed is o f a general m alaise or blight over the
game due to a number o f factors. Principally these are: old grounds, poor facilities, hooliganism , excessive
drinking and poor leadership. Crowd safety and crowd behaviour with which I am concerned are closely
related to the quality o f the accom m od ation and facilities offered and to the standards w hich are encouraged
and enforced. So I think it necessary to consider all these aspects.

O ld G r o u n d s
  27. Because we were first into the field, most o f our football grounds are now elderly. Between 1889 and
1910, 58 o f the clubs belonging to the current League moved into the grounds they now occupy.* Many o f
them are ill-placed on cramped sites boxed into residential areas. W hen they were built, they were not intended
to cater for the stream o f coaches, vans and cars which now arrive and require parking space. Inside the
grounds decay and dilapidation are often extensive. The terrace a ccom m od ation, in particular, is often
uncovered and little has been done to improve the layout in accordance with modern expectations. This is
chiefly because the safety and comfort o f those on the terraces has not been regarded as a priority. In fairness,
limitations o f space at som e grounds m ake it very difficult to achieve a layout appropriate to present day
needs. By contrast, clubs in Europe and South America have the advantage o f grounds built more recently on
more spacious sites and planned to meet modern conditions. Where im provem ents have been m ade to
our grounds they have often been patchy and piecemeal. This approach is itself a threat to safety. To build a
seated stand over a standing area, to enlarge or divide a terrace, to rearrange exits and entrances or to m odify
turnstile areas - any o f these measures is fraught with safety im plications. Yet often such changes have been
made to achieve one purpose without sufficient thought about the adverse side-effects w hich could result.

  28. This was exem plified by the sequence o f alterations at the Leppings Lane end at Hillsborough. Radial
fences were installed to divide up the terraces; this led to a reduction in the system o f crush barriers. The area
inside the turnstiles was altered for purposes o f segregation. Old signs were not removed; new signs were
inadequate. The result was a bewildering com plex which contributed to the delivery' o f excessive numbers
down the tunnel into pens 3 and 4.

P o o r F a c ilit ie s
   29. Football spectators are invited by the clubs for entertainment and enjoyment. Often, however, the
facilities provided for them have been lamentable. Apart from the discom fort o f standing on a terrace exposed
to the elements, the ordinary provisions to be expected at a place o f entertainment are som etim es not merely
basic but squalid. At so m e grounds the lavatories are primitive in design, poorly m aintained and inadequate in
number. This not only denies the spectator an essential facility he is entitled to expect. It directly lowers
standards o f conduct. The practice o f urinating against walls or even on the terraces has b eco m e endem ic and
is followed by m en who would not behave that way elsewhere. The police, who would charge a man for
urinating in the street, either tolerate it in football grounds or do no more than give a verbal rebuke. Thus
crowd conduct becom es degraded and other m isbehaviour seem s less out o f place.

    30. The refreshments available to supporters are often limited and o f indifferent quality. They are sold in

*1nglis: Football Grounds of Great Britain p 10
surrounding streets from mobile carts and inside many grounds from other carts or from shoddy sheds. Fans
eat their hamburgers or chips standing outside in all weathers. There is a prevailing stench o f stewed onions.
Adequate numbers o f bins for rubbish are often not available; so wrappings, containers and detritus are simply
dropped. This inhospitable scene tends to breed bad manners and poor behaviour. The atm osphere does not
encourage pride in the ground or consideration for others. I accept that many fans are quite content to eat on
the h o o f when visiting a match, but there is no reason why the fare available should not be w holesom e, varied
and decently served from clean and attractive outlets. Fast food establishments meeting these requirements
are readily to be found at railway stations and on high streets; why not at football grounds?

   31. At m ost grounds little attempt has been m ade to provide pre-match entertainment. To do so could have
a double advantage. It would give the spectators more value for their money. It could also bring them in earlier
thereby avoiding congestion at the turnstiles in the last few minutes before kick-off. Such entertainm ent as has
been tried has mostly failed to appeal to the spectators. They do not seem drawn by the musical offerings o f the
disc jockey or by marching bands. The football supporters’ organisations com plain that supporters have not
hitherto been much consulted about this or about anything else affecting their well-being a n d enjoyment.

  32. In giving this dismal account o f the football scene, I have taken care to use the words “often”, “at most
grounds” or “at many grounds”. I acknowledge that there are notable exceptions where great im provem ents
have been effected and I do not suggest that every disagreeable feature I have described is to be found at every
ground. Nevertheless, the overall picture o f conditions and facilities to be expected by a standing spectator is
depressing. It is in stark contrast to the different world, only yards away, in the Board R oom and the lucrative
executive boxes. I appreciate that they cater for an affluent clientele and bring in m uch-needed revenue. N o
one would expect or indeed want their plush carpeting or haute cuisine when visiting the terraces; but
accom m odation and facilities have often been below the basic decent standard necessary to give spectators
dignity let alone comfort.

  33. It is small wonder that attendances at matches gradually fell o ff from a peak o f 77 m illion in the season
1949/50 to about 20 m illion in the late 1980s. N o doubt other reasons played their part; for exam ple, the
emergence o f other spectator sports and television. U ntil the 19 60s m ost men worked on a Saturday morning
and many went straight to the match in the afternoon. But the 5 day week together with increased car
ownership m ade Saturday outings for the family a popular activity. On top o f these factors, however, the
prospect o f attending football in the conditions I have described clearly becam e unattractive to many erstwhile
supporters. Added to this was the fear o f disorder. So far, I have not m entioned the further indignities endured
by supporters as a result o f hooliganism and the measures taken to contain it.

H o o li g a n is m
  34. During the 1970s, hooligan behaviour became a scourge at and around football grounds. Rival fans
abused and fought with each other on the terraces. The pitch was invaded, som etim es to facilitate the fighting,
som etim es in an attempt to abort a match by those w hose team was losing and on occasions to display anger
and seek to assault a referee or a player who had incurred displeasure. Throwing missiles, either at a player or a
policem an or at rival fans, becam e another violent feature. W hen the police responded by searching fans for
missiles on entry, the practice grew o f throwing coins (which could not be confiscated). S om etim es the coins
were sharpened in advance to make them more damaging.

  35. Mass singing o f traditional songs, som e o f nation-wide appeal, so m e local to the area or the club, had
becom e a part o f the terrace culture. But the repertoire becam e augmented and degraded by abusive and
obscene chants aim ed at the referee or the opposing fans. A further nasty addition was racist chanting aim ed at
any black player o f either team.

   36. Hooliganism outside the ground also becam e rife. Supporters o f rival team s abused and attacked each
other. Hooligan gangs caused damage to trains, to buses, and to property on their route. S om e deliberately
went out o f their way to rampage through local shops, stealing, wrecking and intimidating as they went - an
activity known as “steam ing”. After a match, rival supporters would attack each other on the way h o m e in the
street, in public transport or in public houses.

S e g r e g a t io n
   37. To contain and control these m anifold forms o f anti-social and criminal behaviour there is now an
elaborate com plex o f measures. The policy o f segregation was born in the 1970s. Gradually, it has called for
more and more extreme and expensive strategies by the clubs and the police. As each measure taken has been
circumvented by determined hooligans, further measures have had to be grafted on to the system. W itnessing
the full florid exercise taking place every Saturday afternoon nowadays makes one wonder how anyone could
have contemplated going to such lengths to facilitate the watching o f football. But nobody did; it just grew.


                                                        6
   38. Clubs have sub-divided their grounds to keep rival fans apart by putting fencing and sterile areas
between them, by screening them from inciting each other, by separate entrances and exits and by perimeter
fences round the pitch. Many o f the fences are very high and are crowned with elaborate spikes and barbed
wire, the top sections being inclined inwards to prevent their being scaled. At som e grounds a telescopic tunnel
is extended on to the pitch to protect the teams from m issiles as they co m e on or go off.

   39. The police start and finish their segregation exercise well away from the ground. Typically, special trains
or coaches carrying the away supporters are m onitored en route. The police meet them and escort the fans with
mounted officers, dog handlers and foot officers, ensuring they go only to their allotted section o f the ground.
They are searched at the entrance for drink or weapons (as are the h o m e fans). They are then confined in an
area caged by fencing for the duration o f the match. W hen it ends, the away supporters are often held back fora
quarter to half an hour whilst the h om e supporters are dispersed. They are then escorted away in the sam e
manner as they arrived and put back on to their trains or buses. Although the main body o f away supporters
can thus be policed as a group, those who arrive independently in cars or vans have freedom o f m anoeuvre.
Occasionally trouble makers get into the wrong area and a violent episode occurs. Again, the further away from
the ground the spectators spread, the less the police can do to prevent sporadic confrontations. By and large
however, the police measures have worked to prevent violent outbursts in and around the ground.

  40. But at what a price! In addition to the poor facilities I described earlier (which are often worse for away
than for hom e fans) the ordinary law-abiding football supporter travelling away is caught up in a police
operation rem iniscent o f a colum n o f prisoners o f war being marched and detained under guard. I watched the
escort o f Arsenal fans after a match at Stamford Bridge. They were held in the ground for thirty-five minutes
while the Chelsea supporters left. T hey were then escorted by a substantial body o f police to Fulham Broadway
underground station. There, to avoid overcrowding on the platform, they were adm itted to the station only in
measured groups. Special trains were run to take them non-stop into the centre o f the city to avoid clashes at
nearby stations.

   41. Clearly, the police with their great experience o f controlling crowds at the ground considered this
strategy was necessary in the present climate. Their views were confirm ed in that despite their efficient and
good humoured m anagem ent o f the match and its aftermath, scuffles took place w hen som e fans got into the
wrong section o f the ground. M oreover such police practice is not unique to our country. There are sim ilar
hooligan problems for exam ple in Holland. I w itnessed a very similar operation carried out by the D utch
police at Utrecht to control a train load o f supporters from Eindhoven.

  42. Necessary though such operations m ay presently be, they do nothing to enhance the image o f football as
a spectator sport followed for entertainment and pleasure. I know o f no other sport or entertainm ent in a
civilised country in which it is necessary to keep those attending from attacking eacl other.

   43. Apart from their impact on the spectator, operations to control football crowds have other serious
repercussions. T he cost in money, manpower and disruption is enorm ous. Last year, the cost o f policing
football in London was som e £ 1 0 m illion o f w hich only £1 m illion could be recovered from the clubs.
According to the Football Trust, w ho meet one third o f the costs o f police charges incurred by clubs at matches
for the Football League, Scottish Football League and G M Vauxhall Conference, the cost to clubs during
 1988/89 was £4.79 million. Since this relates only to costs inside grounds w hich can be recovered by the police,
the total cost to the police service is substantially more. Her Majesty’s C h ief Inspector o f Constabulary for
England and Wales said, in his annual report for 1988, that:-

  "Football continues to be a focus for h o o lig a n ism ... dem ands on the police service continued at a high level.
  Typically, 5000 officers may be engaged on football duties on Saturdays during the football season.”

  The H o m e Office estimate that the total cost o f deploying these officers is perhaps £ 2 0 0 ,0 0 0 to £ 3 0 0 ,0 0 0
each football Saturday. At many League matches, policing requires som e 300 officers in the ground with many
more outside and others performing related traffic duties. At high risk matches, Cup semi-finals and the like,
even greater numbers are deployed. At Hillsborough there were 800 officers in and around the ground.
Obviously officers deployed to football cannot be performing police duties elsewhere. Although many are
brought in on an overtime basis (at a consequently heavier cost) police co m m itm en ts to the com m un ity
elsewhere must be affected by the concentration o f such numbers in one place.

  44. W hen upwards o f 4 0 ,0 0 0 converge on a ground in a residential area the effect on the local co m m u n ity is
very disagreeable. Large numbers o f fans chant in the streets, often offensively. They invade gardens to urinate.
Empty cans and other garbage are dropped in gardens, yards and in the street. Shops m ay be pillaged. Traffic is


                                                            7
congested or diverted. Streets are filled with parked coaches and cars. Side-streets are cordoned o f f by police to
protect residents. Recently, a police cordon was thought necessary at a half mile radius round Highbury when
Liverpool visited Arsenal. Residents had to establish their identity. T he operation was successful in preventing
disorder but the need to conduct such operations and the resultant disruption contributes to the poor image o f
football in the com m u n ity at large.

W h a t d o e s S e g r e g a t i o n A c h ie v e ?
   45. Segregation, which is the main feature o f present crowd control policy, aim s o n ly to contain and control
bad behaviour, not to elim inate it. Indeed, the very fact that rival fans are separated tends to increase and
polarise their hostility to each other. Segregation breeds an “us and th em ” attitude. T he op posing supporters
can be seen as a physically distinct group upon whorr an im osity can be focussed. Again, the knowledge that the
“e n em y” is physically restrained from violent riposte may encourage baiting and abuse which caution would
otherwise deter. There is force too in the view that if people are herded and confined as potential offenders,
that concept may in so m e cases b ecom e self-fulfilling. So, although segregation m ay have appeared the only
way to m aintain the excitem ent o f the adversarial atm osphere at football grounds whilst keeping the peace, it
merely controlled the sym ptom s o f hooliganism. The disease remained and may even have been intensified by
the segregation. Other games have not resorted to it. For example, there is no segregation at rugby league
matches although the catchm ent sections o f population, from which support is drawn both to football and
rugby league, seem similar.

W h o a r e t h e H o o li g a n s ?
    46. In chapter 5 o f his Final Report, Mr Justice Popplewell exploded three popular fallacies about
hooliganism. First that it is som ething new; secondly, that it is only found at soccer m atches and thirdly, that it
is a specifically English disease. He went on to consider the nature o f football hooliganism , the characteristics
o f the hooligan, possible causes o f hooligan behaviour and experience in other countries. I do not propose to
repeat his analysis. N oth in g has thrown any doubt on it in the four years since he reported although m uch has
been written by journalists, academ ics and others. I agree with him that there is no sim ple explanation for all
the m isbehaviour attached to football and there is no single remedy. It is important, however, to recognise the
clear distinction between quite different groups o f hooligans.

  47. There are those who m isbehave spontaneously in or around the ground in response to so m e perceived
grievance - a goal against their team, a doubtful decision o f a referee or taunting from others. But there are
other groups who go out bent on causing trouble for its own sake. The latter were described by Mr Justice
Popplewell as “the new hooligans”. Often they hold down good jobs during the week, dress stylishly and detach
them selves from those fans with club scarves w ho travel on official coaches or trains. T hey plan their violence
as a recreation in itself to w hich the football is secondary or a mere background. Unfortunately, these groups
can fom ent trouble and galvanise support from fans w ho would not otherwise m isbehave. T hus the effect o f
the “new hooligans” can grow out o f proportion to their numbers.

   48. Mr Justice Popplewell sum m arised his conclusions as to the nature and m otivation o f hooligan groups
at paragraph 5.90 o f his Final Report as follows:-

         “I (a) That there has always been a group, albeit a small group w ho find vio len ce attractive; who
            currently find the football ground a convenient theatre for their violence and the football match the
            occasion for the display o f their aggressive tendencies w hich on other days and at other tim es they will
            be exhibiting in public houses, the city centre or elsewhere. Their main target at football grounds is
            o p posing fans. They ch oose to exercise that violence at a football match for a num ber o f simple
            reasons. The date and place o f a m atch are fixed; the nature o f the opposition is known; its presence is
            certain, so is that o f the police. Their own support is known. Its presence too is certain. T he battle lines
            can be drawn. Thus plans can be m ade well in advance for the particular acts o f vio len ce that they
            intend to create.

              (b) And while there is a good deal o f academ ic support for the view that violen ce was at one tim e the
              prerogative o f the so called “rough” working class that is no longer the com plete picture today. A
              majority o f today’s hooligans no doubt do fit into that category, but so m e do not. T hey co m e from a
              variety o f backgrounds, m any have reasonable jobs and earn a proper living.

              (c) W hether they are m otivated by the sam e reasons as their predecessors can only be a matter o f
              conjecture; there seem s little reason however to believe otherwise.

         II (a) A second group im itates the first elem ent I have identified. Thus those not particularly given to
            v iolence witness violence in others and see it being exercised, without let or hindrance. People expect
             the spectators on the terraces to behave in an aggressive way and to use foul language. It then
             becom es accepted as the norm and thus becom es a part o f the pattern o f life which would not be
             tolerated elsewhere. This knock-on effect can be seen in violence in the streets o f our cities,
             unconnected with football.

             (b) The feeling o f anonymity in the crowd gives rise to a loss o f inhibition and self-discipline. The
             association with those o f similar disposition, the enthusiasm and the partisan support for the team,
             which itself causes an atmosphere, all create a situation which can readily give rise to violence.

        III Then there is a third group (not always separate from the other two groups) w ho cause violence fora
            reason, either real or supposed. It may be an inability quickly to get into the ground: it may be the
            presence o f rival spectators in a part o f the ground to which the fans think they have a claim.

        IV Finally there are those, the vast majority o f spectators, w ho abhor violence and wish only for an
           afternoon o f pleasure at a football m atch.”

  The oral and written evidence I have received, the studies and reports I have read on the subject and my
own observations lead me to agree entirely with that summary. I would add only on e further elem ent -
alcohol.

Alcohol
  49. There can be no doubt that an excited and volatile crowd is more difficult to control and more prone to
disorder i f it includes numbers w ho have been drinking. Drink is not a major factor affecting Mr Justice
Popplewell's group I. Their violence tends to be planned coldly and soberly. But group II is often rendered
disorderly and more readily im itates the violence o f others because inhibitions are removed by drink.
Likewise, group III responds to a grievance, is readier to take offence and reacts more im pulsively and
violently because o f drink.

   50. Drinking before matches increased in parallel with the growth o f hooliganism. Before the 5 day week,
those com in g straight from work to the football ground on a Saturday had little tim e to drink excessively.
During the 1960s and 1970s young men in their twenties acquired a new affluence and spending on drink
increased. The advent o f the supermarket with an off-licence provided numerous outlets for the sale o f
canned beer; so it becam e easy to have alcohol at the match and on the way to it, w hether the local pubs were
open or not. Finally, apart from tim e and liquor being available, there has developed an attitude to drinking
in the U K not found to the same extent elsewhere - a cult o f drinking to excess. The spectacle o f young fans,
tanked up with beer, whether near our own football grounds or (more damagingly to our reputation abroad)
at foreign football stadia is all too familiar. Yet. for exam ple in Italy, the largest w ine producing country in
Europe, football fans and indeed people generally do not drink to get drunk. Although they have their own
brand o f hooliganism (from the “Ultras” as they are known) alcohol is not a major factor. Here it certainly is
and it remains so despite legislation banning sales or possession o f alcohol in football grounds and the
carrying o f alcohol on public service and hired vehicles bound for such grounds.

P o o r L e a d e r s h ip
  51. The hierarchy inside football has a num ber o f levels over and above the spectators. At the top is the
national management o f the game. In England the Football A ssociation is responsible for the administration
and welfare o f all football down to the lowliest amateur club and football in schools. T he Football League is a
separate body with responsibility for the 92 professional League clubs. In Scotland and Wales there are
equivalent bodies. Below that top m anagement, each o f the League clubs has its own Board o f Directors.
Then there are the referees, the managers and the players. Finally there are organisations representing the
supporters - the Football Supporters’ A ssociation and the National Federation o f Football Supporters’ Clubs.
One would have hoped that the upper echelons in this hierarchy would have taken a lead in securing
reasonable safety and comfort for the spectators and in enforcing good behaviour by precept and example.
Unfortunately, these hopes have not generally been realised and indeed at tim es poor exam ples have been set.

  52. The FA and the FL have not seen it as their duty to offer guidance to clubs on safety matters. In their
written subm ission they said :-

   "Of course, both T he FA and The Football League are concerned to ensure that crowd safety standards are
   the highest reasonably practicable. It is felt, however, that neither o f these authorities should be charged
   with the responsibility o f setting detailed safety standards or enforcing th em .”


                                                           9
They have been much concerned to avoid pitch invasions because they interfere with the sm ooth progress
o f the fixture list and incur criticism and penalties from the European football authorities. But advice, for
exam ple, as to turnstile lay outs, the d ivision o f viewing areas and, until recently, on ratios o f seating to
standing areas has not been forthcoming. As another specific exam ple, in selecting Hillsborough as the venue
for the Cup semi-final, the FA did not consider in any depth whether it was suitable fo r a high risk match with
an attendance o f 54,000 requiring to be segregated, all o f w hom were, in effect, away supporters lacking week
in week out knowledge o f the ground. N o special inspection was made; no consultation with Sheffield
W ednesday or the local authority took place.

   53. As for the clubs, in so m e instances it is legitimate to w onder whether the directors are genuinely
interested in the welfare o f their grass-roots supporters. Boardroom struggles for power, wheeler-dealing in
the buying and selling o f shares and indeed o f w hole clubs som etim es suggest that those involved are more
interested in the personal financial benefits or social status o f being a director than o f directing the club in the
interests o f its supporter customers. In m ost com m ercial enterprises, including the entertainm ent industry,
knowledge o f the custom er’s needs, his tastes and his dislikes is essential information in deciding policy and
planning. But, until recently, very few clubs consulted to any significant extent with the supporters or their
organisations.

   54. Encouragement and indeed requirement o f good behaviour by the fans should be a prim e aim o f club
management. Here again positive leadership has often been lacking and on occasions counter-productive. It
cannot help to prom ote good behaviour if a club chairman has his photograph in the programme presenting a
cheque for £ 7 5 0 by way o f recoupm ent to a club player fined that sum by the FA for m isbehaviour on the
pitch. The sam e applies to another chairman who extended a VIP w elcom e to h om e com ing “supporters”
convicted o f m isbehaviour whilst attending a match in Greece, even if he was sceptical as to the fairness o f
the criminal process.

   55. Then there is what happens on the pitch itself. Long departed are Corinthian Casual standards;
accepting decisions o f the referee without demur; affecting a m odest diffidence on scoring a sensational goal.
For many years now referees’ decisions have been regularly challenged by spread arm s and entreaties; even an
unsensational goal has caused the scorer to be hugged and embraced all the way back to the centre spot. The
cool self-control o f Corinthian Casuals will never return. Perhaps we should not lament its departure since
there is no harm in a reasonable show o f joy in success. But, more recently, things have gone further. On
scoring a goal a player nowadays often rushes straight towards the perimeter fencing and either affects to
clim b it or, with fists raised and shaking, goes on his knees to excite response from supporters. Little has been
done to stop such dem onstrations which are calculated to hype up the fans into hysteria.

    56. At the other extreme from dem onstrations o f joy and triumph, violence on the field o f play by tackles
aim ed at o p po n en ts’ legs, stamping, elbowing and holding is co m m o n ly to be seen. U ntil lately, the FA’s
response to such violence am ongst players has been weak. Negligible fines on offenders, w ithout penalty to
the clubs either in fines or loss o f points, have tended to discredit the FA’s discharge o f its disciplinary role. In
the last couple o f months, prompted by a series o f m uch publicised incidents and by m edia criticism, a firmer
line has at last been adopted. These incidents have involved violent conduct by players o f f the ball. At the end
o f the match between Norwich City and Arsenal on 4 N o v em b er 1989. a num ber o f players on both sides
were involved in an incident w hen punches were exchanged. The referee said he was not going to m ake any
report on the matter. T he FA initially announced that if there was no report from the referee there was
nothing they could do. However, wiser counsels prevailed: officials o f the FA saw the incident on v id eo and
decided to take action. In the result N orw ich City were fined £ 5 0 ,0 0 0 and Arsenal £ 2 0.000. Other incidents
occurred within days at three other grounds involving violence on the field between players and, in one
instance, managers.

   57. To com plete this survey o f the present football malaise, it is necessary to m en tion the m edia. Football
is highly newsworthy. For the World Cup, provision is being m ade at the San Siro stadium, Milan for no fewer
than 5 ,000 journalists. In the d om estic U K scene, the long haul throughout the season to b eco m e League
cham pions or Cup winners is followed not only by the m illions w ho actually attend matches but by many
m illions more via the media. They watch games and listen to the pundits endlessly discussing them on
television; they read about them in the newspapers and they fill in the football pool coupons. So players and
spectators are exposed to constant scrutiny. W hen scuffles or fights occur, w hether on the field or on the
terraces, they are inevitably witnessed by m illions and such incidents o f bad behaviour are aggregated into a
reputation tarnishing the national game as a whole. W hen our supporters go to Europe, they are preceded by
this reputation. It is expected they will behave badly, so w hether they do so initially or not they are likely to
meet a hostile reception from their counterparts. Thus incidents are provoked and the syndrom e continues.


                                                          10
   58.    I have sought in the broadest terms to identify those features which disfigure football today. But
despite them, and despite the decline in attendances from the peak years, the game still co m m a nd s m assive
public support and interest. Indeed, in the last couple o f years there has been som e increase in attendances
for reasons to be explored later. After the horror o f Hillsborough and the analysis o f football's troubles which
it has prompted, the lesson is surely that now is the m om ent for the fullest reassessment o f policy for the
game. Accordingly, before considering detailed recom m endations for securing a basic level o f safety and for
improving crowd control, I think it appropriate to consider how the low standards described in this chapter
could be raised.
•
                                                       CHAPTER 2

                                        A BETTER FUTURE FO R FOOTBALL

       59. It is not enough to aim only at the m inim u m measures necessary for safety. That has been, at best, the
    approach in the past and too often not even that standard has been achieved. What is required is the vision
    and im agination to achieve a new ethos for football. Grounds should be upgraded. A ttitudes should be more
    w elcom ing. The aim should be to provide more modern and com fortable accom m od ation, better and more
    varied facilities, more consultation with the supporters and more positive leadership. If such a policy is
    im plem ented it will not only improve safety. There will also be an im provem ent in behaviour, making crowd
    control easier.

       60. At so m e clubs changes have already been m ade towards realising this new concept o f how football
    should be. For exam ple, at Ibrox Park, scene o f the appalling disaster in 1971, there has been a total
    transformation. The old main stand remains and still has som e standing areas in front o f it. But three new
    stands have been built round the rest o f the ground. They are colourful, convenient and are all-seating. They
    are constructed so as to provide a covered concourse at first floor level running the length o f the stand. At the
    rear o f that concourse throughout its length are modern lavatories for both sexes. At the front are attractive
    fast food service points offering a good range o f food and drinks (but no alcohol). The walls are clean; the
    flooring is o f studded rubber. M ounted overhead, at regular intervals o f a few yards along the w hole
    concourse, are television sets tuned to a sports programme giving information on the d ay’s fixtures, excerpts
    from previous matches and general sports coverage. These arrangements encourage fans to arrive in good
    time, to have w holesom e refreshments in a clean and pleasant setting, to enjoy on the television the kind o f
    pre-match entertainment which genuinely interests them , to visit a decent toilet, and then to walk up a few
    steps to take their seats for the match. All o f this is under cover and it is enjoyed not just by the affluent but by
    the ordinary supporter. Significantly, the facilities are not abused. Occasional graffiti do appear but are
    wiped away promptly and the overall impression is that if spectators are offered civilised conditions they
    com e to respect them.

    A ll-S e a tin g
      61. There is no panacea w hich will achieve total safety and cure all problems o f behaviour and crowd
    control. But I am satisfied that seating does more to achieve those objectives than any other single measure.

       62. It is ob vious that sitting for the duration o f the match is more com fortable than standing. It is also
    safer. W hen a spectator is seated he has his own small piece o f territory in which he can feel reasonably
    secure. He will not be in close physical contact with those around him. H e will not be jostled or m oved about
    by swaying or surging. Small or infirm or elderly men and w om en as well as young children are not buffeted,
    sm othered or unsighted by larger and more robust people as on the terraces. T he seated spectator is not
    subject to pressure o f numbers behind or around him during the match. H e will not be painfully bent double
    over a crush barrier. Those m onitoring numbers will know exactly how many are there w ithout having to
    count them in or assess the density by visual im pression. There will still, o f course, be scope for crowd
    pressure on stairways whilst entering and especially when leaving, but involuntary and uncontrolled crowd
    m ovem ents occasioned by incidents in the game are effectively eliminated.

       63. It is true that at m om ents o f excitem ent seated spectators do, and m ay be expected to, rise from their
    seats. But the m om ent passes and they sit down again. I also recognise that seating is only regarded as more
    com fortable than standing if cover is provided. The consensus is that, although standing on an exposed
    terrace on a wet day is disagreeable, sitting in the rain is worse. So, increased seating d oes require that cover
    be provided.

      64. Apart from comfort and safety, seating has distinct advantages in achieving crowd control. It is
    possible to have disturbances in a seated area and they have occurred, but with the assistance o f C C T V the
    police can im mediately zo o m in with a camera and pinpoint the seats occupied by the trouble-makers as well
    as the trouble-makers them selves. Moreover, if num bered tickets are issued to named purchasers, the police
    have a further aid to identifying miscreants.

      65. N um bered tickets matching n um bered seats also help to identify forgeries. Forged tickets for standing
    areas may not be discovered. In the past, they simply led to inflated numbers on the terraces at all-ticket
    m atches. But there can only be one valid ticket for each numbered seat and the existence o f a forgery is
    im m ediately exposed.


                                                              12
   66. The evidence I have received has been overwhelmingly in favour o f more seating a ccom m od ation. At
present, the ratio throughout the 92 League clubs in England and Wales is about two thirds standing to one
third seated. But whilst m ost are in favour o f reversing that ratio, there are those w ho wish to retain a
proportion o f standing room. Am ongst them are the FA and the football supporters' organisations.
Essentially they deploy three arguments.

   67. The first is an em otional one based on a desire to retain the traditional culture derived from the close
contact o f the terraces. “M y grandfather stood here; my father stood here with me; why shouldn’t I stand here
with my son?” is a co m m o n ly expressed view. Moreover, to many young m en the camaraderie o f singing
together, jum ping up and down, responding in unison to the nam ing o f the players, their emergence on to the
pitch, the scoring o f a goal, an unpopular decision - all o f these are an integral part o f enjoying the match.
They like being part o f an am orphous seething crowd and do not wish to have each his own place in a seat.

   68. The second argument is that conversion to all-seating will reduce the numbers o f fans w ho can be
admitted to the ground; so, many would-be spectators will be disappointed. This assumes a significantly
greater density being permitted for standing places than for seating. It also assum es that the size o f present
crowds regularly exceeds projected all-seated capacity. But the FA’s own evidence showed that during the
1988/89 season the number o f occasions w hen attendances at League clubs exceeded projected all-seater
capacity ranged from nil to 16. The 16 attendances were at Liverpool, w ho have accepted the need for
all-seating. For only three clubs in the first and second divisions did the attendance exceed the projected
all-seated capacity on more than 10 occasions, and for 21 out o f 44 clubs in these two d ivision s the
attendance never exceeded the projected all-seated capacity. In only one case (Liverpool) was the average
attendance during the season in excess o f the projected all-seated capacity.

  69. Finally, cost. Spectators do not want to pay and, it is argued, m any could not pay the substantially
higher price o f a seat as against the cost o f standing.

  70. I am not convinced that the cherished culture o f the terraces is wholly lost w hen fans are seated.
Watching the more boisterous and dem onstrative sections at all-seater grounds, I have noted no absence o f
concerted singing, chanting, clapping or gesticulating in unison. The co m m un al spirit is still there and finds
ready expression. To such extent as the seating limits togetherness or prevents m ovem ent, that price is surely
worth paying for the benefits in safety and control.

   71. Moreover, the m a xim u m density which experience now shows to be acceptable in standing areas tends
to take the force out o f the first two arguments. If standing density is little more than seating density, the
melded mass previously found on terraces becom es more diffuse and the intensity o f the togetherness
becomes little greater standing than sitting. Likewise, at such a density, the difference between the admissible
numbers standing and sitting b ecom e marginal. It can be m ade up by having two or more tiers o f seating
where previously there was only on e tier o f standing.

  72. As to cost, clubs m ay well wish to charge som ewhat more for seats than for standing but it should be
possible to plan a price structure w hich suits the cheapest seats to the pockets o f those presently paying to
stand. At Ibrox, for example, seating is £6. standing £4 - not a prohibitive price or differential.

The Trend in the UK
   73. The superior safety o f seating has already persuaded a number o f clubs in the U K to convert their
terraces to seating either totally or predominantly. Following Hillsborough, Liverpool have announced their
intention to adapt their fam ous Kop to seating. In Scotland. Aberdeen's ground at Pittodrie becam e all-seater
in 1978; Clydebank followed suit: St Johnstone’s new ground at Perth is all-seated. Wembley stadium will
early in 1990 accom m od ate 8 0 ,0 0 0 spectators, all-seated.

  74. Those opposed to all-seating point out that previous attempts to introduce it have met with spectator
resistance. Coventry City was the first English club to install seating throughout its ground in 1981. In 1983
the club reverted to allowing 2 ,000 to stand. In 1985, after visiting fans o f M anchester City tore up seats and
used them as missiles, the ground reverted to standing. Q ueen’s Park Rangers also m oved towards all-seated
accom m odation but removed so m e seats under pressure from supporters.

  75. Since then, however, Hillsborough has happened; thinking has changed; responsible co m m en t by
government, football authorities and m edia has prepared the way for change. Moreover, there are now seats
available w hich cannot be m anually torn and used as missiles. T h ose at Utrecht, for example, have
survived intact for seven years despite usage and deliberate experim ental tests o f their strength.


                                                        13
•      76. It is possible that in the early stages o f conversion there m ay be instances o f fans standing on the seats
    or in front o f them because they are used to standing or in order to register a protest, but I am satisfied that in
    England and Wales as in Scotland and abroad spectators will becom e accustom ed and educated to sitting.
    The evidence 1 have received shows that more recently, where seating has been installed, the fans have com e
    to accept and like it. At Ibrox Park, for example, the seated areas are the most popular and tickets for them
    sell in preference to those for standing. Significantly, trouble from m isbehaviour and physical injuries have
    been reduced since most o f the crowd becam e seated. Such trouble and accidental injuries as still occur are
    primarily in the remaining standing areas. It is planned to convert them to seating in the near future.

    Sir Norman Chester Centre Research
       77. The Sir N orm an Chester Centre for Football Research, attached to the U niversity o f Leicester, is
    funded by the Football Trust. In N ovem ber 1989 the Centre undertook a survey o f registered mem bers o f the
    Football Supporters' A ssociation to discover the views o f com m itted football fans on a number o f the issues
    after Hillsborough which are covered in my Report. The extension o f seating was one such issue. N um erous
    questions were asked on a number o f different hypotheses. The Report states that substantial majorities in
    the sam ple were in favour o f m aintaining the status quo on the seats/terraces balance at their own clubs.
    However, the Report continues:

      "53.6% claim ed they would actually support the drive for more seating (sic) if they were reasonably priced
      and covered. The addition o f these last two points - concessions on price and cover - also seem ed to have
      dramatic effects in reducing levels o f op position to the prospects o f all-seated facilities as we shall see
      later”.

    When all-seating was put to the sam ple there was a majority against it, but the Report goes on:

      “Finally, and perhaps significantly, op position in our sam ple to the introduction o f all-seated facilities
      d im inishes considerably when one introduces provisos on price and protection from the elem ents. When
      this is done, more people in our sam ple support all-seaters than op pose th e m .”

    Europe
      78. The trend towards seating is even stronger in Europe and is now being driven by decrees o f both
    national and European football authorities.

       79. In Italy the im m inence o f the 1990 World Cup com p etition has forced the pace o f progress. The Italian
    Ministry o f the Interior decreed on 25 August 1989 that for open air facilities with a capacity o f more than
    10,000 spectators at football games and for covered ones with a capacity o f more than 4 ,0 0 0 spectators no
    standing will be allowed after 30 April 1990. Those facilities must have only numbered seats each not less
    than 0.45 metres wide. The San Siro stadium in Milan will by then seat 8 5 ,0 0 0 spectators; the O lim pico
    stadium in R ome will seat 87,000.

      80. In Holland, Utrecht's ground built in 1982 has seating for 12.000 and standing room for 8,000. The
    club already intended to convert the latter to seating. However, on 6 D ecem ber 1989 the D utch equivalent o f
    the FA (the K N V B) agreed with the D utch clubs to cut the standing capacity o f football grounds by 10% each
    year over the next decade so as to render football stadia in the N etherlands in effect all-seater at the end o f the
    1990s.

      81. In following this phasing Holland's policy is in accord with a resolution presently under consideration
    by UEFA (U n io n des Associations Europeennes de Football). The resolution proposes that for the 1990/91
    season only 80% o f the standing tickets may be sold, that figure to be reduced every season by 10% until 1999.

       82. FIFA (Federation Internationale de Football Association) passed a resolution on 26 July 1989
    providing that as from the preliminary com p etition for the 1994 World Cup (starting in autum n 1992)
    "matches may in principle only be played in all-seater stadia”. The resolution went on “as from 1993 it will
    be the duty o f the C onfederations and N ational A ssociations to hold high-risk m atches in their zones only in
    all-seater stadia." High-risk matches are defined under UEFA Regulations as follows:

         “1 All U E F 4 final and semi-final ties o f the UEFA club com p etitions as well as final tournament
            matches o f the European Football Cham pionship.

         11 W hen aeclared as such by UEFA on the basis o f previous incidents o f supporters o f one or both
            teams or o f ottier exceptional considerations.


                                                             14
     III W hen it is expected that visiting team supporters will exceed 10% o f stadium capacity or will exceed
         3.000 persons.

     IV When full capacity stadium is expected or more than 5 0,000 spectators present.

     V W hen the match is likely to attract a large number o f emigrants/foreign workers originating from the
       country o f the visiting team, w ho live either in the country where the match is being played or in
       neighbouring countries.”

   Thus world and European football authorities are clearly determ ined to enforce the conversion o f stadia to
all-seating, so far as international matches and other matches under their control are concerned. It is true that
their resolutions will not be binding in regard to League or d om estic football matches. But they are a pointer
in the direction o f safety and control and as such have been em ulated by Italy and Holland domestically.

   83. Furthermore, I am told by the FA that they regard them selves as duty bound to follow, in the dom estic
football scene, any Resolution passed by FIFA although strictly such Resolution is binding only in
international m atches or m atches between U K clubs and clubs from abroad. Thus, the FA regard the
Resolution o f 26 July 1989 as effective in relation to the League, Cup and other d om estic fixtures from 1993
onwards. The Resolution does not force clubs to install all-seating as a condition o f staging high-risk matches.
There is still the option to use only those parts o f the ground which have seating. Clearly, unless these are
substantial, attendance will be m uch reduced. O ne would therefore expect the major clubs to adapt their
grounds to a ccom m od ate the m a x im u m seating they can manage by the tim e the Resolution takes effect.
Smaller and more im pecunious clubs m ay prefer to postpone conversion. However, if a small club with little
seating accom m od ation draws a large first d ivision club at h om e in the Cup in 1993 (a high-risk match) it will
be able only to use its limited seating a ccom m od ation or the gam e will have to be played at a better equipped
ground elsewhere.

The Football Spectators Act 1989
  84. The intention to follow this sam e trend was stated by your predecessor, Mr Douglas Hurd, in a
statement to the H ouse o f C o m m o n s two days after Hillsborough. H e ad d ed :-

  “This would involve the disappearance o f terraces at (major) grounds. It m ight also involve am endm ents
  to strengthen the Football Spectators Bill so that its provisions for the licensing o f grounds m atched this
  concept”.

  In the event, machinery for im plem enting increased seating is to be found in section 11 o f the 1989 Act.
There, provision is m ade for the Football Licensing Authority (set up under section 8) to be directed by the
Secretary o f State to include in any licence to admit spectators a c ondition im posing requirements as respects
the seating o f spectators at designated football m atches at the premises; “and it shall be the duty' o f the
authority to com ply with the direction”.

Association Football only or D esignated Grounds?
   85. In considering seating and standing, I have concentrated so far on association football because it
attracts the largest and m ost volatile crowds and has been troubled with misbehaviour. But should
recom m endations about seating be confined to association football or should they go further? W herever a
line is drawn com plaint m ay be m ade that it is illogical, but two possibilities seem more logical than most:
either to confine recom m en dation s to the 92 clubs in the Football League or to apply them to grounds
designated under the 1975 Act as am ended. T he latter course would include a num ber o f Rugby League,
Rugby U n io n and cricket grounds. I acknowledge that so far, happily, m isbehaviour at those grounds has
been m inim al. However, even leaving aside possible misbehaviour, where there are large numbers there is a
risk o f overcrowding. A well attended Rugby match o f either code m ay attract numbers in excess o f those
attending m any Football League m atches. There would seem little reason for requiring a fourth d ivision
League club to convert to seating whilst permitting major Rugby clubs to keep their terraces indefinitely.

  86. On the other hand, proposals for all-seating would clearly be inappropriate in relation to sports events
at which spectators are accustom ed, and should be entitled, to m ove about. For example, at horserace
meetings, spectators may wish to view horses in the paddock, place bets, view races from different vantage
points and enjoy the other facilities o f what is a social occasion as well as a sports event. Other exam ples o f
events at which spectators m ove about and should be free to do so are greyhound racing and golf
tournaments.


                                                         15
  87. The criteria for designating a sports ground under the 1975 Act as am ended are laid down in section
KD;
  "The Secretary o f State may by order designate as a sports ground requiring a certificate under this Act (in
  this Act referred to as a “safety certificate”) any sports ground which in his op inion has accom m od ation for
  more than 10.000 spectators.”

  Section 1(1)(A) permits the Secretary o f State to substitute such other num ber as he considers appropriate
for the num ber 10,000.

   88. Clearly the purpose o f such designation is to bring safety o f grounds with capacity for substantial
numbers under the control o f the local authority. Whilst som e grounds with a capacity o f more than 10.000
may currently have an average attendance o f only say 3,000. there is always the prospect o f a visit from a large
club, an attractive Cup draw, or an upturn in fortunes bringing in larger crowds. Safety provisions must be
capable o f coping with such events. Indeed, danger is more likely to result if there is an occasional m atch with
a large attendance than if such m atches were regular since those controlling it and those attending it will be
inexperienced.

   89. For these reasons, I think recom m endations to increase seating should be applied to all designated
grounds. I appreciate that the machinery provided in section 11 o f the Football Spectators Act 1989 can be
used only to regulate the extension o f seating at association football grounds. However, the Secretary o f State
has power under section 6(2) o f the 1975 Act, as am ended, to provide for securing safety by regulations and
may prescribe terms and conditions to be inserted in Safety Certificates under section 15A as indicated in the
next chapter. These powers could be used, even without the provision in section 11 o f the 1989 Act, to
prescribe mandatory rules about seating. So. by a com bination o f his 1989 Act powers and his 1975 Act
pow en or solely by exercising the latter, the Secretary o f State can require the progressive extension o f seating
at designated grounds.

  90. I therefore conclude and recommend that designated grounds under the 1975 Act should be required in
due course to be converted to all-seating. I do so for the com pelling reasons o f safety and control already set
out; also, so far as association football is concerned, because the present trend at h o m e and abroad and the
rules o f the world and European football authorities m ake the m ove to all-seating irresistible.

P hasing
  91. U nless som e tim e factors are specified, progress towards all-seating m ay well be protracted. This is
recognised in the phasing proposed in the UEFA Resolution quoted above and in the machinery set up in
section 11 o f the Football Spectators Act 1989.

  92. For high-risk association football matches I welcome and endorse the adoption by the FA o f the FIFA
Resolution requiring no standing tickets to be sold after 1993 and its application to domestic fixtures.

   93. As to other matches, I consider that w ithout the im petus locally o f the World Cup, w hich is the spur
for speedy change in Italy, and having regard to the present state o f our grounds, it would be asking too much
to require conversion in the U K in the next two or three years. For all grounds designated under the 1975 Act
except for first division and second division League grounds, and national stadia, I think a timing along the
lines suggested in the Resolution under consideration by U EF A (and now adopted in Holland) is reasonable ie
that standing tickets should be reduced by 10% per year starting with a 10% deduction effective from August
1990 and so be phased out by August 1999.

   94. However, I recommend that grounds in the first and second divisions o f the League and national stadia
should be all-seated by the start o f the 1994 /1 9 9 5 season. It is at those grounds that the larger crowds attend
and, in the interests o f both safety and crowd control, I consider they should have seating for all spectators in
five years rather than ten years. The reduction in standing tickets should therefore be at 20% per annum from
August 1990 and be complete by August 1994. Any club promoted to the second division of the League should be
given a reasonable period in which to comply. A sim ilar approach should be adopted in Scotland.

Planning Ground Improvements
   95. Increased seating and other ground im provem ents will require expert planning and m uch finance. As
to planning, it is crucial that before clubs embark upon major work, they should have the best information
and advice on modern ground design. C onversion to seating cannot necessarily be achieved merely by fixing
seating onto existing terraces. For exam ple, sight-lines. access to seats, gangways, ro o f cover and other factors


                                                         16
may require more extensive changes to the layout. S om e clubs may be able wholly to redevelop their existing
grounds: others may be limited by space, finance or crowd needs to more m odest alterations. In som e
instances, the best course would be to move to a new site either alone or in conjunction with another club.
Ultimate decisions on these op tion s must be for the club m anagement. N o doubt, so m e o f the bigger clubs
will be able to engage the foremost contractors in this field to advise them and carry out the work. But even
tor them, and certainly for the lesser clubs, it would be o f great value to have a body fully apprised o f the latest
developm ents in ground design, capable o f giving expert advice on possible schem es and on ways and m eans
o f achieving them.

An Advisory Design Council
  96. I therefore support the suggestion of Professor Maunder’s Technical Working Party that there should be
established an Advisory D esign Council to fulfil this role. It should, in my view, be set up by the FA and the FL
whose functions should include offering a service of this kind to the clubs. By way o f analogy, in Italy this
function is exercised by the C om itato O lim pico N a zion ale Italiano (CON1). After studying m any grounds,
including those in Madrid, Vienna and Athens, CON1 produced an excellent pamphlet on “Design Criteria
for Safe Comfortable and Large Sports Facilities" supported by detailed studies showing how they can be
achieved. These, together with m odels which m ay be inspected at C O N I’s headquarters in R om e, show how a
modern stadium can be designed from car park to pitch so as to secure safety and crowd control.

Research
  97. It has com e to my attention only recently that the Sports Council published in 1981 a “H an db ook o f
Sport and Recreational Building D esig n ”, and in 1989, a work entitled “Arenas, a Planning, Design and
Management G u id e”. The 1981 work included, in volu m e three, studies on outdoor sports stadia. T he 1989
work concentrated on indoor stadia. It seem s that neither o f these works was sent to the FA or the FL, nor
have they acquired them. Again, in July 1986, the Institution o f Structural Engineers formed an ad hoc
com m ittee “to bring together all current technical knowledge relevant to the appraisal o f sports grounds and
their individual elements. The com m ittee’s task was to establish a fully referenced b ody o f knowledge within
three years which would be com plem entary to the ‘G uide to Safety at Sports Grounds’.” T he ad hoc
com m ittee has prepared a fifth draft o f its report which will be finalised after the recom m endations in my
Report have been considered.

   98. It is highly desirable that such worthwhile research as I have m en tion ed should all be brought together
to achieve m axim um benefit. With a formidable building and conversion programme for football grounds
ahead, an Advisory Design C ouncil set up by the FA and FL could m ake the best use o f all available research
here and abroad to assist and advise clubs.

Finance
    99. The scale o f the changes 1 recom m end will necessarily require heavy expenditure, albeit over an
extended period. It is not my function to make detailed proposals for financing the work. That is for football
management and essentially for the clubs. However, lest it be thought that 1 have m ade proposals regardless
o f feasible funding, I ought to indicate sources and m ethods o f finance which should make the im provem ents
practicable, and so m e o f the fiscal arguments which have been addressed to me.

The Football Trust (FT) and the Football Grounds Improvement Trust (FGIT)
   100. Assistance in financing safety measures is presently available from the FT and the FGIT. The former
is funded by the three major pools com p anies (Littlewoods. Vernons and Zetters) from the “Spot the Ball”
Com petition, at the rate o f 21% o f turnover, yielding over £9 m illion a year. T he total given to British football
since 1958 now approaches £ 1 2 0 million. The Trustees are em powered to use their funds to promote
measures for the control or suppression o f unruly behaviour in relation to football; to assist clubs to m eet the
obligations o f the Safety o f Sports Grounds Act 1975; to improve grounds and facilities for those w ho play
and watch the game and for any other purpose they consider to be a benefit to the game o f football in Great
Britain and Northern Ireland. T he FT allocates just over h alf its in co m e (ie over £4.5 m illion) to assisting
expenditure by League clubs on ground safety and improvements. This is done through the FGIT, a second
independent trust. T he FGIT was established in 1975, the arrangements being m odified later in 1979 when
the FT was brought into being.

    101. Although it helps to fund m any other works, from those at international grounds down to those at the
lowliest clubs, the Trust continues to give first priority to assisting expenditure essential to the grant o f a
Safety Certificate for a designated ground. U nder its trust deed, the F G IT is able to make grants o f up to 75%
o f the total cost available to clubs carrying out work as a necessary con d ition o f their being given a Safety


                                                          17
Certificate under the 1975 Act. Accordingly, should my recom m endation o f mandatory increases in seating
be m ade a condition o f the Safety Certificate, the work would be eligible for a grant from the FGIT.

    102. However, even at £4.5 m illion a year, the FGIT fund would be insufficient. Additional financial
requirements fell upon the League clubs on the im plem entation o f the 1975 Act and still more after the fire at
Bradford City’s ground in May 1985. By February 1988 over £37 m illion had been paid out in grants.
Pressures on finance led to the suspension o f im provem ent grants in June 1987. T he FGIT was able to
reintroduce im provem ent grant aid on a limited basis during the closed season o f 1988. However, the range
o f works required to upgrade the League grounds inevitably m eans that resources o f the FGIT would be
spread quite thinly. They will not be sufficient to finance the kind o f im provem ents I have suggested, but the
Trust provides a structure for doing so. By way o f exam ple, Sheffield W ednesday received a grant o f £ 5 9 5 ,0 0 0
for the im provem ent o f the Kop end at Hillsborough. This was in addition to som e £ 4 3 1 ,0 0 0 given to the club
for a total o f 21 safety projects between September 1978 and October 1988. Even so, funds o f this order will
be insufficient to build new all-seated stands. How then, can additional revenue be generated?

Fiscal Considerations
   103. Three arguments have been addressed to m e by the football authorities suggesting alterations in tax
structure to m ake funds available for ground improvements. Fiscal policy is for governm ent and ultimately
Parliament to decide, not for a judge. All I can usefully do is to set out the arguments.

  (a) VAT on the Spot the Ball Competition
   104. The Football Trust have suggested that if VAT were abolished on receipts from this com petition,
som e £5 to £6 m illion would be available. This would am ount to a direct subsidy from the Treasury. It would
be contrary as I understand it not only to present governm ent thinking but to long established principles o f
fiscal policy. If that is so, a different and perhaps more propitious approach would be for the FA to urge the
Pool Promoters A ssociation (PPA) to increase their contribution as part o f a strategy to ensure the healthy
developm ent o f the game from which the PPA m akes its money.

  (b) Pool Betting Tax
   105. A second case m ade by the FA is for a reduction in Pool Betting Tax now standing at 42.5%. The
suggestion is a reduction to 40% which would yield so m e £16 million. This, it is said, could be passed on to
assist ground im provem ents in o n e o f two ways: either the G overnm ent could continue to tax pool betting at
the current level but m ake a donation to football equivalent to 2.5% o f the tax recovered, or it could reduce
the tax rate to 40% on the strict understanding that present proposals as to how any reduction o f the 42.5%
might be used were am ended to allow football to derive the entire benefit from the m oney thus saved by the
pool com panies.

   106. The FA seek to support their argument by reference to the structure o f tax on horse racing. They
claim the com parison shows football to be unfairly treated. In horse racing, the duty o n off-course betting is
8%; on-course betting is not now taxed. There is a Horserace Betting Levy which goes to the im provem ent
and m aintenance o f race courses. However, the com parison between football pools and racing is not o f like
with like. The relationship o f stakes to w innings is different. T he Football League presently receives £14
m illion a year from the PPA for the use o f its fixture list. There is no payment sim ilar to this in racing. N o r is
there an equivalent in racing to the Football Trust or the FGIT. The Horserace Betting Levy is essentially
based on voluntary agreement and is not regarded by the Treasury as a tax. There could be no basis for a levy
on football pools unless there were agreement between the PPA and the Football League.

   107. For these amongst other reasons, the racing analogy m ay not add weight to the FA’s argument on pool
betting tax. However, apart from that analogy, the FA subm it there is a strong case for som e reduction o f the
42.5% tax. The Chester Report o f 1968 recom m ended the establishm ent o f a football levy. T he Rothschild
Royal C om m ission on G am bling recom m ended in 1977 a reduction in the pool betting tax from the level at
that tim e o f 40% to 37% to establish a levy board. T he FA and the FL do not favour the creation o f a football
levy board. They consider that the Football Trust and the FGIT are appropriate bodies to receive and
adm inister any m oney accruing to football were a reduction m ade in the pool betting tax. I can only say that
the case for a m odest reduction in the pool betting tax which convinced the Rothschild C om m issio n in 1977
is arguably stronger now that the rate stands at 42.5%. It must in general be for com m ercial undertakings to
be self-financing. This applies throughout the entertainm ent industry o f which football clubs are a part. The
football authorities appreciate and accept that they m ust find the necessary funding substantially from their
own resources. Nevertheless, if grounds all over the country are to be upgraded and in so m e instances
re-located so as to achieve safety for spectators, im provem ent in the quality o f life for residents near grounds


                                                          18
and a reduction in the expensive police co m m itm en t to controlling matches, it can be argued there is a case
tor financial assistance, if not by direct subsidy then by som e tax reduction.

  108. Whether or not the FA’s argument for tax reduction finds favour, there m ay well be scope for
reassessing and possibly increasing the contribution m ade by pools to football. It would not m atter whether
such contribution is to be by voluntary levy, by an increase in the present percentage rate on receipts from the
Spot the Ball C om petition or by increasing the am ount paid for the use o f the fixture list.

  (c) Capital Allowances
  109. Com plaint is made that no capital allowances can be claim ed against tax in respect o f ground
improvements.

   110. W hen asked why they seem ready and able to spend large sums, som etim es into m illions o f pounds,
for a single player in preference to spending m oney on im proving their grounds, the clubs usually give two
reasons.

  111. First, the attendance and satisfaction o f their supporters depends essentially on success; so buying a
brilliant player has priority over ground improvement.

Transfer Fees
   112. They say the popular perception o f transfer fees as excessive and extravagant is mistaken. The
money, I was told again and again, sim ply circulates round the League clubs. It is calculated to bring on
budding players. The level o f payments is high, but it is forced up by prices continental clubs with huge
financial backing (like Juventus from Fiat) are able to pay.

    113. The “circulation” argument runs like this. First division ciub A buys an ace piayer for £1 m illion
from club B. This enables club B to buy three players at, say. £ 2 5 0 ,0 0 0 each from three other clubs, C, D and
E. Clubs C, D and E each buy two up-and-coming but not yet arrived players from lesser clubs for perhaps
£ 1 0 0 ,0 0 0 each. So the process and the prices continue downwards eventually enabling the poorer clubs to
keep going by cashing in on players they have trained from scratch. M eanwhile, to finance their £1 m illion
purchase, club A m ay sell two or three players who are past their best to lower d ivision clubs. This analysis
may well have som e validity, but there are notable exceptions. For example, when a French club bought a
player from an English club for over £ 4 m illion the m oney had not been circulating round the League clubs.

A Levy on Transfer Fees?
   114. Even if the “circulation” argument has som e validity, the fact remains that transfer fees have reached
a level which many regard as grotesque and certainly out o f all proportion to the am ounts spent on ground
improvement. There is a case for the football authorities im posing a levy on such fees, the proceeds going to
the FGIT to fund ground improvements. I suggest consideration be given to this.

Tax “Anomaly”
   115. Secondly (and this is the tax argument) football clubs have a strong fiscal inducem ent to spend on
players rather than ground im provem ents. Payments for players are allowable revenue expenditure.
Improvements to the ground are not. In Brown (Inspector o f taxes) r Burnley Football and Athletic Company
Ltd 1983 AER 244, it was held that expenditure on a new stand to replace an old unsafe one did not qualify as
an allowable deduction whether as a repair or as provision o f plant. It is arguable that a fiscal provision which
penalises the redevelopm ent o f grounds whilst encouraging the payment o f huge transfer fees is an anomaly,
that it sends the wrong signals to clubs, and that it encourages them to neglect questions o f safety in favour o f
promoting success on the field. To accede to this argument might fall foul o f the m axim that hard cases make
bad law. But as a matter o f policy, it is argued that the encouragem ent o f expenditure on ground
improvements by a fiscal concession m ay well bear re-examination.

Club Financing
   116. Whatever m ay com e from the Pool Promoters Association via the two Trusts, or from any tax
concession, in the end the bulk o f the finances for ground im provem ent must be raised by the clubs
themselves. Here, clubs are at a disadvantage com pared with their European counterparts. On the continent
m ost grounds are ow ned by local authorities which lease them to the clubs. They are regarded as providing a
com m unal facility and often the stadium is available for a variety o f sports and other functions; sports
facilities and offices are built into the stadium com plex.


                                                        19
•
       117. Nevertheless, there are ways o f financing im provem ents if the club m anagem ent is enterprising and
    resourceful. Sponsorship is one. Presently it brings £ 17.5 m illion into football annually. Advertising on
    electric score boards and on hoardings round the ground as well as on tickets, programmes and m em bership
    cards is another. Associated com panies marketing sports wear and other merchandise with the club’s logo,
    the sale o f television rights, the issue o f debentures, and the sale o f shares to the public are other m ethods
    which can be and have been used. In particular, I would expect the football authorities to seek the highest
    possible price for television rights. U nd er current contractual arrangements, the Football Association
    receives som e £6 m illion pa from the sale o f television rights for d o m estic broadcasts, o f which som e £2.5
    million is distributed to clubs. They also receive between £ 0.75 m illion and £1 m illion for the sale o f
    television rights overseas. Separate arrangements apply at Wembley. T h e Football League contracted som e
    two years ago to sell the television rights for League m atches f o r £ l 1 m illion, linked to the Retail Price Index.
    The television com p anies know that football on the screen has a vast following. They should be expected to
    pay a substantial price for the rights to relay popular matches. For their part, the football authorities should
    ensure that this valuable source o f revenue is directed towards im proving stadia as a high priority.

       118. The cost o f covered seating throughout the 92 clubs in the Football League has been investigated by
    the FA. Whilst the assessm ent can only be a rough estim ate and is subject to fluctuations due to inflation and
    other factors, the consultants suggested that to install seating throughout all the grounds might cost about £30
    m illion. To provide cover over all those areas could cost a further £ 100 m illion. It should be noted, however,
    that no breakdown o f that figure is given. Moreover, it assumes “all existing uncovered standing capacity
    should becom e covered”. G iven current attendances, it would seem unnecessary that all that capacity should
    be covered. In many instances, attendances are always well below the perm itted capacity o f the ground. In
    those cases, a much smaller scale solution involving the rebuilding or redevelopm ent o f only part o f the
    ground would be sufficient. There would be little point in providing covered seating a ccom m od ation
    throughout a ground if there is no realistic possibility o f more than h alf o f it being used. Costs m ay therefore
    be less daunting for the smaller clubs than the consultants’ estim ates suggest.

    Upgraded Stadia or N ew Stadia
       119. At major grounds where substantial resources can be generated, vast im provem ents can be m ade on
    existing sites if there is sufficient space. I have seen a num ber o f im aginative exam ples o f ground
    redevelopment. It has been achieved at Ibrox Park and is in the course o f being achieved at Old Trafford,
    W hite Hart Lane and H am pd en Park, to give only four examples.

       120. However, I agree with the evidence from the Sports Council as to the need for space to facilitate car
    parking, external and internal circulation and sufficient exits and entrances to the spectator areas. They
    said:-

      “T he location o f m any existing football grounds in central city or town sites precludes this provision (o f
      space) which im plies the adoption o f a gradual but progressive policy o f disposing o f grounds in densely
      developed areas and replacing the facility on the urban periphery. T he Council believes that opportunities
      exist for such developm ents on a self-funding basis in m any instances. This would also provide the
      opportunity for more than one club to be based at newly developed stadia constructed to a high
      specification and built to m eet new dem ands for safety and com fort”.

    St Johnstone
       121. I was impressed by the way this had been done at three particular grounds. At St Johnstone in
    Scotland, the solution has been to involve private capital directly. T he A SD A supermarket chain bought the
    site o f the old St Johnstone Football Club in the centre o f Perth, redeveloped it as a supermarket, and built
    the club a brand new all-seated stadium for 10,000 spectators on the outskirts o f the town. The site was, in
    effect, donated by a local farmer. It is close to a motorway exit and provides for extensive car parks. I accept
    that this confluence o f factors m ight not be easy to reproduce elsewhere. In particular, land prices in som e
    areas would be prohibitive and planning perm ission very difficult to obtain. A greenfield site is likely to be in
    a conservation or green belt area and the choice o f sites is lim ited by the need to m ake the ground accessible
    to townsfolk albeit outside the town.

    Utrecht
       122. I saw two exam ples abroad where these problems had been tackled resolutely. At Utrecht an old
    stadium on the outskirts o f the town was totally redeveloped on the sam e site ostensibly at nil cost. The
    contracting com pany which rebuilt the stadium (Ballast N ed a m ) is now in consultation with 11 clubs in
    England and Scotland with a view to building similar projects in partnership with the Football A ssociation


                                                              20

    and British Aerospace o f which it is a subsidiary. Their concept involves the recognition that in the past, for
    all but a handful o f days in the year, a stadium com plex has usually and wastefully lain deserted. At Utrecht
    the stadium is owned by the municipality. The space underneath the stands and in the corners o f the ground
    has been developed to provide accom m o d atio n for com m ercial use. The rent provides the m unicipality with
    sports accom m od ation which pays for itself. S om e 6 ,000 square metres o f com m ercial working areas and
    24.000 square metres o f com m ercial offices have been incorporated into the com plex. The com m ercial uses
    o f this accom m od ation include office a ccom m od ation, snack bars, sports facilities, photocopying and office
    equipment services, a driving school and a hairdresser. The large parking area is used except on match days
    as a "'park and ride” facility for those working in the more congested areas o f the city. The advantages for
    business are that shops and offices enjoy a prestigious high profile address with all necessary services and
    facilities. For the com m unity, the com m ercial stadium serves as an arena both for trade and recreation.
    Appendix 5 is a photograph showing the stadium with the com m ercial infill in the corners and out into the
    car park.

    Nimes
       123. The stadium at N im es in Southern France is also owned by the m unicipality . It was built recently on
    the outskirts o f the town with extensive parking and good access to road com m un ication s. The cost was so m e
    £17 m illion o f which £16 m illion cam e from the m unicipality itself. T he justification for this expenditure o f
    public funds is the b elief that the stadium is a com m unal asset. It provides not only a stadium for football or
    rugby but an extensive range o f other sports facilities built into the com plex. T h ese include a gym nastic hall
    capable o f hosting international matches, an “om nisport” hall for tennis, basket-ball and volley-ball, a jud o
    hall, facilities for fencing and billiards, and a large exhibition hall which, at the tim e o f our visit, had just
    been used for a car sales exhibition.

    Local Authority Assistance
       124. All these three stadia are on a com paratively small scale. St Johnstone seats 10,000. Utrecht
    accom m odates 2 0,000 and N im e s about 28,000. I accept that in the current financial climate and with our
    different approach to com m un al funding, local authorities are unlikely to be able to provide subsidies for
    such stadia, although local authorities do subsidize, for exam ple, sw im m ing baths, theatres and other leisure
    facilities which may serve fewer o f their citizens. However, clubs which wish to m ove from centre town sites
    to new sites on the outskirts o f town may well be able to find a purchaser as St Johnstone did with A SDA.
    Likewise, those who wish either to build a new stadium on the outskirts or to redevelop their stadium in town
    may be able to do so in a way which incorporates space for com m ercial lettings.

        125. In such situations, although the local authority may be unable to assist with finance, it could play a
    useful role in bringing parties together and as planning authority. It could take a favourable view, for
    example, o f a planning application which involved the provision not only o f a com m un al sports stadium but
    o f further facilities, whether for sport or otherwise, benefitting the c om m u n ity as a whole. There has recently
    been a number o f attempts by clubs to find greenfield sites for new grounds only to be turned down at each
    attempt on planning grounds. Clearly, an application for a football ground in a conservation area or green
    belt poses planning problems. But, although the protection o f such areas is an important principle, two other
    considerations may also carry weight. First, that the quality o f life o f residents living adjacent to a football
    ground in a town would be much improved by resiting it elsewhere. Secondly, that if we want safety and
    improved standards at grounds there are so m e clubs which will need a new site at which to achieve them. To
    this end. local authorities should surely give what assistance they properly can. One useful exam ple o f the
    mutual assistance which a club and a local authority can give each other is an agreement m ade between
    Millwall and the London Borough o f Lewisham. The latter agreed to pay £ 7 0 ,0 0 0 a year to the club w hich for
    its part agreed inter alia to make the ground available for various activities beneficial to the local community.

    Ground Sharing
        126. Whether or not incom e-earning facilities are incorporated into a sports ground, it seem s u neco n o m ic
    that the stadium itself should be used by only one club, in effect on ce a fortnight. The cost to each club both
    o f upgrading or building a stadium and o f m aintaining it could be halved if sensible sharing arrangements
    could be made. But there is resistance to this. A number o f cities have two clubs, each with its own ground.
    Such is local rivalry that the idea o f ground sharing seem s anathem a to many. Yet, faced with the expense o f
    seating and ground im provem ent, it would make financial sense. O pposition to sharing an entirely new
    ground may be marginally less than to one club sharing another’s existing ground. Recently Mr Peter
    Robinson, C h ief Executive o f Liverpool FC, was quoted as saying:

      “ If som eon e were to build a high-quality stadium on Merseyside, we and Everton would be quite happy to
      share it - even though the idea might not appeal to the fans at first”.


                                                             21
  If two clubs could sell their inner city grounds with planning permission, the resultant capital would go a
long way to building a modern shared stadium on a more suitable site.

  127. It works abroad. AC Milan and Inter Milan share the San Siro stadium. In Turin, Juventus and
Torino also share. G enova and Sampdoria provide a third example.

  128. As long ago as 1981, in the Sports C oun cil’s H andbook o f Sports and Recreational Building Design,
Volume Three (Outdoor Sports), ground-sharing was considered in a technical study o f stadia. The author,
Mr Faulkner Brown, wrote at page 2 4 :-

  “Several courses would appear to be open to football clubs. One is that they might rationalise their position
  and. wherever possible, jointly use a single stadium. This could happen at Sheffield, N ottin gham and
  Bristol. Fulham could m ove in with Chelsea and Brentford with Queen’s Park Rangers. Inter-Milan and
  AC Milan, for all their deep rivalry, do live happily enough together in the giant San Siro stadium. The
  British clubs could all retain their identity, halve their overheads and realise handsom ely the value o f their
  freehold properties, if they could cope with their fiercely held views o f club individuality and club pride.

     A nother alternative would be, where possible, for clubs to offer unused land adjacent to the stadium for
  d evelopm ent and, in realising the assets from the land, to plough them back into the cost o f stadium
  reconstruction. This, o f course, has happened at Lord’s and is having so m e noticeable effects at the Oval
  and in other county cricket grounds.

    A further alternative is to build additional sports facilities alongside the stadium , not necessarily in
  em ulation o f the ancient Greek exam ple (but nevertheless there is a parallel), so that a large number o f
  sports clubs could use all the facilities. This schem e has been developed to so m e extent both in the U nited
  States and on the con tinent.”

Super-Stadia
  129. So far, I have referred only to club grounds. But there is a case for having a small number o f
super-stadia capable o f accom m odating very large crowds for international matches or major Cup ties. At
present, the only such stadium in the U K is W embley which will accom m od ate 8 0 ,00 0 all-seated. Like
Wembley, any other stadia o f large capacity could be available not only for football but for other sports, for
pop concerts and other large events.

   130. A consortium com prising British Aerospace, the FA and Ballast N ed a m (who built the Utrecht
stadium) is presently considering the building o f a new national stadium at Birm ingham to accom m od ate
100,000. There is a suggestion that this project, if carried through, would provide a replacement for
Wembley. However, it may well be that there is room for both. This wouid give a venue in London and a
venue in the M idlands for major events. H am pden Park has served as Scotland’s international football
ground for many years and when planned im provem ents are com plete it should continue to do so. It is
arguable that on e more large stadium may be required in the north o f England but the upgrading o f a ground
such as Old Trafford might well suffice to achieve this purpose.

Leadership and Example
   131. 1 turn from stadia and m oney to one aspect o f football which gives w ide scope for im provem ent at
very little cost. Much is written about the m isbehaviour o f spectators; but m isbehaviour is often imitative.
Hooligans in the crowd find others who will copy them. Similarly, incitem ent from the pitch or bad
behaviour by players has a malign influence on the crowd. For many fervent followers, the men on the pitch
are heroes to be revered and emulated. After a goal, when the scorer dem onstrates to the fans behind the
fencing, the resultant surge forward and hysteria is bad for safety and bad for crowd control. It should not
occur. Worse still, when players fight, the fans follow suit. Lest anyone doubt this, the recent exam ples o f
fighting between players bear it out. In two o f the four incidents in N ovem ber 1989, crowd m isbehaviour
resulted directly from fighting between players. At Highbury, fans cam e out on to the pitch to jo in in. At
U pton Park, scuffles between W im bledon and West H am players provoked surging, fighting and coin
throwing on the terraces.

   132. It is in the first instance up to the players themselves, then the referees, the managers and the club
directors to stop both incitem ent and violence by players whether on or o f f the ball. T he referees, managers
and directors have power to do this. If and w hen they fail to use it, the FA must take a firm disciplinary line
using their very full powers to fine those involved including the clubs and to penalise the clubs in points. If all
else fails, there is no reason why violence on the pitch should have any im m u n ity from the law o f the land or
from police action.


                                                        22
  133.     On the positive side, m anagement could do much to create a better atmosphere in the grounds by
what they say and what they write in programmes and magazines. By consulting with supporters they could
enlist the goodwill and help o f the decent majority to isolate and rebuff m isbehaviour from the minority
rather than imitate it. A campaign for better behaviour could be launched by the clubs through their
literature and backed by managers and players using their popular hero appeal.

   I 34. I should add that violence on the pitch is not confined to soccer. There has been a growing incidence
of stampings and punchings in Rugby U nion gam es even at the highest level. Reaction from referees, clubs
and even international selectors has tended to play such incidents down. Although spectator behaviour has
not. as yet. been adversely affected by such incidents, the authorities ought to deal firmly with them before
that happens and in any event, simply because violence should be put down.

Family and M em bership Areas
    135. Much progress has been m ade at a num ber o f clubs recently in bringing w om en and children back to
watching football by creating separate family areas. Similarly, partial m embership schem es have enabled
clubs to reserve parts o f the ground exclusively to members. This has had the dual advantage o f creating areas
o f reliable good behaviour and offering discounts, favourable travel facilities and other benefits to members.
The good behaviour depends on those who pay for m em bership being more likely to be responsible and upon
their risking loss o f m embership if they transgress.

   136. At a num ber o f grounds, family areas have been de-segregated in the sense that families drawn from
away supporters have been permitted to share family areas with h om e supporters. I have already indicated
how segregation has tended to worsen hostility between rival fans. It is difficult on ce segregation has been
practised to dispense with it, certainly at a stroke. These joint family areas may prove to be the first step in a
retreat from segregation. If the process can be extended gradually to allowing mem bers o f the visiting club to
share the membership area o f the h om e club, useful progress will have been made. It will be m ade easier if
there is seating rather than standing.

The Disabled
   137. I received evidence from the Royal A ssociation for D isability and Rehabilitation (R A D A R ) and the
Access C om m ittee for England drawing attention to the opportunity which redevelopm ent o f grounds
presents to make better provision for disabled people. Many clubs already make provision for the disabled
but this is by no means universal. Particular attention is needed to the provision o f safe and adequately
spacious viewing areas for wheelchair users, with a seat alongside for a com panion, protected from the
weather, accessible to toilet facilities designed specifically for the disabled, and easily reached from a car park
(with reserved car spaces for Orange Badge holders) by means o f ramps. The needs o f other disabled people -
those who have difficulty walking, the partially sighted, and those with impaired hearing - require special
attention, for exam ple by the provision o f handrails, clear signposts, steps painted in bright colours, and the
use o f electronic scoreboards to supplem ent loudspeaker announcem ents, if these people are to be able to
attend sporting events enjoyably and safely. I endorse the importance attached to these suggestions and I
hope that the com prehensive im provem ents which I am proposing will include careful attention to them.
Clubs should regard them as integral to their planning, not as an optional extra.

Conclusion
   138. I hope in these two chapters I have m ade it clear that the years o f patching up grounds, o f having
periodic disasters and narrowly avoiding many others by m uddling through on a wing and a prayer must be
over. A totally new approach across the whole field o f football requires higher standards both in bricks and
mortar and in human relationships.

                           PART I I - SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS

                                                    CHAPTER 3

                                                TH E FRAM EW ORK

M inimum Standards o f Safety
   139. It is a truism that safety and crowd control are inter-dependent. If a crowd gets out o f control safety
will be in jeopardy. Measures to control the crowd, such as fencing, alm ost always have an impact on safety.
Nevertheless, I shall seek to treat each separately. In this Part I shall deal with management and features o f
the ground affecting safety.

    140. I have already stressed the need for football management to give higher priority to the safety and
well-being o f spectators. Clearly, the cost o f safety measures and im provem ents can more easily be borne or
raised by the successful clubs than by those struggling to keep going. But the safety o f spectators in vited to a
ground cannot be left to depend upon the affluence o f the club. There must be prescribed m inim u m
requirements which have to be fulfilled at any ground if spectators are to be admitted there. The evidence o f
practice pre-Hillsborough and indeed post-Hillsborough, right up to D ecem ber 1989, con vin ces me that the
provisions presently in place, statutory and otherwise, have not been strong enough to enforce that basic level
o f safety.

Legislation for Safety
   141. The principal instruments aim ed at achieving a framework for safety are the Safety o f Sports
Grounds Act 1975 as am ended by the Fire Safety and Safety o f Places o f Sport Act 1987 and the H o m e Office
G uide to Safety at Sports Grounds (Green Guide).

    142. The 1975 Act, as am ended, requires a Safety Certificate to be issued by the local authority in respect
o f designated sports grounds. It is an offence (Section 12(l)(d)) to contravene any term or condition o f the
Certificate. Thus the requirements o f the Certificate are mandatory but what those requirements should be is
in the discretion o f the local authority.

  143. Section 2( 1) o f the 197 5 Act provides:-

  “A safety certificate shall contain such terms and con d itions as the local authority consider necessary or
  expedient to secure reasonable safety at the stadium when it is in use for the specified activity or activities,
  and the terms and conditions may be such as to involve alterations or additions to the stadium .”

  144. Originally, certain obligatory terms had to be inserted in Safety Certificates. Section 2(2) provided:-

   Without prejudice to subsection (1) above, a safety certificate -

    (a) shall specify the m axim u m number o f spectators to be admitted to the stadium;

    (b) may specify the m axim u m number to be admitted to different parts o f it; and

    (c) shall include terms and co n d itio n s:-

        (i) as to the number, size and situation o f entrances to and exits from the stadium or any part o f it
        (including means o f escape in case o f fire or other emergency) and the means o f access to any such
        entrances or exits;

        (ii) requiring those entrances, exits and means o f access to be properly m aintained and kept free
        from obstruction; and

        (iii) as to the number, strength and situation o f any crush barriers.”

   However, when the Fire Safety and Safety o f Places o f Sport Act 1987 extended the application o f the 1975
Act from sports stadia to all sports grounds, there was substituted for section 2(2), by section 19 o f the 1987
Act, a new section 2(2) and a new section 15A giving power to the Secretary o f State by order to lay down what
terms and con d itions a Safety Certificate shall include. N o order has yet been m ade but guidance from the
H o m e Office has recom m ended local authorities to approach their function under section 2( 1) in accordance
with the criteria in the superseded section 2(2). (See H o m e Office Circular 7 1 /1 9 8 7 dated 25 N ovem ber
 1987, A nnex A, paragraph 6.)


                                                        24
•
       145. So. presently, local authorities are not bound to include terms or conditions on any particular aspect
    of safety in the Certificate. In practice, they no doubt follow the H om e Office guidance. They also take
    account o f the Green Guide.

    Green Guide
       146. The latter, however, is by way o f guidance only. It provides as follows:-

      "6. D eviations from individual guidelines are possible w ithout necessarily detracting from the overall
      safety o f the ground. The variety o f type, function and layout o f sports grounds and the inter-relationship
      o f the different parts o f them m eans that a flexible approach should be m aintained to take account o f the
      particular circumstances at individual grounds".

       Such flexibility is obviously highly desirable in relation to som e aspects o f the guidance. But flexibility can
    become degraded. Where a local authority has chosen to incorporate the criteria o f the Green G uide into a
    Safety Certificate there has been scope for considerable deviation from provisions which ought to com m and
    standard adherence. Thus, for exam ple, at Hillsborough where the Safety Certificate required com pliance
    w ith certain Green G uide recom m endations and a departure was shown to have occurred, the defence was
    that the G uide expressly provided for flexibility so that a deviation from its provisions was a matter o f
    legitimate discretion.

       147. In view o f this and evidence I have received suggesting that the Green G uide may not be followed as
    closely as is desirable, I consider that when it is revised it needs to be given more effect. At present there is a
    risk o f slackness developing in the absence o f any mandatory provisions. There would appear to be two
    alternative courses open. It would be possible to make the terms o f the Green G u id e mandatory throughout.
    However, I think that this could be too rigid and in relation to som e peripheral matters impractical. The other
    course is to make som e o f its provisions obligatory inclusions in the Safety Certificate. I prefer this.

       148. There are som e requirements of such crucial importance to safety that it should be mandatory for
    Safety Certificates to specify them. I consider those specified in the original section 2(2) o f the 1975 Act fall
    into this category. Moreover, so far as the original section 2(2)(b) is concerned “sh a ll” should be substituted
    for “may”. This is critical to ensuring that no discrete area becom es overcrowded.

       149. Accordingly, I recommend that the Secretary o f State exercise his specific powers under section 15A
    or his general powers under section 6(2) by order or regulation to achieve this. In specifying the requirements
    in the Certificate, for a particular ground, the local authority should follow the Green G uide criteria; but
    once that is d one and the appropriate figures and terms for that ground have been decided no room should be
    left for flexibility. By the stage w hen the local authority has specified the requirements in the Certificate,
    flexibility has been exhausted.

       150. Where a local authority incorporates any other provision of the Green Guide into the Safety
    Certificate it should make it clear whether that provision is to be complied with absolutely or with
    discretionary flexibility. For example, paragraph 88 o f the Green G uide provides that a ramp subject to
    heavy crowd flow should preferably not exceed a gradient o f 1 in 10. Should a local authority require in a
    Safety Certificate that a club com p ly with a Green G uide recom m endation as to gradients it should make
    clear whether it restricts gradients to a m axim um o f 1 in 10 or whether it leaves flexibility to the discretion o f
    the club.

      151. In putting the responsibility for the Safety Certificate upon the local authority, Parliament no doubt
    had two sound reasons: first, since all sports grounds differ in their layout and environs, local knowledge
    ought sensibly to be utilised in laying down and monitoring terms and conditions; secondly, a local body can
    respond quickly to any problem which m ay arise. Nevertheless, there are two aspects o f such local
    administration which can cause problems,

      (i) The Advisory Group
        152. The issue, review and enforcem ent o f Safety Certificates should be based upon efficient professional
    inspection and op inion and should be conducted in a businesslike manner. In Sheffield, the Safety
    Certificate procedure both for Hillsborough and for Sheffield U n ite d ’s ground at Bramall Lane was
    unsatisfactory as I indicated in paragraphs 150 to 158 o f my Interim Report. I hope that this was exceptional.
    It is important that there should be a safety team consisting of appropriate members of the local authority's own
    staff, representatives of the police, o f the fire and ambulance services and of the building authority. What name
    is given to this group does not in the end matter. At Sheffield it began by being called the Officer Working Party.


                                                             25
When Sheffield City Council took over from South Yorkshire County Council, the name was changed to the
“Safety o f Sports Grounds Advisory' G roup”, or the Advisory Group for short. In my interim
recom m endations (N um ber 17) I said an Advisory Group should be set up. I had in m ind the type o f safety
team already referred to. Apparently, in som e quarters, it was thought that I was suggesting a second body
called an Advisory Group to advise the safety team. This was not so. Also, in that recom m endation, I
suggested that representatives o f the club and o f a recognised supporters’ club should be members o f the
Advisory Group. I have reconsidered this in the light o f evidence and advice received. The responsibility for
the Safety Certificate is exclusively that o f the local authority. I therefore think that the correct course is that
representatives o f the club and o f a recognised supporters’ organisation should be consulted, since they m ay
have relevant suggestions or criticisms to make, but they should not be full m em bers o f the team.

  153. I repeat my recommendation that the Advisory Group’s terms o f reference should encompass all
matters concerned with crowd safety and should require regular visits to the ground and attendance at matches.
There should be a chairman from the local authority, and an effective procedure. Resolutions should be recorded
and regular written reports should be required for consideration by the local authority.

  (ii) A Review Body
   154. The other disadvantage o f Safety Certificates being issued locally is that different standards m ay be
applied by different authorities even in practically identical situations. A safety team, or som e very
influential m em ber o f it, may be m uch stricter in one place than the comparable authority elsewhere. I have
had com plaints that since Hillsborough measures appropriate to a larger ground have been rigidly and
inappropriately enforced at grounds with negligible attendance. Conversely, it is possible that too indulgent
or lax an approach may be adopted or develop in a particular locality. Again, sim ply left to solve their own
problems, there would be little opportunity for local authorities to learn from com parison with solutions
adopted elsewhere. In these circumstances, it has been suggested that there should be a National Forum in
which local authority teams could meet periodically to discuss and com pare their procedures, and that there
should be a national overseeing and inspecting body to m onitor and review the consistent discharge by local
authorities o f their certificating duties. Having discussed this with local authority representatives both in
England and in Scotland I am satisfied that two approaches are not necessary. The better course is to have a
N ational Inspectorate and Review Body. T his is now provided for in the Football Spectators Act 1989 by section
13. It is there laid down that the Football Licensing Authority shall have the function of keeping under review
the discharge by local authorities o f their functions under the 1975 Act. The FLA may, having consulted the
local authority and certain local officers, require terms and con d itions to be included in any Safety
Certificate. The section empowers any inspector appointed by the FLA to make inspections and inquiry as
necessary. The local authority m ay by notice be required to furnish the FLA with information regarding its
discharge o f its 1975 Act functions.

   155. I warmly welcome the appointment of a national body to conduct these inspecting and reviewing
functions. A ssum ing it successfully discharges those functions, the effect should be to improve the efficiency
and consistency o f practice with regard to the issue and review o f Safety Certificates. This would be enhanced
if the review body were to circulate, to all local authorities from tim e to time, advice based upon their
experience o f problems and solutions at various grounds. (See also R ecom m en dation 16 o f the report o f the
Technical Working Party at A ppendix 3).

   156. Because the Football Spectators Act 1989 applies only to association football, the inspecting and
reviewing role o f the FLA would be exercisable only in relation to Safety Certificates at football grounds.
Nevertheless, this remit o f the FLA should be extended to cover all grounds designated under the 1975 Act and
indeed all grounds requiring Safety Certificates or licences under Parts III and IV of the 1987 Act. Should Part
I o f the 1989 Act either not be implemented or be substantially delayed, the sam e functions should be given to
another suitably constituted body to cover all sports grounds.

   157. It has been suggested that the Health and Safety Executive could fulfil this function if necessary or
indeed that it could m onitor spectator safety under the provisions o f the Health and Safety at Work Etc Act
1974. However, its resources would need to be increased. Moreover, until now the Health and Safety
Executive, being primarily concerned with the safety o f em ployees pursuant to the 1974 Act, has not
extended its surveillance to include spectators at football grounds. The H o m e Office evidence on this point is
as follows:

  “The Health and Safety at Work Act could also be used to enforce general spectator safety at sports grounds.
  Section 3 o f the Act is w ide ranging in that it places a duty on an employer to conduct his undertaking in
  such a way as to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that persons not in his em p loym ent w ho m ay be

    "undertaking" would fall within this category. However, it is the stated policy o f the Health and Safety
    C om m ission that, as a general principle, they and the Executive wish to avoid duplication o f enforcement
    with other authorities. The HSE would not therefore generally attempt to enforce the requirements o f
    Section 3 o f the 1974 Act w hen they overlap with duties im posed by other more specific legislation where
    other authorities have responsibility for policy and enforcement. The Safety o f Sports Grounds Act 1975
    represents more specific legislation and the Health and Safety Executive does not enforce Section 3 o f the
    1974 Act to secure the safety o f spectators at sports grounds. This arrangement is agreed between the
    Health and Safety Executive and the H o m e Office.”

                                                   CHAPTER 4

                                        S U B S T A N T IV E P R O V IS IO N S

  158. Having considered the framework for safety provided by the statutory provisions and the Green
Guide, I must now deal with certain key substantive provisions.

Capacity
   159. I accept the Technical Working Party’s statement that “the safe allowable capacity o f any viewing
area whether seated or standing is the least o f (i) its holding capacity, (ii) the number o f persons who can leave
through a normal exit system within a prescribed tim e at the end o f an event, (iii) the n um ber o f persons who
can leave through an emergency exit system within a prescribed tim e and (iv) the num ber o f persons who can
be admitted through the turnstiles serving that area within one hour.” The “prescribed tim e ” for normal exit
is said in paragraph 23 0 o f the G uide to be 8 minutes. The “prescribed tim e” for emergency exit is not
definitively fixed in the G uide as it will vary from area to area. It will need to be determined by the local
authority on advice from the Advisory Group and especially the fire service.

   160. Subject to factors (ii), (iii) and (i v), where there is a properly designed seating area, capacity is simply
determined by the num ber o f seats. Increasingly, therefore, problems o f m axim u m capacity will fade out as
seating is phased in. But, as long as w e have standing areas, grounds will be vulnerable to overcrowding and
m axim u m limits must be set and achieved.

    161. The Green G uide provides in paragraphs 221 and 222 for a m a x im u m density o f 54 persons per 10 sq
metres assuming a terrace or viewing slope in good condition. For som e reason, not easy to understand, the
G u id e also provides the lower figure o f 27 persons per 10 sq metres when the slope or terrace “materially
deviates from the recom m ended guidelines, so as to constitute a possible hazard to individuals closely
packed”. This might be taken to im ply that whatever the hazards there is no need to reduce capacity below
27. In the heading to Chapter 16, the Green G uide em phasises that “account should be taken o f the features
o f the individual ground, its configuration, general condition, use and any deviations from the G u id e’s
provisions.”

   162. It becam e clear from evidence before me at both stages o f this Inquiry that not only was the
m axim u m o f 54 per 10 sq metres grossly exceeded at Hillsborough; insufficient was being d one generally to
ensure either by counting or by informed assessment that the Green G u id e criteria were observed.
Accordingly, I reaffirmed the advice in the G u id e and recom m ended that a reduction o f 15% be m ade as an
interim measure to improve the safety margin. The question now is what should be the final recommendation
on this difficult subject.

   163. I entirely agree with the Technical Working Party that there is no benefit to be gained from retaining
the lower figure o f 27 or any other m in im u m figure. Indeed, it could be a dangerous suggestion. T he scale o f
permissible density should be from 0 up to the maximum figure applicable only in good conditions. I note
the Technical Working Party’s view that “a uniformly distributed density o f 5 .4 /m : should be safe in static
conditions in full compliance with the Green Guide". However, the words in italics are crucial to their view.
It is one thing to place 54 docile people evenly in an area o f 10 sq metres on a terrace and say they should be
safe. It is quite another if they are excited, if they sway or surge to and fro, if one end o f the area is a better
viewing point than the other and if account is taken o f possible incidents in the crowd eg a scuffle or a
firework. Any o f those factors can cause bunching; bunching can quickly b eco m e crushing.

   164. Most clubs have responsibly applied the recom m ended 15% reduction. Som e have jibbed at it:
understandably, in view o f its impact on revenue. On the other hand, as I have already observed, som e Police
C om m anders expressed relief that numbers have been reduced. I must also point out that, even whilst the
reduction has been in force, events have shown how easy it is for crushing to occur.

   165. At the start o f the 1989/90 season, on 19 August, Coventry were at h om e to Everton. There were
com plaints afterwards o f congestion and crushing before the match outside the turnstiles and after the match
as spectators pressed to get out.

  166. Even more worrying was an incident on 9 D ecem ber at A yresome Park when Middlesbrough were at
hom e to Leeds. I have not conducted a full inquiry into the incident having no remit to do so. But I have
received a full report from the police. I have also viewed more than once a video film o f what happened. It
was horribly reminiscent o f Hillsborough.


                                                         28
  167. The following facts are clear. Leeds supporters had been allocated, as a standing area, a wedge-shaped
pen "D" at the south east corner o f the ground. It was flanked by a narrow sterile area on each side. There was
a broad gangway running from top to bottom o f pen “D ”. The perimeter fencing at the front o f the pen was
topped with spikes. There was not a single gate to the pitch. The only way out for those at the front was by a
nate at each side into the sterile area and thence through another gate to the pitch. T h ose gates were closed
during the match. The capacity o f the pen in accordance with my interim recom m endation was 2108. Leeds
supporters were admitted to the pen. families with very young children being put at the front. T he gangway
was not kept clear. Som e Leeds supporters managed to get tickets for the opposite hom e end o f the ground
causing apprehension o f trouble. A number o f them were taken out and m oved into pen “D ” from the pitch
side. Other Leeds fans with tickets for the wrong end were also allowed into pen “D" from the back. Shortly
after the match started, there was distress a m ong those at the front o f the pen. After two surges down part o f
the pen where there were no barriers from front to back, the police had to assist in getting spectators,
especially children, out o f the pen. This was d one principally over the fencing although the side gates were
opened and shut a number o f times. In the event, 14 people had to be treated for m inor injuries in the
ambulance room. Five spectators, three o f them children aged 10. 11 and 12, were taken to hospital with
chest injuries, lacerations and bruising.

   168. The local authority, the police and the club were clearly shocked by this incident and have taken
prompt remedial action. Additional crush barriers are to be installed, additional gates are to be provided
including one for pen D, the capacity o f that pen is to be halved. A dm ission to all parts o f the ground, save the
visitors’ section (pen D). is to be for members only to prevent away supporters buying tickets for the home
end. Finally, there is to be a phased programme which will extend seating to all spectators by 1991/1992.

  169. This incident and its aftermath prompt the query: d oes there have to be a disaster or near-disaster at
each ground to trigger radical action? I hope not.

   170. The permitted capacity o f the pen was exceeded, although it is not clear to what extent. The police
view is that it was only by about 60 persons. In a sense, the smaller the excess the more the point is m ade that
danger can occur very quickly on a standing terrace even with moderate numbers. Som e argue that reducing
numbers and giving spectators more room simply enables a surge to gather greater m om entum ; that the
tighter people are packed together the less the scope for surging or misbehaviour. This was the philosophy
which allowed excessive numbers to be packed into pens prior to Hillsborough. The only sensible conclusion
is that unless both numbers and terrace layouts are strictly controlled, there will always be a risk o f crushing
on a standing terrace. The com b ination o f numbers, excitem ent and partisanship, even leaving aside
misbehaviour, has a potential for danger.

   171. Comparison with criteria adopted abroad is instructive. France and Belgium adopt the G reen G uide
figure o f 5 .4 /n r . But in Holland, the m axim um standing capacity is 4 /n r . In Italy, the rule varies between
municipalities. In Milan the figure is 2 /m :. In R om e it is 4 /m :. But in Italy little difference is recognised in
principle between the figures permissible for standing and those for sitting.

   172. Weighing all these factors I do not think it would be right to recom m end a substantial departure from
the effect o f the 15% interim reduction. Now. rather than take a figure and deduct a percentage from it, what
is required is a specific figure for maximum standing density when terrace conditions are good by Green Guide
criteria. I recommend that that figure should be 47 per 10 sq metres and I would substitute 47 for the figure of
54 in the Green Guide. The effect is approximately a 13% rather than a 15% reduction from the former figure
o f 54. I wish to stress as forcefully as I can. however, that this figure is a maximum and it is for the local
authority acting on the recommendation o f its Advisory Group to make necessary and realistic reductions from
that figure in respect o f any feature of the terrace which deviates significantly from Green Guide criteria or has
any other significant shortcoming.

Counting Them In
   173. It is no use fixing a m axim u m capacity for a pen or enclosure unless there are reliable means o f
ensuring it is not exceeded. I therefore repeat my recommendation that the number o f spectators entering each
self-contained pen or other stand in g area must be lim ited electronically, m echanically, by a tick etin g
arrangement, by counting or otherwise. The best arrangement is one which makes all facilities for a single
viewing area self-contained; access should be through turnstiles solely serving that area via a concourse doing
likewise with its own toilets and refreshment points. This point has already been clearly m ade in paragraphs
101 and 206 o f the Green G u id e:-

  "Each section should ideally be self-contained and should be serviced by its own entrance/exits,
  refreshment facilities and toilets. . .”


                                                          29
  That wav the numbers can be accurately recorded at the turnstiles on entry and no extra spectators can get
into the area from elsewhere at half-time or after visiting com m on toilets or snack-bars.

  174. Arrangements must be made to close off further access to each pen or area when maximum capacity is
about to be reached and to close the turnstiles leading to the relevant area.

Gangways
   175. The Green Guide, in paragraphs 97 to 99, makes recom m endations as to gangways as follows;-

  "Spectators should be discouraged from standing in lateral gangways because this disrupts free m ovem ent
  about the ground (or within sections o f it). Also, spectators on the terrace steps behind the gangway may
  have their view obstructed, which will cause them to stretch and strain, and so generate dangerous
  pressures within the crowd. Spectators would be discouraged from standing in these gangways if they were
  sunk from 100mm to 20 0 m m and if crush barriers were provided behind but not im m ediately in front o f
  them.

    Similarly, spectators should be discouraged from standing in radial gangways. T h ese are relatively long
  and uncontrolled downward paths through terraces, and are difficult to keep clear, especially when sited in
  popular viewing areas, eg behind the goal area at a football ground. It is helpful to sink them 150m m to
  200m m and to interrupt an otherwise continuously descending gangway by turns along, say, lateral
  gangways.

    Where sinking gangways, lateral or radial, is not thought to be practical, their boundaries should be
  highlighted with paint and spectators advised by signs not to stand there. Stewards may be needed to
  enforce this instruction."

   176. In my view these provisions need to be much tougher. I agree with the Technical Working Party that
gangways should be kept clear. There is no point in having them, in calling them gangways and in excluding
them from the area used to calculate capacity under paragraph 221 if spectators are allowed to stand in them.
The w hole point o f crush barriers on terraces is to prevent unrestrained m ovem ent o f large masses o f fans
from back to front down the terrace. It they are allowed to stand in the gangways where there are no barriers,
such m ovem ent can occur without inhibition. The incident at Ayresome Park on 9 D ecem ber 1989 involved
just that. Two surges causing crushing against the fence cam e down the terrace unrestrained by barriers.

   177. W'hilst paragraph 98 o f the G u id e notes the difficulty o f keeping radial gangways clear, it can be done.
One way is to fix a radial rail on each side o f the gangway and parallel to it, inhibiting lateral m ovem en t into
the gangway from the standing areas. Another surprisingly effective m eth od which I saw used successfully by
Millwall is to put red and white tapes in the same position to indicate the gangway as a no-go area for
standing.

  178. Gangways should be painted in a conspicuous colour (yellow is used m ost com m only) whether they are
sunk or not. T he Safety Certificate should require that no standing is allowed in gangways and that they be
painted.

Fencing
   179. Perhaps the most em otive and disputed topic in this field is what should be d one about perimeter
fences. 1 hey were installed at many grounds to prevent pitch invasions during the 1970s. After Hillsborough
there was a strong clamour to take them down. Som e clubs did. Within weeks o f Hillsborough, however, there
were unruly incidents involving pitch invasions at m ore than one ground, as I noted in paragraph 308 o f my
Interim Report. I deferred making any interim recom m endation involving structural alterations at the
interim stage, confining m yself to say ing that gates to the pitch ought to be kept fully open.

   180. Since then, whilst v isiting grounds. I have seen a full range o f practices from one extrem e to the other.
There is no consensus. At som e grounds eg Highbury, there have never been perimeter fences. At others, like
Anfield and White Hart Lane, there were fences but they have been taken down. At other grounds the fences
vary in height and design. Som e are fearsome high structures with florid arrangements o f spikes, redolent o f
medieval weaponry. They look more suited to a prison than a sports ground. C om ing down the scale, there
are high fences with only vertical spikes and lower fences without spikes; fences o f wire m esh and fences o f
strong metal; fences w ith a good provision o f gates directly to the pitch, fences with only on e gate per large
pen (like Hillsborough), and som e with no gate at all (as in pen D at A yresome Park). Again, som e clubs have
left their gates to the pitch fully open as 1 recom m ended. S om e have taken the gates out and left blank spaces;


                                                         30
•
    some have opened the gates but put red and white tape across the gap; others have kept the gates open during
    [he match, but closed them towards its conclusion to stop pitch invasions at the final whistle. Others again
    have kept the gates closed and bolted but m anned individually. At Millwall’s ground, an effective procedure
    is followed before each match whereby it is announced over the public address system that stewards will
    demonstrate the gates affording escape to the pitch. The stewards then do so in the manner o f an air
    stewardess demonstrating emergency procedures. T he gates are then closed to, but not locked.

       181. This wide variety o f practices is surprising. If a club were concerned only with its own supporters,
    div ergence o f practice would be readily understandable. Club A might say: “Our supporters can be trusted
    not to invade the pitch; so no fencing”. Club B might say: “S om e o f our supporters have shown that given the
    chance they will invade the pitch, so we m ust have high fences to stop th e m ”. But all the clubs in any division,
    including clubs o f type A and B, visit each other; so one has fans o f club B, used to being caged in at home,
    being given the chance when visiting club A to invade the pitch. They do not seem to make a point o f doing so
    with any frequency. However instances do occur, as I have m entioned; they are unpredictable and may
    happen at any time depending probably upon the occurrence o f som e incident thought to be provocative.
    When they occur, they can cause serious danger. There is risk o f injury to players, to the referee and to the
    police, quite apart from the risk o f injury through fighting between fans. It is true, as is often said, that so far
    no fatality has resulted from a pitch in vasion, whereas 95 people died against a fence installed to prevent such
    invasion. But if fighting between fans starts on the pitch area, it is difficult to stop and injuries can be caused.
    At Selhurst Park on 13 May 1989, five police officers and 16 supporters required hospital treatment.

       182. Since each club in a League division has to cope during the season with at least som e o f the
    supporters o f all the other clubs in the division, the widely differing solutions to the fencing problem must be
    due to different attitudes rather than objectively different needs, The different attitudes taken by clubs or
    local authorities stem from the difficulty in balancing or deciding the priority o f three crucial considerations:

        i.    Fences, especially high, spiked fences, are intimidating, ugly and demoralising.

        ii.   Adequate measures must be taken to prevent pitch invasions for the reasons already given.

        iii. Whatever the measures taken to prevent pitch invasions, there must be adequate provision for
             escape in emergencies.

       183. At som e grounds, point ii. has been regarded as paramount so that i. has had to give way. At others,
    either point i. or, especially after Hillsborough, point iii. have carried greatest weight so as to remove or
    greatly reduce the fencing.

       184. Is there any way o f achieving a satisfactory balance o f all three considerations? I believe so: that it is
    possible to have sufficient obstacles to pitch invasion without prison-type fences and also to provide for
    escape in emergency. I deal with the three considerations in turn.

      i. High Spiked Fences
      185. I agree with the view that high, prison-type fences with spikes and overhanging sections should go. The
    spectacle o f these huge cage-like fences is inconsistent with a sports ground being for pleasure and recreation.
    Moreover, I believe such intimidatory' fences have an adverse affect on both the morale and the behaviour o f
    fans. They feel badly treated. Having to stand in a cage for your Saturday afternoon recreation inevitably
    causes resentment. Resentment often results in hostility to those controlling the match. A sour relationship
    develops and continues between the fans and those in authority, m aking the job o f police and stewards much
    more difficult. Being inside the cage provokes som e to hurl abuse or m issiles at those outside, rival fans,
    players or police. T he security o f the fencing (in that the rival fans cannot penetrate it) encourages bravado to
    indulge in such activity. The spiked fences imply an expectation that trouble will or may occur. They also
    hamper a clear view o f the gam e. To remove them would signal the advent o f a new future for football and
    especially a new attitude from the authorities to the spectators. Accordingly, I consider that when perimeter
    fencing is used it should not exceed a prescribed m axim u m height and all spike arrangements and top
    sections angled inwards should go. This view is in accord with the recom m endation o f the Technical Working
    Party (Appendix 3 paragraph 20). But what should be the prescribed m axim u m height? That leads to
    consideration ii.




                                                              31
  ii. Adequate M easures to Prevent Pitch Invasions
   186. UEFA regulation B6 o f 1988 requires as follows:-

  "Protection o f the playing field by m eans o f

  (a)    a fence o f at least 2.2 metres in height or a m oat or else

  (b)   a barrier with adequate policing so as to make it im possible for spectators to enter the field o f play.

  Fences must have sufficient security gates opening towards the playing field and in the case o f m oats or a
com bination o f m oats and fences adequate other security passages should be provided” .

   187. Inquiries show that the figure o f 2.2 metres was chosen sim ply by reference to the height o f existing
fencing at various grounds especially in West G erm any and the need to ch oose a height o f fence which would
am ount to “a real obstruction” to pitch invasion. As to the word “im p ossib le” similar inquiries suggest that
the intention was to leave it to the police com m and er to decide what resources he might need. Should a pitch
invasion occur, UEFA would consider all the circumstances before deciding what if any action to take.

   188. In my view a fence should be o f sufficient height to be a serious obstacle to pitch invasion. It should
provide sufficient obstruction to enable the police to take timely action should pitch invasion be attempted
without being so high as seriously to interfere with vision or to give a feeling o f im prisonm ent. Although I
appreciate the UEFA regulation says “at least 2.2 metres”, these criteria lead me to recommend that
perimeter fencing should be no higher than 2.2 metres. That measurement I take from ground level at the
front o f the terrace to the top o f the fencing ie the 2.2 metres may consist entirely o f fencing or partly o f wall
and partly o f fencing mounted on the wall. For example, at Ibrox Park the fencing is about 1.45 metres high
but it is m ounted on a wall and the total height o f wall and fence is 2.2 metres.

   189. In making this recom m endation I am merely indicating a m a xim u m height should perimeter fencing
be used. I do not suggest there must be such fencing or indeed any fencing. Those clubs which presently have
no perimeter fencing may well think it safe to continue that way. Others m ay em ulate them. Still more may
consider that they can dispense with fencing or bring it to a lower level than 2.2 metres in front o f their family
areas or their seated areas. As the seating areas increase it should progressively be found possible to achieve a
corresponding reduction in fencing. These options, subject to the m axim u m height o f 2.2 metres which I
have indicated, should be left to the discretion o f local authorities acting on the advice o f their A dvisory
Group which will have consulted the club and supporters.

  190. I should make clear that I have thus far referred only to perimeter fencing at the pitch side o f viewing
areas. Different considerations may well apply to the height o f radial fencing used to segregate rival fans. The
m axim u m height o f such fences should be a matter for local decision and m ay depend for exam ple on
whether there are sterile areas between pens o f rival fans; but I still recommend that no spikes be used.

   191. S om e may feel I am being naive or over-optimistic in recom m ending that fencing be brought down to
a lower level. Hooligans may take advantage o f this relaxation to have, literally, a field day. However, I draw
attention to those grounds where fences have already been brought down to or below the level I recom m end
and others where there are none at all. If we wish to make progress, som e initiative m ust surely be taken to
stop the cycle o f bad behaviour met with repression inducing worse behaviour.

   192. Besides, there are other ways o f deterring pitch invasions than by dauntingly fortified fences. O ne is
to balance the lowering o f the fences with a prohibition against going on to the pitch without reasonable
excuse. I shall deal with that in the next chapter. The other is by alternative physical means.

Safety Corridors
   193. O ne m ethod has been adopted, so far successfully, at Anfield, G o o d iso n Park and W hite Hart Lane.
It involves reserving a safety corridor or dry moat between the front row o f standing spectators and a
perimeter fence or wall o f moderate proportions. The two photographs A ppendix 6 illustrate the Liverpool
and Everton versions o f it. The front few steps o f the terrace are sacrificed as a viewing area and left as a
sterile strip. Behind that area, the front row o f crush barriers is filled in and m ade con tinu ous with no gaps.
The Everton version has no fence above the perimeter wall. At A nfield there is a low red rail fence. That
arrangement does not absolutely prevent pitch invasion, but it inhibits it. Moreover, anyone or any group
m ind ed to get to the pitch has first to get over the front crush barrier, then cross the corridor, then get up the
steps or over the wall onto the perimeter track. At W hite Hart Lane there is finally a line o f advertising
hoardings to be scaled. By that tim e the police should be able to intervene. At high-risk m atches no doubt
police could patrol the sterile area.


                                                           32
Moats
    194. The safety corridor at these three grounds is not truly a dry moat. But I have seen exam ples both in
Holland and Italy o f a concrete dry moat providing a total obstacle to pitch invasion. At Utrecht, there is a
deep broad moat; provision is m ade to enable spectators to descend into the m oat and use it as a passageway
for entrance and exit. A photograph is at Appendix 7. At the San Siro stadium in Milan, there is a similar
moat at one side o f the ground which will be extended all round. At present there is no provision for access to
it or across it to the pitch but I was told in R om e that access to the pitch by bridges will have to be provided to
accord with the Italian regulations.

   195. To interpose a full scale moat o f the Utrecht or Milan type between the spectators and the pitch
requires considerable space. It is easier to provide it as an integral part o f the design o f a new stadium than to
introduce it as a m odification o f an old one. At most U K grounds the space between pitch and spectators is
very limited and to introduce a moat would involve a large loss o f viewing area. Nevertheless, it is a solution
worthy o f consideration and especially so for a new stadium. Its advantage is that it effectively prevents pitch
invasion without im peding vision or im porting a prison atmosphere. A few rows back from it, you are not
even aware o f its existence. Its disadvantage, apart from the space it requires, is the difficulty o f com b ining it
with access to the pitch in emergencies.

  iii Emergency Escape
   196. Hillsborough showed conclusively that, if there are to be perimeter fences, there must be sufficient
gates to permit escape to the pitch and they must be im m ediately available in an emergency. That lesson was
reaffirmed by the recent incident at A yresome Park. I know there is a school o f thought opposed to access to
the pitch in any circumstances, preferring that alternative evacuation routes should all be away from the
pitch. Thus, at som e grounds (Hillsborough was one) emergency plans did not require gates to the pitch or
take any such existing gates into account in calculating the time required for alternative routes o f evacuation.
At Hillsborough, evacuation was to be via the central tunnel, or alternatively through the radial gates at the
back o f the terrace and round the ends o f the west stand. But, if the emergency arises at the front o f the
terraces (as it did) those alternative routes cannot and did not afford timely relief. Presently, although
emergency access to the pitch could readily be gained at both Anfield and G o o d iso n Park, the plans do not
rely on emergency evacuation in that direction. The tragic Bradford City disaster, in which fire swiftly
engulfed a stand, would have caused much greater loss o f life had there not been ready access to the pitch. It
can no doubt be argued that inflammable stands with neglected underspaces should not recur, that with
modern stands constructed o f non-inflam m able materials there should be no risk o f another Bradford, and
that if capacities and safety measures are observed no Hillsborough situation should recur. The solemn fact is
that those two disasters did occur. One cannot predict what emergency may arise to make evacuation away
from the pitch either wholly impractical or too slow.

  197. The UEFA regulation cited above recognises that where there are fences access to the pitch should be
preserved. I agree with that view and recommend that emergency access to the pitch should be provided.

   198. How should this be done? There is no significant problem where there are either no fences or none
higher than crush barrier level. At Anfield or G ood ison Park, for example, it would not be difficult to get over
the front crush barrier into the “dry m oat” and thence to the pitch. That arrangement could be m odified to
include radial gangways at intervals running straight down to the “dry m o a t” through gaps in the front
barrier. This would give even readier access. It must be for local judgem ent to balance the need for ready
access to the pitch in emergencies with the need to deter such access otherwise.

   199. The more difficult problem arises at grounds where fences o f up to 2.2 metres are deem ed necessary.
In such fences there must, in my view, be sufficient gates not less than 1.1 metre in width as approved by the
Green Guide. It is no use seeking to specify how many gates will be required by reference to the length o f
fencing at the front o f a given pen or other enclosure. The length o f the frontage is only o ne factor. Much will
depend on the depth o f the terrace and the numbers it is permitted to hold. I prefer, in concurrence with the
Technical Working Party (Appendix 3 paragraph 22) to say that the gates should be sufficient in number to
enable the pen or other enclosure to be evacuated in the time required for any other emergency evacuation route.
Such gates should be evenly spaced along the frontage of the pen to avoid congestion on exit.

The Gates at N im es
   200. One solution to this problem is the system installed in the new stadium at N im es which I visited
together with the Assessors. There, the fence consists o f a number o f electrically operated panels which open
as gates to the pitch, as shown in A ppendix 8. There are six sections o f the ground. T he fencing in each section
is governed by a trigger gate which may be operated electrically or manually. The post upon which it is


                                                          33
m ounted has an electro-magnet which holds the m echanism inside the post in a position keeping the gate
shut. W hen a button is pressed, the magnet is de-activated. the gate descends in its m ounting and is free to
swing towards the pitch. As it does so, it releases the next gate which is also m ounted on a sw ivelling device
within its post, operating by gravity to open the gate. This d o m in o effect continues throughout the section. It
can be arrested by som eon e leaning against one o f the gates from the pitch side but how far anyone there
could withstand substantial crowd pressure is doubtful. The trigger gate can be operated manually but this
seem ed to require considerable force. To shut the gate again seem ed to require considerable force and a lifting
m otion. T he gates are about nine inches higher than the front floor o f the terrace, but there is no sump such as
often exists in grounds in the UK. The system could be adapted to U K grounds but there are a num ber o f
factors upon which greater reassurance might be required. If the gates were fixed on top o f a low wall such as
that at Leppings Lane, there would be a danger o f crushing in the sump or at least o f broken limbs as people
tried to get out. The system has been in operation at N im es for only a few m onths and has not been severely
tested to show that it would be effective under crowd pressure. Although a firm is licensed to market the
system in 34 countries worldwide, our information is that so far they have been fitted only at N im es and
Toulon although one or two other French clubs are interested. In these circum stances the robustness o f the
fencing and the effects o f English weather upon it are as yet unproved. At N im es the system operates with a
level walkway on the spectators’ side o f the fencing. Apart from a very small step, the pitch is at the same
level. To achieve this arrangement would require considerable alteration to the layout o f many U K grounds
in volving in particular raising the lower part o f terraces to make them level with the pitch and with the
bottom o f the fencing.

Gates Unlocked
   201. I m ade an interim recom m endation to leave gates fully open when the pen or enclosure was
occupied. This was for three stated reasons; first, to afford instant access to the pitch; secondly, to provide
visual reassurance to fans after Hillsborough that there was an escape route and thirdly, to keep police and
stewards alert to conditions inside the gateway. I also had in m ind that the numbers and size o f gates might at
som e grounds be inadequate and I was not making any recom m endation for structural change at that stage.
Along with reduced capacities, provision o f sufficient gates and lower fences, I must now consider whether to
keep or m odify my recom m endation to leave gates fully open. I know that som e Police C om m anders have
been anxious that to do so is an invitation to pitch invasion; hence the practice at som e grounds o f closing the
gates near the end o f the game or keeping them shut but not locked. I would still hope that gates would be left
fully open wherever those in command feel this can safely be done. However, I recommend that whether they be
fully open, partially open or closed they be kept unlocked throughout the period when the pen or enclosure is
occupied. They should thus be easily available for emergency exits and spectators should be confident o f this.

   202. I repeat my interim recommendation that all gates in radial and perimeter fences o f pens or other
self-contained areas should be painted in a different colour from the rest of the fences and marked “Emergency
E xit”.

Authorising A ccess to the Pitch
  203. Interim recom m endation number 9 provided as follows:-

  “ * 9. There should be in respect o f each gate in a perimeter fence (or group o f gates if they are close
  together) a police officer authorised to decide whether or not to allow spectators through a gate to relieve
  overcrow din g. . .”

    Despite the much greater alertness to the possibility o f an emergency which now exists, following
Hillsborough, I still believe it necessary to make a recom m endation to ensure that proper provision is m ade
for swift action to authorise the opening o f gates in the event o f an emergency. However, it has been drawn to
my attention that strict observance o f this interim recom m endation verges on the absurd where a pen
contains only a handful o f spectators. Moreover, to be bound to provide a police officer at each gate or group
o f gates in all circumstances involves a heavy com m itm en t o f police m anpower which would be even heavier
with an increase in the num ber o f gates. Accordingly, I have decided to recommend that although each gate
should be manned when the enclosure is occupied, whether such manning should be by a police officer or by a
steward is for the Police Commander to decide. In either event plans should ensure that the police can authorise
access through gates to the pitch immediately in the event o f an emergency.

M onitoring Crowd D ensity
  204. It is convenient to m ention a m odification I think sensible regarding interim recom m endation 5.
That provided:-


                                                        34
   • * 5. At each match, there should be on the perimeter track, for each self-contained pen or other terraced
  area, a steward ( if the club is monitoring that area) or a police officer (if the police are m onitoring it) w hose
  sole duty is to check crowd conditions in that area for possible overcrowding or distress throughout the
  period the area is occupied by spectators. W hoever is so appointed should be in addition to any other
  steward or police presence. H e should have ready access to the police officer authorised under
  Recom m endation 9 below, and by radio to the control room .”

   I repeat that recommendation (with a slight change o f wording to achieve clarity) but qualify it to avoid
absurdity when numbers are sm all. The recommendation need not be applied to any self-contained pen or other
standing area where the spectators present, or reasonably to be expected, during a particular match do not
exceed one third of the area’s maximum permitted capacity, or 2,000, w hichever is the lower.

Cutting Equipment
  205. In the im m ediate aftermath o f Hillsborough, I recom m ended that suitable and sufficient cutting
equipment should be provided to enable spectators to be released from behind perimeter fencing. A ssum ing
the recom m ended m axim u m capacities are observed, that fences are lowered, that sufficient gates are
provided and left unlocked, cutting equipm ent should not be necessary. Som ething in these provisions would
have to go badly wrong for such equipm ent to be required. Nevertheless, I recommend that the equipment
should be maintained in case of some unforeseen emergency.

Functions o f Police and Stewards
   206. Which functions should be discharged by the police and which by the club’s stewards is one o f the
most vexed questions. To describe the background to the argument I can do no better than repeat what 1 said
in my Interim Report at pages 28 and 29.

  “Who should M onitor the Terraces?

   161. Should it be the host club via its stewards? Should it be both? Or should it be by arrangement,
 depending upon the ground or section o f the ground in question?

   162. In principle, a football club which invites the public to a match on its premises for reward is
 responsible for securing safety at that event. The Green G uide (1986) provides:


   “23. The safety o f the public inside the ground is the responsibility o f those who stage the event and
   administer the ground in which it is held, ie the “m anagem ent”. This responsibility applies in both
   normal and emergency s it u a tio n s . . .

    195. . . . there are five basic duties which stewards are called upon to carry out. T hese are:

        (a) controlling or directing members o f the public w ho are entering or leaving the ground, to help
        achieve an even flow o f people to the viewing areas and safe dispersal o f spectators on the terraces or
        viewing slopes;

        (b) patrolling the ground to deal with any emergencies, eg raising alarms or extinguishing fires:

        (c) m anning entrances, exits and other strategic points, especially exit doors and gates which are
        continuously open whilst the ground is in use;

        (d) assisting police as appropriate or as requested with crowd control; and

        (e) undertaking specific duties in an emergency.”

 The Interim Popplewell Report
    163. There was considerable controversy in the course o f the public inquiry held by Mr Justice
 Popplewell in 1985 as to the responsibility o f the club and the police. In paragraph 3.6 o f his interim report.
 Mr Justice Popplewell quoted from a report produced for the Minister o f H ousing and Local Governm ent
 in 1969 as follows:-

   “The responsibility for controlling crowd behaviour is d ivid ed between the police and the club operating
 the ground. T he broad line o f d ivision being that police are responsible for m ovem en t o f spectators in
 public thoroughfares and from public thoroughfares into the ground, while the club is responsible for the
 control o f spectators once they are on the club’s p r e m is e s . . .”


                                                         35
•
      Mr Justice Popplewell said he did not quarrel with that view and went on to observe that in practice the
      police have to take charge and be responsible for controlling crowd behaviour. He then said (paragraph
      3.8):

        “It follows, therefore, that as a matter o f practice, while the physical safety o f the building and the
        m aintenance and good housekeeping o f the ground must always be the responsibility o f the club, the
        police have to take the de facto responsibility o f organising the crowd, with all that entails, during the
        gam e...”

      Mr Justice Popplewell went on to instance evacuation o f the ground as a procedure in which only the police
      could bear the responsibility o f supervising the organisation o f the crowd.

      The Final Popplewell Report
          164. He harked back to this subject in chapter 4 o f his Final Report. There, he cam e down more firmly
      in favour o f holding the club responsible for crowd safety. At paragraph 4.13 he said “Because, as a matter
      o f practice, police officers have regularly attended in large numbers at football grounds, it has som ehow
      been assumed by the clubs that the responsibility for control o f what goes on inside the ground has passed
      from them to the police. A police presence is there to assist in the enforcem ent o f law and order. Those
      responsible for organising a private function, however, have the primary and continuing obligation and
      responsibility to ensure reasonable safety for those w ho are invited on to their prem ises.” Mr Justice
      Popplewell ended that section as follows: “It cannot be too strongly em phasised that it is upon the club, or
      the occupier o f the ground who is putting on the function, that the primary and continuing obligation
      rests.”

         165. There remains, however, the question whether there are som e grounds or parts o f grounds where
      the club may need to rely upon the police (whom they pay to attend) to control filling o f pens and
      m onitoring them for overcrowding. In other words, whilst the duty in law to ensure safety rests upon the
      club, they may need, and by agreement be entitled, to em p loy the police to act as their agents in certain
      circumstances. This very difficult and grey area as to club and police responsibility will need to be reviewed
      in greater depth at stage two o f this Inquiry.”

      Since Hillsborough was concerned with a disaster on the terraces, 1 headed that passage “Who should
    m onitor the terraces?”. But the wider question is: who should control the entry o f spectators, their placing
    and m ovem ent whilst in the ground and their exit from it? It is undisputed that the club, as a matter o f law,
    has a duty to take reasonable care for the safety o f the spectators invited to its premises. There have, however,
    been two practical difficulties about the club, rather than the police, being de facto in charge.

       207. First, the club discharges its duty through stewards. They are part-time em ployees or assistants whose
    duties are confined to match days. Many o f them are seasoned supporters o f the club and som e tend to be
    elderly: others are keen young supporters. D u e either to age or youth, many therefore lack the physique to
    cope with awkward customers. They are usually not well paid, part o f their “rem uneration” (indeed all o f it at
    som e clubs) consisting o f the opportunity to see the game. As the subm ission from the A ssociation o f C hief
    Police Officers o f England. Wales and Northern Ireland (ACPO) puts it:

      “(Stewards) are at best casual workers (usually working on e day in two weeks), they are probably not people
      who have a supervisory role in ordinary' life and are not always equipped or used to giving directions or
      facing obstruction. Many are retired people and pay is not so attractive as to guarantee co m m itm e n t.”

      Whilst there are exceptions. I have frequently been told that the stewards presently em ployed at many
    clubs are o f limited capacity and reliability.

      208. Secondly, there has to be a police presence at a match to maintain law and order. Police are trained to
    give and enforce instructions. This, together with the uniform they wear and the respect for and fear o f the
    law which the majority o f spectators have, gives the police far more authority than stewards. Moreover, if
    trouble arises, whether from m isbehaviour or from any other cause, the police will inevitably be drawn into
    assum ing control. They have all the means to do so at their disposal - the control room , the CCTV, the
    planned deployment o f serials o f officers round the ground, a co m m un ication s system to co-ordinate them
    and reserves on call. The subm ission from A CPO suggests that in these circumstances, and to avoid
    confusion, the police ought to accept prime responsibility for controlling the crowd. 1 quote two passages
    from their argument:


                                                            36
•
      "It may be that the ambiguous position o f the police is part o f the problem - that is acknowledging the
      club's responsibility for safety on the one hand, whilst routinely assum ing all those tasks o f stewarding
      which the stewards cannot do. either because o f the truculence o f supporters or the limited talents o f the
      stewards themselves, on the other. It has to be said that the present lack o f clarity in these arrangements can
      lead to som ething o f a ‘d og’s dinner’. In som e clubs the police actively control the stewards, in others the
      stewards are quite independent and. despite som e im provements, standards o f stewarding vary
      considerably w ith many being too old o rsim p ly unreliable...

        ... It may be better to acknowledge that if trouble is anticipated or if crowd control is going to test the
      ground capacities then, in the interests o f public safety, police should take control over the stewards
      through their supervisory ch ain”.

        "As to the question o f ‘responsibility’, the matter o f civil liability should not cause us to resile from our
      decisions if they are necessary. Dual responsibility for safety is a recipe for confusion. The police are always
      going to seize the initiative in a crisis; crowd control is always going to be inextricably linked to criminal
      hooliganism: the police are never going to accept direction from stewards; stewarding will never (at least
      not in the foreseeable future) be able to cope without som e law enforcem ent backup; and finally police do
       own’ most o f the means o f control. In these circumstances the police must accept a leading role and.
      despite the requirements and civil liabilities o f football clubs, them selves take on supervision o f the overall
      conduct o f events wherever crowd safety is an issue.”

       209. The question is one o f balance. Carry ing delegation to its ultimate, clubs could lean back and leave it
    to the police to take over the management o f spectators from street to terraces and back again, with stewards
    performing a m inim al role. This w ould involve a very heavy police com m itm e n t and indeed the
    com m itment at present is very substantial. As already indicated, som e 5 ,000 officers or more are deployed
    every Saturday at football matches.

    C osts o f Police and Stewards
       210. The tem ptation to the clubs to leave it all to the police is stronger if they are not required to make
    realistic payment for police services. N o charge is made for officers outside the ground since m aintaining law'
    and order in the streets is a normal public function o f the police. At the present time, the practice as to
    recovering costs o f policing inside the grounds from clubs varies greatly from place to place, different
    formulae being used. In som e areas, the charge made is the actual cost o f the officers attending in the ground.
    At others, it is made on a sliding scale dependent on whether the match is category A (high-risk) B or C. At
    others it is dependent on the size o f the crowd attending. At som e, it appears to be entirely arbitrary and at
    one ground it is said to be nil. In my view a more consistent and businesslike approach should be made to such
    charges. If clubs were to find it more econom ical to recruit efficient stewards than to delegate duties to the
    police, there could be a significant reduction in the num ber o f police deployed at football grounds to the
    benefit o f the com m un ity at large. If this is to happen, stewards must be fit, active and robust. I would suggest
    they should be between the ages o f 18 and 55. They must also be fully trained. S om e clubs presently have
    efficient stewards w hom they recruit individually and train fully with the assistance o f the police. Others hire
    security firms to bring in a well-trained team o f stewards.

    Division of Functions
      211. There are clearly many aspects o f crowd control and management which are capable o f being carried
    out by efficient stewards. Manning gates, directing spectators to the correct areas and to their seats, keeping
    gangways clear, monitoring the density o f packing in pens or enclosures - indeed, the duties specified in
    paragraph 195 o f the Green Guide, as already quoted. At most grounds, and in m ost parts o f each ground,
    these duties ought to be capable o f being performed by properly trained stewards. Where that is so. clubs
    should require stewards to perform the duties and should not take the option o f leaving all to the police.

      212. However, 1 accept that there may well be particular areas o f a ground, perhaps on visitors’ terraces
    and particularly at high-risk matches, which call for the greater authority and resilience o f the police. What
    the division o f functions should be must be a matter for local decision and in the last resort for the Police
    Comm ander to determine.

    Written Statem ent o f Intent
      213. I therefore repeat my recommendation that there should be a written document setting out the
    respective functions o f club and police for crowd safety and control “and in particular for the filling o f each
    self-contained pen or other terraced area and the monitoring of spectators in each such pen or area to avoid


                                                             37
overcrowding.” (Interim recom m endation 4). The aim should be for the club through its stewards to perform
all those functions o f controlling spectators o f which they are capable having regard to the quality o f the
stewards, the layout o f the ground and the nature o f the match. Where they are not able to discharge any such
function the police should perform it. As the proportion o f seating at grounds increases, control by stewards
should becom e the norm.


  214. In making interim recom m endation 4, I used the phrase “written agreement”. This led to anxiety
that what was required was a binding legal contract which would deprive the police o f any flexibility in
response to circumstances o f the day. My intention was not to shackle either party by a binding contract; it
was simply to have a docum ent setting out how functions were to be d ivid ed so that no m isunderstanding
could arise whereby on e party thought the other had undertaken som e duty and vice versa. I am content that
the document be referred to simply as a “statement of intent”, so that it can be subject to alteration without
breach o f contract should circumstances so demand.


Police Commanders
   215. The ultimate control at any match must be that o f the Police C ommander. H e has authority to decide
how many officers he needs and to deploy them in and outside the ground. H e has, if necessary, to take such
decisions as to postpone kick-off, to stop the match, to evacuate the ground or any area o f it. Police
C om m anders tend to remain in post for lengthy periods. They thus acquire skill, experience and special
knowledge o f the problems at their particular ground. However, there must co m e a tim e for change. It is then
essential for the new C om m and er to have adequate tim e and training to acquaint h im self with his functions
and the problems o f policing peculiar to the ground. Training for such functions should be the subject of a
specific course to be attended by senior officers presently acting as Police Commanders and those in line to do
so. Such a course would give induction training in the basic strategy of policing football matches and would also
give opportunity for the pooling o f experience and the solution o f co m m o n problems.


Rate of Admission
   216. An important causative factor at Hillsborough was the congestion which built up outside the
turnstiles in the last 20 m inutes before kick-off. Twenty-three turnstiles were required to adm it 24,256
spectators; only seven turnstiles were available to admit the 10,100 with tickets for the west terraces. Much
was m ade in evidence o f the late arrival o f the Liverpool fans. However, further evidence at stage two o f the
Inquiry suggests that the late arrival o f large numbers is a co m m o n feature at many grounds. Apart from
those wishing to drink as long as possible (whom I consider in chapter 6) there are many who do not care to
stand or even sit for a long period in addition to the 90 m inutes o f the match. Moreover, at all-ticket matches
or to those with tickets in seated areas, there seem s little reason to arrive early since places are assured. The
absence o f any attractive pre-match entertainment is a further disincentive to early arrival. Whilst measures
should be taken to encourage earlier entry to the ground, it is essential that turnstiles or other entrances can
cope safely and efficiently with spectators as and when they arrive. To do this requires sufficient turnstiles or
other entrances to admit, if necessary, a large late influx w ithout dangerous congestion. That involves
assessing the rate o f flow through turnstiles or gates and the tim e within which they should be capable o f
admitting all the spectators they are intended to serve.


   217. 1 accept the view o f the Technical Working Party that the Green G u id e figure o f 750 persons per hour
is too optim istic a turnstile flow-rate. It m ay be achieved or even bettered in ideal conditions. But as soon as
there is a build-up, the flow-rate will diminish. There are also delays caused by those with no tickets, those
with wrong tickets or other problems. I accept the recommendation that 660 should be the maximum notional
rate. The Green Guide should be amended accordingly.


  218. I repeat my interim recommendation that the turnstiles serving a discrete area should be capable of
admitting its holding capacity within one hour. U nless this can be done, there will be a risk o f serious
congestion in the last half or quarter o f an hour. I f it cannot be done, the permitted capacity of the area must be
reduced accordingly. This recommendation relates to one of the crucial matters contained in the original section
2(2)(c)(i) of the 1975 Act and should therefore be a requirement of the Safety Certificate.


Communications
  219. The efficient d eploym ent and co-ordination o f police and stewards depend upon effective systems o f
com m unication. Radio systems are susceptible to two problems; excessive air traffic on the channels in use
and the volum e o f noise from the crowd.


                                                         38
•
       220. If large numbers o f officers are issued with radios and are all entitled to use the same channel,
    confusion may result should a major incident occur. In such an event, many officers m ay wish to speak
    simultaneously. Especially if the channel is used on “talk-through" (whereby all officers including those in
    control give and receive messages without priority) the C om m ander in the police room may be unable
    effectively to issue orders. Again, if the level o f crowd noise is high, as it often is, an officer on the perimeter
    track may have great difficulty in hearing messages. Although ear pieces are o f som e assistance, they are not
    totally successful in excluding crowd noise and are not usually issued to every officer carrying a radio.

      221. Mr Justice Popplewell in his Interim Report recom m ended that “early attention should be given by
    the H om e Office Directorate o f Telecom m unications to consider the practicality o f producing a more
    suitable personal radio for the police”. In his Final Report, he returned to the subject at paragraphs
    4.102-104. By that time, he reported that “a detailed study is being com m ission ed by the H om e Office
    Directorate o f Telecom m unications into the problem o f personal radios”.

      222. The Directorate produced an upgraded specification. As a result, supplies o f two new m odels have
    been made available. They are the Philips P F X and the Motorola M T 600E . These radios have greater range
    and clarity than those previously used. They also give access to many more channels. To take advantage o f
    this, the police have been allocated eight additional U H F frequencies.

       223. Police Com m anders have told m e that, in addition to any other channel or channels in use, there
    should always be a command channel reserved solely for the Police Commander to communicate with his senior
    officers round the ground. This is o f the first importance since it enables the C om m ander to use the
    information com ing to him in the control room to deploy his forces promptly and effectively at any part o f
    the ground without radio interruption. I recommend this should be done.

      224. As suggested by the Technical Working Party, I repeat the recommendations I made in my Interim
    Report as to communications, with one exception. A sentence in o n e recom m endation suggested that
    "consideration should also be given to the use by police officers o f a sim ple cod e o f hand signals to indicate to
    the control room the existence o f certain emergencies or requirements.” I am persuaded by evidence from the
    police that the use of hand signals could create a risk of confusion and I do not therefore repeat that suggestion.

    Other Topics in the Green Guide
      225. 1 have in this chapter considered specifically a number o f key safety factors covered by the Green
    Guide. I have suggested respects in which the G uide should be strengthened or am ended. In addition to those
    topics, the Technical W orking Party considered a number of further aspects of safety - crush barriers, stands,
    ingress and egress, stairways and ramps, inspections and testing, fire safety, emergency power and disabled
    spectators. I accept and adopt the Technical W orking P arty’s Report and recommendations on those matters
    (Appendix 3). Without repeating them in this text, I add only a few additional com m ents.

      226. As to crush barriers, paragraphs 25 to 28 o f their report recom m end a simpler and clearer test
    procedure than that in the current Guide. In particular, the values to be achieved by way of percentage recovery
    after the required loading test w ill depend upon the material from which the barrier is constructed eg concrete,
    steel or wrought iron. W hen the Guide is revised, acceptable values for various materials should be specified.

      227. The Green G uide does, in paragraph 6 o f Annex C, refer to the possibility o f doubts arising as to the
    safety o f a barrier “for any reason (including such matters as cracking o f the terracing or distortion o f
    connections)". It does not, however, presently make any special m en tion o f the need to inspect crush barriers
    for possible corrosion. The evidence from the Health and Safety Executive after their in spection o f barriers
    at Hillsborough suggests that corrosion is a serious threat to the safety o f metal barriers. W hen the Green
    Guide is revised, the need to inspect for possible corrosion should be specifically mentioned and emphasised.

    Co-ordination of Emergency Services
      228. It is vital that adequate provision should be m ade for possible emergencies arising from fire or
    accident and from illness or injuries however caused. I repeat the recommendations I made in my Interim
    Report regarding co-ordination of the emergency services. In addition, although it is m en tion ed in paragraph
    176 o f the Green Guide, 1 em phasise that “join t consultation between m anagement, police, fire, ambulance
    and other emergency services should take place in order to produce agreed plans o f action for all foreseeable
    types o f emergency.1' Such plans should include, for example, contingency arrangements for adm issions to
    particular hospitals in the event o f a num ber o f casualties and consideration o f possible casualty clearing
    areas at the sports ground. Lines of communication, whether by telephone or by radio, from the police control
    room to the local headquarters of all emergency services should be maintained at all times so that emergency
    calls can be made instantly.


                                                             39
First Aid, M edical Facilities and Ambulances
   229. The scale o f available medical facilities has been the subject o f controversy. After Hillsborough, there
were com plaints o f insufficient basic equipm ent such as stretchers. I repeat what 1 said in my Interim Report
at paragraphs 298 and 2 9 9 :-

  "298. It would be unreasonable to expect, at any sports stadium, medical facilities capable o f dealing with
  a major disaster such as occurred. To have in advance at the ground, oxygen, resuscitators, stretchers, other
  equipm ent and medical staff sufficient to deal with over 100 casualties is not practicable.

   299. What is required is a basic level o f provision for first aid, for professional medical attention and for
  ambulance attendance, together with a system o f co-ordination with the emergency services which will
  bring them to the scene swiftly in whatever numbers are. required. What will am ount to an appropriate
  basic provision for the future eg the equipm ent in a first aid room , requires expert evaluation and advice” .

   230. T h e Scottish ambulance service has developed a “ major incident equipment vehicle” designed and
equipped to deal with up to 50 casualties. I t is packed with 50 stretchers, blankets, and medical supplies and is
in effect a travelling storehouse for such equipment. A vehicle of that type is deployed in addition to other
ambulance attendance at matches with crowds over 25,000. This provision goes a long way towards meeting the
criticism raised after Hillsborough and I recommend that it be adopted elsewhere.

   231. I repeat the Interim Recommendations I made under this heading subject to two variations. First, it has
been sensibly urged that it is unreasonable to require a medical practitioner to be present throughout a match
where attendance is very small. At such a match it is suggested that to have a medical practitioner on call
w ould be sufficient. I agree w ith this and recommend that the full-tim e presence of a doctor should not be
required where there is no reasonable expectation of more than 2,000 spectators attending.

   232. Secondly, som e clubs have told m e that they can secure private ambulance services more
econom ically than those from the appropriate ambulance authority. They accordingly wish to have freedom
to choose. I modify my Interim Recommendation in deference to this argument by requiring at least one fully
equipped ambulance from, o r approved by, the appropriate ambulance authority should be in attendance at all
matches with an expected crowd of 5,000 or more.

Status of the Green Guide                                                *
  233. 1 have recom m ended that som e safety factors covered by the G uide should be m ade mandatory
requirements in Safety Certificates. T h ose apart, I consider the G uide should remain a non-mandatory set o f
guidelines. Sports grounds vary greatly in their layout and fixtures. It must be open to a local authority to
judge the propriety o f deviating in som e respect from the Green G uide recom m endations at a particular
ground. However, 1 agree with the Technical Working Party that where there is a departure from a specific
recom m endation o f the G uide, the local authority should be aware o f it and should be satisfied that such
departure is justified for good reason.

Revision of the Green Guide
  234. Neither 1 nor the Technical Working Party have sought to revise or redraft the specific wording o f the
Guide. We have simply indicated where and to what effect it should be altered. Detailed consideration o f the
revision must be for a suitably qualified body to be set up by the H o m e Office for the purpose. The Technical
Working Party, in addition to their report, have prepared detailed supplementary notes on som e aspects o f
the G u id e which will be available and I am sure useful to those revising it. Accordingly, I recommend that the
Hom e Office set up a body to revise the Green Guide as a matter of urgency.

Sports Grounds W ith in Part I I I of the Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987
  235. This Part o f the 1987 Act applies in relation to a sports ground which is not a designated sports
ground but which provides covered accom m od ation in stands for spectators. A Safety Certificate is required
where such a stand provides covered accom m od ation for 500 or more spectators. By section 27(1) the Safety
Certificate:-

  “shall contain such terms and con d itions as the local authority consider necessary or expedient to secure
  reasonable safety in the stand w hen it is in use for v iewing the specified activity or activities at the ground,
  and the terms and conditions m ay be such as to involve alterations or additions to the stand or any
  installations in or serving the stand.”


                                                        40
 236. These provisions apply to a variety o f sports such as tennis, golf, horseracing, greyhound racing or
motor racing.

   237. I have received a number o f com plaints that local authorities, perhaps in response to Hillsborough,
have sought to apply the full rigour o f my Interim R ecom m endations to sports grounds requiring a Safety
Certificate under these provisions, not being designated sports grounds under the 1975 Act. On occasion this
has been done without regard to the Green G uide or to H om e Office guidance. Examples given are
requirements in relation to greyhound stadia regarding the presence o f a medical practitioner, the size o f a
first aid room, and capacity o f parts o f the stadium other than the covered stand itself.

  238. The Green G uide provides at paragraph 5 as follows:-

  "The G uide is intended to cover grounds where sporting events o f all kinds are held and where the
  gathering o f large crowds is likely to present a safety problem. However, much o f the guidance has
  particular application to football stadia and this should be borne in m ind when applying the G uide to
  grounds used for other sports and m odifications may prove necessary, because the measures to meet
  problems o f stadia used for association football m ay not always be necessary at other grounds used for
  other types o f sports. For example, if a ground has no terraced or sloped viewing areas, crush barrier
  requirements are unlikely to be o f concern”.

  A similar approach is appropriate in relation to my Final R ecom m endations. They are essentially directed
towards designated sports grounds. Many are relevant to other sports grounds but will need to be applied
with due regard to the different circumstances at those other sports grounds.

  239. One appropriate function o f the inspecting and reviewing body, which I propose should cover all
certificating and licensing o f sports grounds, would be to ensure that recom m endations in the Green G uide
and those m ade in this Report are applied sensibly across the varied range o f sports grounds.

Sports Grounds W ith in Part IV of the Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport A ct 1987
   240. This Part o f the 1987 Act relates to indoor sports licences. It introduced am endm ents to the
London Governm ent Act 1963 and the Local Governm ent (M iscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982 requiring
a licence to be granted by the relevant local authority where premises are to be used for “any entertainment
which consists o f any sporting event to which the public are invited as spectators” (a “sports
entertainment”).

  241. U nder this legislation, the relevant local authority:-

  “may grant to any applicant, and from tim e to tim e renew, a licence for the use o f any premises specified
  in it for any sports entertainment on such terms and conditions and subject to such restrictions as may be
  so specified”.

  242. I have received evidence from a number o f bodies com plaining that the procedure followed in
pursuance o f these provisions often requires different applications to be m ade by different applicants for
different “sports entertainm ents” at the sam e premises. Apart from the expenditure o f tim e and effort, such
multiple applications tend to be expensive to amateur sports organisations w hich are often im pecunious. The
suggestion is m ade that a procedure should be available whereby a licence for a range o f “sports
entertainments” at the same premises could be obtained by a single operator periodically. This matter
merits review by the appropriate authorities.

                                   P O L IC E P L A N N IN G A N D C O N T R O L

  243. The role o f the police is crucial to crowd control. In my findings as to what happened at Hillsborough
and why, I criticised the police operation on the day and especially som e senior officers. I did, however,
recognise that the South Yorkshire Police had a good record, that day apart, for handling difficult crowd
problems successfully. I also com m en d ed many junior officers for their efforts to rescue and assist those
crushed or trapped at Hillsborough.

  244. I should like here to pay tribute to police forces generally for their invaluable work in maintaining
order at sports events and especially in and outside football stadia, Saturday after Saturday. W ithout them,
sports events would be chaotic and indeed many could not be permitted to take place. Their service is often
thankless and not infrequently they are subjected to abuse and worse from those they are there to serve.

   245. They would be superhuman if on occasions they did not react, at any rate verbally, to the stress and
provocation they have to endure. This leads m any fans to feel the police are against them. Moreover, it is
often difficult in the confusion o f a crowded scene for firm police action against miscreants not to im pinge
also, or focus by mistake, on the innocent. The latter then feel aggrieved and others b ecom e aggrieved on
their behalf.

  246. It is therefore vital that police discipline and self-control be o f the highest standard and that friendly
relations with supporters are cultivated. I know and have m yself seen that this is achieved at many grounds.
But there are reports that, at som e places, som e police treat supporters, especially away supporters, with a
measure o f contempt. W hen this happens it unfortunately sours the attitude o f the supporters towards all
police.

  247. Accordingly, Police C om m anders should in their briefings stress the need to balance firm control
with good humour and patience.

  248. As to the planning of police operations and the techniques to be considered, I repeat my interim
recommendations (numbers 6 and 26 to 30) which are now recommendations 1 6 ,4 4 to 4 6 ,4 9 and 51.

Police Control Room
   249. I t is essential to efficient police operations that their control room inside the ground should be well
placed, of sufficient size and well equipped. A num ber I have seen have been very good. S om e are too small,
however. There should be room for at least the Commander, his deputy and enough officers to man the radios,
telephones and C C T V screens. The room should leave space for others who may need from time to time to visit
the room eg other senior officers, club management or a member of the emergency services. The room should
command a good view of the whole pitch and of the spectator areas surrounding it. I t should where necessary be
sound-proofed against excessive crowd noise. Failure to provide the police with a satisfactory control room is
misguided thrift.




                                                        42
                                                 CHAPTER 6

                                                  ALCOHOL

  250. There can be no doubt that excessive drinking by fans significantly aggravates problems o f crowd
control. Because alcohol tends to remove inhibitions and self control, those who have drunk too much may
become aggressive and even violent especially when provoked. Short o f this, however, alcohol can make fans
resistant to sensible and reasonable instructions, more im patient and less considerate o f others. All o f this
increases the problems for police and stewards in managing large numbers which is difficult enough even
with co-operation.


Legislation
   251. In Scotland, serious crowd misbehaviour, much o f it drink-related, led to the appointm ent in 1976 o f
the Working Group chaired by Mr Frank McElhone MP. The recom m endations o f his report were followed in
the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980 which m ade it an offence to be in, or to attempt to enter, a
designated ground while in possession o f alcohol or to be in, or to attempt to enter, the ground whilst drunk.
It also banned the possession o f alcoholic liquor on public service vehicles carrying passengers to or from a
designated sporting event and by am en dm en t this ban was extended to vehicles adapted to carry nine or
more passengers.


   252. I am in no doubt after discussions with senior Scottish police officers that this measure has greatly
reduced the problem o f m isbehaviour at Scottish football grounds. Sectarian violence still has to be
contained, especially at Rangers and Celtic matches. There is still trouble from the "new hooligan" groups,
known in Scotland as “casuals”. But much o f the m isbehaviour o f groups 11 and 111 in the Popplewell
classification has abated due to the firm enforcement o f the 1980 Act by the Scottish police.


 253. In England and Wales this lead was followed in the Sporting Events (Control o f Alcohol etc) Act 1985
which m ade similar provisions.


    254. There is. however, an important difference between the Scottish provisions and those applying in
England and Wales. In Scotland, the ban on alcohol is absolute. N o sales o f alcoholic drink are permitted in
the ground. In England and Wales, section 3 o f the 1985 Act permits Licensing Justices to grant exem ption
from the ban on sales in the ground. This is subject to alcohol not being sold or con su m ed at any part o f the
ground from which the sporting event may be directly viewed and to other con d itions im posed by the
Justices. It is open to the Justices to revoke or vary an order and the police have power to shut dow n the sale
o f alcohol at a particular event if they consider it would be detrimental to orderly conduct or safety.


Alcohol Sales in Grounds?
  255. It is against this background that 1 must consider the subm ission o f the FA and others that sale o f
alcoholic drink in football grounds should be generally permitted w ithout need to obtain an exem ption order.
The argument is that the ban on such sales does not prevent fans from drinking. It merely drives them to
drink in public houses until a short tim e before the match. They then arrive late, often inebriated and
truculent, thereby causing congestion and other problems at entrances. Far better, it is said, to make alcoholic
drink available at the ground so as to bring them in earlier. Since service o f drink inside the ground is slow
and selling points are crowded it is argued that the visitor will be lucky to buy more than one round. He is
therefore unlikely to becom e drunk from drinking inside the ground.


  256. Ideally 1 accept that people attending a football match should be able to buy refreshments including
alcoholic drink just as they can at the theatre or other places o f entertainment. 1 hope, in halcyon days ahead,
a better atmosphere at football grounds may justify bans being relaxed. 1 do not. however, think the present
time is ripe for such relaxation.


  257. I have m en tion ed the great improvement o f crowd behaviour in Scotland where the ban is absolute
and has been in force now for nearly 10 years. N o doubt other factors such as increased seating have played
their part in this. The im provem ent has been recognised by the Governm ent, and is the main reason why the
Football Spectators Act 1989 has not been applied to Scotland. Thus Mr Moynihan, the Minister for Sport,
said on the Third D ay o f the C o m m ittee Stage (Official Report, colum n 83):



                                                       43
  “There has been a marked im provem ent in the behaviour o f football crowds in Scotland, which is accepted
  by all parties and the Scottish Football Association. The Scottish Office is monitoring developm ents
  closely and . . . it does not believe that it is necessary to legislate for a national m embership schem e in
  Scotland. However, it will be able to take action in the future should the position deteriorate”.

   In England and Wales, the ban has had only four and a half years to operate and is watered down by the
availability o f exem ptions. Where it is thought appropriate, there is nothing to prevent clubs from applying
to their local justices for an exem ption. There m ay regrettably be places where the local circumstances,
known to the justices, warrant refusal o f an exem ption. At m any others, it will be granted as indeed it has
been already at a number o f grounds.

   258. When such exem ptions exist, there is no clear evidence to suggest that late arrivals are greatly
reduced. Indeed, the argument that no-one can get drunk in the ground because o f the problems o f getting
served or because only low alcohol beer is available, seem s to m e contradictory to the main argument. Those
w ho wish to drink full strength beer in quantity will not be m uch attracted by the service offered inside the
ground.

   259. In these circumstances I consider it would be a retrograde or at least premature step at this tim e to
restore a blanket licence to sell alcohol at designated sports events. I do not go so far as to suggest that the
total ban applicable in Scotland should be extended to England and Wales ie that no exem ptions should be
available. But I do not believe it appropriate to relax the present restrictions.

  260. Are there other steps which could and should be taken to reduce problems from excessive drinking?

Arrests
   261. I have referred to the provision in Section 2 o f the 1985 Act making it an offence to be in, or to
attempt to enter, a designated sports ground whilst drunk or in possession o f intoxicating liquor. The impact
o f these provisions clearly depends upon enforcement. Here again there is a contrast between Scotland and
England. In England, although arrests are made, there is a tendency to eject many offenders w ithout arresting
them. In Scotland the police take a firm line. They do not eject offenders; they arrest them. The English
approach m ay partly be due to a com m en dab le desire not to be seen as hostile to football spectators.
However, it is also a matter o f expediency. Making an arrest requires the arresting officer to take the offender
to a police room and go through the prescribed procedure and paperwork. This takes the officer away from
his post for a m inim u m o f a quarter o f an hour. At som e grounds (Hillsborough was one) evidence suggests a
much lengthier absence is com m on . Clearly, if a serial o f eight officers is posted to a bank o f turnstiles, three
or four arrests may greatly reduce the team for a significant period. There is a tendency, therefore, to avoid
making arrests save in the worst cases. I do not wish to advocate repressive measures w hich would be counter
to all I have said about the need for a new attitude towards spectators. On the other hand, it cannot be a good
ground for declining to make an arrest that one cannot spare an officer to do it. I therefore recommend that
consideration be given to stream lining arrest procedures so as to divert an arresting officer from his post for
the minimum time. One m ethod I have seen adopted is for the officer to give only basic details o f the arrest
and be photographed with the offender before resuming his duties. He can then return after the match to
com plete the documentation.

Closing Bars
   262. In som e areas, bars in the vicinity o f the ground are closed either throughout a match day or between
certain hours. This may be required by the Justices or it may be the result o f agreement between police and
publicans. Such a measure may however have limited effect. To close the pubs in a radius o f one or two miles
o f the ground simply diverts drinkers to bars outside that range and may aggravate late arrival. Moreover,
beer from shops with off-licences probably accounts for as much pre-match drinking as that bought in bars.
This said, it may well be sensible to limit the availability o f alcohol especially before a high-risk match. How
effective the measure can be depends on the locality. In London or other large cities it could have little
impact; in a more isolated town it could be very effective.

E a rly K ick-O ffs
   263. Traditionally, kick-off at football matches has been at three o ’clock. That may formerly have been to
accom m od ate those w ho worked on Saturday mornings. By another tradition, permitted hours in pubs led to
a recognised drinking period from mid-m orning until three o ’clock. The c om bination o f these two traditions
often brings fans to a match with too m uch drink on board. There is therefore much to be said for an early
kick-off especially in a high-risk match. It gives less opportunity for prolonged drinking sessions im m ediately


                                                         44
before the game. A mid-day kick-off gives tim e for away supporters to reach the ground but less tim e for early
arrivals to kick their heels and lift their elbows in bars.

  264. It is true that an early kick-off will discharge the fans earlier at the end o f the match. Som e anxiety
has been expressed as to whether drunkenness avoided before and during the match may have more hours to
build up after the game causing problems for the police and the local com m u n ity in the evening. This could
be so. but there are two moderating factors. First, drunken behaviour in the town, although a problem for the
police, is less likely to cause serious danger to many people than at a match where it may be com p oun ded by
excitement, partisanship and incidents o f the game and where large numbers are in a confined space.
Secondly, the segregation exercise often results in the bulk o f away supporters being escorted back to their
road or rail transport as soon as the match is over rather than lingering in the town.

Sunday Matches
    265. Sunday matches ought also to be a considered option. On a Sunday, there is less traffic, especially
commercial traffic, to com pete with those arriving for the match. Arrival, parking and departure are
therefore easier for them in private coaches and cars. It is true that public transport generally on a Sunday is
less plentiful but special arrangements are often m ade for major events. Again, bars and indeed many places
o f entertainment being closed on Sundays, there is less incentive to have a night on the town after a Sunday
game.

Information on Tickets and Signs
   266. It is vital to good crowd control that those attending a sports event should have clear directions where
to go. It makes for confusion and hence added problems for stewards and police if spectators are milling
about looking for their appropriate entrances. The congestion at Hillsborough was aggravated by poor
information on the tickets and poor signposting outside and inside the turnstiles. I therefore repeat my
recommendations that tickets and signs should provide simple, clear and consistent information to
spectators.

  267. All available measures should be taken in the printing o f tickets to prevent forgeries being produced.
Computer Record of Tickets
  268. It would greatly help to defeat forgery and theft of tickets as well as assisting in the apprehension of
those misbehaving in the ground, if clubs maintained a record on computer of ticket sales. This is d one in
Italy where season tickets and tickets for all-ticket m atches in seated areas are num bered and a record is
m aintained o f the nam es and addresses o f purchasers. Such information is o f great value to the police in
identifying forgeries and tracing offenders. Clearly, season tickets for seats could be m ade attractive if
favourable terms were offered (especially to young supporters). This would enable the authorities to know for
a whole season w ho was occupying a particular seat. As seating accom m od ation increases this would give
greater information and control.
Fans W ithout Tickets
   269. One problem which creates difficulties for the police is the arrival o f would-be spectators without
tickets at an all-ticket match. Although I found there was not a large b ody o f such fans at Hillsborough there
undoubtedly were som e. At other matches the numbers have not only been large; they have been determined
to gain entrance by one means or another. If they could not acquire tickets at the ground they have created so
m uch trouble that the police have judged it best to let them in. S om etim es this has been for payment; on
occasions, even free. The rationale has been that it is better to have troublemakers inside the ground where
they can be monitored than roaming round the town at large. Obviously, the practice o f admitting fans
without tickets has a bad knock-on effect. Bands o f fans unable to get tickets believe that if they turn up and
create sufficient clamour the police will admit them.
Police Policy
  270. This must not be allowed to continue. It is intolerable that those with no tickets should be able to
blackmail their way into a ground. “ If you don't let us in we'll force the gates or wreck your town”, is not a
threat to which a police force should submit. The policy o f admitting such people is also unfair to those who
have taken the trouble and spent m oney to buy tickets. It further involves, at a capacity match, letting in fans
for w hom there may be insufficient space. It may also create problems o f segregation. Above all, it is allowing
the m ob to rule.

  271. True. 1 held that in the crisis which developed at the Leppings Lane turnstiles on 15 April 1989,
opening gate C was justified since life would otherwise have been at risk outside the ground. However, that
was a matter o f life and death. It arose because o f inadequate facilities and inadequate crowd control. I would
hope such a situation will nev er recur. If anything like it should recur, preservation o f life must clearly be
paramount. But when the police have an option to let fans without tickets in or keep them out, their policy
must clearly be to exclude them. U nless that rule is firmly and universally applied and known the problem
will grow.

A ll-ticket Matches
   272. All the evidence 1 have received suggests that great caution should be exercised before making a
match all-ticket. To do so can assist in achieving segregation. In general, it should however be d one only
where a capacity or near capacity crowd is expected. There should then be little difficulty in selling all the
tickets in advance. The point o f making such a match all-ticket is to prevent the arrival o f greater numbers
than the ground can accom m odate. However, if a less popular match is m ade all-ticket, it may turn out that
only a m odest proportion o f the tickets is sold in advance. If then fans arrive w ithout tickets, they will be
aggrieved at being turned away when there is space available. Moreover, the club will be tem pted to give in to
them and sell tickets on the day. This discredits the all-ticket policy and m ay cause breaches o f the
segregation strategy. I therefore recommend that all-ticket matches should be confined to those at which a
capacity or near capacity crowd is expected and that, having so designated them, clubs m aintain a firm policy of
not selling tickets at the match.
louts
  273. The recom m endations in the last two paragraphs are designed to deter those w ithout tickets from
turning up at matches and so obviating any trouble they may be tem pted to cause. However, m any fans
without tickets turn up at the ground in the hope o f buying them from touts.

   274. During my visits to sports grounds I have found universal condem nation o f touts by all involved in
organising and managing large stadium events. Apart from the obstruction they them selves cause, touts
attract fans without tickets to attend at grounds in the hope o f getting in. Moreover, they sell tickets to all
comers regardless o f their allegiance. Thus tickets for the h om e area at a soccer match fall into the hands o f
away supporters and vice versa. The result is to frustrate the efforts o f clubs and police to achieve peaceful
segregation. Pockets o f alien affiliation planted amongst hom e supporters form a focus for hostility and often
v iolence results. Apart from these objections, voiced by the FA, the FL, the police and the clubs, most
supporters also detest touts because they often corner the market for a popular match and offer tickets at
grossly excessive prices.

   275. From all these quarters the plea is to take positive action against ticket touts at football matches.
1 am mindful o f the need for caution before advocating a law limiting liberty to conduct on eself and on e’s
business freely and according to established practice. I likewise accept that market forces should, in general,
operate freely in the com m ercial field. Nevertheless, I am satisfied from what I have read, heard and seen
that outside football grounds the presence and activities o f touts have a grossly anti-social effect leading both
directly and indirectly to disorder. Directly, through obstruction and the attraction o f numbers without
tickets. Indirectly, because o f trouble from those so attracted who, in the end, cannot or do not buy tickets
and from those who buy their way into an o pposition enclave.

   276. Touts operate, o f course, at places other than football grounds. They are to be found, for example, at
national rugby stadia, at the All England Lawn Tennis Club at W im bled on and at countless other sporting
events. D epending on how one defines “touting”, the activity could include selling unwanted tickets for the
opera, the theatre or concert halls. Touting usually means, however, not just selling at face value a ticket you
cannot use, but selling numbers o f tickets at an inflated price as a com m ercial venture. There is a clear
distinction between the im pact o f touting at football grounds and elsewhere. Football is the only sport at
which segregation is practised to prevent violence. This is because it is the sport where violence inside and
outside the ground is, at present, most prevalent. There are therefore strong grounds for regarding football as
a special case as the Governm ent has recognised by prom oting the Football Spectators Act.

  277. Whatever the policy merits o f freedom to trade and market forces, they must surely yield to the
maintenance o f safety and the prevention o f disorder. Touts at football m atches put both at risk. At other
sports and in other leisure fields the tout does not endanger safety or order to the sam e extent. Accordingly,
w hatever view on e takes o f him, he can be left to ply his trade there. But so far as football is concerned, in my
view touting should be m ade unlawful. The fast buck should stop here.

  278. At present, police can deal w ith touts only by som ew hat strained and stretched use o f existing laws.
They arrest them for obstruction even if the physical obstruction caused is m inimal. Alternatively, they make
an arrest on the grounds that they suspect the tout o f carrying forged tickets, although the suspicion o f forgery
may merely be convenient conjecture. After holding the tout during the match the police release h im and the
now valueless but genuine tickets are returned to him. Growing wise to this, m any touts now carry only two or
three tickets at a tim e, relying on a runner to bring up more from a “banker" standing o f f with perhaps
hundreds o f tickets in his possession. If the salesman is arrested the m erchandise is not all lost. Police should
not have to stretch the law to deal with a public mischief. There should be a specific prohibition w hich police
can then enforce.

    279. H ow to formulate a prohibition against touting at football grounds will require careful consideration
and drafting. It could be made an offence to sell tickets for and on the day of a football match without
authority from the home club to do so. Another way would be to prohibit such sales within a specified radius
o f the ground on the day o f the match. Yet another would be to prohibit sales o f tickets for a football match at
more than face value. This third alternative would permit any genuine purchaser o f a ticket who found he
could not use it to recoup his outlay by selling his ticket outside the match. Its disadvantage would be the
difficulty o f proving a tout had sold at more than face value; ways would also be devised to evade the
prohibition. I tend to favour the first alternative which is sim ple and capable o f easy p r o o f The genuine
ticket holder, finding h im self unable on the day to use his ticket, and not permitted to sell it outside the
ground, should be permitted to return it to the club and recover his money. Clubs should be prepared to
accept such tickets in the interests o f fairness and o f having a law w hich defeats touts. If touting outside the
ground is banned, fans with no tickets for an all-ticket match could have no excuse for turning up outside
hoping to get in.

Cautious Optim ism
  280. I turn now to ways o f curbing misbehaviour and dealing with hooligans. At the outset, I m ust record
that there are grounds for cautious optim ism about m isbehaviour inside football grounds although the same
cannot be said o f behaviour outside and en route. Evidence I have received from various police forces, from
ACPO, from the football authorities and from the clubs suggests that measures taken in the last couple o f
years have reduced incidents o f violent misbehaviour inside grounds. Also, for the first tim e for decades,
there has been a small but steady increase in attendances at m atches in each o f the last three years. T h is has
occurred despite reductions in capacity. It is attributed by police and football authorities and by supporters’
organisations to greater confidence by the decent majority o f spectators that violence in the ground is under
control.


   281. These w elcom e signs must be seen in perspective. D isorder in the ground has been, for the m ost part,
controlled not eliminated. There have still been occasional outbursts o f violence in recent m onths. All that
can be said with confidence is that the police are now m uch better equipped and informed to deal with
hooligans than they were three years ago and their operations have been more successful in controlling
disorder.

CCTV
  282. In particular, the installation o f C C T V has greatly improved police surveillance o f the crowd both
inside the ground and at the turnstiles.

   283. In 1985, after the Bradford Disaster, the Football Trust m ade funds available to install CCTV at all
first and second division football grounds. Unfortunately, the systems initially installed, although the best
available at the tim e, proved to be o f inadequate quality for identification purposes. Moreover, operators
initially lacked the training and expertise necessary to make effective use o f the equipm ent.

  284. A number o f clubs now have better equipm ent and m ost o f the remainder o f the 92 clubs in the
League have applied to the Football Trust for funding to enable them to do likewise. The Football Trust, not
unnaturally, wish to be sure the m oney will be well spent. They have therefore asked that an agreed
specification should be laid down as to the quality o f the C C T V to be installed. ACPO hope to provide this as
soon as possible.

  285. In the two years ending June 1989, about 200 operators were trained in the use o f C C T V at matches.
A training video is also available to all police forces.

  286. Already, C CTV has had a major im pact on the hooligan problem inside football grounds as well as
proving extremely useful to m onitor safety measures. If any trouble appears on the screen or is reported from
any quarter o f the ground, the C C T V can zoom in on the incident. The police can then record what occurs on
colour video and on hard copy prints. Individuals can be picked out by facial appearance and the colour o f
their clothing. The evidential effect o f such a vid eo recording has proved formidable. It has persuaded
hooligans, who would previously have sought to challenge oral evidence o f identification, to plead guilty.
H ooligans know cameras are keeping a roving watch and their activities in the ground are inhibited by that
knowledge. Police evidence suggest that as a result o f C C T V surveillance and the police strategies it
facilitates, the more com m itted hooligans now concentrate their activities outside the ground, attacking
opposing fans on their way to or from matches.

N ational Football Intelligence U n it
   287. ACPO have for som e years encouraged the developm ent o f an intelligence network nationwide. A
national in dex o f football liaison officers was set up to collect, record and pass on inform ation about the
behaviour, past and anticipated, o f club supporters, especially the hooligan element. Thus, before a match,
the police responsible for it can receive information from the football liaison officer in the visiting club’s area
as to the propensities o f the visiting supporters and any known plans any elem ent am ong them m ay have.
Although this schem e has proved useful, the need was recognised for a central unit equipped with a com puter
to gather, record and dissem inate intelligence. ACPO, in their written subm ission, say:-
  “Hooligan gangs operate across a wide area and m ay o f course be involved in crim inal escapades in any
  town between their point o f departure and the venue o f the fixture. Furthermore, in recent times there is
  good evidence that they will often plan criminal violence which has nothing whatever to do with football.
  There is a need to overview such events to identify patterns and recognise what is behind seemingly
  unconnected events.”

   288.     The N ational Football Intelligence U n it has now been set up. It is based in London; staff are in post;
the U nit is being funded by the H o m e Office. It is hoped the com puter will be installed shortly. The U n it will
then be o f great value in dealing not only with d om estic football-related crime but also with hooligans
travelling to m atches abroad.

   289. Although incidents o f physical violence inside grounds are now m uch fewer, there remains an
undercurrent o f unruly behaviour which can and occasionally does result in disorder. Three activities in
particular have this potential: (i) throwing coins and other m issiles (ii) chanting obscene or racialist abuse
(iii) going onto the pitch w ithout reasonable excuse.

    i.    There can be no possible excuse for hurling missiles at a sports ground. It is not only dangerous in
          itself. It may and often d oes incite others to do likewise; that may and often d oes provoke retaliation.
          Violence may then escalate.

    ii.   N o -o n e could expect that verbal exchanges on the terraces would be as polite as those at a vicarage
          tea party. But shouting or chanting gross obscenities or racialist abuse ought not to be permitted. If
          one starts, others join in, and to the majority o f reasonable supporters, as well as to those abused, the
          sound o f such chants from numbers in unison is offensive and provocative.

    iii. Running on the pitch often provokes and is the prelude to disorder. This is not just because it
         interrupts the game or because it invades the hallowed turf. It is often d one with the intention o f
         attacking som eone. Even if the invasion is not with intent to attack the referee, a player or o pposing
         fans, it tempts others to follow suit. If rival fans com e on to the pitch violen ce will probably break
         out. Even if they do not, there may well be violent exchanges with police seeking to repel the
         invaders. A fan may run onto the pitch merely to congratulate a goal scorer. But his action could well
         provoke opposing fans (displeased by the goal anyway) to invade the pitch with less benign intent.

  290. Ought not these activities therefore to be m ade criminal offences? This has been raised before. Mr
Justice Popplewell considered the same three activities. After discussing whether they should be made
separate offences, he concluded, on analogy with the Scottish “breach o f the peace”, that a sim ple offence o f
disorderly conduct at a sports ground would sweep up not only the three activities m entioned above but other
disorderly activities too. He concluded, at paragraph 4 .74 o f his Final Report, as follows:

  “4.74 Quite clearly a new offence in England and Wales o f disorderly conduct or breach o f the peace on
  the lines o f the Scottish co m m o n law offence, would be o f substantial assistance in dealing with
  hooliganism. It would avoid the problem o f trying to define all the different types o f behaviour w hich give
  rise to disorder at football m atches and would undoubtedly enable the police to take action m uch earlier
  than they can under the present law. This offence should be confined to sports grounds where the
  disorderly conduct is likely to have such a devastating effect o n crowd safety. Disorderly conduct would
  clearly include throwing a missile, running onto the pitch, seeking to climb over or to pull down a perimeter
  fence, shining a mirror towards a batsman, throwing bottles or cans onto the field o f play, or interfering
  with a greyhound or horse race. I suggest that it should be triable summarily and there should b e a power o f
  arrest. / recommend, therefore, that consideration should be given to creating an offence o f disorderly
  conduct at a sports ground."

  291. This recom m endation was not taken up. At the tim e Mr Justice Popplewell reported, the Public Order
Act 1986 was in preparation. It created new offences relating to public order but none specifically related to
conduct inside sports grounds. Evidence from the H o m e Office gives two reasons for this. First, it was thought
wrong in principle to treat football or sports grounds as a special case. Secondly, it was apparently thought that
the provisions o f the 1986 Act, especially section 5, sufficiently covered the field.

  292. As to the first reason, on e must surely look at the nature o f the mischief. The three specified activities
would, o f course, be an anti-social nuisance anywhere. But at a designated sports ground they are fraught
with potential disorderly consequences. There is good reason therefore to treat as a special case the
prohibition o f these activities at such grounds. By analogy, having alcohol in one’s blood over a fixed limit
has been made an offence only in relation to driving, because it is dangerous to the public in that special
context.

  293. The second reason requires an exam ination o f sections 4(1) and 5(1) o f the 1986 Act. So far as is
relevant, these provide as follows:-

  “4( 1) A person is guilty o f an offence if he -

     (a) uses towards another person threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour . . .
          with intent to cause that person to believe that im m ediate unlawful violence will be used against him
          or another by any person, or to provoke the im m ediate use o f unlawful violence by that person or
          another, or whereby that person is likely to believe that such violence will be used or it is likely that
          such violence will be provoked . . .

  5(1) A person is guilty o f an offence i f he -

    (a)   uses threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour, or disorderly behaviour . . .
          within the hearing or sight o f a person likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress thereby”.

  294. Throwing m issiles could only be caught under section 5 as “disorderly behaviour” if the additional
element were proved that it was “within the hearing or sight o f a person likely to be caused harassment, alarm
or distress thereby”. To adduce evidence o f this last elem ent may be very difficult indeed. It should surely be
sufficient to show that the accused threw a missile at a football match.

    295. As to obscene or racialist chanting similar difficulties arise. Although the chanting may be proved
abusive or insulting it would also have to be shown, under section 4, that it was used “towards another person
. . . with intent to cause that person to believe that im m ediate unlawful violence will be used against him etc”.
Proof o f those elem ents may not be possible.

  296. U nder section 5, whilst again the chanting may be proved to have contained “abusive or insulting
words”, it may be difficult to show that this was d one “within the hearing or sight o f a person likely to be
caused harassment, alarm or distress thereby”. The words may cause nothing other than disgust.

  297. N or does section 18 o f the Act help. U nd er the heading “Acts intended or likely to stir up racial
hatred”, the section provides as follows so far as is relevant:-

  “ 18(1) A person who uses threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour . . . is guilty o f an offence
  if-

    (a) he intends thereby to stir up racial hatred, or

    (b) having regard to all the circumstances racial hatred is likely to be stirred up thereby”.

  298. Racialist abuse o f the kind chanted at football matches is probably not intended to stir up racial
hatred. N or could it readily be proved that racial hatred was likely to be stirred up. The effect o f such
chanting is to give cheap and ignoble am usem ent to those participating whilst causing offence and
embarrassment to those abused and to the decent majority o f fans.

  299. For these reasons, I do not consider that the activities which Mr Justice Popplewell concluded should
be the subject o f a criminal offence are covered by the 1986 Act. H e set out the arguments for and against
legislation to prohibit them at paragraphs 4.42 to 4 .74 o f his Final Report. I do not rehearse those arguments.
I agree with his conclusion that on balance, despite the difficulties o f drafting and enforcement, these
activities should be prohibited. Mr Justice Popplewell concluded that a “catch-all” offence o f disorderly
conduct at a sports ground should be considered. I appreciate the force o f his reasoning. However, I would
prefer to see separate offences in respect of each of the three activities I have mentioned. The object o f the
legislation must be not merely to prosecute offences when they occur but to deter them. If there is a specific
offence o f throwing missiles at a designated sports ground, a separate specific offence o f chanting obscene or
racialist abuse there and a third specific offence o f going on the pitch w ithout reasonable excuse there and, if
full publicity is given to the legislation, hooligans will know precisely what is prohibited and that they do
those things at their peril.

  300. As to going on the pitch, I have a reason for recom m ending prohibition additional to those which
convinced Mr Justice Popplewell. I have recom m ended lowering the level o f fences and removing spikes and
overhanging sections. That relaxation is m ade in the interests o f the decent majority o f supporters who have
no yen to invade the pitch. To back up the lesser deterrent effect o f lower fences I think it prudent to have a
criminal sanction against pitch invasion.

   301. I appreciate that at som e sports grounds there is a tradition o f running onto the pitch when the game
is over simply from joie de vivre or to pat players on the back. At Murrayfield, for exam ple, schoolboys sit on
forms on the pitch side o f the perimeter fencing and run on harmlessly at the end o f the game. Again, going
onto the pitch to escape som e hazard on the terraces in an emergency should, o f course, be legitimate.
Accordingly, the offence should be aim ed at prohibiting invasion o f the pitch w ithout good reason or
reasonable excuse. The police will in this as in many other situations have to exercise sensible discretion and
judgment.

                                                     CHAPTER 10

                                   CLUB STRATEGIES AGAINST HOOLIGANS
      302. Various club schemes to exclude hooligans have been undertaken or suggested.

    Luton
      303. In March 1985, Millwall visited Luton with a large contingent o f “supporters”. Widespread disorder
    broke out causing injuries to both fans and police. Serious damage was also done in and outside the ground as
    well as to trains returning to London.

      304. Following this episode, Luton FC decided to adopt a H o m e Only Supporters Schem e excluding away
    supporters and allowing only Luton mem bers and their guests to attend matches. I am grateful to the
    management o f Luton FC and to the Bedfordshire police w ho explained to me the history, operation and
    merits o f this scheme.

       305. Applicants for m embership normally reside within 25 miles o f Luton. Those further away must
    justify why they wish to join. A m embership card entitles the m em ber to buy a ticket for entry, either in
    advance or on the day, and to bring in with him up to three guests. The card has a bar-coding and must be
    presented to obtain a ticket in advance. To buy a ticket on the day, the card is “sw iped” through a
    computerised reader by the m em ber at an outer set o f turnstiles at the Kenilworth Road end o f the ground.
    Payment for a ticket is then m ade at another inner set o f turnstiles. Those mem bers w ho misbehave are
    deprived o f membership. A banned list is maintained on the computer. It consisted, at the tim e I received
    evidence, o f only six names. If entry is attempted by using a banned card, a red light shows and the turnstile
    will not open. A steward then escorts the holder to an office outside the turnstiles where the problem is
    investigated.

      306. The schem e started in August 1986. The equipm ent installed initially proved unsatisfactory. S om e o f
    the problems were: failure through condensation, delay whilst the reader checked the card’s validity, and the
    fact that a Barclaycard could do the trick. After a number o f attempts at rectification, this eq uipm ent was
    abandoned and a different firm o f suppliers was engaged. I should m ention that equipm ent from the first
    source was installed at Plymouth where it also failed after a number o f attempts and the experim ent was not
    pursued further.

      307. The second system at Luton has proved effective after som e teething troubles. It has been working
    satisfactorily now for nearly two seasons.

    Benefits of the Scheme
       308. Both the club and the police are happy with the effects o f the scheme. The exclusion o f away
    supporters naturally excludes the hooligan elem ent which they would have included. But it also removes the
    focus for the aggression o f any hom e hooligans. With no visitors to attack or bait, it is said that the hooligan
    elem ents in Luton have faded away. They have not sought to jo in the scheme, nor do they seem to travel to
    away games. The town has also benefitted. Shops which previously had to board up their windows now enjoy
    a peaceful Saturday trade which has increased by 40%. Arrests at matches have dropped from over 100 per
    season before the schem e to nil. Police costs have been greatly reduced. The club accepts that initially there
    was a fall in attendances, but claim s they are rising again. In 1985/6. average attendance was 11.100. in
     1986/7 it was 10.300. in 1987/8 it was 8,038 and in 1988/9 it was 10,039.

      309. The list o f benefits is im pressive and there can be no doubt that the schem e has been a success for
    Luton. But would it be successful elsewhere?

      310. Luton is, in the football context, som ewhat isolated geographically from other clubs, their fans and
    their catchm ent areas. In this, its situation differs greatly from, for exam ple, London clubs or those on
    Merseyside, Greater Manchester or the Midlands. H ence the assum ption that those within 25 miles o f Luton
    are likely to be natural Luton supporters. Luton also differs from clubs in the larger conurbations by size o f
    crowds, their average numbers being only about one-quarter o f those at large clubs. The banned list is tiny. An
    important feature o f the Luton scheme is the use o f outer and inner turnstiles for which the ground has ample
    room. Many other grounds do not.


                                                            52
•
      311. At Luton, the card-holder h im self “sw ip es” his card through. The club and the police acknowledge
    that, if the card had to be passed to a turnstile operator to “sw ipe” it through, entry would be considerably
    retarded. They also accept that the essential feature o f Luton’s success has been the ban on away supporters
    rather than the m embership card schem e itself.

    Ban A ll Away Supporters?
      312. If this is the touchstone o f success in elim inating hooliganism, why not introduce it generally and
    have no away supporters at any football matches nationwide? This has been considered before and rejected.
    Mr Justice Popplewell in his Interim Report recom m ended that:

      "Urgent consideration should be given to introducing a mem bership system in England and Wales so as to
      exclude visiting fans”.

      However, in his Final Report he m odified this and recom m ended that:

      "Consideration should continue to be given to som e form o f m embership schem e for Football League
      clubs in England and Wales”.

      313. Clearly the G overnment has rejected the idea o f a ban on all away supporters which forms no part o f
    the scheme o f the Football Spectators Act 1989.

      314. To exclude all away support would be a draconian step. It would halve the number o f matches fans
    could attend. It would seriously diminish clubs’ revenue and deprive football grounds o f a healthy
    atmosphere o f rivalry, which so m e say is a casualty o f the Luton scheme. But perhaps the conclusive point is
    that it would be impractical and possibly counter-productive in the campaign against hooliganism.

      315. To exclude away supporters from Luton is on e thing. Th ose excluded can at least go at present to any
    other match instead. But to exclude all away supporters from all m atches and especially to exclude them from
    "local derby” matches or matches in large cities could cause serious disorder. If Manchester City supporters
    could not go to Old Trafford when their team plays there, or Chelsea supporters follow their team to
    Highbury or to their neighbours Queen’s Park Rangers, trouble could result. There would be attempts and
    devices to defeat the scheme and get into the ground in defiance o f it. There could well be disorder outside
    grounds. The more fanatical supporters and the hooligans would be unlikely to stay hom e and play patience.

    Away Mem bers O nly
       316. There is a halfway house between freedom for all comers and a ban on all away supporters. This is to
    make entry to sections o f the ground for away supporters by ticket only; tickets to be allocated strictly to
    members o f the away tea m ’s travel club and no tickets to be available on the day o f the match. This scheme
    builds on an existing practice adopted at som e grounds for key matches, for exam ple the Liverpool v Arsenal
    match in May 1989 to decide the cham pionship. It also builds upon existing club mem bership schemes.
    Most clubs have a club mem bership scheme o f som e sort following an agreement between the football
    authorities and the Government in February 1987. whereby all clubs were to introduce schemes covering at
    least 50% o f each ground’s capacity by the beginning o f the 1987/8 season. C om pliance was patchy and
    varied from a membership o f over 40,00 0 at Manchester U nited to one or two clubs which did nothing at all.

        317. The away members only solution encourages the p rom otion o f mem bership schem es offering
    discounts, favourable travel facilities and other benefits. It aim s to limit away supporters to those, in effect,
    vouched for by the away club. M isbehaviour would result in loss o f mem bership and thus exclusion from
    future away matches as well as loss o f other mem bership privileges. The schem e has the unanim ous approval
    o f the 48 third and fourth division clubs, given at their annual general m eeting in June 1989.

       318. As with any proposed solution to the hooligan problem, this schem e cannot be watertight. It has to be
    recognised that any mem bership scheme is vulnerable to abuse arising from the loss or theft o f cards and
    from the determined activities o f those who, for whatever reason, do not possess them. The away mem bers
    only scheme does at least hold out good prospects o f improving behaviour in the away supporters’ enclosure
    since only those vetted by the away club will be allocated tickets there. That may deter others from travelling
    but there may still be som e w ho are determined to travel and get in. On occasion, the FA has ordered that a
    club’s supporters having a bad record for causing disorder can be admitted at away matches only if they are
    accredited members o f their own club. Leeds U nited is an example. This has, on the whole, proved beneficial.
    However, on occasions, Leeds non-m em ber supporters - perhaps those living near the ground Leeds U nited


                                                           53
are due to visit - manage to get tickets intended for hom e supporters at or from the ground. They then get
into the wrong end and cause trouble. This seem s to be what happened at Ayresome Park on 9 D ecem ber
 1989. Much therefore depends upon the care and scrutiny given to ticket allocation by the hom e club. Often
it is too easy for segregation plans to be thwarted by ready availability to all o f tickets from the h om e club
whether at the box office or even by credit card over the telephone. I appreciate the difficulty o f identifying
surely h om e and away supporters but clubs should review their procedures with a view to tightening them.

  319.    D espite its imperfections, I consider the away mem bers only solution has som e merit both in
excluding undesirables from away supporters’ enclosures and in encouraging the growth o f club m embership
schemes conferring real benefits on members. It should be given further consideration.

                       OTHER POSSIBLE MEASURES AGAINST HOOLIGANS

Exclusion Orders
  320. At present, pursuant to Part IV o f the Public Order Act 1986. a court, on convicting a person o f an
offence connected with football has power, in addition to im posing a sentence, making a probation order or
discharging him, to make an exclusion order prohibiting him from entering premises to attend any football
match. The exclusion order must be for not less than three months. If a breach is proved, the offender is liable
lo imprisonment for on e month, to a fine or to both.

  321. This provision has not m ade much impact. It has not been greatly used by the courts. W hen orders
have been m ade they have tended to be for too short a period. On one occasion, absurdly, Justices im posed a
three m onth exclusion order on an offender appearing before them in May! A great weakness o f a bare
exclusion order is the difficulty o f discovering whether it is being obeyed or flouted.

  322. By section 27(5) o f the Football Spectators Act 1989, the provisions o f the Public Order Act 1986
relating to exclusion orders shall cease to have effect when the Secretary o f State, by Statutory Instrument,
brings the 1989 Act into effect. So exclusion orders will go, to be replaced by expulsion from the national
membership schem e under Part I o f the 1989 Act and restriction orders under Part II, as I shall explain in the
next Chapter.

Enforcing Exclusion by Attendance Centre O rder
  323. Were exclusion orders to be retained and used more realistically there are two additional measures
which could be taken to enforce them. First, there could be provision for attaching to an exclusion order a
requirement to attend at an appointed centre on the occasions o f designated football matches. Failure to
attend would im mediately be detected and would render the absentee liable to further penalties including
imprisonment.

  324. Such a measure would have a number o f merits. A mere ban on entering grounds may be flouted
without detection and in any event does not ban presence near the ground. An attendance centre order would
provide a m eans not merely to ban a hooligan from entry to a ground but to keep him physically from going
there. He would thus be prevented from causing trouble outside or near the ground as well as inside it. This
would be achieved without adding to the prison population, unless he defaulted, and without any elaborate
scheme im pinging on spectators generally. The provision would be the logical counterpart in the dom estic
scene to the provisions o f Part II o f the 1989 Act relating to foreign matches.

Is it Practicable?
   325. I appreciate that detaining convicted hooligans during designated matches in the d om estic football
programme is a bigger undertaking and would im pose a more restrictive penalty than requiring them merely
to report on the occasions o f English matches abroad. It is necessary, therefore, to consider the present
structure o f attendance centres, what extension o f it might be necessary, the resource im plications and the
fairness o f such a measure.

Attendance Centres
  326. At present section 17 o f the Criminal Justice Act 1982 empowers courts to make attendance centre
orders for young people under 21 who:

    (a) have been convicted o f an im prisonable offence;

    (b) have defaulted on payment o f their fines etc; or

    (c) have failed to com ply with the requirements o f a probation or supervision order.

  Attendance centre orders may not be used for those w ho have previously been given a custodial sentence
except in special (undefined) circumstances. The m in im u m length o f an order is 12 hours, except for those
under 14. The m axim u m is 24 hours under 17. and 36 hours for those aged 17 to 20.
  327. At present there are 137 centres: 111 junior centres for those aged under 17, and 26 senior centres for
those aged 17 to 20 (males only). The senior centres are, for the most part, in the larger conurbations. The
H om e Office has recently reviewed the use o f the junior centres and som e with low attendance figures are
being closed.

  328. Most centres are in school premises. They are normally open for 2 (junior) or 3 (senior) hours every
other Saturday, usually, but not invariably, in the afternoon. Each centre is staffed by an officer in charge,
normally an off-duty or retired police officer, assisted by other instructors. Regim es include physical
education and at least on e other activity.

  329. Subject to these factors, attendance centre orders can be m ade at present against those convicted o f
football related offences. They cannot however be im posed on anyone over 21, or anyone w ho has had a
custodial sentence.

  330. Effectively to exclude the offender from football grounds, it would be necessary to have the centre
open at least on every Saturday afternoon during the season. To try to include week-day evening matches
would create difficulties in making centres available and might be thought too oppressive on the offender. If
power to make orders were extended to cover those over 21 and those who have served a custodial sentence,
the centre would have to provide for a more challenging type o f offender. It w ould probably be thought
inappropriate to mix 17 to 20 year old attenders with more hardened hooligans.

Resource Im plications
   331. Such an extension would probably involve an increase in the number and calibre o f staff. Presently,
as indicated earlier, staff include retired and off-duty police officers. More such personnel would be required.
However, such increases might be m odest in com parison with the police resources likely to be required to
im plem ent the national m em bership schem e (see paragraphs 4 20 to 423 infra).

Fairness
  332. I would not suggest that the im position o f an attendance order should be a mandatory
accom panim ent to an exclusion order. It would be a discretionary power available to the courts to be used in
accordance with the sam e criteria as apply in Part II o f the 1989 Act, ie no such order could be m ade unless
the court was satisfied that making it in relation to the accused would help to prevent violence or disorder at
or in connection with designated football matches (cf section 15(2) o f the 1989 Act). This would enable the
courts to keep the numbers o f orders within manageable limits and to apply them only in serious cases where
the offender might otherwise be in danger o f a custodial sentence.

  333. In such situations, if the offender were judged by the court to be a com m itted football hooligan, and
were required to attend for say two hours each Saturday in the football season, to a m a xim u m o f 36 hours (ie
nearly h alf a season) or even 72 hours, he could not surely have any just grievance. The order would be less
harsh than even the shortest prison sentence and, from the public’s point o f view, much more effective.

   334. I recognise the practical difficulties in im plementing extended attendance centre orders but, if those
difficulties can be overcome, the scheme would have considerable merits. I accordingly recommend that
consideration be given to im plementing it.


Tagging
  335. A second possible measure to enforce exclusion from the ground and its environs is electronic
m onitoring or tagging. This device is used successfully in the U nited States. Pilot schem es are presently being
run here by the H o m e Office. Accused persons on remand are kept under supervision using anklets with
small radio transmitters linked to a central computer. D esp ite reports o f som e difficulty with the pilot
schemes. Mr John Patten in an answer to a Parliamentary Question on 10 January 1989 stated:-

  “It is already clear that the technology can be put to practical use and that the procedures for fitting the
  equipm ent and m onitoring defendants are practicable. It would now be desirable to test the use o f
  electronic m onitoring on a trial basis in an area in which substantial numbers are likely to be eligible for its
  application as a condition o f bail.”

Moreover, you are reported as having said to the Bow Group on 11 D ecem ber 1989:-


                                                        56
 "There is a need for courts to have powers to make curfew orders, confining offenders to their h om es at
 certain times. This should not be a 24 hour house arrest. They need to be able to go to work if they have a
 job. attend training courses or probation centres, or receive treatment for alcohol or drug misuse. But som e
 types o f crim e - pub brawls, for example, or car thefts - could be reduced by curfew orders. I very much
 hope that our experim ents with electronic m onitoring will enable it to be extended from defendants on
 remand to sentenced offenders, so as to m ake a curfew order properly enforceable".

  336. If the experiments do enable the tagging to be extended to sentenced offenders, it would be a most
useful and effective way o f ordering convicted hooligans, excluded from grounds, to remain at h om e during
designated matches. Their obedience to the orders could be monitored without excessive resource
requirements.

   337. I therefore recommend that consideration be given to using this technology in the sentencing of
offenders convicted of football-related offences.

                   PART IV - T H E FO O TBALL SPECTATORS ACT 1989

                                                  C H A P T E R 12

   338. The principal object o f the Football Spectators Act is to break the link between football and
hooliganism. It aim s to do this by a national mem bership schem e requiring spectators to purchase and hold
m em bership cards without which they will not gain admission. Th ose who com m it relevant offences or
otherwise misbehave in a football context will be deprived o f mem bership and thus be excluded from
attending matches. It is hoped that by this strategy hooligan activity will be elim inated both inside and
outside football grounds. Thus, Mr Ridley, then Secretary o f State for the Environment, said at the launch o f
the Bill on 17 January 1989:—

  “For the first time, there will be an effective and com prehensive procedure to keep hooligans away from
  football matches. O f course there will be attempts to abuse the system but if the schem e is effective, those
  attempts will fail. We believe that it offers the real prospect o f ending football hooliganism both inside and
  outside grounds. If hooligans know that they will not be allowed into football matches, they will have no
  in centive to travel to them. The link between football and hooliganism will be broken and football will
  cease to be a focus for vio len ce.”

Provisions of Part I
  339. The Statute is an enabling Act and permits the Secretary o f State to make an order by Statutory
Instrument to bring it into operation (section 27(2)). I do not propose to set out all the provisions o f the Act in
every detail. In the broadest terms, however. Part I o f the Act is to the following effect.

   340. Section 1(5) provides for a national mem bership schem e (“the sc h e m e”) to restrict “the generality o f
spectators attending designated football matches to persons w ho are m em bers o f the s c h e m e”. Section 1(2)
gives the Secretary o f State power to designate football matches or an individual match.

   341. Two new bodies are to be appointed by the Secretary o f State. The first is the Football M embership
Authority (FMA), a corporate body with articles o f association. The FM A is to be responsible initially for
drafting the schem e (section 4(1)). The Secretary o f State is empowered to approve the scheme, again by
Statutory Instrument (section 4(3)). The FM A is then to be responsible for the administration o f the schem e
(section 3(1)). Section 7 disqualifies from becom ing or continuing to be a m em ber o f the schem e anyone
subject to an exclusion order under section 30 o f the Public Order Act 1986 (after con viction o f an offence
connected with football) whilst he is so subject. Also, anyone convicted o f a relevant offence, being one o f
those listed in Schedule 1 to the new Act, is likewise disqualified. Anyone so convicted is disqualified for five
years i f he receives an im m ediate prison sentence and for two years if not.

   342. The second body is a quango to be called the Football Licensing Authority (FLA) (section 8). The
FLA is to be responsible for the grant (section 10(1)) or refusal (section 10(3)) o f a licence to adm it spectators
to any premises to watch any designated football match there. It has power to im pose conditions on the
licence (section 10(4) to (7)). to make inspections and inquiries (section 10(8)) and to vary a licence (section
 10( 10)). suspend or revoke it (section 12). In making decisions under section 10. the FLA is to have regard to
whether the equipment, the premises and the responsible persons there are such as to secure com pliance with
the scheme.

  343. The FLA also has ancillary functions, as noted earlier: first, to include in a licence, if the Secretary o f
State so directs, a condition as to seating (section 11): secondly, to keep under review and oversee the
discharge by local authorities o f their 1975 Act functions regarding football grounds and Safety Certificates
(section 13).

Contents of the Scheme
  344. Section 5(2) prescribes as follows:-

  “The schem e must include provision -

     (a) securing that the only spectators permitted to attend at designated football matches are authorised
         spectators;
    (b) providing for temporary m em bership o f the scheme, including (in particular) the temporary
        m em bership o f football club guests;

    (c) providing for the ad m ission as spectators at designated football matches, without their being
        mem bers o f the scheme, o f -

          (i)   disabled persons, and

          (ii) accom panied children,

          in such circumstances and subject to such conditions as are specified in the scheme;

    (d) securing that persons w ho are disqualified under section 7 below are excluded from membership
        while so disqualified;

    (e) providing for the exclusion from membership, for an appropriate period not exceeding two years
        determined under the scheme, o f persons w ho are, by reference to circumstances specified in the
        scheme, determined under the schem e to be unfit for m em bership and for notifying persons who are
        exclu ded from mem bership o f the grounds for the exclusion;

    (f) im p o sin g pecuniary penalties on any persons having functions under the schem e for failure to
        discharge those functions;

    (g) im posing requirements as respects the procedure to be followed in dealing with applications for
        mem bership o f the schem e and requiring that in Wales any application form for m embership o f the
        schem e shall also be available in Welsh;

    (h) im p osin g requirements on responsible persons as respects the procedure to be followed and
        equipm ent to be used in relation to any designated football match to secure that, except in an
        emergency, the only spectators admitted to and permitted to remain on the premises are authorised
        spectators;

    (i)   to such effect, in relation to the ad m ission o f spectators to the premises, as the Secretary o f State may
          specify in writing;

    (j)   establishing and maintaining a central register o f members o f the scheme;

    (k) regulating the form and contents o f m em bership cards; and

    (1)   establishing procedures for the making and consideration o f representations against decisions made
          under the schem e refusing or withdrawing m em bership o f it and for the independent review o f the
          decisions in the light o f the representations;

and in this subsection “accom panied children” means persons under the age o f 10 years in the charge o f an
authorised spectator.”

  345. Section 5(3) prescribes, inter alia, that the schem e may make provision for the im position ot charges
for m embership cards (section 5(3)(b) and by section 5(3)(c)):-

  “for the adm ission as spectators at designated football matches, without their being members o f the
  scheme, o f descriptions o f person specified in the schem e in such circumstances and subject to such
  conditions as are so specified”.

  346. My short summary o f Part I om its a number o f provisions eg the constitution o f the FM A and o f the
FLA, details o f offences, defences to them and appeals. Data Protection Act 1984 im plications etc.

Provisions of P a rt I I
  347. Before proceeding to discuss the im plications o f Part I o f the Act. which are highly controversial, I
should refer to the provisions o f Part II which are not. Although I assume my remit is limited to sports events
within the jurisdiction to which Part I applies, the schem e o f Part II is. I think, relevant.


                                                           59
  348.     The aim o f Part II is to prevent convicted hooligans from travelling to matches abroad including
m atches in Scotland and there by m isbehaviour causing trouble and damaging our national reputation.

   349. The scheme, again stated in broad terms, is to give courts power to make a restriction order after a
conviction for a relevant offence, in addition to any other sentence (section 15). Such an order is to be for five
years if it accom panies an im m ediate sentence o f im prisonment; otherwise for two years (section 16(1)). It
im poses a duty to report at a police station (unless exem pted) on the occasion o f designated football matches
abroad. Failure so to report is an offence punishable on su mm ary conviction by up to one m o n th ’s
im prisonment, by a fine or by both (section 16(5)). There is provision in section 22 for making restriction
orders consequent upon convictions in countries other than England and Wales for “corresponding offences”
to those listed in Schedule 1.

   350. Even those implacably hostile to the provisions o f Part I are mostly in favour o f Part II. In my view it
is a sensible and practicable measure to take against a persistent m isch ie f practised by a small m inority but
with national repercussions. To adapt a famous dictum, never in the field o f sport has so much od iu m been
brought upon so many by so few. The scheme is aim ed directly and solely at the few w hose m isbehaviour
abroad brings such od ium upon English football supporters generally. I welcom e it.




                                                        60

   351. Returning to Part I. it is crucial to a full evaluation o f its likely impact to know the terms o f the
scheme to be approved. At present there is no approved scheme, nor even a draft scheme, since the FM A has
not yet been appointed, although the FA and FL have been offered "first refusal" for appointm ent as such. I
do not know therefore how and in what terms such a scheme would comply with the requirements o f section 5
set out above.

  352. The only guide presently available is the Invitation To Tender (ITT) and the Statement O f
Requirements (SOR) prepared by Ernst & Young, Management Consultants, in conjunction with the
Department o f the Environment. This docum ent is directed to com p anies which have shown interest in
tendering for the contract to supply the relevant technology. T he ITT was dated 1 D ecem ber 1989 and
required tenderers to respond by 19 January 1990. As I write this report that date is still ahead and so the
response is not known. Presently there are seven potential tenderers.

General Requirements of the IT T and S O R
  353. The successful tenderer will be required to set up, manage and operate a company, the “scheme
operating com p an y ” (SOC) to run the entire scheme. It will work under the overall policy, supervision and
control o f the FMA. At the outset o f the ITT. certain key objectives have been identified as follows:-

  "1. M inim ise the turnstile process tim e and the queuing problems that might occur in large crowds close
   to kick-off and '.ccp them within acceptable limits.

   2. Fund the scheme, taking account o f its costs and also the possible disincentive effect to supporters o f
   paying membership fees.

   3. Ensure the application process, card production and issue procedures meet the requirements within
   acceptable turnaround tim es to spectators.

   4. Deal with invalid card holders at entry points and ensure that offenders against the m embership rules
   are dealt with fairly and that any punishm ent can be enforced.

   5. Keep within manageable limits the size o f the referral file containing banned members to ensure that
   speed o f access to it is acceptable and still have sufficient protection against the use o f lost, stolen, forged
   cards and pass-backs on match days.'’

  354. The SOR provides as follows:-

  " Apart from ensuring financial integrity and acceptability o f the marketing strategy, the FM A will be
    concerned to ensure that:

    1.   the number o f supporters is m axim ised while recovering the cost o f the scheme

    2.   the scheme d oes not add to problems outside grounds

    3.   the schem e assists in reducing hooliganism."

  That the schem e must be self-funding is further stressed in the ITT as follows:-

  “ The Football Membership Scheme will be self-funding, that is, the SOC will be responsible for all costs
    and expenses (including set-up costs) incurred in carrying out its obligations under the contract and
    shall reimburse the FM A for expenditure incurred by the FM A both on the SO C ’s behalf relating to the
    scheme and in respect o f the FM A fulfilling the requirements o f the Act.

   The costs o f running the FM A will also need to be recovered from the in com e generated by the SOC.

   The levels o f mem bership fees including any variations over the period o f the contract, will be subject to
   the prior approval o f the FM A".


                                                         61
Ground Modifications
  355. As to the cost o f ground modifications, the ITT notes:

  "It is anticipated that there could be a significant cost involved in accom m od ating the membership
  validation system at som e grounds. Therefore any m odifications to be made to the existing turnstile
  equipm ent and the inclusion o f any new turnstiles should be entered against this item."

Applications for Mem bership
  356. Applications for m embership o f the scheme must be made in person, not by post, using a standard
application form. The form will include personal particulars and the tyne o f application. This may be for
adult membership, renewal, replacement, change o f details, temporary, junior or senior membership. The
form will state the m embership period (normally two seasons), the applicant's nominated club allegiance,
second club allegiance and national allegiance. It will include a box to allow exclusion from any mailing lists.
The Post Office and the clubs will act as collection points for handling applications and carrying out an initial
verification process. This will require the applicant to produce evidence to prove identity and on e or more
passport standard photographs. The collecting agent will be responsible for checking the form, the
acceptability o f the photographs and their general likeness to the applicant as well as the other evidence o f
identification. He will also accept the fee.

  357. The SOR provid es:-

  " Vetting o f applications at the point o f presentation in a collection agency must be consistent and m ethods
  to ensure that vetting procedures are followed must be employed. The integrity o f the system as an
  anti-hooligan measure will depend on this vetting procedure.”

  358. The SOR states that the major problem in handling the application will be to ensure that the attached
photographs are linked to the application details to enable the subsequent correct printing o f membership
cards.

Validation Procedures
   359. 1 concentrate on applications for adult, junior or senior membership. In these cases, the SOR
provides two basic validation procedures which must be followed. The first is a “person check”, explained as
follows:-

  "The purpose o f this check is to stop supporters getting more than one membership card. The reason being
  that a ban on one m embership registration would still leave the supporter in possession o f another
  membership card. Therefore there will be both a nam e and an address check against the membership
  registration database (postcoding o f all addresses will obviously make this procedure a lot faster and it may
  be necessary to insist upon postcodes from the start). Also it is not sufficient to undertake a straight name
  and address check due to different ways to spell names and addresses. The prim e contractor should
  propose m ethods to ensure that adequate checking is undertaken against deliberate multiple applications.”

   360. Secondly, there must be a “referral file check". The referral file will contain particulars o f the
following:

  " - persons banned from membership (existing members)

    - persons who are considered to be undesirable due to their past record who have not yet applied for
      mem bership (this will include those with existing exclusion orders against them)

    - lost/stolen m embership v.ards either by direct notification or due to an application for a replacement
      card

    - fraudulent copies."

Provision and Updating of Inform ation to Clubs
  361. The national referral list will be com m unicated to all 92 League clubs. Moreover, the list will have to
be updated weekly during the football season to add fresh instances o f any o f the four categories o f exclusion
m entioned in the last paragraph: also, to remove from the list those no longer excluded £>g after a successful
appeal.


                                                       62
  362. Each club wiH also be given the names o f those successful applicants who have claim ed allegiance to
the club. From this information the club will be required to keep a register o f its own members.

Exploitation of the System
   363. The ITT provides for the F M A by itself or a designated agent to be responsible for approving and
co-ordinating the SO C ’s commercial exploitation o f the National M embership File and extracts from that
file. This is said to be “in order to protect and promote the reputation o f football to avoid any possible
conflict with existing and future com m ercial activities at a club and national level” . The FM A may also
licence clubs to use data relating to members w ho express allegiance to that club on terms and conditions to
be agreed.

.Membership Cards
  364. It is mandatory that the m embership card must carry a photograph o f the member, the m em ber’s
name, full membership number, the expiry date, club allegiance if any and national allegiance. The
membership number must be in a “m achine readable form on the card as it is the only m ethod o f rapidly
enough m atching the card against the national referral file”.

  365. The card will need to meet standards for size and durability; it will need to last for more than the
normal m embership period (two years) as this may be increased later.

  366. The security level must ensure that:

  “ - cards are not forgeable

   - photographs cannot be replaced

   - m achine readable membership numbers cannot be changed

   - printed details on the cards cannot be changed

   - supplies o f blank cards are held in a secure en vironm en t.”

  All o f this assumes that the m embership cards “will be the ‘plastic credit-card’ type”.

Entry Checking Procedures
  367. I now co m e to requirements having a critical bearing on safety and crowd control. They concern the
checks and procedures at turnstiles. The following six provisions are mandatory:

    i     A spectator must present a valid current m embership card to the turnstile operator.

    ii    “A spectator m ust be authorised to hold the membership card and be permitted to attend the
          designated match. (Note: it has been accepted that the turnstile operator will not be able to compare
          the photograph on the card with the person presenting the card as well as undertaking electronic
          checking).”

    iii   The card must not be “present on the referral file” and

    iv    can only be used “once per designated match.”

    v     "The turnstile operator must not let any person into the match without them (sic) producing a
          m embership card and validating that card using the procedures and eq u ipm en t provided.”

    vi    “The system should be capable o f directing members into their permitted sections o f the ground,
          using the primary and secondary club allegiance field (unless playing each other) in the membership
          n um ber to determine through which entry points the m em ber may pass.”

Turnstile A larm
   368. If a card fails any o f the six basic checks summ arised above, the system must alert the officials
(stewards and/or police). It must also be capable o f alerting the turnstile operator but not alerting the
spectator while in the turnstile.


                                                         63
  369. Three types o f failure are envisaged.

    (1) Referral file check shows the card is subject to a ban; card notified as lost or as stolen; alternatively,
        the card has been used previously at that match (pass-back).

    (2) Equipment/card m alfunction, mem bership expired.temporary card not valid for match.

    (3) Card being presented at the "wrong” turnstile or no card at all.

Detection
  370. The procedure to be followed in relation to each o f these three types o f failure is mandatory and
important in the evaluation o f the schem e for safety and crowd control.

  371. If the failure is o f type (1 ):—

  “The suspect should be apprehended and taken to an investigation area either inside or outside the ground.
  These will be situated at co n ven ient places around the ground. It is anticipated that there will need to be
  one investigation area on each side o f the ground, although this is likely to depend on ground c on d itio n s”.

  If the failure is o f type (2):—

  “The card will be retained at the entry point and a receipt for the card given to the spectator. This receipt
  will contain either the mem bership number or som e m ethod to identify the retained card later. The
  spectator will be advised to contact the club after the match when the problem may have been resolved”.

  If the failure is o f type (3):-

  “The spectator is turned back from the entry p oin t” .

System Contingency
  372. Systems at turnstiles must be capable o f operating “a degraded service” in the event o f system
malfunction. This must include replacement o f any malfunctioning unit within five m inutes and alternative
power supplies if the system relies on external power. If cabling is used it must be tamper p roof and more than
one route must be provided between “every turnstile installed unit” and the processing unit. Turnstile
systems must not depend on a single club com puter system.

Performance and Environmental Conditions
  373. Finally, two mandatory provisions are laid down which are o f great im portance to safety and crowd
control.

  374. As to performance the SOR provides:-

  “It is critical that the conducting o f the six basic checks and any follow-up procedures described in this and
  the next section must give rise to no significant delays to ground entry at turnstiles. The m axim um
  additional tim e which will be considered will be no more than 1 second per entry to the normal ground
  entry rate for a particular turnstile and ground configuration at all tim e s” .

  375. As to environm ental conditions, the provision is: -

  “Any systems installed at turnstile locations will have to operate reliably in the conditions experienced in
  an outdoor, all-weather, all-year environm ent. Power supplies to turnstiles will be unreliable.”

Summary
  376. As with my analysis o f the statutory provisions, this su mm ary o f the contents o f the ITT and SOR is
not exhaustive. It seeks only to indicate how the schem e is intended to work and what is expected o f it.

  377.     Having summarised the intended objects and benefits o f the schem e and the means by which it is
required to achieve them. I turn now to the arguments against the schem e raised by its critics.

  (i) Disproportionate?
  First, it is said that the scheme with all its com plex ramifications is out o f proportion to the problem.
  Setting up the technology and m aintain in g it secure and in working order: adapting grounds to install it:
  dealing with millions o f applications swiftly; issuing m illions o f cards, renewing them, coping with lost and
  stolen cards: setting up a referral list, distributing it and updating it; training staff: coping with banned
  cards and other failures at the turnstile: processing offenders; dealing fairly with appellants - these, and
  other ancillary measures, am oun t to an enorm ous undertaking. It is aim ed principally at keeping hooligans
  out o f the ground, but. so it is said, the problem inside grounds is less than it was and could be met by other
  less com plex and less am bitious strategies.

  (ii) Unfair?
  In aim ing to exclude a m inority o f hooligans from the football scene, it is com plained that the huge
  majority o f decent spectators are to be put by the schem e to trouble and expense. Each fan will have to go
  through the application procedures, presenting his form, proving his identity, purchasing and producing
  photographs. He will have to pay between £4 and £ 1 0 a year to join the schem e in addition to pay ing for
  match tickets. He will have to keep his card, remember it on match days, guard it from loss and theft, and
  renew it from tim e to tim e for further payments. Should he forget it. or lose it, should it be stolen or b ecom e
  damaged, he will be put to trouble to replace it and to gain entry to matches meanwhile. It is argued that
  measures against hooligans should target the hooligans only, not inconvenience m illions o f spectators in
  the hope o f weeding out a few.

  (iii) Casual Spectators
  There is anxiety that the schem e will, in effect, exclude from football the spectator w ho attends only on a
  casual basis or for a rare match which takes his fancy. Such a spectator, it is argued, would not go to the
  expense or trouble (especially the latter) o f buying a m embership card sim ply to attend an occasional
  match. This category o f spectator is thought possibly to account for som e 20% o f present attendances -
  sizeable numbers to be deprived o f their present freedom to watch football.

  (iv) D im inished Club Revenue
  Taking these lost casual visitors together with former regular attenders who may also find the schem e a
  disincentive, the clubs fear their revenue will be severely reduced. For this reason, inter alia, they have been
  strongly opposed to the scheme.

  (v) Danger o f Congestion a n d Disorder
  There is concern that the am bitious technology, which is yet to be produced and tested, may fail.
  Alternatively, that even i f by persistence and through trial and error, it could in the end be m ade to
  function reliably, there may be serious failures in the teething period. In either o f these events the fear is
  that congestion at the turnstiles could cause serious danger or disorder.

  (v i) Will the Schem e Defeat Hooligans?
  Even if the technology works according to plan, will it (a) exclude determined hooligans from inside the
  ground and (b) also induce them to stay away from the environs o f the ground? The criticism is that it
  may do neither o f these things, especially not the latter.

  (vii) Police Resources
  There is concern, especially from the police themselves, as to the numbers o f police to be deployed and the
  facilities they will need at the ground to cope with problems arising from the scheme at the turnstiles.
  These will involve banned cards, lost cards, stolen cards, unreadable cards and determined hooligans
  try ing by various means to buck the system.

In short, critics say the schem e proposes a sledgeham m er to crack a nut; a sledgehammer which may not
swing at all but. if it does, may not swing safely or even reach the nut.

Arguments Relevant to this Inquiry
   378. O f the seven arguments I have just briefly summarised, the first four do not bear directly upon safety
or crowd control. They may have considerable force and (ii) and (iii) do bear upon matters consid ered in Part
I o f this Report (especially better treatment o f spectators). However, they raise issues o f policy w hich are
essentially for Parliament. Accordingly, I say no more as to those four points.

  379. On the other hand, arguments (v), (vi) and (vii) do bear very relevantly upon safety and crowd
control. They are therefore within my remit and I shall explore them in turn.




                                                      66

Present R isk o f Congestion
   380. Congestion outside turnstiles and consequent injuries or disorder are already recognised risks. Those
risks are aggravated by the limited number o f turnstiles available and the limited scope for increasing them at
many old grounds. They are also increased by the late arrival o f a large proportion o f the crowd, which is a
com m on occurrence.

  381. During the last busy 20 m inutes before kick-off, queues, or som etim es a phalanx, o f waiting
spectators, tend to build up. If the delivery through the turnstiles is delayed or slowed down, that build-up
grows and its pressure further retards the turnstile operation. The next stage is that those waiting b ecom e
restive, fearing they will not get in for the kick-off. Crowd noise from the ground, denotin g that the teams are
out, increases impatience. There is then real danger o f pressure towards the turnstiles causing injuries and
panic causing disorder. This is what happened at Hillsborough. It is said that it nearly happened again,
despite Hillsborough and the interim recom m endations, at Coventry on the first day o f the new season.

Additional T im e to Check Cards
  382. These risks have existed even without a national mem bership scheme. Since the schem e requires
that all spectators passing through the turnstiles must produce their m em bership cards for checking, it is
inevitable that som e additional tim e will be taken for each spectator.

  383. In realistic acknowledgement o f the risk this might create, the ITT states as its first key objective:-

  “M inim ise the turnstile process tim e and the queuing problems that might occur in large crowds close to
  kick-off and keep them within acceptable lim its”.

  The SOR likewise requires the FM A to ensure:-

  “The schem e does not add to problems outside grounds”.

  More specifically, I repeat the mandatory provision o f the SOR as follows:-

  “It is critical that the conducting o f the six basic checks and any follow-up procedures ... must give rise to
  no significant delays to ground entry at turnstiles. The m axim u m additional tim e which will be considered
  will be no more than 1 second per entry to the normal ground entry rate for a particular turnstile and
  ground configuration at all tim e s”.

  384. Even if this is achieved, it would reduce the numbers per hour admissible through a turnstile from
the norm o f 500 (m entioned in A ppendix 3 at paragraph 33) to about 436.

  385. But can it be achieved? This depends upon two factors: (i) what has to be d one at the turnstile; (ii)
whether the technology can achieve the required rate; not only in favourable conditions but in real life and
despite attempts to defeat it.

    (i)   Procedures at the Turnstiles
  386. The six entry checks which have to be undertaken at the turnstile (see supra paragraph 367) require
the spectator to “present a valid current m em bership card to the turnstile operator”. So, in the normal case,
there will be a passing o f the card to the operator, a validation o f it by him, and a return o f the card to the
holder - all o f this to be additional to buying a ticket or (at an all-ticket match) presenting a ticket and having
the stub returned.

  387. The system as prescribed in the ITT depends upon the operator getting possession o f the card
because it has to be “retained” at the turnstile if there is a failure o f type (2) eg malfunction or card expired.
This requirement is significant when one is dealing with a tim e factor not to exceed 1 second. The schem e is
unlike that at Luton, for example, which must be quicker since (a) there are two sets o f turnstiles with an
operator only at the inner set and (b) the m em ber swipes his own card through at the outer turnstile. If the
ITT were to be changed to follow the Luton example, however, what would happen at grounds where there is


                                                         67
insufficient space for two sets o f turnstiles and how would the operator get possession o f the card so as to
“retain" it if there were a malfunction?

  388. If the turnstile alarm alerts the operator to a failure o f type (1) - a banned, lost or stolen card or
pass-back - the suspect is to be apprehended. The turnstile operator will therefore have no more to do with
him; but how long it will take to have the suspect apprehended inside or outside the turnstile will depend on
the police presence to which I shall turn later.

  389. If the failure is o f type (2), apart from retaining the card, the operator is required to give the holder a
receipt for it which “will contain either the m em bership number or som e other m ethod to identify the
retained card later”. Since the operator will be unable to anticipate the card numbers o f those which fail for a
type (2) reason, he cannot have a receipt ready in advance. If he has to make on e out. hand it to the entrant
and explain the procedure for redeeming the card later, the exercise would take considerably longer than 1
second - especially if, as would be likely, there is som e backchat.

  390. It is true that the SOR requirement that the schem e must add no more than 1 second to the turnstile
time, although said to be mandatory and critical, could be changed. However, in my view the authors o f the
SOR were right to choose 1 second as “the m a xim u m additional tim e which will be considered”. At 500 per
hour, each entrant has 7.2 seconds to go through the turnstile. Any additional tim e could cause difficulty: 1
second is an addition o f nearly 14% to the existing 7.2 seconds and more than 1 second would, as the SOR
says, be unacceptable.

  391. If the failure is o f type (3) - wrong turnstile: no card - the ITT requires that “the spectator is turned
back from the entry p oint”. The evidence I heard at Sheffield from many police witnesses, and all I have seen
and read since, makes it clear that where there are queues, let alone a phalanx, trying to get som eon e w ho is
wedged in the narrows o f a turnstile back through those waiting is at best a slow, laborious and unpopular
exercise. At Hillsborough, the crush m ade it impossible.

    (ii) The Technology
  392. It has yet to be shown that a computerised system can be produced which is capable, even in
favourable conditions, o f achieving reliably the requirements o f the ITT. So far as I am aware, nowhere has a
computerised system been installed to cope with the m assive numbers o f people, in the short period o f tim e
and in the all-weather context which will be required by this scheme, quite apart from the added problems o f
attempted disruption. The schem e therefore invites tenderers to break new ground. The fact that it has not
been done before does not, o f course, show that it cannot be done. But it d oes require greater caution and a
more extensive testing procedure than if there were a successful precedeni.

  393. The only comparable exercise which has been attempted was a Football Identity Card Schem e in
Holland. That failed in its early stages and has been shelved. However, I should stress that the Dutch schem e
was very different from that proposed under the 1989 Act. It in volved only five clubs with a bad history o f
hooliganism and it applied only to the away matches o f those clubs. Only 2 5.00 0 cards were issued. Much
depended on careful control o f ticket sales. The schem e was introduced at the start o f the 198 9/90 season.
Unfortunately, the opening m atches o f the season featured two o f the five clubs hosting two o f the others.
Ticket sales were not controlled effectively, the clubs were hostile to the scheme, away supporters were
admitted without tickets and supporters on both sides com bined to defeat the experim ent.

  394. In these circumstances. I do not think that the failure o f the Dutch schem e can found a fair argument
against the totally different scheme proposed in the 1989 Act. What it does show is the need to make any such
scheme proof against wrecking tactics.


Demonstration
   395. One o f the seven potential tenderers gave a dem onstration to a Parliamentary group using a
laboratory prototype to show the technology they could deploy. That being so, a similar dem onstration was
arranged for m e and my Assessors. We were shown a “smart-card” and how it could be programmed and used
as a football m em bership card. Each “smart-card” contains its own mini-computer. M uch in formation can
be stored inside it. T he dem onstration showed the holder passing the card over a reader and the possible
responses o f red, amber or green light, depending on whether the card was valid, doubtful or invalid.
Advertising possibilities and other packages o f benefits were also explained and illustrated.


                                                        68
  396. I was extremely impressed by what we were shown. However, this was a single card, at a single
simulated turnstile, in warm. dry. indoor conditions, without a large national referral file to be searched and
without anyone trying to circumvent or wreck the system.

Police Apprehensions
  397. I quote from the written evidence submitted by A C P O :-                           '

  "The question, however, which m ost concerns police officers relates to the efficacy o f the technology. The
  ( Act) naturally d oes not detail how it will work or what is required o f it but, it is clear that, unless it is robust
  and virtually trouble-free, it will be counter-productive. In the worst case it could be massively
  counter-productive. At the least each turnstile must have access to a national database and must be able to
  survey that database almost instantaneously. The m achine itself must be durable against sabotage . . . and
  must work without persistent fa u lt.. . .

  All our experience to date has been that com puter salesmen have offered m uch and delivered little. The
  police feel that they must be involved in the specification for any technology and would need to be satisfied
  that it works before support could be given to this scheme. The consequences o f repeated failure, hostile
  queues, interminable delays and the rest, are unthinkable”.

Computer R eliability
   398. The concern expressed in that passage about computer performance is not unduly cynical. Many
people have personal experience o f computer failures in one field or another. The com puter “going d ow n ” at
an airport causing delays at check-in, computer errors in banks, problems with computerised entrances to the
London Underground, and, recently, com puter “viruses”, are merely a few examples. These problems
continue to occur from tim e to tim e even with com puter systems which have been thoroughly tested, which
are widely used and have long ago passed through what was thought to be the teething period. In m any cases
such failures cause delay or annoyance but not danger. The technology for the present scheme, however, has
not yet been through the stage o f teething troubles. Moreover, the schem e could cause dangerous build-ups if
the technology either failed wholly or failed to work at the stipulated rate. In the London Underground,
where build-ups were occurring, a m anned entrance channel has had to be provided at many stations
alongside those which are computerised, as a safety valve. To have to open extra non-com puterised entrances
at football grounds would (unlike the Underground) scupper the system. Its whole and sole point is to exclude
hooligans by computer checking.

  399. In fact, the Act seem s to leave it open to the FMA to include in the scheme power for a person in
authority to open gates and let spectators in, whether they have m em bership cards or not, should an
emergency arise (section 2(2). section 5(2)(h), section 5(3)(c) and section 10( 12)(a)). If the exercise o f that
power should have to be considered, all the problems which arose outside Hillsborough would arise again
- deciding whether the power should be exercised or not; if so, at what m om ent and by whom; making a clear
decision and com m unicating it; coping with the in-rush and the loss o f control and o f segregation it may
cause. If the power had to be exercised, the schem e would be discredited at that place on that day and perhaps
generally.

Relaxation in an Emergency
   400. I said in the last paragraph that the Act “seem s to include power” to relax the turnstile requirements
in an emergency. But the power is only to be inferred by implication from the four sub-sections I have cited.
Nowhere is the power expressly given; nor is it said who shall exercise it or how “an emergency” is to be
interpreted. The admission o f authorised spectators only, and only by production o f their m em bership cards,
seems to be fundamental to the scheme. Yet there is no stipulation in the Act that cards have to be produced.
No doubt this could be provided for in the approved scheme. But since anyone other than an authorised
spectator com m its a criminal offence by entering the ground, admitting a non-authorised spectator is a
serious matter and could am ount to aiding and abetting a criminal offence. It is therefore surprising that the
Act does not indicate w ho is to have power to declare an emergency so as to admit all and sundry and in what
circumstances.

Tests
   401. What testing >s envisaged? The ITT provides for a “system testing strategy” . This is divided into
"laboratory” prototypes and pilot system tests. Two clubs have volunteered and been accepted to be the pilot
sites for the latter form o f testing. They are Derby County and Reading. It is envisaged that at least four
different levels o f test will be carried out at each o f the two clubs. These four levels are likely to be:


                                                           69
    i     issue m em bership cards to existing members;

    ii    issue cards to all home or away supporters;

    iii   small all-ticket match (hom e and away supporters);

    iv    large (near capacity) all-ticket match.

  402. The ITT provides:

  “Each test will try to simulate as close (sic) as possible the live situation with problem cards being used at
  random".

   403. I foresee two problems which beset this testing procedure. First, the difficulty o f making the test
conditions truly sim ulate those which will obtain when the schem e is working nationwide. For example, only
two clubs are to be used for the tests “with problem cards being used at random ”. U nless the computers at the
two clubs have to search a referral list (whether real or sim ulated) as long as the national referral list may turn
out to be, they will not have been adequately tested for capacity and speed. The estimated v olu m e o f
“banned” cards, according to the SOR, is between 5,000 and 2 0 ,0 0 0 per annum. The estim ate o f stolen and
lost cards is between 20,000 and 8 0,000 per annum. It is not clear whether “per a n n u m ” refers to the
numbers on the referral file in any given year or to the number o f fresh bannings, losses and thefts each year.
Taking the more conservative approach, however, they could jointly am ount to 100,000 per annum.
Accordingly, for a realistic test, the computers at the two clubs would have to be able swiftly to pick out the
“problem cards” from a list o f up to 1 0 0 ,0 0 0 - som ewhat different from the Luton list o f six.

  404. The size o f the referral list may have an important bearing on the speed at which the technology can
work. I repeat that key objective number 5 in the ITT stipulates:-

  “Keep within manageable limits the size o f the referral file containing banned members to ensure that
  speed o f access to it is acceptable etc”.

    How is the referral file to be kept “within manageable limits"? Its size will surely depend upon the number
o f cards banned, lost or stolen. There can be no management control o f the numbers lost and stolen and the
number banned will depend on the number o f convictions or acts o f misbehaviour meriting a ban. The only
way o f keeping the number banned “within manageable lim its” would be not to ban all those w ho may
deserve it, which would bring the schem e into disrepute.

  405. The SOR estimates that the number o f cards which are unreadable or otherwise require investigation
may be up to 3% o f the cards being checked. So at a capacity match with 50,00 0 present, the test would
require 1,500 malfunctioning cards to be randomly issued. Presumably, the number o f unreadable cards
would tend to grow during the first two years o f the schem e as the first issue o f cards accumulates damage
from rough treatment.

  406. Again, with pilot tests at only two clubs, the hooligans’ response will be unpredictable. They may try
to sabotage the schem e at the pilot clubs which would really put the technology to the test. They may,
however, prefer to misbehave at som e other ground where no tests are in progress. W hen the schem e is
im plem ented generally, they will be unable to go to any such “other ground” and m ay only then make their
attempts to sabotage the scheme.

Human Guinea-pigs
  407. The second problem is that tests can only be carried out by using real spectators. Bank computers and
other com puter technologies can be tested by putting through figures, data and print-outs. This system can
only be tested by putting through people. So in the very testing o f whether the system may cause danger,
danger may be caused.

Disruption and Sabotage
  408. The w hole raison d ’etre o f the scheme is the perceived need to elim inate from football a hooligan
elem ent so substantial, and so determined to make trouble, as to justify this enorm ous undertaking. Since the
schem e seeks to defeat such determined hooligans, it must be assu m ed that the hooligans will seek to defeat


                                                         70
the scheme. They will see it as a challenge. Wrecking or circumventing it will add a new piquancy to the
perverse pleasure they derive from their activities. Mr Ridley recognised this on the launch o f the Bill, in the
passage I have quoted, when he said :-

  “O f course there will be attempts to abuse the system but if the schem e is effective, those attempts will
  fail".

   409.   Accordingly, the technology will not only have to be capable o f fulfilling the requirements o f the
scheme without malfunction, in all weathers and at the stipulated speed. It will also have to be resistant to the
ingenuity and determination o f those who may seek to sabotage it or find a way round it. It will need to do
these things not just most o f the time, but all o f the time. This is a very tall order, and for the reasons I have
set out above. I have the gravest doubts if it can be met. Should it not be met in full, the safety implications
would be serious indeed.




                                                       71
                                                      CHAPTER 16

                                 WILL THE SCHEME W EED OUT HOOLIGANS?
  410. Even assuming that the technology can be m ade to work reliably and is not disrupted or sabotaged,
two questions still arise on whether the schem e is likely to achieve its objects, (i) Will the schem e in fact weed
hooligans out o f the ground and (ii) will they also be deterred from causing trouble outside the ground or at
places en route?

(i)     Exclusion from the Ground

  411. The strategy depends first upon the court banning the hooligan after conviction o f a relevant offence
or the FM A banning him after som e misbehaviour. But to im pose a ban is one thing; to enforce it is another.
True, the banned hooligan will not lawfully be able to enter by presenting a valid mem bership card o f his
own. o nce he is on the referral list. But he may still enter by other means.

   412. A serious defect in the schem e is the acceptance that the entry procedure will not involve checking
the photograph on the card against its presenter. Such checking is precluded by the need for speed. But the
main rationale o f having a photograph o f the m em ber on his card is defeated if it cannot be relied upon to
exclude so m eon e else from using the card and will be checked only should the user later be apprehended for
an offence. So if a banned hooligan can get hold o f a valid card he could gain entry. N ot being scrupulous by
nature, he may steal one. borrow one or even buy one, for it is not unlikely that a black market in cards will
develop. D espite requirements in the ITT to prevent such abuses, multiple applications and forgeries may
also be successfully made.

   413. It is nothing to the point to say that if a banned hooligan enters the ground by using a stolen or
borrowed card and is there arrested for an assault, he will have com m itted not on e but two offences, the
assault and the unlawful entry. He could be charged with the assault even without the 1989 Act, and without
his com m ission o f the assault, the unlawful entry is likely to go undetected. N or d oes it seem sound to say
that if he so enters and is not seen to com m it an offence in the ground, all is well. At the very least, the system
is brought into disrepute when he brags to his mates that he has beaten it. Police evidence suggests, moreover,
that the more sinister members o f hooligan gangs often do not use violence themselves, but, from a vantage
point in the ground, direct the activities o f others.

  414. I refer again to the subm ission from ACPO, a body with special knowledge o f the hooligan problem
and o f how hooligans are likely to react:-

      ‘ The success o f the proposals will eventually be judged at two levels.

      First, there is the question as to whether this legislation will:-

        (a) progressively remove hooligans from the football grounds and

        (b) deter the allegiance o f those w ho are involved in trouble and violence but do not necessarily attend
            matches.

      Second, and in a sense more fundamentally, the question remains whether or not the sim ple m echanics o f
      processing mem bership cards through turnstiles can actually be achieved.

      The police view over a long period o f tim e has been that these provisions are, to a great extent, marginal to
      the problem, if for no other reason than they cannot exclude the possibility o f fraud by people w ho are, by
      definition, hell bent upon defeating the system, and because it will take a very long tim e before a significant
      number o f potential hooligans are exclu ded by the scheme. There are som e countervailing advantages:

        (i)   the deterrent effect may be considerable;

        (ii) the club disciplinary system may well be able to take strong action on the evidence o f CCT V alone;

        (iii) the game will be able to exclude many o f the very worst offenders.

      Nonetheless, the police view is that many o f the measures that we have already taken           . .. are having a
      significant effect and are far more critical to the problem o f h ooliganism ”.


                                                              72
(ii)   Elimination from the Area and Routes Near the Ground
  415. I have already noted that hooliganism inside the ground has been reduced, largely by CC’TV, but has
been transferred outside the ground. I refer again to the submission o f ACPO:

  '‘Two aspects o f control have d one much to change the nature o f hooliganism. The legislation which
  prevented the general supply o f alcohol in transit and the universality o f C CTV have m ade a major impact.
  Taken together the effect has been that displays o f wild aggression from hordes o f drunken supporters are
  much less frequent. The hooligan has m oved out o f the camera’s range and in a word, there has been
  "displacement" away from the terraces to the darker confines o f the stadium or to other venues such as
  public houses and to the transit system ”.

   416. This, together with other police evidence I have received, shows that although football generally and
a match in particular provide the occasion and the focal point for hooligan activity, many hooligans do not
regard it as essential to be able to enter the ground. They need the converging crowds and the inter-club
rivalry or enm ity o f a match to set the scene for their violence. They do not need the football itself. Mr Ridley,
in his observations quoted above (paragraph 338) said:-

  “If hooligans know that they will not be allowed into football matches, they will have no incentive to travel
  to th e m ”.

  However, exclusion from the ground d oes not necessarily remove the in centive for hooligans to turn up
there.

   417. I fear it may be merely wishful thinking to assume that football hooligans, banned from inside
grounds, will not, if they are free to do so, turn up and cause trouble outside, in public houses or in the town.
It would be surprising if hooligans o f Mr Justice Popplewell’s group I (paragraph 48 supra) were totally to
abandon their activities o f attacking and baiting away supporters just because they could not themselves get
into the ground.

  418. It is argued by advocates o f the schem e that elim inating hooligans from outside the ground, as well as
inside it, has been achieved at Lutcn. However, the success at Luton does not in my view bear directly upon
the likely ou tcom e o f the national scheme. The main factor in Luton’s success has been the ban on away
supporters which removes the focus for violence. There are also the other factors already noted, the
geographical position o f Luton, the comparatively small attendances and the fact that the Luton schem e has
operated at only one club.

  419. I therefore have grave doubts whether the schem e will achieve its object o f elim inating hooligans
from inside the ground. I have even stronger doubts as to whether it will achieve its further object o f ending
football hooliganism outside grounds. Indeed, I do not think it will. I fear that, in the short term at least, it
may actually increase trouble outside grounds.




                                                         73
                                                 C H A P T E R 17

                                            P O L IC E R E S O U R C E S

   420. The schem e envisages that the checking procedure at turnstiles will let valid card holders through but
will produce the three types o f failure already described. Each o f those three types o f failure may involve an
offence by the person presenting the card and the first type is quite likely to do so. There will therefore have to
be police present to apprehend the suspect, investigate the circumstances and, it may be. make an arrest. I
have already quoted the estim ated failures o f types (1) and (2) anticipated in the SOR. Even assuming the
estimates are correct for the grounds as a whole, there will be no means o f knowing how many “problem
cards’’ will be presented at any particular bank o f turnstiles. There will need to be enough police to be able to
monitor each turnstile throughout the ad m ission period. If a banned card is presented, the entrant will need
to be taken by an officer to “an investigation area”. The S O R anticipates there will need to be one
investigation area at each side o f the ground. Presumably, staff there will be equipped with the m eans to
investigate the problem card fully. It may then be necessary for the suspect to be arrested and processed.
Whilst the officer who has apprehended him is away from the turnstile through which the suspect came,
further card holders should be com in g through the sam e turnstile at a rate o f about 1 per 8 seconds or faster.
There will therefore need to be enough officers to cope with further problem cards. Even if the apprehending
officer merely takes the suspect to an investigation room and hands him over to officers stationed there
before returning to his post, the turnover rate at the turnstiles would need a substantial number o f officers.
Requiring stewards to do the job may be inappropriate since arrests may have to be made. Again, if the
suspect realises he may be about to be arrested, he may seek to rush o f f and lose h im self in the crowd. So
dealing with presenters o f “problem cards” may have to be d one solely by the police. If the schem e showed,
after an initial period, that the incidence o f “problem cards” had settled down to a m odest number, the police
co m m itm ent could be reduced. But initially, considerable numbers will be needed to perform these functions
in addition to those habitually undertaken.

  421. Police anxiety about this com m itm e n t o f resources is su mm arised as follows by ACPO:

  “The second level at which the technology causes concern relates to procedures following a “red light” at
  the turnstiles. Policing at turnstiles at present is very selective and the Police Service could not
  countenance providing the sort o f cover which would allow for a quick response to each turnstile in the
  event o f a problem. The only powers conferred in the Bill are on the police and on the face o f it every
  attempt to enter which activates a “red light” suggests an offence is being com m itted. At Manchester
  U nited for exam ple 30 .000 people will pass through the turnstiles in just over 20 minutes before kick-off.
  There are about 100 turnstiles and the prospects o f policing this system are absolutely daunting”.

  422. The exam ple o f Manchester U nited in that passage is confirm ed by the club itself in a paper on the
national m em bership schem e entitled “A U nited Perspective”. At page 3, the club says:

  “We have yet to be shown the com puter hardware that will do the work successfully. Manchester United
  has run a com puterised box office for more than 15 years now and it is well known that what is promised by
  com puter com panies rarely, if ever, performs to anything like its supposed potential in “ real” situations
  where they may have had no experience. Average attendances at Old Trafford are around 4 0 ,0 0 0 but on
  occasions this figure can go as high as 56,000. Experience shows that around 50% arrive in the last 30
  minutes before kick-off and this number increases substantially for evening m atches.”

   423. There is a risk therefore that, at big matches, police control o f procedures at the turnstiles during the
last 20 minutes before kick-off, in addition to their present duties, may create serious problems. Apart from
the numbers o f officers needed, space will have to be found for investigation rooms. It is doubtful whether
one “ investigation area” at each side o f a ground like Old Trafford will suffice. I therefore have strong doubts
about the practicality o f policing the scheme effectively.




                                                         74

                       S T R A T E G IE S A G A IN S T H O O L I G A N I S M - C O N C L U S I O N S

  424. 1 fully understand and respect the reasons which prompted the prom otion and enactm ent o f the
Football Spectators Act 1989. However, it follows from my com m en ts in the last three chapters that I have
grave doubts about the feasibility o f the national mem bership scheme and serious misgivings about its likely
impact on safety. 1 also have grave doubts about the chances o f its achieving its purposes and am very anxious
about its potential impact on police co m m itm e n ts and control o f spectators. For these reasons, I cannot
support the im plem entation o f Part I o f the Act.

Suggested Strategy
  425. As has been said many times, there is no single measure which will defeat football hooliganism and
even a package o f measures will take tim e to have effect.

  426. That said, the strategy 1 would suggest is to consider relying upon a com b ination o f all or som e o f the
following m easures:-

    (i)   D eveloping the detection and evidential potential o f CCTV and the new N ational Football
          Intelligence Unit;

    (ii) Prohibiting, by creating criminal offences, three specific activities in the ground:

          (a) throwing a missile;

          (b) chanting obscene or racialist abuse;

          (c) going on the pitch without reasonable excuse;

    (iii) Extending the courts’ power to make attendance centre orders, in conjunction with exclusion orders,
          for football related offences on occasions o f specified matches so as to keep hooligans away from
          football grounds;

    (iv) U sin g electronic m onitoring (tagging) for the same purpose.

   427. These four measures are all aim ed solely at the hooligans and will impinge only on them. Moreover,
(iii) and (iv) are the only measures, other than im prisonment, aim ed not only at banning hooligans from the
ground but also at preventing them from getting into it or near it during matches. Put together with progress
towards all-seating, im proved accom m od ation, better facilities, improved arrangements for crowd control
and better training o f police and stewards to achieve it. I believe these m easures would give the best chance o f
eliminating or m inim ising football hooliganism.




                                                            75
                             PART V - FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS
A ll-S eated A ccom m odation
  1. The Secretary of State should ensure that spectators are admitted only to seated accommodation at
matches played at sports grounds designated under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 in accordance with
the timing set out in Recommendations 2 to 4 below.

  2. Recommendation 1 should apply with effect from the start of the 1993/4 season at high-risk matches as
defined under the UEFA Regulations set out in paragraph 82 above.

  3. Subject to Recommendation 2 above, Recommendation 1 above should apply with effect from the start of
the 1994/5 season to all matches at grounds in the first and second divisions of the Football League, the
Premier Division of the Scottish Football League, and at national stadia, subject to a reasonable extension of
time in the case of a club promoted to the second division of the Football League or the Premier Division of the
Scottish Football League. Standing accommodation at these grounds should be reduced annually by 20% of the
present standing capacity (such present standing capacity to be calculated according to Recommendation 8
below), the first 20% deduction being effective from August 1990 so as to eliminate standing by August 1994.

  4. Subject to Recommendation 2 above. Recommendation 1 should apply with effect from the start of the
1999/2000 season to all matches at all other grounds designated under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.
Standing accommodation at these grounds should be reduced annually by 10% of the present standing capacity
(such present standing capacity to be calculated according to Recommendation 8 below), the first 10%
deduction being effective from August 1990 so as to eliminate standing by August 1999.

Advisory D e sig n Council
  5. The Football Association and the Football League should establish an Advisory Design Council whose
functions should be:

    (a) to conduct and marshal research into the improvement and design of football stadia;

    (b) to disseminate regularly such information and expertise as they acquire in this field to members of the
        Football League and, on request, to other football and sports clubs in England, Wales and Scotland.

N a tio n a l Inspectorate and Review Body
  6. (a) If Part I of the Football Spectators Act 1989 is implemented, section 13 should be brought into force
giving the Football Licensing Authority the functions and powers therein specified (power to review the
discharge of functions by local authorities). If Part I of the Act is not implemented or is substantially delayed,
other arrangements should be made for the discharge of the functions and powers in section 13 of the Act by the
appointment of a body to exercise them.

      (b)       In either event, the body exercising those functions and powers in relation to association football
should also be entrusted with similar functions and powers regarding the discharge by local authorities of their
certifying and licensing functions in relation to other sports grounds and sports entertainments pursuant to the
Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 and Parts III and IV of the Fire Safety and Safetv of Places of Sport Act
1987.

M a x im u m C ap acities for Terraces
  7. Where a viewing terrace is divided into pens or areas which are self-contained, the Safety Certificate
should specify the maximum number of spectators to be admitted to each such pen or area.

A pen or area is to be deemed “self-contained” notwithstanding that it has a gate or gates affording access to
another pen or area and whether such gate or gates be open or shut.

  8. Each figure for maximum capacity should be assessed in accordance with Chapter 16 of the Green Guide
(“the Green Guide figure”) subject to the following qualifications:-

    (a) the maximum density permitted under paragraphs 221 and 222 of the Green Guide (w hen the terrace
        or viewing slope is in good condition) should be 47 not 54;
    (b) the minimum figure specified in paragraphs 221 and 222 (when the terrace or viewing slope materially
        deviates from the recommended guidelines, so as to constitute a possible hazard to individuals closely
        packed) should be 0 not 27;

    (c) in arriving at "the Green Guide figure", proper and realistic allowance must be made for all factors
        which should reduce the permissible density including those specified in paragraphs 220 to 224
        inclusive of the Green Guide.

  9. Arrangements should be made:-

    (a) to limit the number of spectators entering each self-contained pen or area to the maximum capacity
        figure assessed in accordance with Recommendation 8 above either electronically, mechanically, by a
        ticketing arrangement, by counting or otherw ise, and

    (b) to close off further access to such pen or area w hen its maximum capacity is about to be reached.

  10. The maximum notional rate at which spectators can pass through a turnstile should be 660 persons per
hour, not 750 per hour as stated in paragraph 47 of the Green Guide. The maximum rate for any particular
turnstile must take full account of all circumstances including those given as examples in paragraph 47.


Filling and M on itorin g Terraces
  11. There should be a written statement of intent, agreed between the club and the police, setting out their
respective functions as to crowd safety and control and in particular as to the filling of each self-contained pen or
other standing area and the monitoring of spectators in each such pen or area to avoid overcrowding. Any
variation of the document in respect of an individual match should be agreed in writing in advance.

  12. (a) At each match, there should be on the perimeter track, for each self-contained pen or other standing
area (subject to (b) below), a steward (if the club is monitoring that area) or a police officer (if the police are
monitoring it) whose sole duty is to check crowd conditions in that area for possible overcrowding or distress
throughout the period the area is occupied by spectators. W hoever is so appointed should be in addition to any
other steward or police presence. He should have ready access to a police officer who can authorise access
through gates to the pitch under Recommendation 20 below.

      (b)       This Recommendation need not be applied to any self-contained pen or other standing area w here the
spectators present, or reasonably to be expected, during a particular match do not exceed one third of the area’s
maximum permitted capacity, or 2,000, w hichever is the lower.


G angw ays
  13. Gangways should be kept clear, in accordance with paragraphs 97 to 99 of the Green Guide. Gangways
should be painted in a conspicuous colour w hether they are sunk or not. The Safety Certificate should require
that no standing is allowed in gangways and that they be painted.


Fences and G ates
  14. All spikes or similar constructions on perimeter or radial fences, and any sections overhanging or
returning inwards towards spectators, should be removed.

  15. Perimeter fencing should be no higher than 2.2 metres, measured from the top of the fence to the lowest
point at w hich spectators may stand, and including any wall or other foundations forming part of the perimeter
boundary.

  16. All police officers and stewards with duties in relation to the standing areas and especially those with
duties under Recommendation 12 above, should be fully briefed and trained with regard to the recognition of
crowd densities, to the recognition of signs of distress and to crowd dynamics. Training should include
demonstrations at the ground and photographs, designed to enable stewards and officers to recognise different
crowd densities.

  17. There must be provided in any perimeter fence of a pen or other self-contained area sufficient gates of a
minimum width of 1.1 metres to enable that pen or area to be evacuated onto the pitch in the time prescribed for
an emergency evacuation of that pen or area.


                                                         77
   18. All gates in radial or perimeter fences of pens or other self-contained areas should be painted in a
different colour from the rest of the fence and marked "Emergency Exit”.

  19. Where there is a perimeter fence in front of a pen or enclosure, all gates to the pitch should be kept fully
open during the period when spectators are in the pen or enclosure, wherever those in command feel that this
can safely be done. Whether they be fully open, partially open or closed, they should be kept unlocked
throughout the period when the pen or enclosure is occupied.

   20. Each gate in a perimeter fence affording access to the pitch from a pen or enclosure should be manned by
a steward or by a police officer w hen the pen or enclosure is occupied. Whether such manning should be by a
police officer or by a steward should be decided by the Police Commander. In either event, the Police
Commander should appoint one or more police officers with power to authorise access through gates to the
pitch immediately in the event of an emergency.

  21. Suitable and sufficient cutting equipment should be provided by the club at each ground where there are
perimeter fences to permit the immediate removal of enough fencing to release numbers of spectators if
necessary. Agreement should be reached as to whether the equipment should be used by police, the fire brigade
or stewards. Whoever is to use it should be trained to do so. Whether to use it should be a decision of a
nominated senior police officer at the ground.


C rush Barriers
   22. All crush barriers should be visually inspected each year for signs of corrosion. Any barrier found to be
affected by a significant degree of corrosion should be repaired or replaced.

   23. The layout of barriers in each pen or terraced area should be reviewed immediately (if this has not
already been done following the Interim Report) to ensure that it complies with the criteria contained in
Chapter 9 of the Green Guide. If it does not, the assessment of the maximum capacity figure for that pen or
terraced area, in accordance w ith Recommendation 8 above, should reflect the fact.


Safety C ertificates
   24. The Secretary of State should exercise his powers under either section 6(2) or section 15(A) of the Safety
of Sports Grounds Act 1975 so as to make mandatory in Safety Certificates those conditions specified in the
original section 2(2) of the 1975 Act. So far as the original section 2(2)(b) is concerned "shall” should be
substituted for “may”.

  25. In assessing these mandatory requirements in the Certificate for a particular ground, the local authority
should follow the Green Guide criteria. Once that is done, the resultant figures and terms for that ground
should be specified in the Safety Certificate and no variation from them should be permitted other than by
formal revision.

  26. Where a local authority incorporates any provision of the Green Guide into the Safety Certificate, other
than one within the scope of Recommendation 25 above, it should make clear whether that provision is to be
complied with absolutely or with discretionary flexibility.

  27. There should be an immediate review of each Safety Certificate (if this has not already been done
following the Interim Report) by the responsible local authority, which should consult the club in respect of
which the Certificate is issued, the police, the fire service, the ambulance service and the building authority.
Such a review should include an inspection of the stadium. Its object should be to ensure that the operative
conditions of the Certificate are complied with and to add or substitute any condition shown to be necessary as a
matter of urgency follow ing the findings and Recommendations in this Report.

  28. Any local authority within whose area there exists a sports ground designated under the 1975 Act for
w hich no Safety Certificate has yet been issued should proceed forthwith to remedy the situation.

  29. Every Safety Certificate should be reviewed by the local authority at least once annually and each
Certificate should require to be renewed annually.

  30. Each local authority should review its arrangements for issuing, monitoring, enforcing, reviewing,
amending and renewing Safety Certificates (if this has not already been done following the Interim


                                                        78
Report). Such review should require that there exists or is provided an accountable administrative structure
whereby the functions of the local authority are regularly and effectively supervised by senior officers and
elected members and decisions are properly taken in accordance with the local authority’s rules.

   31. To assist the local authority in exercising its functions, it should set up an Advisory Group (if this has not
already been done) consisting of appropriate members of its own staff, representatives of the police, of the fire
and ambulance services and of the building authority. The Advisory Group should consult representatives of the
club and of a recognised supporters’ organisation on a regular basis. The Advisory Group's terms of reference
should encompass all matters concerned with crowd safety and should require regular visits to the ground and
attendance at matches. The Advisory Group should have a chairman from the local authority, and an effective
procedure. Its resolutions should be recorded and it should be required to produce regular written reports for
consideration by the local authority.


D uties of E a c h Football C lub
  32. Each turnstile should be inspected and its potential rate of flow measured (if this has not already been
done following the Interim Report). Thereafter, regular inspections should be made to ensure that each turnstile
remains capable of admitting spectators at the rate anticipated.

  33. The correlation between each viewing area in the stadium and the turnstiles serving it should be such as
to ensure that all the spectators intended to be admitted to that viewing area can pass through the turnstiles
within one hour. If that cannot be done, the capacity of that viewing area should be reduced accordingly. Since
this Recommendation includes terms and conditions within the scope of the original section 2(2)(c)(i) of the
Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 it should be given effect in the Safety Certificate (see Recommendation 24
above).

  34. Turnstiles should be closed when the permitted capacity of the area served by them is about to be reached
and arrangements should be made to ensure quick and effective communication with turnstile operators for this
purpose.

  35. Closed circuit television should be so installed as to enable crowd densities outside the ground, within
concourse areas and in pens and other standing areas, to be monitored before, throughout and at the end of a
match.

  36. All signposting for spectators both outside and inside the ground should be comprehensively reviewed (if
this has not already been done following the Interim Report). It should, in relation to the arrangements for each
match, be unambiguous, eye-catching, simple and clear and should be designed to ensure the rapid movement of
spectators to their appropriate view ing areas. Any redundant signs should be removed.

  37. Information on tickets should be unambiguous, simple and clear and should correlate absolutely with the
information provided in respect of each match both outside and inside the ground. Retained ticket stubs should
contain information necessary to guide spectators once inside the ground.

  38. Information on tickets requesting spectators to be in position by a particular time should be reviewed (if
this has not already been done following the Interim Report) by clubs in conjunction with the police to ensure
that it corresponds with the planned arrangements for admitting spectators to the ground.

  39. Clubs should consider maintaining a record on computer of ticket sales before the day of the match, for
season tickets and tickets for all-ticket matches for seated areas, containing the names and addresses of those
purchasing tickets.

  40. All-ticket matches should be confined to those at which a capacity or near capacity crowd is expected.
When a match has been designated all-ticket, clubs should not sell tickets at the match and should take steps to
advise the spectators of both clubs accordingly.

  41. Each club should consult with a recognised supporters’ club as to the provision of pre-match
entertainment aimed at attracting spectators to the ground in good time.

   42. Clubs should recruit and retain sufficient competent stewards. They should be fit, active and robust, and
preferably between the ages of 18 and 55. Clubs should ensure that stewards are fully trained, aware of their
duties under Annex B of the Green Guide and under the statement of intent (see Recommendation 11) and able
to perform them.


                                                         79
  43. The club should provide a police control room which is:-

    (a) well placed, so as to command a good view of the w hole pitch and of the spectator area surrounding it;

    (b) of sufficient size for the commander, his deputy and enough officers to operate the radios, telephones
        and CCTV screens. There should be space for others w ho may need from time to time to visit the room
        eg other senior officers, club management or a member of the emergency services;

    (c) well equipped with CCTV, radio and telephone facilities and, where necessary, sound-proofed against
        excessive crowd noise.

  It should be the duty of the club to provide a room and equipment to the satisfaction of the chief officer
nominated under Recommendation 44 below.


P olice P lan nin g
  44. The Chief Constable of each police force in whose area there is one designated sports ground or more
should nominate a chief officer to liaise with the management of each football club and local authority
concerned in respect of the safety and control of crowds.

   45. The Operational Order for each match at a designated sports ground, and the pre-match briefing of all
officers on duty there, should alert such officers to the importance of preventing any overcrowding and, if any is
detected, of taking appropriate steps to remedy it.

  46. The Operational Order for each match at a designated sports ground should enable the police to cope
with any foreseeable pattern in the arrival of spectators at a match and in their departure. It should provide for
sufficient reserves to enable rapid deployment of officers to be made at any point inside or outside the ground.

  47. Police planning should provide that ticketless fans should not be allowed to enter a designated sports
ground except in an emergency.

 48. Arrest procedures inside and outside designated sports grounds should be reviewed so as to keep to the
minimum the period during which an arresting officer is away from his post.

  49. The option to postpone kick-off should be in the discretion of the officer in command at the ground.
Crowd safety should be the paramount consideration in deciding w hether to exercise it.

  50. Consideration in consultation with the club should be given, especially for high-risk matches, to the
possibility of an early kick-off or a Sunday fixture.

  51. There should be available in the police control room the results of all closed circuit television monitoring
outside and inside the ground and the record of any electronic or mechanical counting of numbers at turnstiles
or of numbers admitted to any area of the ground. Officers in the control room should be skilled in the
interpretation and use of these data.

   52. Consideration should be given to the provision of a specific training course for senior officers presently
acting as Police Commanders and those in line to do so. Such a course should include training in the basic
strategy of policing football matches.

  53. Police authorities should review the charges they make to clubs for the costs of policing inside grounds so
as to ensure that realistic charges are made. The Home Office should take steps to ensure consistency of
practice, subject to local discretion and the need to have regard to local circumstances.


C om m unications
  54.     There should be sufficient operators in the police control room to enable all radio transmissions to be
received, evaluated and answered. The radio system should be such as to give operators in the control room
priority over, and the capacity to override, others using the same channel. Additional channels should be used,
where necessary, to prevent overcrowding of the airwaves.


                                                       80
  55. There should always be a command channel reserved solely for the Police Commander to communicate
with his senior officers round the ground.

   56. To complement radio communications, there should be a completely separate system of land lines with
telephone links between the control room and key points at the ground.

  57. W ithin the control room, there should be a public address system to communicate with individual areas
outside and inside the ground, with groups of areas or with the whole ground. Important announcements should
be preceded by a loud signal to catch the attention o f the crowd despite a high level of noise in the ground. This
arrangement should be prominently advertised on every programme sold for every match.

  58. U se should be made where possible o f illuminated advertising boards to address the crowd.


Co-ordination of Emergency Services
   59. T he police, fire and ambulance services should maintain through senior nominated officers regular
liaison concerning crowd safety at each designated sports ground.

  60. Before each match at a designated sports ground the police should ensure that the fire service and
ambulance service are given full details about the event, including its venue, its timing, the number of spectators
expected, their likely routes of entry and exit, and any anticipated or potential difficulties concerning the
control or movement o f the crowd. Such details should be readily available in the control rooms of each of the
emergency services.

  61. Lines of communication, whether by telephone or by radio, from the police control room to the local
headquarters of all emergency services should be maintained at all tim es so that emergency calls can be made
instantly.

  62. Contingency plans for the arrival at each designated sports ground o f emergency vehicles from all three
services should be reviewed. They should include routes of access, rendezvous points, and accessibility within
the ground itself.

  63. Police officers posted at the entrances to the ground should be briefed as to the contingency plans for the
arrival of emergency services and should be informed when such services are called as to where and why they are
required.


First Aid, Medical Facilities and Ambulances
  64. There should be at each sports ground at each match at least one trained first aider per 1,000 spectators.
The club should have the responsibility for securing such attendance.

  65. There should be at each designated sports ground one or more first aid rooms. The number of such rooms
and the equipment to be maintained within them should be specified by the local authority after taking
professional medical advice and should be made a requirement o f every Safety Certificate.

  66. (a) At every match where the number o f spectators is expected to exceed 2,000, the club should employ a
medical practitioner to be present and available to deal with any medical exigency at the ground. H e should be
trained and competent in advanced first aid. H e should be present at the ground at least an hour before kick-off
and should remain until half an hour after the end o f the match. H is whereabouts should be known to those in
the police control room and he should be immediately contactable.

       (b)        At any match where the number o f spectators is not expected to exceed 2,000, the club should make
arrangements to enable a medical practitioner to be summoned immediately to deal with any medical exigency
at the ground. H e should be trained and competent in advanced first aid. The arrangements made should be
known to those in the police control room.

  67. At least one fully equipped ambulance from or approved by the appropriate ambulance authority should
be in attendance at all m atches with an expected crowd o f 5,000 or more.

   68. T he number o f ambulances to be in attendance for matches where larger crowds are expected should be
specified by the local authority after consultation with the ambulance service and should be made a requirement
of the Safety Certificate.


                                                        81
  69. A "major incident equipment vehicle”, designed and equipped to deal with up to 50 casualties, should be
deployed in addition to other ambulance attendance at a match where a crowd in excess of 25,000 is expected.


Offences and Penalties
 70. Consideration should be given to creating an offence o f selling tickets for and on the day o f a football
match w ithout authority from the home club to do so.

  71. Each of the following activities at a designated sports ground should be made a specific offence:-

    i.    throwing a missile;

    ii.   chanting obscene or racialist abuse;

    iii. going on the pitch without reasonable excuse.

  72. Consideration should be given to extending the courts’ powers to make attendance centre orders for
football related offences on occasions of designated football matches. The provision should be capable of
imposition on an offender aged 21 or over and subject to a maximum o f 72 hours in the case o f an offender aged
17 or over.

  73. Consideration should be given to the use o f electronic monitoring (tagging) in the sentencing of offenders
convicted of football related offences.


Green Guide
  74. As a matter of urgency, the H om e Office should set up a body to revise the Green Guide in accordance
with this Report, these Recommendations and the Report o f the Technical Working Party (Appendix 3).

  75. In any revision o f the Green Guide, the values to be achieved by way o f percentage recovery after the
required loading tests on crush barriers should be specified. Acceptable values for various materials should be
specified.

  76. When the Green Guide is revised, the need to inspect crush barriers for possible corrosion should be
specifically mentioned and emphasised.

                                                                                                 22 December 1989


Dear Sir Peter

You invited the Technical Working Party “to review technical aspects o f the guide to Safety at Sports
Grounds; identify areas requiring clarification or amendm ent; and recom m end accordingly.” I have pleasure
in submitting its Report, which has been agreed by all members. D etailed supplementary notes dealing with
certain o f the technical features will be available for your use in due course.

We note that the G u id e is not confined to football grounds and stadia but includes guidance on all sports
grounds, and we have borne this in m ind in our considerations. Although not within our terms o f reference,
and for that reason not addressed in our Report, we recognise that efficient and effective stewarding is an
integral element o f crowd control and safety. Our recom m endations com plem ent, rather than supplant, the
need for such stewarding.

The Technical Working Party m et first on 18 October and held five formal day-long m eetings supplem ented
by many working papers and informal discussions during the period available for report. The heavy pressures
o f the timetable could not have been a ccom m od ated w ithout the fullest co-operation o f those concerned, and
I record my thanks to all members o f the Technical Working Party and to its Secretary for the integrity,
com m itm ent and enthusiasm with which they approached the task.

                                                                                          LEONARD M A U N D E R




                            R E P O R T O F T H E T E C H N IC A L W O R K IN G PARTY

The Green Guide
    1. The Technical Working Party recognises the valuable contributions o f successive editions o f the G u id e
to Safety at Sports Grounds, co m m o n ly known as the Green Guide. Its scope and status are described in its
introduction as follows: “This booklet provides guidance to ground m anagement, local authorities and
technical specialists such as engineers on measures for im proving spectator safety at existing sports grounds.
It is a voluntary guide and has no legal force”.

   2. In view o f the variability o f existing sports grounds in function and in scale, there are serious difficulties
in establishing com prehensive and general regulations, backed by legal force, to cover all the com plex details
o f design and construction. Adherence to the standards set by Building Regulations should provide a
measure o f uniformity in respect o f new work at sports grounds. Nevertheless, the Technical Working Party is
strongly o f the op inion that a much higher degree o f standardisation than presently prevails should be sought
in practice.

  3. It considers that a revised issue o f the Green G u id e should form the basis on which a designated ground
or stand is certified by the certifying authority, and recom m ends that any departures from its guidance on
technical provisions that may arise from local circumstances should be fully defined and should be subject to
approval in writing by the certifying authority.

A Centre of Expertise
   4. The Green G u id e covers a w ide range o f material, m uch o f which concerns the physical characteristics
o f grounds. Its successive issues have been published in response to a num ber o f serious accidents at football
grounds. This process has led to incremental advances in the G u id e as experience has grown, but the
Technical Working Party does not believe that such a process, although essential, is by itself sufficient to cope
with present-day requirements.

  5. Many British football grounds were first constructed a long tim e ago, and im provem ents have been
introduced largely on an individual basis. A central body o f knowledge applicable to the com plex design o f



                                                         89
such grounds has been conspicuously absent although a start has now been made. As a result, progress has
been piecemeal.

   6. The Technical Working Party considers that this is a serious defect. A continuous and expanding body
o f public knowledge, drawn from the relevant professional fields, is required to provide a basis for good
individual designs at modern standards. At a time when substantial im provem ents are under consideration,
including a higher proportion o f seated accom m od ation, it is imperative to establish and to disseminate
rigorous standards o f design if expectations are to be fulfilled. The work o f organisations in other countries,
including the C om itato Olim pico N azionale Italiano (CONI), can provide a valuable reference. The
Technical Working Party recognises, too, the important work undertaken in this country by the Sports
Council. Its recent guide to the planning, design and management o f indoor arenas is a noteworthy attempt
to draw together a considerable body o f research and practical experience. Similarly, other work on outdoor
stadia has taken place and is currently proceeding under the C oun cil’s aegis. It is important that resulting
publications should be widely disseminated and that any guidance on outdoor stadia should make particular
reference to the structural aspects o f safety, comfort and crowd control.

   7. The Technical Working Party therefore recom m ends the formation o f a central body, under a title such
as the Advisory Council for Sports Grounds, to provide an authoritative source o f knowledge for all those
involved in the design and construction o f outdoor stadia. A detailed specification o f its structure and
funding is not proposed at this stage but, as envisaged, its mem bers would be drawn from the relevant
professional fields and would com m ission specialist advice when necessary. It would be independent o f any
Inspectorate. The relationship o f such a body to other organisations is a matter for further discussion, but it
is suggested that the Football Association and the Sports C ouncil might wish to play leading roles.

Seating and Standing
  8. The Technical Working Party notes that FIFA has agreed regulations on seating for certain classes o f
football matches, and that the regulations are to be im posed within a short time-scale. It also recognises that
the British tradition o f standing on terraces runs counter to these international requirements.

   9. It is clear that if British clubs are to continue within the international com m unity, they will be obliged
to close their standing accom m od ation for matches that fall within the FIFA definition. For other matches,
the Technical Working Party recognises that, whilst standing a ccom m od ation is not intrinsically unsafe, the
benefits to spectator comfort and crowd control brought about by all-seater stadia are likely to accelerate the
m ove towards such venues. The Technical Working Party accepts, however, that although the introduction o f
all-seater stadia for leading, well-supported football clubs may be both beneficial and practical, clubs in the
lower divisions may find it less so and the removal o f all standing accom m od ation at these grounds may
affect their viability. Alterations to seating from standing arrangements at existing grounds may have both
design and cost im plications through the impact on such matters as spectator sight-lines and crowd density.

   10. In addition, it must be recognised that there are many sports (horse, greyhound, m otor racing and car
rallying for example) where the nature o f the sport favours the m obility o f large sections o f the crowd and
where viewing from standing areas is an essential element. Any recom m endations towards all-seater stadia
must therefore be carefully worded.

Capacities
   11. The Technical Working Party recognises that the safe allowable capacity o f any viewing area, whether
seated or standing, is the least o f (i) its holding capacity, (ii) the num ber o f persons w ho can leave through a
normal exit system within a prescribed tim e at the end o f an event, (iii) the num ber o f persons w ho can leave
through an emergency exit system within a prescribed tim e, and (iv) the num ber o f persons who can be
admitted through the turnstiles serving that area within o n e hour.

   12. The theoretical holding capacity o f a seated viewing area is sim ply the num ber o f seats in good
condition which com ply with the relevant Green G u id e recom m endations including those relating to
distance from exits and gangways and size and spacing. D eterm ination o f the holding capacity o f a viewing
terrace or slope is not so simple: factors that must be taken into account include the strength and spacing o f
the crush-barriers, the position o f gangways, the d im en sio n s and physical state o f the steps, the effective
standing area, and the acceptable packing density.

   13. A packing density o f 5 .4 /m 2 is recom m ended in the current Green G uide as the m axim u m allowable
figure for terraces and viewing slopes that meet all the specified guidelines. A reduced figure o f 2 .7 /m 2 is



                                                        90
presently recom m ended for areas deviating materially from the guidelines. The Technical Working Party sees
no point in retaining reference to the lower figure and recom m ends that there should be no lower limit to the
reduction; ie if the enclosure had such poor safety standards that it was totally unfit as a viewing area the
figure should be zero.

  14. As to the m axim u m figures, the Technical Working Party concludes that a uniformly distributed
density o f 5 .4 /m : should be safe in static con d itions where the terraces are in full com pliance with the Green
Guide. It recognises, however, that there will be variations o f density within a given enclosure, and allowance
should be m ade to accom m odate this factor in the final determination.

   15. The Technical Working Party recom m ends that the m axim u m allowable average packing density
determined by the Inquiry should establish a general reference for certifying authorities. For an individual
ground, the packing density applicable to a given standing area should be derived from this figure, the full
figure for areas in good condition and reduced figures for areas in poorer condition. D etailed calculations o f
holding capacities should then be determined on the basis o f the agreed packing density for that specific
enclosure or other relevant factors. These calculations should take into account specific features o f the
crush-barriers and fences and o f step d im ensions as illustrated in the Green Guide. The Technical Working
Party recom m ends a thorough review o f the exam ples currently contained in Chapter 16 o f the Green Guide,
and the inclusion o f appropriate diagrams.

Structural Elem ents
   16. It is a fundamental requirement o f safety that structures at grounds should provide spectators with
safe accom m od ation and safe m eans o f ingress and egress. They should also enable police and stewards to
exert proper control over crowd m ovem ents. If a conflict should occur between these objectives, a substantial
re-arrangement may be required; in no circumstances should safety standards be com prom ised. The
Technical Working Party recom m ends that references to sub-divisions in Chapter 14 o f the Green G u id e be
reviewed with these considerations in mind, and that the Chapter as a w hole should reflect these principles
more positively.

Separation of Viewing Areas and Pitch
   17. The Technical Working Party recognises the im portance o f physical barriers as deterrents to pitch
invasions. It also recognises that not all viewing areas present the sam e risk, and recom m ends that
consideration be given to differentiating those areas requiring higher levels o f security from other areas, such
as seated accom m od ation and m em bers’ enclosures, where a lesser degree o f security might be acceptable.

   18. The general principle o f separation endorsed by the Technical Working Party is that the means
adopted should provide sufficient security against pitch incursions to enable the police to take timely and
effective action should such incidents occur. Clearly a balance has to be struck between crowd control and
safety.

    19. A configuration recom m ended for wider consideration consists o f a perimeter barrier on the
pitch-side backed by a parallel and continuous crush-barrier on the terrace-side, set back from the perimeter
barrier so as to provide a clear walk-way between the two; except in emergencies, spectators would not be
allowed to enter the walk-way. Such an arrangement would reduce the risks associated with a com m on feature
o f British grounds, namely that the front steps o f terraces are substantially lower than the level o f the pitch:
im m ediate attention should be given to the elim ination o f this hazard.

  20. The Technical Working Party recom m en ds that the m axim um height o f perimeter fences should be
determined in relation to the UEFA standard o f 2.2in. It also recom m ends the removal o f overhanging
sections and spiked or barbed-wire attachments at the tops offences.

   21. A form o f separation increasingly adopted in new stadia is the dry moat. To be effective, a dry moat
must be sufficiently w ide and deep, and should be protected by fences on both sides to ensure that spectators
and players do not fall into it. Where enough space is available, a moat may offer an a ttracthe solution, but
its application to older grounds is likely to be restricted by limitations o f space.

Emergency A ccess to Pitch
   22. The Technical Working Party recom m en ds that emergency access to the pitch should be provided
from all adjacent viewing areas. It considers the provision o f gates or gaps in any formal barrier to be in all
cases advantageous for the evacuation o f adjacent enclosures and essential except where adequate, safe


                                                          91
•
    alternative arrangements exist. Where fences, barriers or m oats are installed the majority view o f the
    Technical Working Party is that there should be clear gangways leading to emergency exits on to the pitch.
    Such gangways must be properly identified and kept clear at all times. T he exit gates or gaps should be at least
     1.1 metres w ide or as wide as the gangways feeding into them, whichever is the larger and should be sufficient
    in d im en sion s and spacing to allow evacuation o f the enclosure within a prescribed time. The Working Party
    recorded a minority view that the need to police gangways exacerbated friction on terraces, and that
    gangways were not always essential for proper crowd control and safety.

    Crush Barriers
      23. A review o f the procedures for inspection and testing o f barriers is recom m ended. The Technical
    Working Party considers that greater em phasis should be given to thorough recorded and certified annual
    visual inspections o f all crush barriers. Particular attention should be given to the d evelopm en t o f corrosion.

      24. It is further recom m ended that 25% o f barriers, evenly spaced through each enclosure as designated by
    a com petent engineer, continue to be tested each year. In addition, all barriers which the in spection has
    identified as o f possibly sub-standard condition should also be tested.

       25. The adopted test m ethod should be capable o f applying to barrier rail, post and foundation anchorage,
    a loading equivalent to a uniformly distributed load 1.20 x the design load o f the barrier as at present.

        26. The test procedure should be revised in line with current practice for structural testing to incorporate
    (i) a detailed visual inspection o f the barrier, (ii) a bedding-in cycle taken to a percentage o f the design loading
    and (iii) a single cycle o f p roo f testing taken as at present to 1.20 x the design loading. D eflections at all
    significant points should be recorded.

      27. After the full p roof load has been held for a m in im u m o f five m inutes the deflections should be
    recorded prior to release o f loading and the permanent residual unloaded deflections recorded after the load
    has been released.

      28. The Technical Working Party recom m ends the adoption o f two criteria for acceptable structural
    performance (i) that no significant defects, including corrosion, are revealed by inspection and (ii) that the
    percentage recovery o f deflections after release o f the load during proof-testing achieves acceptable values.
    The specific values required will depend on the materials o f construction.

      29. The Technical W'orking Party recom m ends that the distinction currently drawn in the Green G uide
    between “peak” and “n on-peak“ viewing areas for the purpose o f assessing barrier spacing should be
    abolished. All areas should com ply with the peak viewing specifications.

    Stands
      30. A substantial part o f Chapter 10 o f the Green Guide, ‘Roofed Stands with Seated A cc o m m o d a tio n ’,
    deals with temporary structures. It is recom m ended that this material should be placed in a separate Chapter,
    and that it should give explicit references as required to British Standards and to applicable regulations.

       31. The remainder, which might be called ‘Covered Standing and Seated A c c o m m o d a tio n ’, should clarify
    the special requirements for safety that are in volved, noting that fire risk is not the only hazard and that
    statutory control o f the requirements may be vested in different authorities. Appropriate references to
    Building Regulations should be made. It is important to ensure that all spectators can be cleared into safe
    protected escape routes within prescribed times, although such routes need not be exits from the stand as a
    whole.

    Ingress/Egress
      32. The current Chapters on Ingress and Egress in the Green Guide (Chapters 5 and 6) contain much
    useful information, but are nonetheless in need o f som e revision. Consideration was given by the Technical
    Working Party to the possible amalgamation o f features com m on to both ingress and egress, but despite the
    com m on ground it is recognised that em phases might well differ. The Working Party does not therefore
    recom m end amalgamation o f the individual Chapters.

    Ingress
      33. The Technical Working Party felt that Chapter 5 needed expansion to incorporate additional clauses
    on (a) the positive counting and recording o f those passing through each turnstile: (b) the location o f


                                                              92
amenities inside the ground to avoid obstructing or disrupting the How between turnstile and enclosures: (c)
the sub-division o f enclosures; (d) the adequacy o f well distributed entrances into large enclosures to
facilitate even packing; and (e) the design o f entrances so as to avoid local pressure on spectators caused, for
example, by downward ramps. Informative diagrams should be adopted and general principles laid down,
wherever possible. T h e Technical Working Party would not favour the introduction o f numerical examples
which might, in any event, be difficult to establish. It views the current m axim u m notional flow rate per
turnstile o f 750 persons per hour (as set out in paragraph 47 Green Guide) as too high, and recom m ends a
figure o f 500 as the median for a normal turnstile. Furthermore, it recom m ends that variations up or down
be approved by the certify ing authority, subject to a m axim u m upper limit o f 6 60 persons per hour.

Egress
  34. Greater cross-referencing with other Chapters is required, and the Technical Working Party favours
expansion or a m endm ent o f a number o f paragraphs. In particular, the density figure set out in paragraph 54
in respect o f reservoir areas is felt to be too high, and the members o f the Technical Working Party
recom m end that, where reservoir areas cannot be removed from egress routes, a lower density o f 35-40
persons per 10 sq metres be substituted. The Technical Working Party favours greater emphasis on
networking, and believes that the Green G u id e should include a stipulation that each ground produce proper,
networked plans, delineating all aspects o f ingress/egress.

Enclosures/Turnstiles
  35. The Technical Working Party strongly recom m ends that there should be a direct one-to-one
relationship between banks o f turnstiles and enclosures in order to maintain accurate counts o f entries. A
review o f the current state o f League grounds had shown that sub-divisions such as had occurred at
Hillsborough wer; uncom m on, and had generally been initiated by police for crowd control. Where such
sub-divisions do exist, it is imperative that the total number o f spectators entering each sub-division should
be counted separately.

Stairways and Ramps
  36. The Technical Working Party notes the dangers presented by stairways and ramps, particularly those
used by the public in large numbers, and recom m en ds extensive redrafting o f the Green G uide to present
more sharply the hazards involved. It recognises that the standards o f safety required for stairways and ramps
which form part o f the access between enclosures and an exit and those which exist as gangways within
enclosures differ and recom m ends that the differences be explained in more detail. Particular attention
should be given by certifying authorities to acceptable upper limits on the gradients o f ramps and stairways.
The m axim u m gradient for ramps set out in the current Green G uide was felt acceptable.

  37. Similarly, the Working Party believes that the channelling o f flows by the provision o f handrails should
be given greater emphasis. The recom m ended width o f channel for both stairways and ramps should not
exceed three persons (unit widths) in line abreast, and the width o f up to 1.8 metres permitted by paragraph
76 should therefore be reduced accordingly. Handrails should extend, by at least 300m m beyond the top and
bottom o f any stairway or ramp.

  38. The difference between handrails, balustrades and barriers on or near the top and bottom o f stairways
and ramps, and their appropriate strength requirements, needs to be clarified.

  39. The Technical Working Party recom m ends the inclusion in the Green G u id e o f a greater number o f
diagrams illustrating the potentially hazardous situations in relation to stairways and ramps and o f the
principles behind the provisions.

Inspections and Tests
   40. Inspection and tests o f all equipm ent and structures at grounds are vital features o f good operation.
Their range is wide, extending from visual inspection before and after each event to regular testing o f
structural com ponents. It is a matter o f serious concern that the interpretation o f requirements by those
responsible is unacceptably variable. The Technical Working Party considers that action should be taken to
ensure that com m o n high standards o f inspection and test are realised, and makes the following
recommendations.

  (i)   The Green G uide should include a com prehensive tabulation o f inspections and tests covering the
        essential technical features o f grounds. It should prescribe the m inim u m frequencies at which the
        inspections and tests should be conducted.


                                                       93
  (ii) The required levels o f com p eten ce o f those carrying out the inspections and tests should be defined.

  (iii) Records o f the results o f in spections and tests, including the identification o f defects and the remedies
        adopted, should be certified by those carrying out the work.

  (iv) A national Inspectorate should be established to oversee the adoption o f com m on standards o f
       inspection and test. Its terms o f reference should include the com pilation and maintenance o f a
       national register o f organisations employed to carry out inspections and tests; central recording o f the
       extent and type o f the inspections and tests adopted at individual grounds; and the provision o f advice
       on inspection and test for those responsible for carrying out the work ^nd for certifying authorities. It
       would be in the interest o f com m on standards if an Inspectorate o f this kind dealt with the grounds o f
       all relevant sports, and consideration should be given to its formation through an association o f their
       governing bodies.

Fire Safety
  41. There is general recognition amongst Technical Working Party members that the current Chapter on
Fire Safety (Chapter 11) is well-defined. It contains much useful advice on egress and means o f escape,
application o f which is not restricted to fire risks and which would bear repetition in other Chapters.

   42. The Technical Working Party considers that it is essential to maintain sim ple, clear lines o f authority
and com m unication; independent input from individual bodies is to be avoided. With that in mind, its
mem bers believe that consultation on all safety matters should be directly with the certifying authority who,
in turn, would consult with the fire, police, and other authorities.

Emergency/Auxiliary Power
  43. The Technical Working Party considers that the current Green G u id e contains insufficient
information on auxiliary power. It recom m ends a separate chapter on the topic with a requirement that
emergency power should be sufficient to maintain an adequate level o f lighting, and public address system
and to operate any electronic gates, alarms etc for a period o f three hours from the tim e o f failure o f the
normal supply.

Communications
  44. The Technical W'orking Party considers that too little weight has in the past been attached to the need
for a com prehensive com m un ication s system, capable o f reaching both inside and outside the ground.

   45. Chapter 12 o f the Cireen G uide therefore requires substantial am en dm en t to reflect the im portance o f
effective com m un ication s systems, the need to make use o f high-technology equipm ent, and the value o f
closer co-operation between club and police personnel. The Technical Working Party considers that Interim
R ecom m en dation s 31-34 should be retained permanently and incorporated into the Green Guide.

Disabled Spectators
  46. The current Green G uide fails to address the specific problems encountered by disabled spectators
and the Technical Working Party recom m ends the introduction o f a Chapter to cover these aspects. It should
deal in particular with Ingress and Egress and with the provision o f self-contained viewing areas.




                              S U M M A R Y O F M A IN R E C O M M E N D A T IO N S

The Green Guide
   1. A higher degree o f standardisation in stadia design and construction is required. An updated and
revised Green G uide should form the basis on which a designated ground or stand is certified. It should
incorporate appropriate diagrams and refer to relevant Building Regulations.

Advisory Body
  2. There should be a single, central body (called perhaps the A dvisory Council for Sports Grounds) to
provide an authoritative source o f knowledge for all those involved in the design and construction o f stadia.


                                                         94
Seating/Standing
  3. Whilst standing accom m od ation is not intrinsically unsafe, all-seater stadia bring benefits to spectator
comfort, safety and crowd control. The im plem entation o f higher proportions o f seated accom m odation
should be governed by com m on high standards o f design and construction.

Capacities
   4. Capacity depends on standards o f ingress, egress and safety generally as well as the acceptable packing
density and the effective area o f the accom m odation. The current m axim um packing density o f 5 .4 /m 2
recom m ended in the Green G uide for standing terraces should be safe in static conditions where the terraces
are in full com pliance with the Green Guide. It should be recognised, however, that densities normally vary
over an enclosure, and an allowable average figure should reflect this consideration. T h e reduced figure o f
2 .7 /m 2 should be abolished and there should be no specified lower limit. If an enclosure has such poor safety
standards that it is totally unfit as a viewing area, the figure should be zero.

Separation of Viewing Areas and Pitch
  5. Consideration should b e given to different perimeter arrangements appropriate for different areas o f a
ground.

  6. The means o f separation adopted should provide sufficient protection against pitch incursions without
com prom ising spectator safety. T h e m axim u m height o f fences should be determined in relation to the UEFA
standard o f 2.2 metres. Overhanging sections and spiked or barbed-wire attachments should be removed.

  7. Attention should be given to the elim ination o f spectator viewing from front steps o f terraces which are
substantially lower than the level o f the pitch.

Emergency A ccess to the Pitch
  8. Emergency access to the pitch should be provided from all adjacent v iewing areas.

   9. Exit gaps or gates should be at least 1.1 metres w ide or as w ide as the gangways feeding into them,
whichever is the larger. All gangways must be clearly identified and must be kept clear o f spectators in normal
circumstances.

Crush Barriers
   10. A review o f the procedures for inspection and testing o f barriers is recom m ended. Greater em phasis
should be given to thorough recorded and certified annual visual inspections o f all crush barriers, and to the
establishment o f an unam biguous testing procedure.

Stands
   11. The Green G u id e should contain a separate C hapter on temporary structures, with appropriate
references to applicable regulations and British Standards.

Ingress
   12. The current m axim u m notional flow rate per turnstile o f 750 persons per hour is too high. A figure o f
500 should be adopted as the median with a m axim um upper limit o f 660 persons per hour. Variations from
the m edian must be approved by the certifying authority.

Egress
  13. Where reservoir areas cannot be removed, a lower density o f 35-40 persons per 10 sq metres should be
adopted. Each ground should produce networked plans delineating all aspects o f ingress and egress.

Enclosures/Turnstiles
   14. There should be a direct on e-to-one relationship between banks o f turnstiles and corresponding
enclosures. Where sub-divisions exist, it is im perative that the totals entering each sub-division are counted
separately.

Stairways and Ramps
  15. The recom m ended width o f channels should not exceed three persons (unit widths) in line abreast.
Handrails should extend by at least 30 0 m m beyond the top and bottom o f any stairway or ramp. The design
and strength o f handrails, barriers and protection on or near stairways or ramps should be clearly defined.
Ramps should not produce dangerous crowd pressures.


                                                       95
I n s p e c t io n a n d T e s ts
   16. A ction should be taken to ensure that co m m o n high standards o f in spection and test are realised. A
national Inspectorate should be established to oversee the adoption o f such standards. Its terms o f reference
should include com pilation and m aintenance o f a national register o f organisations em ployed to carry out
inspections and tests; central recording o f the extent and type o f inspections and tests at individual grounds;
and the provision o f advice.

C o m m u n ic a t io n s
   17. T he Green G u ide should be am ended substantially to em phasise the im portance o f effective
co m m u n ica tio n s system s capable o f reaching both inside and outside the ground.

D i s a b le d S p e c t a t o r s
    18. T he Green G u ide should contain a separate Chapter to cover this subject.

  2.1 W hen my Interim Report was published, it might have been thought by som e that the suggestions
which I set out had only recently been considered. It was said to be unfair to expect the football clubs to have
taken earlier steps to arrange their affairs. It was urged that they should now be entitled to more tim e and
more m oney in order to deal with the problems o f crowd control and safety at their grounds. The problem o f
crowd control and safety had, so it was said, suddenly arisen. I have to say that almost all the matters into
which I have been asked to inquire and alm ost all the solutions I have proposed have been previously
considered in detail by m any distinguished Inquiries over a period o f sixty years.

The Shortt Report
  2.2 On 11 June 1923, the then Secretary o f State for the H o m e D epartm ent asked the Rt H on Edward
Shortt KC to form a C om m ittee to inquire, am ongst other things, into arrangements m ade to deal with the
abnormally large attendances on special occasions, especially attendances at athletic grounds. This arose
from disorder which occurred at W embley Stadium on the occasion o f the first Cup Final on 28 April 1923.
The C o m m ittee reported on 13 March 1924. T he Report was presented to Parliament and published as
C om m and Paper 2088 at the princely sum o f 6d.

  2.3 About responsibility for control inside grounds the Report had this to say:

  “As regards the general question o f the apportionment of responsibility inside the ground as between the
  police and the ground authority, the principle to be followed should, in our judgment, be that the police should
  be responsible for all matters appertaining to the preservation of law and order and that for arrangements for
  the convenience o f the public the ground authority should be responsible. It is, however, most important not
  only that the police arrangements should be under the control of a single officer, but also that the duties for
  which the ground authority is responsible should be assigned to a definite individual, who should be
  competent to give instructions and to deal with any incident which arises. If responsibility is definitely
  allocated in this matter it appears to us that, in ordinary circumstances, there need be no difficulty in this
  division of duties and that no disadvantage need result from the existence of dual control so long as the closest
  co-operation is maintained between the two authorities at all times. We are of the opinion, however, that if any
  emergency arises or there appears to be the slightest probability of a disturbance, it is essential that control
  should pass into the hands of one individual, and we recommend that, in the case o f grounds providing
  accommodation for more than 10,000 persons, on all occasions when specially large attendances are
  anticipated or for other reasons unusual excitem ent is to be expected, arrangements should be concerted
  beforehand by which one individual can at any moment take control of the situation.”

  2.4. That paragraph o f the report continued:

  “T he question in such circumstances would have become one of the preservation o f law and order and we
  therefore have no doubt that the control should then pass into the hands o f the senior police officer present,
  and we consider that such officer would be justified in any circumstances, whether in accordance with a
  pre-arranged schem e or not, in assum ing control if he considered it necessary for the purpose o f the
  restoration of order. A s part o f the arrangements for this purpose we think that, in the very large grounds,
  there should be a central control box in telephonic communication with all parts of the ground and that the
  principal police and ground officials should be stationed there so that they may be in constant touch with the
  situation.”...(Paragraph22).

  2.5 About stewards the Report said:

  “We understand that there is no uniform practice with regard to the employment of stewards at sports
  grounds, that in som e cases they are only used to show spectators into the seating accommodation, and
  that, in cases where stewards are employed for packing of the standing room, they are only employed when
  there are specially large crowds. We consider it desirable in the interests of safety that, for the purpose of
  handling a crowd, stewards should be employed in any case where the crowd is likely to approach the capacity
  of the ground. For seating accommodation stewards should always be employed. It is in the highest degree
  important that any such stewards should be properly trained in their work and intimately acquainted with the



                                                          97
  part o f the ground placed under their charge. We doubt whether it is practicable to secure suitable men for
  this purpose unless they are given continual experience in the work, and we therefore recommend that every
  ground with a capacity exceeding 10,000 which provides terraced accommodation for its spectators should
  maintain, or have a call upon, an adequate staff o f efficient stewards, and should ensure that they keep
  proficient by requiring them to perform duty at frequent intervals. Stewards should be organised as a
  disciplined body and should act under the control and supervision o f their own officers. They should wear a
  distinctive badge o f authority, which they should not be able easily to discard." (Paragraph 27).

  2.6 The Report had this to say about precautions against fire:

  “We have been somewhat surprised to find that in many cases little or not precaution is taken against the risk
  of fire in stands. We do not suppose that either the risk or the consequences o f fire would be so serious in an
  open stand as in a closed building, but we consider it most important that adequate arrangements should be
  made to deal with any outbreak which might occur.” (Paragraph 40)

but concluded generally:

  “We are assured that these governing bodies are only too anxious to secure that their sport is carried on under
  conditions which will promote the public safety, and we feel that at this stage it is safe to leave the matter to
  them.” (Paragraph 47).

The M oelwyn H ughes Report
  2.7 The next report (published as C m n d 6846) arose out o f the disaster at Bolton Wanderers' Football
Ground on 9 March 1946. Mr R Moelwyn Hughes KC was appointed by the then H om e Secretary to conduct
an enquiry into the circumstances o f the disaster which arose by the presence o f som e 85.00 0 spectators.
50.000 had been expected. Because o f the press o f people in an enclosure two barriers collapsed and 33
people were killed.

  2.8 It is interesting to observe that the previous best attendance at Bolton in the 1945-46 season had been
43 .0 0 0 and it was amply policed by a force o f 60. On this occasion there were 103 police to control 85.000
spectators, which is about 1/10th o f the present ratio o f police to spectators at football grounds both inside
and outside the ground.

  2.9 Mr Hughes made a num ber o f recom m endations. He said:

  “Burnden Park is typical of m ost home grounds of the leading football teams in the country. They have grow n
  stage by stage from humble beginnings on sites acquired when the large gates of these days were not
  anticipated, or when the clubs had not achieved eminence. It would be idle to suggest that the grounds, or
  large sections of them, should be rebuilt, but if they are to be made reasonably safe and if the risk o f repeating
  the tragedy of Burnden Park is to be avoided, then, I have formed the clear view that the following steps must
  be ta k e n . . . " (Page 10).

  2.10 The r ecom m en dation s included inspections o f the enclosures, scientific calculation o f the m axim u m
number to be allowed entry, counting those entering the ground by mechanical means and central
co-ordination o f the system, all to ensure the adm ission o f a safe num ber o f spectators.

  2.11 So far as future regulation was concerned the Report said:

  “T he preceding safety measures cannot be secured without legislation. A Departmental Committee reporting
  on Crowds to a previous H om e Secretary in 1924 (Cd 2088) anaemically recommended that adequate
  provision for safety be left to the pressure of the governing bodies in sport. The most important of these was,
  of course, the Football Association, w hich had not deigned to appear before the C o m m ittee. . .

  The legislation should empower the H om e Secretary to issue general regulations for different kinds of
  grounds and the broad conditions necessary for safety.

  N o ground of any considerable size should be opened to the public until it has been licenced by, I suggest as an
  appropriate licensing authority, the local authority. T he issue of the licence would depend upon satisfying the
  authority as to the construction and equipment of the ground, its compliance with regulations and the
  proposed maximum figures o f admission to the different parts.”



                                                         98
  2.12 Mr Hughes went on to say:

  “Compliance with the recommendations of this Report will cost money. They will involve grounds in a loss of
  gate money on popular d a y s . . . The insurance for greater safety for the public demands a premium."

Mr Hughes ended his report by saying:

  “I earnestly hope that, if the proposals I have made in this Report, or similar suggestions, commend
  themselves to you, Parliament will not be slow in granting you the necessary powers." (Pages 11-12).

The Chester Report
  2.13 Mr Hughes’ words fell on d ea f ears. It was another 22 years before there was a further report
com m ission ed by the G overnm ent on the problem s o f football. In June 1966. the then Secretary o f State for
Education and Science appointed Mr N orm an Chester CBE, as he then was (Warden o f N uffield College,
Oxford), to chair an Enquiry. His terms o f reference were:

  “To enquire into the state o f A ssociation Football at all levels, including the organisation, management,
  finance and administration, and the means by which the game may be developed for the public good; and to
  make recommendations.”

  2.14 Mr Chester m ade this observation about crowd behaviour:

  “In recent years there has been an increase in disorderly behaviour by spectators. During the period
  1946-1960 there were 195 cases brought to the attention of the FA, an average of 13 per season. In the
  following six seasons 148 cases were reported, an average of 25 per season. The matter was discussed some
  time ago at a meeting between representatives of a number o f police forces (including the British Transport
  Police), the Football Association and the Football League. Both these governing bodies have been very
  concerned at this development.”

  2.15 T he Report continued:

  “We have not been able to devote the time and resources to the study of this problem which its complexity
  deserves. We very much welcome the initiative of the Birmingham Research Group, of which Dr J A
  Harrington is Research Director and have been fortunate enough to see the Group’s preliminary report. We
  are sure that its findings will be of value to all concerned.” (Page 97).

The Harrington Report
  2.16 This was m ade to the then M inister o f Sport.1 It observed:

  “Som e spectators carry knives, hammers, sticks and spikes, choppers, and other offensive weapons like
  powdered pepper which are not necessarily used for violent purposes but may be used in threatening displays.
  There is also the problem of singing or chanting bawdy or obscene songs and phrases som e of w hich are also
  threatening and provocative.” (Page 8).

  2.17 About riots the Report said:

  “W hile such riots must be regarded as alm ost unknown accompaniments of football in this country, their
  potential seriousness and danger were exemplified recently by football riots in Turkey, where many people
  were reported killed. W hile comparable riots seem unlikely here, it would be foolish to rule out the possibility
  of much more serious crowd disturbances at football matches than we have yet experienced.” (Page 9).

  2.18 T he Report regretted inactivity thus far:

  “The question of public safety and crowd control at football m atches was dealt with by a departmental
  committee report published in 1924 (Cond. 2088) and the inquiry into the disaster at the Bolton Wanderers
  Football Ground in 1946 (Cond. 6 9 4 6 ) . . . Unfortunately the most helpful suggestions in these reports have
  often been ignored, though the committee’s recommendations do carry some weight with boards of football
  clubs”.

  2.19 T he Report went on:

  “The absence o f national legislation outlining minimum standards o f safety and amenity at football grounds
  means that som e club managements do not feel obliged to put their grounds into a state considered by the
  police to be necessary for crowd control.” (Page 33).

                                                            99
  2.20 And continued:

  “ We feel that improved ground facilities would not only help to deal with the hooligan problem but do
  som ething towards its prevention. Clubs often seem keener to spend money on the purchase of players than to
  undertake any major spending on ground improvement which would increase safety and make hooligan
  control easier. The loss of revenue w hich a club may suffer from alterations may be the determining factor.
  There is of course no obligation on a club to convert a ground w hich can accommodate 50,000 to one w hich
  takes a smaller number in conditions o f greater safety and comfort. Letters from members of the public
  suggest that already some are staying away because o f their dislike o f poor facilities, overcrowding, and
  disturbances, so that the neglect of ground improvement may ultimately be self defeating.” (Page 34).

  2.21 So far as responsibility is concerned, the Report said:

  “We think that those responsible for club management and the governing bodies of football should accept far
  more responsibility for keeping their crowds in order. T h is applies not only within the stadium itself but to
  club supporters travelling in groups to and from matches. One gets the impression that som e clubs disclaim
  any responsibility for the behaviour of their supporters and if the atmosphere of a Roman holiday is not
  deliberately fostered it is looked on with considerable tolerance. Football matches are commercial enterprises
  conducted for profit on private premises and clubs have therefore a heavy responsibility for keeping order and
  safety for the public on their prem ises.” (Pages 35-36).

  2.22 In its summary the Report concluded:

  “The solution of the problem of hooliganism in the football stadium is ultimately the responsibility of
  individual clubs who must each deal with it in the light of local circumstances. W hile a few clubs are
  exemplary in their attitude to the problem others are laissez-faire and need persuasion to take a more active
  role in trying to control hooliganism in their own grounds. T his laissez-faire attitude does not help the police
  in their attempts to deal with the matter.” (Page 56).

The Lang Report
   2.23 Shortly thereafter, a Working Party under the chairmanship o f Sir John Lang G C B and including a
number o f distinguished members, was appointed by the then Minister with special responsibility for Sport
to exam in e the problems involved in football crowd behaviour to which attention had been called a few
m onths previously by the Harrington Report. Sir John’s Report was presented on 21 N ovem ber 1969.

  2.24 By way o f introduction it said:

  “T he Working Party was dealing with a subject which has been discussed a most ad nauseam during recent
  years. N ot unexpectedly the Working Party has not found a single simple solution for a problem which is
  often due to a combination of fa ctors. . . ” (Page 3).

    2.25 The m embers o f the Inquiry w itnessed the dem onstration o f C C T V equipm ent and reported:

    “. . . the view was formed that closed circuit television could be of value in the general subject o f crowd
    control and . . . would be an important factor in preventing misbehaviour by spectators at grounds. It was a
    refinement which most o f the top class clubs could be expected eventually to have as a matter o f course.”
    (Page 9).

  2.26 About alcohol the Report said:

  “There can be no doubt that consumption o f alcohol is an important factor in crowd misbehaviour, both
  because it stimulates quarrelsomeness and because empty bottles are dangerous m issiles. There would be no
  advantage in refusing licence facilities to football club grounds - this would merely stimulate spectators to
  bring their supplies from outside.” (Page 14).

The Wheatley Report
  2.27 On 4 February 1971 the Rt H on Lord Wheatley was asked by the then Secretary o f State for the
H om e Departm ent and the then Secretary o f State for Scotland to make an independent appraisal o f the
effectiveness o f existing arrangements for crowd safety at sports grounds in Great Britain, and o f the
improvements which could be brought about within the present framework o f the law. and to consider the
nature o f any alterations in the law which appeared to be needed. This arose from the disaster at Ibrox Park
where 66 spectators died.


                                                        100
  2.28 On 16 March 1972 Lord Wheatley com pleted his Report and it was presented to Parliament and
published by H M SO as Cmnd. 4952.

  2.29 The Report contained a technical Appendix. Following the Report, the Safety o f Sports Grounds Act
1975 was passed. A licensing system in volving the issue o f a safety certificate for designated grounds was
introduced and supporting guidance (the Green Guide) was published. In his Report Lord Wheatley said:

   "I recognise that a decision to introduce a licensing system for grounds along the lines I have recommended
   may cause anxiety to some football clubs and football administrators. As I see it, their m isgivings are
   associated with a fear that such stringent conditions might be attached to the granting o f a licence that
   many clubs may not be able to afford the cost and som e may have to go out of business.” (Paragraph 66).

   2 .30 “M y answer to that is this. M y task was to consider the problem of crowd safety at the grounds. Clubs
   w hich charge the public for admission have a duty to see that their grounds are reasonably safe for spectators.
   That is a primary consideration. It is accordingly necessary that some standards should be imposed and
   observed. T his has been recognised by the football authorities themselves . . . I have canvassed all the
   alternatives that have been proposed or w hich I personally thought were reasonable to consider, and the one
   which I decided was best to meet the situation in the interest of the public is the licensing system by a local
   authority. There is nothing new in this proposal. It has been mooted for alm ost fifty years. It can come as no
   surprise to the football world, and in the light of happenings over the years the demand for an independent
   appraisal and determination of the safety of grounds becomes almost irresistible. I certainly cannot resist it.”
   (Paragraph 67).

   2.31 Lord Wheatley ended his Report by saying:

   “I trust that this Report may be of assistance to you in deciding what should be done to solve this
   important question of crowd safety in football grounds. One thing is certain. T he public demand for
   something to be done has been growing over the years. I am sure I am reflecting public opinion when I say
   that som ething must be done now. The evidence certainly supports that view.”

The M cElhone Report
 2.32 In October 1976 the then Secretary o f State for Scotland asked Mr Frank M cElhone MP to chair a
Working Group on Football Crowd Behaviour.

   “to consider the problems caused by some Scottish football supporters and to make recommendations to
   the Scottish Football Association and other organisations concerned.”

  A m ong the mem bership o f the Working Group were representatives from the football authorities, from the
football clubs and the Strathclyde Police.

   2.33 In the introduction to the Report2, Mr M cElhone said:

   “There is no simple solution to the problem; it is but one o f the manifestations of anti-social behaviour
   besetting society in general today. We have however in our findings arrived at a number of conclusions and
   recommendations which we hope, given a commitment to implement them on the part of all those most
   closely concerned, will go some way towards reducing the problem o f hooliganism at football matches and
   by so doing turn football grounds once again into places of entertainment where parents can take their
   children to enjoy, in relative comfort and safety, the pleasures of our national game."

   2.34 The Report observed that:

   “A hooligan is a hooligan no matter where he operates and the fact that his behaviour is conspicuous at a
   football match has very often nothing to do with the game itself.” (Paragraph 4).

   Mr M cElhone saw the problem as one o f trying to reduce, or at least contain, the incidence o f hooliganism
at football matches without restricting the pleasure o f the majority o f supporters.

•
       2.35 So far as drink was concerned, the Report recom m ended that it should be an offence for a spectator
    to carry or attempt to carry alcohol into a football ground; that is should be an offence to be in possession o f
    alcohol within the ground or to attempt to gain adm ission while drunk. The Report recom m ended that more
    people who were physically capable o f carrying out the duties o f enforcem ent would have to be recruited and
    suggested that, in their recruitment o f stewards, clubs should look to their supporters' clubs to assist in
    providing the kind o f men required for the job. So far as transport was concerned, the Report recom m ended
    that it should be an offence for anyone to be in possession o f alcoholic liquor on a vehicle hired specifically
    for the purpose o f carrying passengers bound for a football match; or to allow any alcoholic liquor to be
    carried on a public service vehicle being used for the purpose o f carrying passengers to football matches; or to
    allow the carriage o f any drunken person on such a vehicle bound for a football match.

      2.36 So far as the separation o f supporters was concerned the Report recommended;

      “That in the interests o f crowd control and safety, separation of rival supporters at turnstiles should be
      carried out if the police, in consultation with the club, consider such a step to be necessary; that for matches
      where larger than average attendances are expected, sufficient turnstiles should be opened timeously in order
      to achieve speedy admission." (R ecom m en dation 13).

      “In order to protect players, match officials and the pitch, access to the playing area should be made as
      difficult as possible. To prevent an invasion o f the playing area by spectators ... the erection o f a physical
      barrier in the form of a fence not less than 1.8 metres in height with access points to allow the pitch to be used
      if necessary for the evacuation of spectators in an emergency.” (Paragraph 53).

      2.37 A further recom m endation was that:

      “the Courts should make full use o f the higher fining powers under the Criminal Law Act 1977 in respect of
      common law offences which include malicious mischief, breach o f the peace and assault, these being the most
      common offences associated with football hooliganism, and in respect of persistent offenders, should
      normally impose imprisonment without option.” (R ecom m en dation 19).

      2.38 The Report recom m ended that;

      “T he police should have statutory powers to search for any containers ... in the possession o f any person
      entering or attempting to enter football grounds.” (R ecom m en dation 24).

    but went on to point out that the clubs must bear their share o f the responsibility for the behaviour and
    conduct o f their staff at all levels:

      2.39 A m ong other observations the Report says this:

      “We recognise that many football grounds in Scotland are very old; som e could even be described as primitive
      in that not only do they lack any kind o f comfort for spectators but they also lack basic am enities including
      adequate toilet accommodation. T his primitive environment encourages some people to react in a primitive
      manner. Moreover there is a strong case for more seating accommodation. In our view it would go a
      considerable way towards reducing hooliganism; potential trouble spots could be more quickly recognised and
      identification of troublemakers by police would be made that much easier.”

    The Report therefore recommended:

      “that clubs should consider the provision o f additional seating accommodation. In addition clubs must
      provide adequate toilet facilities for men and women and generally improve am enities for spectators.”
      (Paragraph 88).

      2 .4 0 This Report also recom m ended that:

      “players should be encouraged by the clubs to extend their voluntary public relations work in the community
      including personal appearances at youth clubs etc and coaching sessio n s in schools with the objects o f
      promoting the game and the concept of good sportsmanship.” (R ecom m en dation 37).

    C C T V was recom m ended and supporters’ clubs encouraged. The Scottish Football A ssociation was
    recom m ended to take appropriately firm action against clubs.


                                                            102
Departm ent of the Environment W orking Group
  2.41 The most recent G overnm ent publication on the subject o f football is the Report o f an Official
Working Group on Football Spectator Violence set up by D epartment o f the Environment, which was
published by H M SO in 1984. The Working Group was set up following incidents o f violence involving
British supporters at England’s soccer m atches in Luxembourg and France in N ovem ber 1983 and February
1984 respectively. It dealt party with problems arising out o f international football.

  2.42 However, as regards d om estic football the Report said:

  “the Group reaffirmed the importance of consistent planning, preparation and co-ordination; of building on
  experience; and of the need to consider afresh a ll possible measures, including those previously thought to be
  im practical or unnecessary.” (Paragraph 5.1).


  “We recommend therefore that the FA reviews and better defines its powers and procedures and the
  responsibilities of the clubs. I f th eir powers prove to be inadequate, the Association should consider
  enhancing them ."


The Report went on:

  “This w ould better equip the FA to implement some of the recommendations." (Paragraph 5 .5).


  2.43 The Football Association had issued a “blueprint” detailing the precautions which league clubs
should take against violence, which was circulated to clubs at the beginning o f the 1983-84 season. T he
Working Party Report said that it:

  “ ... has not been rigorously adopted by all clubs. Since it represents the collective wisdom of football clubs,
  many of whom have successfully countered serious threats of violence, its im plementation should have
  prevented some of the violence in grounds last season." (Paragraph 5 .7).


  2.44 The Report observed that the enforcement by the Football Association o f its “blueprint” occurs after
the event when the deficiencies in a club’s planning has becom e apparent. The Report recom m ended that:

  “improved means should be found for ensuring that clubs adopt the provisions of the “ blueprint” in a way
  appropriate to their own grounds and matches.” (Paragraph 5.7).


The Report went on to recom m end that each club should produce a detailed set o f plans to be subm itted to
the football authorities for endorsement. This would prevent som e clubs from a voiding their responsibilities
and might ensure also a more co-operative and co m m itted response.

   2.45 The Report recom m ended that matches between high risk clubs should be programmed so that the
risk or threat o f violence could be reduced. The Report said:

  “I t is more likely to take place at the beginning and end of the season and at holiday periods, particularly at
  seaside fixtures when other groups of young people sometimes also clash w ith football supporters.”
  (Paragraph 5.13).

  2.46 The Report went on to recom m end the introduction o f club membership, the introduction o f C CTV
and closer links with the com m unity. It did not recom m end that alcohol should be banned in grounds and
concluded that in the absence o f clear evidence that the introduction o f legislation along the lines o f the
Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980 would reduce violence at English soccer matches, it could not
recom m end such action. Furthermore, said the Report:

  “ legislation of this kind would be unwelcome to many; the m ajority of football clubs are untroubled by
  violence and would unnecessarily be penalised financially and the vast m ajority of non-violent spectators
  would suffer for the actions of the few." (Paragraph 5.34):


The Working Group did not recom m en d additional measures for banning alcohol on trains or on football
coaches.


                                                       103
Conclusion
  2.47    A study o f all these reports (and there are numerous reports and discussion papers by other bodies)
shows that the following are measures which have been frequently recom m ended:

      Closed Circuit Television
      M embership Cards
      Segregation
      More seating at football grounds
      Encouragement o f supporters’ clubs
      A ban on alcohol
      Involvem ent o f the clubs with the com m un ity
      Heavier penalties

I too shall argue for these and related measures. It is to be hoped they will be more vigorously pursued by the
appropriate bodies than in the past.

  HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY:   FINAL REPORT PUBLISHED


  The Final Report of the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster Inquiry
  under Lord Justice Taylor is published today.   In Part V the
  Judge makes 76 Recommendations which he hopes will be
  "instrumental in promoting better and safer conditions at sports
  grounds in the future."  (43 of the Recommendations are repeated
  from the Interim Report and there are 33 new ones).

  Football:   Present and Future
  Lord Justice Taylor paints a bleak picture of the current state
  of football under the heading "Three Sombre Lessons After
  Hillsborough".  He notes how previous reports on crowd safety
  have been unheeded, that complacency is still to be f o u n d at many
  grounds even after Hillsborough, and that football is suffering
  blight because of old grounds, poor facilities, hooliganism,
  segregation, alcohol and poor leadership.   He sets out ways in
  which he thinks all those in the game could set a better example,
  especially to younger fans, and embark on the task of creating a
  better atmosphere at football grounds and upgrading stadia so as
  to provide fans with modern facilities.   He points out the ma^y
  sources of revenue available to the football clubs to enable them
  to finance the improvements he is proposing.   In the course of
  his Inquiry, Lord Justice Taylor visited modern stadia in
  Scotland, Holland, France and Italy as well as grounds in England
  and Wales.

  All-Seated Accommodation

  Lord Justice Taylor recommends that sports grounds designated
  under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 should become «*11-
  seater under a phased programme.  For the English first and
  second divisions, the Scottish Premier League and national stadia
  he recommends a reduction of 20% in present standing capacity
  over each of the next five years, so as to eliminate standing by
  August 1994. For all other designated grounds, he recommends an
  annual reduction of 10%, so as to eliminate standing by August
  1999.  The first reductions should be made at the start of the

at grounds.  Their planning should provide that ticketless fans
should not be allowed to enter a ground except in an emergency.
They should consider options such as postponing kick-off, early
kick-offs or Sunday fixtures.  Police authorities should review
the charges they make for the costs of policing inside grounds.

Other Recommendations

There are detailed recommendations about communications, Safety
Certificates, the role of the local authorities, co-ordination of
emergency services, first aid, medical facilites and ambulances.
Lord Justice Taylor does not think that the current rules
governing the sale of alcohol in grounds should be changed.

Offences and Penalties

Lord Justice Taylor considers the problems raised by ticket touts
and suggests making it an offence to sell tickets on the day of
the match without the club's authority.  He also proposes that it
should be an offence to throw a missile or to chant obscene or
racialist abuse.  He suggests extending the powers of the courts
to make attendance centre orders and to use "tagging" to keep
convicted hooligans away from football grounds during matches.

N a t i o n a l M e m b e r s h i p Scheme

Lord Justice Taylor considers in detail the Management
Consultants' Invitation to Tender (ITT) and Statement of
Requirements (SOR) for the national membership scheme.   This
follows undertakings by Ministers last summer that Parliament
would have an opportunity to consider any comments he might make
on i t .

He says (paragraph 424) that he has grave doubts about the
feasibility of the scheme and serious misgivings about its likely
impact on safety.  He also has grave doubts about the chances of
its achieving its purpose and is very anxious about its potential
impact on police commitments and control of spectators.  For
these reasons, Lord Justice Taylor says he cannot support the
implementation of Part I of the Act.

He draws attention to the progress being made through the use of
CCTV in detection and in the collection of evidence, and the
better use of intelligence with the setting up of the National
Football Intelligence Unit.  "Put together with progress towards
all-seating, improved accommodation, better facilities, improved
arrangements for crowd control and better training of police and
stewards to achieve it, I believe these measures would give the
best chance of eliminating or minimising football hooliganism."

     HOME SECRETARY RESPONDS TO LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR'S FINAL REPORT
                  ON THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER


   The Home Secretary, the Rt Hon David Waddington QC MP, today
   gave the Government's initial response to Lord Justice Taylor's
   final report on the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster by means of a
   Statement in the House.

   The full text of the Home Secretary's statement is attached.
               HOME SECRETARY'S STATEMENT ON
             LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR'S FINAL REPORT
                    OF HIS INQUIRY INTO THE
               HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER
                       29   JANUARY 1990


With permission, Mr Speaker, I should like to make a
statement about the final report of Lord Justice Taylor's
Inquiry into the tragedy at the Hillsborough stadium on
15 April 1989, which is published today.      Some months have
passed since that terrible event but not long enough I know
to dull the pain suffered by the bereaved, and I wish to
place on record my sympathy for them and for those who
sustained injury.



I am most grateful to Lord Justice Taylor for the Report,
which sets out clearly why we have had so many major
tragedies at football grounds over the years and why we have
had disorder and hooliganism.      As the House familiarises
itself with the Report, it will become clear that it is
addressed as much to the football industry as it is to the
Government. Lord Justice Taylor explains how in his interim
report he concentrated on overcrowding because that was the
cause of the Hillsborough disaster, but now he goes on to
talk of a game, the image of which has been much
tarnished, and of a blight over the game due to old grounds,
poor facilities, hooliganism, excessive drinking and poor
leadership.


Lord Justice Taylor does not spare those who run the
industry.     He says indeed that the provision they make for
their customers is often not merely basic but squalid,       and
he says that squalid conditions can have an impact on safety
and that in his view they also lead to lower standards of
behaviour.


Lord   Justice    Taylor   Taylor   says   that   the   Football
Association and Football League have not seen it as any part
of their duty to offer guidance to clubs on safety matters,
and he questions whether the directors of many clubs are
genuinely interested in the welfare of their own supporters
or their good behaviour.     Players too are criticised, with
Lord Justice Taylor pointing out that incitement from the
pitch or bad behaviour by players, which is not confined to
soccer, has a major influence on the crowd.       I acknowledge
that some clubs have made an effort to an effort to improve
standards, but Lord Justice Taylor's clear conclusion was
that the majority had not and that the game only has a
future if the directors and the players can change their own
priorities and give a leadership which is plainly lacking at
present.


He agrees with the Government that there must be a move
towards all-seater stadia and points out that section 11 of
the   Football    Spectators Act specifically provides the
machinery for this. The change will improve safety and will
improve behaviour, and we intend to bring it about.        Lord
Justice Taylor makes clear that the bulk of the finances for
ground improvements will have to be raised by the clubs
themselves.      He says there are ways of raising the money if
the clubs' management is enterprising and resourceful and he
points to the opportunities presented by sponsorship.        He
also points to the revenue that flows to the football
authorities for television rights and says that the football
authorities should ensure that this valuable source of
revenue li directed towards improving stadia.      He canvasses
the possibility of a levy on transfer fees which he says
have reached a level which many regard as grotesque.


There are a whole series of detailed recommendations set out
in Chapters 3, 4 and 5 on matters relating to
spectator safety such as gates and gangways.      Indeed, of the
76 recommendations, 43 in substance appeared in the Interim
Report.      The Government accepts these proposals,         some of
which can be implemented immediately.           Some will need
further work.       For convenience I have placed in the Vote
Office a schedule setting out the Government’s response to
each.


Hon Members will recall that section 13 of the Football
Spectators Act provides for the Football Licensing Authority
to      supervise   the   safety   responsibilities     of     local
authorities in respect of designated football grounds.            We
intend to implement that provision.      Lord Justice Taylor
welcomes     the establishment     of the   Football     Licensing
Authority but would like us to go further and extend its
remit to cover other than football grounds.            This would
require primary legislation and we will have to consider
whether it is justified.


Part III the Report contains a number of proposals relating
to crowd control and hooliganism.           It acknowledges the
crucial role of the police in crowd control.          Lord Justice
Taylor rightly reminds us that, without the work of the
                              5   .

police, many sporting events would be chaotic and could not
be permitted to take place.           Something like 5000 police
officers are engaged on football duties each Saturday during
the season, largely at the expense of the taxpayer and
ratepayer.   He pays tribute to them for their service.        I
want to add my thanks to the police for the way they carry
out the difficult, thankless and often unthanked tasks which
are thrust upon them.


The Report recognises the advances made in the last couple
of years in the effectiveness of the policing of football,
particularly inside grounds, and to the major impact of
closed circuit television on the hooligan problem.       It also
mentions other measures taken by the Government such as the
                                               4


restriction on the sale of alcohol and the power given to
the courts to make orders excluding convicted hooligans from
grounds.


Lord Justice Taylor also recognises the great potential
value of the police National Football Intelligence Unit in
dealing with football-related crime and with hooligans
travelling to matches abroad.
                               6   .

As I have said, Lord Justice Taylor takes the view that
better facilities and better treatment of fans will bring
better behaviour.     Beyond that, the Report recommends the
creation of three new specific three new specific offences
to apply at designated sports grounds:, throwing a missile;
chanting obscene or racialist abuse;            and going onto the
pitch without reasonable excuse:            and it also asks for
consideration to be given to extending the courts' powers to
impose   attendance   centre       orders and    for the use     of
electronic tagging in the      case of offenders convicted of
football-related offences.             The specific new offences
suggested do to some extent seem to duplicate offences which
are already available in the Public Order Act.         But I shall
look carefully and quickly at all these suggestions.


I now come to the proposed Football Membership Scheme. Lord
Justice Taylor examined the Invitation to Tender for a
scheme which was issued by the consultants employed by the
football authorities.     He   came to the conclusion that he
could not support a scheme     of that kind         because he        did not
believe the technology would work well enough to avoid the
danger of congestion and disorder.          He was also concerned
about the call on police resources.         Instead he proposes the
measures to which I have referred.
In the light of this advice, the Government have decided not
to proceed with the establishment of a Football Membership
Authority, but Part I of the Act will remain on the Statute
Book. Work will      continue to see how the shortcomings
identified by Lord Justice Taylor could be overcome in case
we have to return to the matter again, should the problem of
hooliganism not be defeated by the alternative strategy
alternative strategy proposed in the report.


Let no-one imagine that this means there will be any let up
in the fight against hooliganism.             Those who,      unlike
Government,   have     for   so   long     shrugged     off    their
responsibilities will now have to face up to them.               The
Government intends to proceed as quickly as possible to the
establishment of a Football Licensing Authority and, subject
to consultation,     Section 11 of the Football Spectators Act
will be used to direct the to direct the Licensing Authority
to require all seater stadia - with standing being reduced
by stages and entirely eliminated in First and Second
Division grounds by August 1994 and 1n all designated
Football League grounds by 1999.         The necessary steps will
be taken to ensure improved arrangements for crowd control
and better training for police and stewards.          There will be
urgent consideration of the case for new offences and for
new powers to deal with those excluded frcm grounds by the
Courts.        The Clubs will be compelled will be compelled to
get rid of the terraces.         But Lord Justice Taylor indicates
how much more they can do to create a better atmosphere by
improving the now often squalid conditions to which they
subject their supporters - squalid conditions which can
encourage squalid behaviour.          Those clubs which have not
faced     up     to   their   responsibility   now   have   a   final
opportunity to do so: and if they don't now act, the public
will not forgive them.

SUBJECT:        THE HILLSBOROUGH SCRUTINY - ACCOMMODATION




Following our telephone conversation of the 12 August 1997, I have made enquiries over the cost
of providing portacabin accom m odation at the Heeley site and also visited Heeley and looked at
the spare accommodation contained w ith in that building.

The costings for a portacabin installed on site for six m onths are as follow s:-

Hire of 4 0 ' x 12' portacabin w ith tw o end offices and                     £ 1 ,4 2 0
conference room facilities

Burglar Alarm                                                                 £500

Fire Alarm                                                                    £250

Carpets                                                                      £300

Heating and Lighting                                                          £140

Conference Table and Chairs                                                   £640

Planning Permission                                                           £100


TOTAL:                                                                       £ 3 ,3 5 0
                /



Planning permission w ould be required if the portacabin w ere to remain on site longer           than six
weeks and at the present time it takes tw o to three months fo r such permission to be            granted.
There w ould be additional costs for office furniture, pow er link up, extra telephone lines       and fax
machine but most of these costs w ould also be incurred if accom m odation w ith in the            existing
building w as utilised.

W ithout knowing the ultimate size of the team that w ill be required to w o rk on the Hillsborough
Scrutiny it is difficult to really estimate the size of the accom m odation required. I have, however,
spoken w ith the new head of Discipline and Complaints and he has no objection to the
Hillsborough Scrutiny Team setting up an office on the ground flo o r of the building, utilising w h a t is
presently known as the w aiting room. This room is the first office on the right hand side of the
ground floor when one enters the Discipline and Complaints part of the building and is next door to
the present conference room.         The room will accom m odate 3 people w ith their o w n desks and
chairs in com fort.
The room is protected by the existing burglar and fire alarms, it is w ith in the security door to
Discipline and Complaints and can be independently locked. The conference room next door could
be used by the Hillsborough Scrutiny Team when required, as could the interview room opposite.
Papers and exhibits from the Hillsborough Enquiry Store w ould be more secure as they w o uld not
have to be taken out of the existing building fo r the team to w o rk on them as w ould be the case if
a portacabin were to be utilised.

Costs for setting up the w aiting room as an office w ould be as follow s:-

2 x Project 1 Double Pedestal Desks                                           £500
(1 desk already in situ)

3 x Executive Chairs                                                          £600

Plain paper Fax                                                               £595


TOTAL:                                                                    £ 1 ,6 9 5

This cost w ould also have to be added to the cost of setting up a portacabin office. It may also be
necessary to purchase one or more secure filing cabinets at a cost of £ 4 0 7 each in order that
papers being worked on in the office could be securely stored. Additional telephone lines could be
installed in this office by our ow n Telecom Engineers w ith o u t incurring any budgetary costs.

M y preference would be to set up the Hillsborough Scrutiny O ffice w ith in the existing building at
Heeley.     The advantages of this are that the building is more secure than a portacabin,
documentation does not have to be carried backwards and forw ards outside the building, the
building is protected by burglar and fire alarms, it is heated and could be taken into use as soon as
office furniture is available. It w ill also be cheaper and will not require planning permission.

Submitted for your decision please.

1.    Potential Problems Relating to the Millennium IT Contingency

      Chief Superintendent Peter Hale attended the meeting for this item and presented a
      research document regarding the millennium issue. He explained that he had
      quickly realised that there was a need for the organisation to find a method of
      keeping track of the plethora of potential difficulties that might occur.

      His report identified two main issues; the first being IT and whether main or
      embedded systems in the force are Millennium 2000 compliant (eg able to manage
      the date change).

      The second major issue was the potential for direct and indirect public disorder;
      direct being related to official and unofficial celebrations which all require some
      active policing, the indirect relating to the more imprecise difficulties that might occur
      if other social functions break down (eg energy generation, telecommunications
      etc).

      Peter Hale pointed out to the team that running in conjunction with the issues that
      came from these main areas was the need to address staffing levels and that the
      requirement to have a contingency plan requiring the use of large numbers of staff
      might be necessary, also the issue of cost which is linked to staffing issues, along
      with matters arising out of technological needs.

      The team discussed at this point the issue of whether to block applications for
      annual leave on 31 December 1999 and 1 January 2000. It was accepted that this
      was an issue of importance to which the Good Practice Guide gave sufficient
      guidance regarding applications at this time, but that the issue was one the team
      needed to consider with some urgency. In order to 'flag up’ this issue for the
      organisation, it was agreed that the matter of annual leave on those dates should
      be discussed at the next PACSAC meeting and at the next Operations Conference.

      The recommendations which flowed from Peter Hale’s report indicating the way
      forward could be summarised by the following watch words “thorough investigation
      and careful planning”. He presented two recommendations to the Senior Command
      Team;

      1)     The millennium problem should be classed as a major project and a
             structured approach adopted.
     2)     The Project Board should start now.

     The Senior Command Team unanimously agreed with these recommendations and
     Ian Daines was identified as the Project Leader, reporting once a month on
     progress to the Senior Command Team. It was also agreed that Tim Hollis would
     raise the issue of the millennium on next year’s Joint Contingency Planning
     meeting.

     At the conclusion of the presentation Peter Hale left the meeting.

2.   Training Fees Estimates

     Jeff Berrett joined the meeting for this item and presented a paper for consideration
     by the team. The main focus of the discussion centred on a short fall of £57,700
     within their 1997/98 budget. Jeff Berrett explained that this short fall had emerged
     following a temporary virement of £50,000 in 1995/96, this to date had not been
     reinstated.

     Richard Wells expressed the view that the best means of resolving this was at the
     point at which this year's books are closed. He stated that he was in agreement
     with the principle of reinstating the money highlighted in the short fall but would like
     Training to do a business case in respect of it. He explained that once the budget
     underspend, currently calculated at £1.25 million, was confirmed, a package for
     reinstatement could be drawn up.


3.   Implications of CIP

     Richard Wells presented the team with a brief factual sheet which highlighted the
     number of CIP bids relating to increases in staffing in statutory and voluntary
     agencies and indicated that this should be a point of discussion with the Police
     Authority Treasurer when he attends the Senior Command Team meeting in the
     near future.

     Tim Hollis briefed the team on the Police Authority’s disappointment on the negative
     focus of the press launch at Barnsley in June. He went on to highlight that the
     Police Authority are looking to review CIP ind stocktake during the course of this
     year. He believed there was value in progressing the debate through exploring an
     idea currently being examined by John Booth and Mike Sanderson which proposes
     to ring-fence certain projects which the South Yorkshire Police would support within
     the CIP arena, year on year (Lifestyle, Crucial Crew etc) allowing better access for
     the scrutiny of other bids that on close examination might not be as valid.

     Richard Wells indicated that he saw this as a positive way to address the concerns
     he had with regard to the current quantum of bids for CIP. It was agreed that this
     was a major issue for discussion with the Police Authority Treasurer.


4.   Section 15 of the Police Act 1966 - Civilian Staff

     Mike Hedges and Martin Davies indicated confusions and inaccuracies they felt
     were present in recent Counsel’s advice to the Police Authority with regard to the
     issue of delegation. The team agreed that this current advice did not counter
     previous advice sought.


                                            2
It was agreed that Bill Wilkinson should be asked to write to the Chief Constable
regarding this latest opinion in order that the Senior Command Team could develop
a clear way forward. Martin Davies agreed to clarify what was taking place in other
forces with regard to this issue.


Update Paper on the Hillsborough Disaster

Ian Daines re-affirmed that £500,000 was to be requested from reserves in order to
fund costs relating to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s scrutiny. He stressed the need for
the Senior Command Team to consider who might be best placed to liaise and co­
ordinate with the Lord Justice’s team.

Martin Davies indicated that John Lowe had agreed to return and work in a
consultant capacity for the Force and the team agreed that with his help, and the
expertise of PC Ken Greenway, the Head o' Discipline and Complaints would be the
appropriate person to oversee the day to day functioning. Ian Daines indicated that
he felt the team should be accommodated at Heeley, close to the archives, and that
it may be necessary to hire a portacabin at a cost of £1,000 and £130 per month in
order to facilitate this.

Richard Wells briefed the team with regard to a draft letter he had prepared for Lord
Justice Stuart-Smith inviting him to South Yorkshire to brief relevant staff if he felt it
was appropriate.

SUBJECT:      HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL GROUND


At our useful meeting together at Niagara on 9 July, Steve King raised an aspect of Hillsborough
concerned with incidents beyond the events of 15 April 1989.

The 1981 incident to which Steve referred may well be the Tottenham v. Wolves semi-final played
at Hillsborough. There was some crushing within the crowd. It was investigated at the time and
the report was made available to the West Midlands Police and to the Treasury Counsel who
assisted Lord Justice Taylor.

In respect of the late 1989 event, since that took place after the Inquiry, I view it as essentially
outside the scope of the Stuart-Smith scrutiny. If the Judge moves to a full public enquiry, the
scope of any such broader look at contributory factors might bring the events of November 1989
into play, though, in my opinion, only as post hoc indicators rather than 'evidence'.

I thought that you would value an up-date on our useful - and dynamic - discussion.

    SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE AUTHORITY


    17 NOVEMBER 1989




    REPORT OF THE CHIEF CONSTABLE


    ACTIONS OF THE SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE FOLLOWING THE
    PUBLICATION OF LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR'S INTERIM REPORT


    1.    Introduction

    1.1   In the wake of the disaster which occurred at Hillsborough Stadium,
          Sheffield, on 15 April 1989, a Public Inquiry was commissioned to enquire
          into the events and to make recommendations about the needs of crowd
          control and safety at sports events.     The Inquiry was chaired by Lord
          Justice Taylor and it sat from 15 May until 14 July 1989.

    1.2   Lord Justice Taylor published his Interim Report on 4 August    1989,  in
          which he made 43 interim recommendations.   He emphasised that these were
          designed to prevent overcrowding and crushing on terraced areas in the
          short term,  and that long term recommendations fell to be considered in
          his Final‘Report. A copy of the recommendations is appended.


    2.    Implementation of Recommendations

    2.1   The recommendations contained in Lord Justice Taylor's Interim Report
          included many which were already identified as necessary in the light of
          the events at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989.   The South Yorkshire Police
          were therefore well prepared to ensure that they were swiftly implemented
          at the five football league grounds in the County.

    2.2   The ChiefConstable nominated Mr P Hayes QPM LLB         MA,   Deputy Chief
          Constable, to liaise personally with the management of each football club
          and with each local authority concerned in respect of future crowd
          safety.    Mr Hayes met with directors and secretaries of all five South
          Yorkshire football  league   clubs on 24 August          1989    and  with
          representatives of the four local authorities on 18 September 1989.

    2.3   To progress the recommendations of the Taylor, Report the Deputy Chief
          Constable   appointed an 'Implementation Team' which included the    local
          ground commanders who have a responsibility for policing each of the five
          football league clubs in the County,       and officers with specialist
          knowledge in such areas as communications, CCTV and training.     The team
          has met under the Deputy Chief Constable's chairmanship on seven
          occasions since 4 August 1989 and each of the recommendations which
          places a responsibility with the police has been implemented at all
          football league grounds.    Those recommendations which were asterisked by
          Lord Justice Taylor,      signifying their immediate need,      were each
          implemented by 18 August - just two weeks after the publication of the
          Taylor Report and before the start of the current       league programme.
          Furthermore,   it is pleasing to be able to report that, with the positive
          co-operation    of   the football clubs,     signed   written   agreements
                                     - 2 -                                    \

      between   the clubs and the police,       setting out    their   respective
      responsibilities for crowd safety, have been drawn up.

2.4   The    SouthYorkshire  Police have also addressed     theremaining
       recommendations for which they are not directly responsible.    A report
       concerning   these matters has been forwarded to each of the local
       authorities who have a responsibility for safety certification at
       football grounds.

2.5   A copy of each written agreement together with a summary of the action
       taken on all relevant recommendations in relation to that football ground
       is appended.


3.    The Responsibilities of the Local Authorities for Safety at
       Sports Grounds                                                     s

3.1   Any local authority within whose area there exists a sports stadium
      designated under the Safety at Sports Grounds Act 1975 (as amended)    is
      responsible for the issue of a Safety Certificate in respect of that
      stadium.   Each of the local authorities of Rotherham,      Barnsley and
      Doncaster have a responsibility for one football league ground, Sheffield
      has a responsibility for two.

3.2   The certifying authorities are called upon by the Taylor Report       to
      immediately review each Safety Certificate,    ensure that the operative
      conditions of the Certificate are complied with,  then add or substitute
      any condition shown to be necessary by the findings and recommendations
      of the Taylor Report.

3.3   The centrally directed police 'Implementation Team' has achieved as much
      as it can by independent action.       The local authorities in South
      Yorkshire, which each have a responsibility under the Safety of Sports
      Grounds Act,   have been provided with a comprehensive report of what the
      police have so far achieved.     Where it has not been possible for the
      South   Yorkshire   Police   to fully    implement   any   recommendation
      unilaterally,   proposals are offered to the responsible certifying
      authority of how the recommendation might be progressed.


A.    Increased Costs for Policing Football Matches

4.1   Several of the recommendations in the Interim Report of Lord Justice
       Taylor impose additional duties upon the police at football matches. For
       example,  (i) the deployment of police officers,     to each gate in a
       perimeter fence, authorised to decide whether or not to allow spectators
       through a gate to relieve overcrowding;      (ii) the deployment of a
       reserve of police officers to each match who are not committed to any
       specific duty and are therefore able to deal with any unforeseen
       difficulties which arise inside or outside the ground;   and,  (iii) the
       deployment of a sufficient number of skilled operators in the police
       control room to enable all radio transmissions to be received,  evaluated
       and answered and to enable all the results of CCTV recording outside and
       inside the ground to be monitored and interpreted.

4.2 It is obvious from the implementation of these three recommendations
     alone that the cost of policing football matches will be greater than
     ever before.
Members will be aware that a proportion of policing costs is met by the
football clubs themselves.     At present the financial contribution is
determined by reference to a sliding scale of charges agreed annually
between the Police Authority,  the Chief Constable and each of the clubs,
based upon a prior estimate of crowd size for a particular game.   In the
two seasons   1987/88 and 1988/89 the total cost of policing the five
football clubs in South Yorkshire,  both inside and outside the grounds,
amounted to some £1.83 million and, of this figure, the clubs contributed
£398,000 which amounts to 22% of the overall cost.

In the light of Lord Justice Taylor's recommendations many Police
Authorities are now reassessing the charges levied on football clubs for
special police services.

The facility to charge for police officers in these circumstances is
provided by Section 15 of the Police Act 1964, which enables the Chief
Constable, at his discretion,   to provide,  on request, special police
services at any premises or in any locality in the police area.     The
section further empowers the Police Authority to charge for these
services.

There is no precise definition of the term 'special police services'  but
the case of Harris -v- Sheffield United Football Club 1986 held that the
Chief Constable is not, as part of his normal policing responsibility,
obliged to provide officers to react to potential breaches of the peace
where the owner of private property creates such a risk on his property.

It would seem,  therefore, that officers provided to meet such a risk, as
in the case of a football match, are within the meaning of special police
services and can be charged for.     Indeed,  Police Authorities have a
fiduciary duty to the ratepayers of their area to make such charges.

The Harris case,   however,  does not fully resolve which officers can be
regarded as performing special police services.    It held that the fact
that officers were deployed on private property was significant        in
tending to show their provision amounted to special police services,  but
did not deal with the question of officers deployed to perform duties
outside the ground - duties that arise directly from the event which is
occurring inside the ground.   Legal opinion has,  therefore, been sought
for clarification as to which duties performed by police officers at
football matches can properly be regarded as 'special police services'

Notwithstanding the question of payment for police deployment outside
football grounds it is submitted that the level of contribution from the
clubs presently falls significantly short of the actual cost of officers
inside the ground, and that the shortfall is set to widen in the light of
the Taylor recommendations which necessitate an increase in the number of
police officers deployed at football matches.


Criminal Investigation of South Yorkshire Police Officers

During   the     course of the Hillsborough Inquiry     the question  of
manslaughter    by the criminal negligence of SouthYorkshire Police
officers was     raised by counsel for the bereaved, Mr Benet Hytner Q C .

Because this matter was not dealt with in the Report of the Hillsborough
Inquiry the Chief Constable,  on the morning of the Report's publication,
referred it     to the Director of Public Prosecutions,   asking for his
 A'                                                        V
•"    decision on the question of criminal liability of any member of the South X
      Yorkshire Police.    It was considered appropriate,   at that time,    to
      suspend from duty the police commander of the Hillsborough event, Chief
      Superintendent David Duckenfield,  pending the outcome of the Director's
      deliberations.   Mr Duckenfield remains suspended.

5.3   On 15 August 1989, the Director wrote to the Chief Constable setting out
      his view that the matter should be subject of a           full   criminal
      investigation.    The West Midlands Police had already done considerable
      work in gathering evidence for Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry.   It seemed
      sensible, therefore,    to invite Mr Geoffrey Dear QPM DL LLB, Chief
      Constable of the West Midlands Police Force,          to undertake   this
       investigation.   His report,    in due course, will be submitted to the
       Director of Public Prosecutions.


6.    Matters of Complaint and Discipline

6.1   Additionally, the Chief Constable has asked that if, during the course of
       their investigation,   the West Midlands Police officers discover any
      matters which might suggest that offences were committed against       the
       Police (Discipline) Regulations, of a non-criminal nature, those offences
       should be brought to his attention and, where appropriate, be enquired
       into by the West Midlands Police on behalf of the South Yorkshire Police.
      This is agreed.

6.2   There are currently seven matters of public complaint about the actions
       of South Yorkshire Police officers,     arising from the Hillsborough
       incident.

6.3   Three of these matters have been raised by a single complainant.       Two
       relate to the actions of the senior officers in command of the policing
       operation at Hillsborough on he day -and these are being supervised by
       Captain E Noel Taylor of tr.e Police Complaints         Authority.    The
       investigation of these complaints is being conducted by Mr Geoffrey Dear,
       Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police,    along with the * criminal
       matters. The third complaint is of incivility and is being investigated,
       unsupervised by the Police Complaints Authority, by Superintendent Ashton
       of the South Yorkshire Police.

6.A   A fourth complaint is that an officer at the perimeter fence contributed
      to the death of the complainant's son by his failure to open the fence
      gate in good time.

6.5   A fifth complaint is that the failure by South Yorkshire Police officers
      to open perimeter fence gates caused the complainant to sustain injury.

6.6   A sixth complaint is made by a man who alleges that he was assaulted by a
      police officer whilst attending the football match.

6.7   These latter three cases are again to be investigated by Mr Dear's team
      and are likewise being supervised by Captain E Noel Taylor of the Police
      Complaints Authority.

6.8   There is a seventh complaint of corruption,   namely of police officers
      offering to allow fans into the ground on payment.   This complaint is
      being investigated by Superintendent Carlisle of the Greater Manchester
      Police.

                     Coroner's Inquest Regarding the 95 Deaths Which Arose
    s
/              7.1   The   gathering of evidence on behalf of HM Coroner,          Dr   Stefan
                     Popper LLB BMedSci BM BS MRCGP,     in relation to the 95 deaths that
                     occurred at Hillsborough, is continuing by the West Midlands Police.

               7.2   The Coroner opened the inquests on 19/20 April 1989, and adjourned them
                     to a date to be fixed.      He had set aside three months to hear the
                     inquests beginning in January 1990.    I understand, however,  that the
                     Director of Public Prosecutions has recently written to Dr Popper
                     requesting that the inquests be deferred until after the results of the
                     on-going criminal investigation are concluded.


               8.    Civil Actions

               8.1   To date eight writs have been served upon the South      Yorkshire Police
                      alleging negligence by its officers on 15 April 1989,   leading to loss,
                      injury, damage and, in two cases, death.

               8.2   The writs are to be defended by the Police Authority's insurers,
                     Municipal Mutual Insurance Company.  It is understood that three of these
                     actions will be representative actions.

               8.3   The presiding Northern Circuit Judge, Mr Justice Rose, has taken personal
                      charge of the interlocutory proceedings.      At a Directions Hearing on
                      26 October 1989 at the High Court in Manchester Mr Justice Rose set the
                      date for commencement of the civil actions for 11 June   1990.   At that
                      hearing Mr Justice Rose expressed his satisfaction regarding the work
                      done by all parties to the claims to achieve a state of readiness for
                      trial.


               9.    The Effects of the Hillsborough Disaster on the Health
                     and Welfare of the Force

               9.1   Twenty-three officers reported injuries sustained in the rescue of people
                     from the Leppings Lane terraces.  These injuries were, in the main, minor
                     strains and bruising to backs and limbs.

               9.2   A total of 58 officers subsequently took sick leave which was directly
                     attributable to the disaster in the weeks which followed the event,
                     mainly due to the effects of shock and stress. As a result, 356 working
                     days were lost.

               9.3   Two officers remain on sick leave, suffering from stress, one of whom may
                     well retire from the Force on the grounds of ill-health in the near
                     future.

               9.4   During week ending 23 April 1989 - the week immediately following the
                     disaster - only 92 officers had taken sick leave,   compared with 101 in
                     the corresponding week in 1988.     The figure rose to a maximum of   143
                     officers taking sick leave during week ending 30 April. 1989, compared
                     with 107 in 1988.    By week ending 21 May 1989, however,   the number of
                     officers taking sick leave had fallen to 105 which corresponded,
                     identically, with the same period in 1988.

               9.5   Any effects that the Hillsborough disaster had upon the health and
                     welfare of the Force appear, largely, to have been short lived. It is
                                        -   6   -                             \
M                                                   \
          thought that this is, to a significant extent, due to the efforts of th<§
          Force Welfare Officer and our Consultant Counsellor who started their
          work at the ground within hours of the tragedy occurring.   The memories
          of the disaster,   and the emotions evoked by it, will remain with many
          officers for a long time.   The Force as a whole, however,  has adjusted
          well.


    10.   Recommended

    10.1 The   Police   Authority note the efforts made       to   implement   the
         recommendations of the Interim Report of Lord Justice Taylor,  insofar as
         they relate to the police.

    10.2 The Police Authority accept, in principle, the need to review in detail
         and,  if necessary, re-negotiate the basis for recovering the costs of
         providing special police services to the football clubs in South
         Yorkshire.

    10.3 The Police Authority note that the relevant local authorities are
         responsible for the implementation of any outstanding recommendations,
         and for the enforcement of new or existing conditions of the Safety
         Certificate issued in respect of each football stadium.

    10.4 The Police Authority note the progress of the on-going         criminal
         investigation,  the civil litigation and the Coroner's Inquiry arising
         from the disaster at Hillsborough. Further reports will be submitted in
         due course.

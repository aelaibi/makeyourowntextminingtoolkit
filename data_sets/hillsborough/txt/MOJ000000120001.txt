Mrs Flaschner



LETTER TO THE HOME SECRETARY PROM JOE BENTON MP

We spoke about the attached copy of correspondence and you said
that it might be for you to deal with rather than F 8 . As you
will see, the difficulty with the letter is that the MP does not
specify what difficulties his constituents have faced though one
would suspect that it is either with the police or the coroner's
office.  However, I have discovered from enquiries I have made
of the police that there has been little contact with Mr and Mrs
Church so it is unlikely that the complaints is against them.
The coroner (a Mr Dorriss) has kindly agreed to speak to me this
afternoon and I hope he can shed some light on what the
difficulty is. I will let you know what transpires.



2.   I am afraid that none of us in F8 saw the Cook Report
referred to by Mr Benton though I have asked Press Office to
check whether they recorded the programme.

Police          control          of     this          crowd.            I was           in      the       company          of     two      friends

                                             and                                                     We    a l l -h a d      tickets' for              the

North       Stand          which        is       a    sitting           area          but       our       tickets          placed          us     at   the

escape          the       crush        which          of        course        had       filled            in    behind          us     but      could
see    the       building             that       we       needed          to    enter        and     the       direction             of    which

we    had       to    move.           In    normal             circumstances                 I would           have       made       my    way       to

the    entrance                which       my    ticket             was    for       but     the     crush          was       so    great       that

in    fact       I was          taken       where          the       crowds          were        standing.               There       were       occasions

when       my    feet          did    not       touch          the    ground.              Fortunately               I    was       literally

carried          by       the    crowd          into       the       right       e n t r a n c e 'as          were       my    two       friends          and

as    we    got       inside          the       actual          building             of    the     ground           the       crush       eased       off

somewhat             because          it    would              appear          that       certain         Police          Officers             opened

additional                doors.           Neither             myself          nor    my     two    friends              were       required          to

produce          our       tickets          and       I    still          have       my    full      ticket          which          no    one    in

actual          capacity             whatsoever                required          of       me. ; I k n o w           of    various          other

people          as    well       who       still          have       their       entire           tickets.                Certain          persons

to    my    certain             knowledge             as       well       got    into        the    gnund-through                    the       same

entrance             as    myself          who       did       not    have       t i c k e t s ' to       be    in       the       ground       at    all

never       mind          in    the    seating             section             which       I was         supposed             to    be.


By    the       time       I    actually             got       passed          the    grounds            were       I was          entitled          to    sit

it    was       approximately                   3 . p.m.        and       the    Players           were        out       on    the       pitch^



I    got    to       my    seat       witli      my       two       friends          adjacent            to    me    and       we    took       our

seats       although             all       three          of    us    were       even       at     that        stage          shaken       and       rather

distressed                by    the    previous                half       hours       experience.'


Almost          immediately                after          having          taken       my         seat     I was          aware       of    a'

commotti.on           a n d _d is tu r b a n c e           in       the    Lepping          Lane         Stand       which          was    then

immediately                adjacent             to    us       on    my    right          hand     side.


My    attention                was    drawn          from       the       game       to    the     terracing              because          I    could

see    people             trying       to       c limb         over       the    fence           between        the       pitch          and    c r owd

and    noises             were       coining         from       that       area       w h i ch     were        not       the       normal       noises

one    wotj Id        expect          from       a    football             crowd.            I    s aw    p e o p 1e      trying          to    get       out

but    being          thrown          back       into          it    by    the       Police        but        then       other       Police          Officer

s e e nied    to       realise           that          something                    terrible           was           happening           one      ina n       ran

over     to    the        Referee               and        the       game          was     immediately                   stopped            and     the        Players

were     sent          off     the       pitch,             but          others           started               then     to      try     and      actually                get

people        out       of     the       area          and       onto              the    pitch.                Obviously             by now        my        total

attention              was     focused               on     the          terracing                  and I        had      to     view scenes                  of     the

utmost        horror.              The          crowd        was          completely                  out        of    control           in    the        sense           that

there        was       mass    p a n i c :I           could              see       people            surging           down       the       terracing               from

above        there       were        screams                obvious                hysteria            and           people       were        trying           to     drag

other        people          out     from            the     terracing                    over        the        top        of    the       crowd         preventatii

barrier        and       onto        the         pitch.                  Very       soon        afterwards                  two       ambulances               arrived

and     then       more        and       more          spectators                    were           able        to    get      onto      the p i t c h             and

started        to       collapse                in    front              of    me        and        many        people         a p p e a r e d to        be        either

dead     or    dying.              There             was     pandamoniurn                      on     the        pitch        Police          Officers              runninj

improvised              from       advertising                    boardings                    round            the    ground          and     I could              see

various        instances                of       people           being             put        onto*improvised                        stretchers               or    propel

ground        and       in     imine.diate                 proximity                 to        them. *


I have        never          seen       a       scene        such             as    that        which            I w i t n e s s e d on           this        occasion

and     even        now       it    is       difficult                    for       me     to p u t         into       words          and     I would              rather

not     at     this          time       try          and    put           further              into       words         all       that        I saw       or        the

emotions           I    experienced.                       Suffice                 to     say       that         I    felt       physically               ill       and

revolted           by    the       entire             specticle.                        When        the         announcement                was     made           that

th.'   in•j tc.h       had    been          a b a n d o n e d and                  tt'at       we    were         requested              to l e a v e         the

ground        we       tried       to       make           our       way        out,       because               T    p r e s u m e d 111 a t n o w           a way
would         be    cleared                   for       spectators             who    were          net    acfu-lly           Injured             to    be

removed            from          the          area       as    quickly          as    possible.                 Up    until        that          time       I

had      not       dared             leave          my     seat      for       fear       of       being       caught        up    in       any       situation

of    the      type          of       which             I was       witnessing.                    Having       said       this        I made          my       way

with      my       friends                down          the    tunnel          way    leading             from       where        we    where          to       the

outside            of    the          ground             to    find       that       theescape                 route       was     blocked             by       4

engines.                There             was       just       space          between          the       engines        and       the       outside

world         for       people                to    squeeze          through          at       a    slow       rate,       which        in       time       my

ft i e n d s       and       I       did       but       of    course          we    found          ourselves           in    yet       another             crush

behind         u;       for          people             trying       to       get    out       and       away    from        the       scene?          they          itad

been      witnessing,                         and       once       we     did       get    passed          the       fire     engines f o und

ourselves               in       a    further             crush          outside          the       grounds.            There          were'fans

outside            undirected                      by    anybody          in    a    state          of    shock       panic,           hysteria,                the

Police         were          b e i n g of           no    co-operation                at       all       that    I    could        see       in       actually

dispersing               the          crowd             and    trying          to    comfort             people       outside,              and       the

atmosphere               between                   the    fans       and       the    Police             was    becoming           n'ore         and    more

uglv.              However                we       were       able       to    make       our       way    through           the       crowd          and       get

back      to       the       coach             that       had       brought          us.           We    waited       at     the       coach          for

approximately                        an       hour       because          the       people          on    the    coach        were          distributed

was      filled          we          returned             from       Liverpool.                    My    emotions          and     feelings             on          the

my    only         thought                was       that       I   never        wanted             to    see    anything           like          it    again.

Wlteti    I    returned                   to       Liverpool             I made       my       way       straight          home        and       when       I

arrived            home          I    basically                collapsed             and       cried       in    front        of       my    Wife       who          to

the      best       of       my       knowledge                had       never       heard          me    cry    before,           and       I    took          so in?

any         tablets          but       said        I was               obviously                   suffering              from    shock           and       after

effects            and       to    just         take           things                 easy         and    let       time     and        my      own     youth

do      the       rest.           As     I    said           after              about          a    week       I    started           to     sleep          more

normally            but       even           now    I        still              have          recurring             emotions            regarding             th e

situation               and       my     sleep          is            not       as     it      should          be ,        this       obviously              then

effects           my     work,           I    had       to            take        some         time       off      work      after           th e      tragedy

that        being        the       Tuesday              itself.                      Like          most    people          who     have           to    justify

their         own       living           I    f illd         it        very          difficult             to       take     time          off        work    and

it     i.s vei. y        unusual              for       ine           to       take      any        time       whatsoever              off.            but    I have

been        conscious              that        apart              from            th e      actual         day        I   took     off        my       working

ability           has        been       severely                  affected                  since         the       time    of     the        tragedy

although            now       I am           starting                  to      overcome              my    emotions              and       get      back      into

As      I was        near       the       turnstile                there        was     a massive             surge        forward

People          were       yelling             stuck       at     l.he    turnstile             by    the     pure       volume

I rind o t h e r s            tried        to h e l p          the m    over,          the    police        were        uncertain

''.’lint     to d o      but       thankfully              (I     thought.)            they     did       open     IIk - g a t e s .

As      1 turned           to g o         inside          I.tie g r o u n d       there       was     only       one     obvious

entrance           1 could              see.

There          were      no     stewards             or    police         to d i r e c t        us    to     the      Clanks

or      other      parts           of     the    ground          so     we     all      headed        to     the      s e c I.ion

I     thought         it      was        like    Anfj.eid w h e r e             when         you     arrive        on    the

I couldn't               turn        back       because          of      the    people          behind.

I was          forced         to     the       left       hand     corner          of     the      section,           it w a s

loo        packed,         it      wasn't        comfortable                 and       I felt        then     that.      I wanted

to      yet     out.

Apparently               I lie g a m e         had    kicked           off     and      caused        a     further-        ran g e

towards            the     fence.

The        crowd      had       stopped          moving           forward          but       the     surge       of     pressure

                      Thank ^ y o u ^ for  the  draft   of' Pr                : report on the

                      the bixef      time available   this morning,  I have read through the
                      report and 1 believe it to be a satisfactory and balanced summary
                      o j al*    the most   interesting discussions.    So  therefore I have
                      little comment to make on the       draft in  its present   form, apart
                      from to c o ngrstillst© the authors on their succinctn^os .

                     1   do   however,   believe   that   in   the                                 Summary of   Main
                     Recommendations,  Item  3 Se ating/Standing,                                 this  should  also
                     include^the  reference to implications on sight                               lines and costing

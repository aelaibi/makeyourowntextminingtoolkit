             left    the       house a nd       set    off       for S h e f f i e l d        where     we w e r e   going        to    see

            We went        to L i m e      Street      Train Station                and       caught     the    11.35 am T r a i n            to

             ground a Police               Officer         saw    that       we    had    can    of     coke a n d     told       us we

our    packed           lunches           at     the       train       station and               got    on the          bus      for

Hillsborough.                     Th e    bus        took     us     to    the L e p p i n g s         Lane area            of    the       ground

and    we m a d e        our       way      to       the    turnstile             (turnstile            B ) which allows                    access

to    the W e s t        Stand.             As       we m a d e      our w a y        to    the    turnstile              I noticed               that

a    lot     of    supporters               were       waiting            around        in L e p p i n g s         Lane,         Tw o

supporters              asked        if we           h ad a n y      tickets          to    sell.

We    passed        through              our     turnstile             without          having         to     queue       at all.             I

noticed           that       every        turnstile              I could          see      had    one       Policeman            standing           by

i t , and         that       a number            of P o l i c e m e n       were        in a n d a r o u n d           the L e p p i n g s

Lane       area     telling              people        without            tickets          for    the m a t c h         to m o v e       a l on g .

Having        passed          through            the       turnstile            I saw a tunnel                 which        led       into        the

ground.            I c o ul d        see        the     pitch        through          the    t u nn e l       so m y s e l f      and       the

two    others           walked           through           the     t u n ne l ,      along       its    right          hand      side,        and

walked         into P e n 3.                    We    were       able      to     pass      along       the        tunnel        without

problem.            I d id         not      notice          any Police               Officers          or S t e w a r d s        at     the

entrance           to,       or    inside,            the     tunnel.

When       we a r r i v e d        in     pen 3 t h e r e           were        a few       people          sj^afhding at             the     back

wall,       and a few              sitting            on the         terrace          at    the V e r y        fr o n t .        We     were

By about           2 . 5 5 p m , when         the       players           walked          out    to    play       the       game,,     our      pen

was     sti l l     q u it e     normal           a n d we w e r e          not      under       any     great         pressure.               At

this     time Lee          and        I were         standing             side       by    side,       right^against                 the

f e nc e .     Le e      wa s    on m y       left        hand       side

As     the    players           kicked       off        I felt           a strong          surge / o m e          from       behind,

didn't        t h in k    anything           w as       wrong        at     this       t i m e & s this           type       of     s u rg e

happens        regularly              on    the     K o p at L i v e r p o o 1. / As                  a result          of    this        first

surge        both Lee           and myself              were        forced        against         the       perimeter             fence.            I

then moved            backwards,             as      is    normal           in t h i s      type       of    swaying          movement.

Lee     was    also       moved           backwards            and       ended       up    one    step       further           back       from

me.      I jostled              the       people        on m y       left       hand       side,       and wanted Lee                  to      come

back     to m y       side,          but    he w a n t e d          to    stay where             he was.

I used        the     space          I had made            to       turn myself             around          so    that       I was

now     facing        Lee,       and       shouted         to                   w ho      was    still       further

up     the    terrace,           to       stay where            he was.              While       I was       facing          towards           the

back     of    the       terrace           I could         see       that       my     pen w a s       full       of    people         all      the

way     to    the     back.           I also        noticed              that     C are a was            still         fairly        empty

with     People          only        standing           towards           the     back      of    it.

Before        I could tu rn a r o u n d                   to    face        the      pitch       there       was a seco nd                surge.

I was        still       facing           towards         Lee       and     the      s u rg e    pushed          us    together.               As

L ee    is s m a l l e r        t h a n me        his     face       w as    pushed         into m y         chest.           This        time

there        was    no    backwards               s w a y as        there       was       with    the       first,          or w i t h a n y

normal        sway,       and        the    pressure            just        remained            constant.              As    Lee     was

pushed        into me           he                                                                          tried       to     struggle

free.         His     head was             now     being        forced

back,        and    his     chin was              being        pushed        into m y           chest.           His    head        then

dropped,           his    face        was    forced            into m y         c h est     again,          a n d he yP'e 11         to     the

There        were       q u it e    a few P o l ic e           Officers          facing         into      our    pen as         this       all

happened           and     supporters             were       shouting           to    them asking             them     to m a k e

people        move       back.           A fe w O f f i c e r s       climbed          onto       the     perimeter            fence       and

began        shouting           people       to m o v e        back.         People         were       climbing        over         the

perimeter           fence          and     others       were       being        pulled        from      the     terrace         up    to

the     seated          area above           it.       People         had       been     climbing            over     the      perimeter

fence        since       the       second        surge       had    occured.

After        about       5 minutes           of     b e in g    in the          crush         I noticed         that        a small

gate        in the       perimeter           fence       had       been         opened allowing                 people         to    get out

of     my    pen    onto        the      pitch.         X watched                p e o p l e go      through         the    gate      but

after        another         5 minutes            it s e e m e d      to     stop.

I was        no w w e d g e d       into     the       corner       of     pen 3 a g a i n s t          the     perimeter            fence

and     the     fence        dividing            pen 3 a n d 2.              I w as      standing            side     o nt o    the

pitch with my                rig h t       arm    through          the     railings.              At    this     point         people

who     were       standing           in    pen 2 g r a b b e d me              from above             a n d p u l l e d me         upwards

to     get    over       the       pen     fence       and     ended       up    in    pan 2.

Almost        immediately                I was      joined         by a P o l i c e m a n         who    was     reaching

was     able       to    f i n d that        L ee      was     still       b r e a t / l n g.        Four     supporters             in P e n

get     me    out       of    the       pen.         We    followed         the     officers            carrying          L ee      to    the

pitch where              one       of       them     started mouth               to m o u t h      on Lee.

not     be a b l e       to       go w i t h Lee.

Myself        and                  stayed          on     the    pitch      for a b o u t        30 mins          just        watching

what     wa s      going          on.        There        were       lots   of    people         rushing          around           and    many

             LIVERPOOL CITY COUNCIL HILLSBOROUGH WORKING PARTY

             I refer to your letter of 18 May 1989 which identifies your remit from
             the City Council (by decision of 19 April 1989).

              I am grateful for the information which I have noted and also passed onto
              the Secretary of the Inquiry, Mr R M Whalley.

              In closing can I reiterate my earlier spoken and written suggestions that
              anything you learn which is material to Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry can
              be forwarded to myself or Mr Whalley at the following address

              Room 662
              Home Office
              50 Queen Anne's Gate
              London
              SW1H 9AT

              Can I also point out that I am also carrying out the Inquiry into how
              each of the ninety five killed met with their death on behalf of Her
              Majesty's Coroner.  Regardless of what you choose to forward to Lord
              Justice Taylor's Inquiry, I will still need to be aware of all material
              facts on behalf of the Coroner.

              I am sure I can look forward to your co-operation in this matter.




                                                  Sheffield
      PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE AT

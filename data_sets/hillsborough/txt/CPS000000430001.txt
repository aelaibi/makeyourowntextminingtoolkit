Dear Sirs

HILLSBOROUGH: Adlington v Duckenfield and Murray

Further to my letter of 27 July 1998 I enclose two schedules of material in the possession of
the Crown Prosecution Service.

The schedules comprise the material considered in the two CPS reviews in 1990 and 1997.
This is the only material now in the possession of the CPS. If voluntary disclosure becomes
applicable following our review decision then I would invite you to view the material at our
York offices. You will note that the schedules refer to some documents which are subject
to either public interest immunity or legal privilege, which will be claimed by the CPS.

Yours faithfully




George R.Croston
Prosecution Team Leader

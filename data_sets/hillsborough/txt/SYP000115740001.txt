       b eh a v i o u r was        just         fear,            I a sked               this mars to           look after         the man who

       a mop of untidy              dark              hair that fell                        f o r w a r d onto      his     face,,     He was

very emotional and upset but I could not u n d e r s t a n d this b e h a v i o u r .

The young                   boy who       had been         pulled from           the        crowd e v e n t u a l l y        started

breathing a g a i n and was                          laid     in the       recovery              position,,

I then saw anot h e r                      mars brought            from    the      crowd and              laid at        the side             of

this young                   boy,     the man who was about                   t h i r t y five years                  of age with

dark             hair and a full               beard was           obviously          dead.          A few minu t e s             later,

two young                   girls     from     the S t . Johns            Ambulance              were at his            side and

trying             to       revive      him,       they were        upset     thems e I v e s and              1   t was     odvious•

that             they were          wasting         their     time.

I tried                to go and          help them and             to tell         them so,           but     every time              I

left             the    gate      someone          would    open     it a l l o w i n g          supporters           onto       the       pitch.

E v e n t u a l l y another                  man     came     over to      the        two     girls and             took them away

covering                the man's            head With         his jumper.

         I sun a Police Constable of the South Yorkshire Police, presently stationed

         at Main Street, Rotherham#

         On Saturday 15th April 1989, I was on duty working the Liverpool, Nottingham

         Forest, F.A. Cup semi final at Hillsborough, Sheffield*                                                                                             I was detailed to

         receive the special train carrying the Liverpool fans from Wadaley Bridge

         railway station and escort them to the Leppings Lane turnstiles*

         The Liverpool supporters special train arrived early at .v'adsley Bridge, at

         around 1*35 p*m«                               The train was carrying approximately 350 football

         supporters who were marshalled together at the bottom of the steps leading

         to the station in Penistone Road before being excorted to the ground. The

         supporters                      were kept together on the right hand pavement v/hen facing towards

         the footballground with police officers on foot and on horseback walking on

         the roadway facing the on coming traffic.                                                                       The supporters were good humoured

         and there was no trouble encountered whilst walking them to the ground*

         We arrived at the ground at the Leppings Lane turnstiles at around 2*05 p*nu

         At that time a large crowd was at the turnstiles but again there was no

trouble and people were entering the ground in an orderly manner*                                                            However

a larre number of supporters were stood around in large groups talking and

drinking from cans of beer and bottles of wine and spirits. Approximately 100

to 150 supporters were stood in a group leaning on the stone bridge directly

across the road from the turnstiles and another group were on the railway

banking at the rear of the bridge, many of these were drinking but again

were generally conducting themselves in an orderly manner* After about ten

minutes stood at the turnstiles I was approached by a senior officer who I

did not know, he ordered me to start encouraging the supporters stood around

to make there way into the turnstiles* I approached a group of about forty

supporters stood across the road from me, I began taking cans of beer from

them and throwing them into the side of the road, I kept asking them to make

there way into the grounds, saying things such as • Gome on lads lets have you

inside we can*t all be getting in at the last minute.’. I went behind them and

began encouraging them to cross the road to the turnstiles, some did but others

simply split from the group and began walking in different directions. I

continued talking to other groups and asking them to enter the ground in a

similar manner.      Some did as requested but others again dispersed along the

Lane*     At this time I saw two mounted officers approach                                             the large group of

supporters leaning against the stone bridge, the mounted officers rode there

horses along the back of the group forcing them into the roadway and I could

hear them constantly asking people to enter the ground.                                             They refused to do so

and simply walked around the police horses and as fast as the mounted were

 clearing the wall the supporters were going behind them and again standing

alongside the bridge wall#

Throughout this time traffic was still trying to get through Leppings Lane

 and was hindered by fans still arriving and walking in the roadway, I therefore

 began clearing fans off of the road to allow the traffic through. More fans

        were arriving and this began to prove an impossible task, I heard from another

        officer nearby that the road was being closed to                                traffic and we were to let the

        supporters have the roadway, I therefore went back to the front oftheturnstiles.

        At that time I was approached by Superintendeat Sykes, he was accompanied by

        a young man pushing another young man in a wheel chair, he asked me to try and

        clear a way through the edge of the crowd for the wheel chair and get the lad

        into a gate which was in the left hand corner of the turnstiles where the facing

        wall meets the end wall of the shops on Leppings Lane. I recruited the

        assistance of P.C. 2910 Canmock in this and together we got the wheelchair

        through the crowd who readily allowed us access to the gate in a very good

        humoured manner. The gate was opened on our request and the wheelchair was

        allowed through before it was again closed.                           I then turned and started to make

        my way back to the roadway and         the rear of the crov/d.

        At this time the whole mood of         the crowd appeared to chanpe in an instant, there

        was a      great pushing from       the rear                and the people around me                             began toget

        on to      the turnstiles and into the corner of the two                               walls, people began to

        panic      anri try to push back but it was impossible todo so.

        After      only a few minutes several police horses were ridden into thecrowd,,

        nose to tail in a line effectively seperating the crowd into two halves,

        those already within the gates         near to the turnstiles and those nearest to the

        roadway.      The horses began pushing the crowd back towards                                        the road but all the

        time supporters were running in between the horses and underneath there legs.

        I stood between the rear of one horse and the head of another horse which I

        remember was being ridden by a Police Inspector, I continually tried to push

        people back as they tried to climbbetween and underneath the two horses

        inmediately in front of me.         We must have relieved the pressure from the crowd

        for a short while because I was then grabbed from behind and turned around by

        a m r- who was in the crowd nearest to the turnstiles.                                       He was obviously very

        distressed and was very abusive and aggresive, it was obvious that his aggression

        was not from anger but from fear and panic, he was shouting that people were

        going to be killed and that he had been at Heysel and the same was going to

        happen again, he got hold of both my arms and was shaking me shouting ' For fuck

        have to arrest him as he was winding up other people around us.               As I was saying

        this to him we v/ere approached by another nan, he said that he was this mans

        solicitorand that the man had been at Heysel and his behaviour v/as just fear.

        X asked this man to look after the man who v;as upset and he took him av/ay from

        me. The man who approached me and said . that he had been at Hysel was about ko

        years of age, he had a mop of untidy dark hair that fell forward onto his face.

        He was wearing very thick dark rimmed glasses and a very loud che ued jacket

        whicl was brown in colour.

        At that time the pushing started again, the horses in front of me appeared to

        be pushed sideways and back into the crowd near to the turnstiles. I could not

        push back and could feel myself being carried along with the crowd, there was

        a lot of shouting and confusion and a very strpng smell of alcohol in the air

        around me. Near the turnstiles I could see other officers pulling people up on

        to the wall above the turnstiles, I could see a supervisory officer stood

        immediately above the turnstiles talking into his radio and another supervisory

        officer stood on the wall immediately to my left immediately in front of me.

        People were screaming and shouting and were very frightened and I began to

        shout to the officer stood on the wall to open the gate, I clearly remember

        doing this. After a few more minutea the pressure appeared to go immediately

        and I was thrown apainst the fencing at the opposite side of the turnstiles to

        which I had started.      The crowd had gone and only a small number of people were

        were left milling around.

        As I began to come round and regain my composure a message came over the radio

        for all officers to attend in the ground at the Leppings Lane end immediately.

        I did not know what was happening on the ground but ran into the stadium through

        a gate, around the back of the seated stand and down through a gangway on to

        the pitch.    As I reached the pitch the Leppings Lane stand was immediately to

        my left, I could see people climbing over the safety barrier onto the pitch.

        Police officers were stood on the wall leaning over the safety fence.                                        As I

        got to the back of the goal mouth I began to climb onto the wall, as I did so I

        saw a man strike out from 'the crowd and hit the police officer leaning over the

        fence at the side of the head.                       I could see that people were being pushed up

        against the fence in a distressed condition and it became obvious that what -;as

        happening was not a pitch invasion as I had at first thought*                                         Before I could

        climb onto the wall I saw the body of a young boy of about twelve years being

        passed over the fence, together with a female member of the St Johns ambulance

        brigade I grabbed the boy and pulled him onto the pitch, we were then joined

        by a male member of the St Johns ambulance brigade and these two people carried

        the boy from the rear of the goal mouth to my immediate left at the corner of

        the Leppings Lane stand and the seated area.                                     3y this time a number of people

        were on the pitch and were receiving first aid from St Johns ambulancemen,

        police officers and other persons. I began trying to help people in obvious

        distress and at that time saw a number of supporters coming through a small

        gate to the left of the pitch when facing towards Leppings Lane, they appeared

        to be fighting each other and I ran over and seperated them, I tried to feet

        the standing area, they refused to leave the pitch and I therefore shut tils' gate/i

        to prevent anymore people coming onto the field and adding to the confusion.

        As I shut the gate X saw the man and woman from the St Johns Ambulance trying

        revive   the young boy who had been passed over the fence with mouth to mouth

        and heart massage.      I went over to them and knelt down at the side of the boy

        to try and assist them, as I did so I felt blows to the back of my head and

        shoulders, I turned round and two men were lashing out at me, I tried to

        restrain them and was assisted by other supporters and police officers. We tried

        to get them to leave the pitch but they would not, I saw that the small gate do I

        to ny left had again been opened and more people were coming onto the pitch.

        Small pockets of fighting and pushing were breaking out and so in order to

        prevent anymore people coining on to the pitch and adding to the confusion I went
                         C^C
        back to tfee gate*and closed it once again. I remained at the gate to prevent

        anyone else opening it and supporters were continually trying to climb over

        the barrier and push through the gate, there was plenty of room inside that

        part of the stand and so I began pushing them back over the railings and was

        assisted by other supporters in the stand who were pulling them back and

        trying to calm them down, I became the subject of verbal abuse and spitting

        fro:: these people but to have let them on to the pitch would have led to more

        confusion.    I did let onto the field anyone who said that they were medical

        staff and offering assistance.        It appeared to me that the decent people

        in tie crowd were realising the scale of what had been talcing place and remained

        in tie stand, the ones who were trying to get on to the pitch were the people

        who vere drnnk and for some unknown reason wanted to be part of what was

        happening.

        Throughout this time I could see more people being pulled over the fence and

        on to the pitch, the Nottingham Forest fans did not appear to know what vas

        happening or appreciate the gravity of the situation, I could clearly hear them

        charting 1 Let em Die, Let em Die Let em Die ' and this obviously incensed the

        Liverpool supporters who continued shoving forward and then began throwing coins

        at T>eor>le on the pitch who were trying to help. Everyone was very emotional and

        upset but   I could not understand this behaviour#

        The young boy who had been pulled from the crowd eventually started breathing

        again and was laid in the recovery position.

        I then saw another man brought from the crowd and laid at the side of this

        young boy, the man who was about thirty five years of age with dark hair and

        a full beard was obviously dead.         A few minutes later, two young girls from the

        St Johns ambulance were at his side and trying to revive him, they were upset

        themselves and it was obvious that they were wasting their time,

        I tried to go and help them and to tell them so, but everytime I left the gate

        soaeone would open it allowing supporters on to the pitch.

        Eventually another man came over to the two girls and took them away covering

        the sans head with his junqser.

        I was annoyed and disgusted at         the way the drunken         element in the crowd behaved,

        their conduct prevented myself         and others to help those whohad been injured.

        The najority of the people in the stand area on that side of Leppings Lane

        were decent and helpful but the minority who were drunk, violent, abusive and

        aggressive did nothing to help         the situation.

        I regained at the gate until after           the anouncement       had been made that the game

        was to be abandoned and the majority of supporters had left the ground.

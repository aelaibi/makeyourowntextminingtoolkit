    the recommendations of the Interim Report of Lord Justice Taylor, and have
    pleasure in forwarding for your attention a report in respect of Barnsley

    Some of the points highlighted have already been addressed by the Barnsley

    information, then please do not hesitate to contact me.

    Yours sincerely

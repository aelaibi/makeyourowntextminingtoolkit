LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR'S VISIT TO IBROX

I attach letters to the Chief Constable and to Rangers FC outlining final
details for Saturday's v isit.

The arrangem ents remain v e r y much those se t out in the annex to my
letter of 2 October. I have em phasised to both the police and to Rangers
that we may need to in ser t a considerable degree of flexib ility to the
timetable arrangements once we get to Ib rox, and my outline proposals in
the above annex give v er y approximate times only.

I recall that you do not want much in the way of b riefin g.               However, I
attach -

       a.     a drawing of the Stadium,

     b.       a paper b y Rangers FC on crowd sa fety and control policy

     c.    papers relating to offen ces committed under the Criminal Justice
     (Scotland) Act 1980, th e su ccess of which has been one of the major
     factors influencing the improvement of crowd behaviour in Scotland
     in recent y ea rs. One of th e in terestin g asp ects of Saturday's v isit
     may be a post-m atch inspection of the ground to count controlled
     containers ie beer cans etc discarded at the ground. I understand
     that this is a rare occurrence at Ibrox - sure testim ony to the
     su ccess of this statu tory m easure.

I look forward to m eeting you on Saturday.

PART V OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE (SCOTLAND) ACT 1980
SPORTING EVENTS: CONTROL OF ALCOHOL ETC


1«   Part V of the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act gives effect to recommendations
contained in the report of the Working Group on football crowd behaviour, under
the Chairmanship of Mr Frank McElhone MP, which reported to the Secretary of State
in 1977.    The aim is to reduce the problem of violence and hooliganism associated
with drinking and drunkenness, particularly at football matches, and the measures
contained in the Act are directed at the consumption and carriage of alcohol at
designated sporting events and on coaches travelling to and from these sporting
events.


Offenees created


2.   The Act which applies only in Scotland, creates a number of offences in
connection with the carriage, possession or consumption of alcohol at or while
travelling by a hired coach to or from a     designated event at a designated
ground.    The offences are:                                                        #


     (a)   for any person to carry alcohol or be drunk on board a coach travelling
     to or from a designated sporting event (Section       (a) and (c));


     (b)   for the person to whom the coach is hired to fail to prevent the carriage
     of alcohol on a coach travelling to or from a designated sporting event
     (subject to defence in Section 7l that he did all he reasonably could to prevent
     the carriage) (Section ^(b));


     (c)   for the PSV licence holder, his employee or agent to permit the carriage
     of alcohol on the vehicle for which the licence is held when it is taking
     passengers to or from a designated sporting event (again subject to the defence
     in Section71) (Section70);


     (d)   by any person to attempt to enter or be in a designated sports ground
     during the period of a designated event in possession of a bottle, can or other
     container which could cause injury (Section 72);


     (e)   for any person to attempt to enter or be in a designated sports ground
     during the period of a designated event in possession of alcohol (Section 73);


     (f)   for any person to attempt to enter or be in a designated sports ground
     during the period of a designated event while drunk    ^Secfci«\ 74-
 Police Powers


 3»    Section 75 provides the police with certain powers to enable them to enforce
 the provisions of Part V of the Act.      A constable shall have the power without
 warrant:


       (a)    to enter a designated sports ground during the period of a designated
       sporting event;


       (b)    to search persons and vehicles where he has reasonable grounds to
       suspect an offence under Part V is being or has been committed;


       (c)   to arrest persons whom he has reasonable grounds to suspect are
      committing or have committed an offence under Part V;


      (d) to seize and detain bottles, cans etc, together with their contents if
      any.


Designation


k. The Secretary of State may under Section^ designate by order (a) a sports
ground or class of sports ground and (b) a sporting event or class of sporting event
to which the provisions of the Act apply.      The provisions apply only to designated
sporting events taking place at designated sports grounds.      Amateur events for
which there is no admission charge are excluded from the scope of the provisions.


Definitions


5*    It should be noted that under Section 7 7 5—


      (a)    the "period of a designated sporting event" (during which the controls will
      apply) means the period 2 hours before the start and one hour after the end of
      the event; and


      (b)    the provisions apply to the "relevant area" of a sports ground, which is
      the part of a ground to which spectators are admitted on payment, or any part
      from which the designated sporting event may be viewed, but not to private
      areas of the stadium such as the boardroom or changing rooms.

  VISIT BY LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR

  I am w riting just to confirm the arrangem ents which we have d iscu ssed in
  recent days b y telephone, for Lord Justice Taylor's v isit to Ibrox on
  Saturday 14 October.       The Lord Justice will be accompanied b y Mr
  Jonathan Sweet and m yself. Mr R ussell H illhouse, Permanent S ecretary at
  the Scottish Office will also atten d . Mr Sweet and I will accompany the
  Lord Justice on h is tour of the ground and w hilst I imagine that
  Mr Hillhouse will accompany the Lord Justice prior to the k ick -o ff, I
  think that Mr Hillhouse would p refer to see all of the match if at all
  p o ssib le.

  On that b a sis, the p arty will arrive at 1200 h r s.         As d iscu ssed ,
  introductions and initial b riefing might take place b y means of a b rief
  tour of the ground, followed b y lunch at about 1230. As we agreed , the
  p arty might then resume a more len gth y tour of facilities from about 1315,
  involving examination both in sid e and outside the ground. Lord Justice
  Taylor will be particularly keen to see the arrangem ents for stew arding,
  tu rn stile monitoring and police control of the crowd, as well as looking at
  the physical layout of the ground. The Lord Justice may wish to tour
  the ground during at least some of the fir st half and will be particularly
  in terested in exit arrangem ents at full-tim e.      I hope that it will be
  possible for him to have a short d e-b riefin g session with both Strathclyde
  Police and you rselves sh ortly before he departs at 1720 h r s, for the 1755
  plane to London.

   If you w ish any fu rth er information about Lord Ju stice Taylor's
   requirem ents, please do not h esitate to contact me. In the meantime, I
   would like to thank R angers FC for b eing so accommodating in the run up
   to Lord Justice Taylor's v is it. I hope that on the d ay, we have th e right
   resu lt both on and off the park!

   I am copying this letter to Jonathan Sweet for information.

LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR'S VISIT TO IBROX 14 OCTOBER 1989

I am w riting just to confirm the details of arrangem ents which I have
made with Rangers FC and Mr John Dickson for the v isit of Lord Justice
Taylor to the Rangers v Dundee United match at Ibrox on 14 October.

Lord Justice Taylor is making th is v isit as part of h is tour of a wide
range of sp ortin g grounds throughout the UK and you may well already
have seen papers which relate to the second le g of his Scottish tour on
26-28 October.

Lord Justice Taylor will be accompanied b y h is Private Secretary
(Jonathan Sweet) and m yself. Mr R ussell H illhouse, Permanent S ecretary
at the Scottish O ffice, will also attend , in fulfilment of a lon g-stan d in g
invitation to v isit Ibrox.

Lord Justice Taylor and Mr Sweet will be fly in g up from Gatwick on the
Air UK 0855 plane, which lands at Glasgow airport at 1015. I would be
grateful if you would make arrangem ents for them to be ferried to Pitt
Street b y police car. Mr Hillhouse will be travellin g to Glasgow on the
1000 h r s train from Edinburgh. I would also be grateful if he could be
met b y police car and taken to Pitt S treet.          I will be travellin g
independently and will aim to arrive at Pitt Street b y 1100 h r s.

Mr Dickson has kindly agreed to b rief Lord Justice Taylor 1100 h rs -
1145 h rs on the policing of major sp ortin g even ts in S trathclyde,
including police train in g, deployment and ta ctics, as well as a tour of
SITRAC control.

We should leave for Ibrox at 1145, as Rangers FC are exp ectin g u s at
1200 h r s. A fter an initial tour of th e ground and in troductions, Lord
Justice Taylor will have lunch with Rangers FC and proceed to make a
more detailed inspection of the inside and outside of the ground,
including of course the police control room and turnstile monitoring
operations. I understand that the Lord Ju stice will be keen to see all
parts of the ground and Rangers FC are b ein g extrem ely co-operative in
this resp ect. I expect that the Lord Justice will wish to leave Ibrox no
later than 1720, in order to catch the 1755 plane. There will therefore
be a limited opportunity for the Lord Ju stice to be briefed on how the
day has gone, in terms of crowd behaviour etc. Perhaps Mr Dickson
could b rief accordingly.


A0200608.109
As Mr Hillhouse will be attend in g the match as a gu est of Rangers FC,
rather than as part of the Lord Ju stice's tour I imagine th at, whilst
Mr Hillhouse will accompany Lord Ju stice Taylor on the pre k ick -o ff tour
of the ground, he will w ish to see most, if not all, of the match itse lf. I
will accompany Lord Justice Taylor throughout. Mr Hillhouse will wish to
leave Ibrox at 1715 h r s, retu rn in g to Edinburgh b y official car, which his
Private Secretary will arrange.             Finally,  I am in touch with
Inspector Dempsey concerning arrangem ents for Lord Justice Taylor's
second v isit to Scotland, from 26-28 October.         I will write again once
plans have been finalised on that tour.         In the meantime, Lord Justice
Taylor's office have asked me to p ass on their gratitude for the
arrangem ents which Strathclyde Police are making to a ssist Lord Justice
Taylor.

I am copying this letter to Mr Hillhouse and Mr Sweet for information.

 LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR’S VISITS TO SCOTLAND

T hank s for y o u r le tte r of 27 Septem ber. On th e basis of th a t and o u r
telephone conv ersatio ns in re c e n t d a y s, I attach a d ra ft programme for
th e 14 O ctober v isit. I will be meeting R angers FC people on a se p a ra te
issu e on 4 O ctober and I have made arran g em en ts with them to go
th ro u g h th e fin er details of th e v isit to Ibrox th e n . But for th e moment,
can I say th a t R angers a re genuinely pleased th a t Lord Ju stice T aylor
w ishes to v isit th e ir g ro u n d , th a t th e y and th e S tra th c ly d e Police will be
h ap p y to show his Lordship round all of th e facilities, as he w ishes, and
th a t, h aving seen Ibrox m yself in recen t d ay s, I am su re th a t th e v isit
on 14 O ctober will be extrem ely in te re stin g , p a rtic u la rly those a sp e c ts
concerning        stew ard in g ,  com puter        control o f tu rn s tile s      and    th e
predom inance o f seating facilities.

You may also wish to mention to Lord Ju stic e Taylor th a t my Perm anent
S e c re ta ry , Mr R ussell Hillhouse, will be a tte n d in g th e match as a g u est o f
R ang ers FC, Mr Hillhouse has in fact had a lo n g -o u tstan d in g Invitation
from th e club to a tte n d a match at his convenience, and Mr Hillhouse
feels th a t it would b e p a rtic u la rly o ppo rtune for him to a tte n d th is m atch,
in order to gain an im pression of how th e match is policed and some of
th e behind th e scenes arran g em en ts at such a major m atch.                 In o th e r
w ords, Mr Hillhouse would not propose to accompany Lord Ju stice Taylor
on all asp ects of his v isit to Ibrox and would v e ry much be content to
w atch th e match its e lf a f te r seeing som ething of th e p re-m atch
p re p a ra tio n s e tc .

I would welcome early confirm ation th a t his L ordship is content with th e
a ttach ed program m e.

As re g a rd s th e 26-28 O ctober v isit, I have yet to finalise d etails, b u t th e
program m e so fa r is sh aping up q uite well. The p ic tu re looks like a late
 flight on 26 O ctober, sta y in g o v ern igh t in Glasgow. Mr Ernie Walker th e
 S e c re ta ry of th e S cottish Football Association is u n d o u b ted ly a p erso n
whom Lord Ju stice Taylor should meet if at all p ossible.               Mr Walker is
flying o u t to Stockholm early on 27 O ctober, so th e only possibility fo r a
m eeting with Lord Ju stic e Taylor would be ov er d in n er on th e ev enin g of
th e 26th. I have mentioned th is possibility to th e S trath cly d e Police, who
have su g g e ste d th a t th e ir Chief C onstable, Mr Sloan, p u ts on a small
d in n e r for Lord Ju stice T ay lo r. The Police are du e to come back to me
in th e n ex t few days b u t, if th a t proposal falls th ro u g h , I would expect

E0201602.109                                 1.
Mr Walker to be available him self for a                       p riv a te   d in n e r   with   Lord
Ju stice Taylor (at SFA ex p en se, of c o u rse ).

On 27 O ctober, I su g g e st th a t Lord Ju stice Taylor base himself at
Alhambra House, o u r office In Waterloo S tre e t, Glasgow fo r e ith e r a
sin g le, or a se rie s of m eetings with the S cottish Football League, the
Association of Chief Police O fficers (Scotland) and th e Fire and Ambulance
A uthorities      In     S cotland. T his   session    could    be     completed
9000hrs-1300hrs. A fter a lig h t lu n ch , Lord Ju stice Taylor could th en
d e p a rt fo r a to u r of Hampden P ark (1345-1530) followed b y a to u r of
Celtic P ark (1545-1715), The arran g em en ts for d in n er th a t ev enin g a re
somewhat u n certain as y e t, and it may be th a t, if th e Chief Constable is
unavailable on th e 26th, he may wish to host a small g a th e rin g on th e
evening of th e 27th,

The S e c re ta ry of St Johnstone FC has confirmed th a t th e club would be
deligh ted if Lord Ju stic e Taylor was able to v isit th e ir g ro und in P e rth .
T his would Involve a d e p a rtu re from Glasgow a t 9000hrs for a to u r of
Mcdlarmld P ark from 1000-1100 approxim ately.                 T his g ro u n d h as a
capacity of about 10,000 all-seated and was completed in A ugust th is
y e a r. It was co n stru c te d by developer’s money a fte r th e Club had sold
th e ir p rev io u s elderly gro und for th e co n stru ctio n of a su p e rm ark et. It
la an excellent example of a less obvious way to modernise facilities.
In cid en tally , crowds have in creased m arkedly since th e new g ro u n d was
opened and th e Club is th riv in g at th e top of th e S cottish F irst Division.

The Scottish Rugby Union would be delighted to have Lord Ju stice Taylor
as th e ir gu est for th e Scotland v e rsu s FIJI match and his p a r ty would, of
co u rse , be in v ited for th e pre-(natch lu n ch . You may wish to b rin g to
Lord Ju stice T ay lo r's atten tio n th e fact th a t H er Royal H ighness th e
P rin c ess Royal will also be a tte n d in g , as will th e P resid en t o f Fiji,
to g e th e r with Mr Michael F o rsy th MP, M inister with respon sib ility for sp o rt
in Scotland. It Is also possible th a t th e Prime M inister of Fiji, and my
S e c re ta ry of State will also a tte n d .T h e re fo re , th e se c u rity arran g em en ts at
th e gro u n d th a t day may be sligh tly d ifferen t to th a t for a more normal
major f ix tu re . Having said th a t, I have no doubt th a t it would still be
possible for Lord Ju stic e Taylor to examine closely th e configuration of
th e gro u n d and th e arran g em en ts made for th e handling of a major ru g b y
crowd at M urray field.

I will contact you          as   soon    as possible      on    th e    fin er   details    of th e
26-18 O ctober v isit.

Dear Sir,

                              Hillsborough Inquiry

    Thank you for your letter of 26th May.

    Please let me have details of the widths of the gates referred to in the
first paragraph of your letter.

   With regard to the lateral fencing at the Milton Road End what is its width?



                                      Yours faithfully,




                                       for The Treasury Solicitor

   EVIDENCE OF PROFESSOR PHIL SCRATON
           AND MR DAVID FROST




                      1
 1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Mr. Frost is going to tell me
 2         something about the way statements were taken by the
 3         South Yorkshire Police.        Is that right?
 4   PROFESSOR SCRATON:     Yes.      David Frost is a former police,
 5         officer in the South       Yorkshire Police.
 6   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         I did ask you to let me have a
 7         written statement.
 8   PROFESSOR SCRATON:      Yes.
 9   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Why haven't I got it?
10   PROFESSOR SCRATON:      Because what I did - and I agreed this
11         with Chris on the phone - was to give you a second
12         submission which would indicate what David would talk
13         about today because David felt that he didn't want to
14         make a written statement at that point and I couldn't
15         commit him to that.       So in that situation I spoke to
16         Chris about it and I said that what I would do -              which is
17         what I did do - is to put in a second submission              where I
18         would outline the area which David would talk about.
19   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Yes,   I see.
20   MR.   BONE:     We do have that.
21   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         I have got the supplementary
22         submission.     The difficulty is that if I don't know
23         precisely what is going to be said it is difficult for me
24         to ask questions about it beforehand.
25   PROFESSOR SCRATON:      Yes,   I would accept that.
26   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         All right. Let us hear what you
27         have got to say, Mr.      Frost.     What is your full name?
28   MR.   FROST:     David John Frost.
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         And what is your occupation?
30   MR.   FROST:     I am a student now.       My former occupation      at the
31         time of the Hillsborough disaster,           I was a police
32         constable in the South Yorkshire Police.            2130 is my
           number,    if that is of help.        It is probably just      as well
           if you read t h a t .    Those were my duties on the day.
                         (Statement handed to the Judge)



                                           2
 1         If you would like to read the statement,             I'll explain the
 2         relevance of the front sheet.
 3   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:           This is your statement,     is it?
 4   MR.   FROST:     That is my statement as it was adjusted.
 5   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:            This is a letter from the
 6         solicitors.
 7   MR.   FROST:     That is right.
 8   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:            It appears to be only part of a
 9         lett er.
10   MR.   BONE:     That is the police force's solicitors.
11   MR.   FROST:     Yes,    it is.
12   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:           Have you got the rest of the
13         letter?
14   MR.   FROST:     No,    that was just the front sheet that came back
15         on the statement.           Basically it would appear that the
16         statements went to the solicitors and came back with the
17         relevant comments about changes in statements,
18         submittance of various parts of evidence.              One thing that
19         concerned me at the time,          having served at that time
20         approximately eight years,             is that after the event we
21         were asked to give our statements on non-CJA witness
22         paper, which was unprecedented in mine and my colleague's
23         experience and, having done so, mine and a large
24         proportion of my colleague's statements came back which
25         had been scrutinised and various alterations made -
26         which,    again,     I have never had to submit a statement in
27         any part of my work that has been scrutinised at any
28         stage in my service.
29                 When it came back there were omissions and various
30         alterations to my statement,             and I did in fact refuse to
31         sign a scarified version.              As you will read from my
32         statement,        I was a fairly important witness, having gone
33         from outside the cages to inside the cages;             and I was
34         never asked to give evidence in the inquiry.
35   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:            Which cages are you talking about?
36   MR.   FROST:     The Leppings Lane cages.

                                              3
 1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:            Do you mean the pens?
 2   MR.   BONE:     Pens 3 and 4.
 3   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:            Pens 3 and 4.
 4   MR.   FROST:       Yes.
 5   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:            After the disaster?
 6   MR.   FROST:       Well,    during.
 7   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:            During the rescue operation?
 8   MR.   FROST: • Yes.
 9   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:            I had better just read this for a
10         moment.
11                             (The Judge read the statement)
12         "Inspector Beresford poking",            is it,   "with the fence"?
13   MR.   FROST:       "Inspector Beresford poking with the fence that
14         was to cost so many of their lives.               It was all a big
15         joke     "
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:            Yes,   that is all right.    I can
17         read the rest.           What are C&V work mates?
18   MR.   FROST:       It is Crime and Vandal - it was a specific public
19         order unit.          We were asked ----
20   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:            Just let me ask the questions for
21         the m o m e n t .
22   MR.   FROST:       I was just going to give you an explanatory note
23         which might help you.
24   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:            On page 2, the last paragraph,        "I
25         went outside the ground again",            that is the Penistone
26         Road end,      is it?
27   MR.   FROST:       The north stand,     yes.    It is on the right-hand
28         s i d e ----
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:            Yes - but not the Leppings Lane
30         end?
31   MR.   FROST:       No.
32   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:            A n d there were a number of
33         Liverpool fans at that end, were there?
34   MR.   FROST:       Yes,    they were trying to storm there way in,
35         trying to force their way in through the turnstiles
36         without paying.
 1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          Sorry,      I am going to have to ask
 2          you to look at this again.             On the fourth page,       about    12
 3          lines down:       "I moved towards the centre of the pen",               and
 4          then I can't read the       next word.
 5   MR.    FROST:     "Oh,   fuck".
 6   LORD   JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Oh, I see.        By "thecentre pen"
 7          which are you referring to?Is that                pen 3   or 4?
 8   MR.    FROST:   Pen 3.
 9   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          I don't quite understand this
10          reference to bags of sand.
11   MR.    FROST:   "Like carrying bags           of sand",carrying dead
12          people, very heavy.
13   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          Oh,   it was like carrying bags of
14          sand - that is what you meant, was it?
15   MR.    FROST:   Yes.
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          When you refer to "gaffers",            is
17          that a reference to senior officers?
18   MR.    FROST:   Yes.      We were asked to write the statement             in the
19          form of a personal account to            start with,    and   that is why
20          it is in the language that it is.
21   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          Yes, of course.           I understand.       As
22          I understand it, you were asked to write your own
23          description of what had happened that day,                is that right?
24   MR.    FROST:   Personal account.
25   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         In your       own words     -which    you do
26          with all your feelings and emotions at the time
27   MR.    FROST:   Yes.
28   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          If you had been asked to make a
29          witness statement, would you have included all those
30          matters?
31   MR.    FROST:     I would have included matters that had been
32          crossed out regarding behaviour of fans, behaviour of
33          senior officers;       and I don't think feelings are
34          necessarily relevant as regards evidence.




                                               5
1    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Can we perhaps go through it and
2           you tell me what you think should not have been crossed
3           out?
4    MR.    FROST:     OK.    It was unusual in the respect that I could
5           not understand why we weren't asked to do a CJA witness
 6          statement.
7    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         I imagine because there was no
8           question of any prosecution of anybody at this stage.
9    MR.    FROST:     Yes, but even as a witness you would expect to do
10          a statement in that form.       In your experience,    have you
11          known this happen before as regards police officers
12          giving evidence?
13   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         I-have not had experience of a .
14          disaster of this sort before.
15   MR.    FROST: No, but would you have ----
16   LORD   JUSTICE      STUART-SMITH: Have you?
17   MR.    FROST: No.        That is what I am saying.    Ihave never   been
18          asked to give a personal account when I have been at work
19          being employed as a police officer,        a professional
20          witness,    I have never been asked to give - my original
21          was handwritten on just bits of fly paper.
22   LORD   JUSTICE      STUART-SMITH: Why did you think it    was wrong       to
23          ask you to give a personal account?
24   MR.    FROST:     At the time - that is what I am saying - at the
25          time I couldn't understand why.         It seemed to be a waste
26          of manpower and time to get everybody to do that and not
27          just submit a statement on CJA witness paper.          I have
28          never been asked to do it before.         When you are employed
29          as a police officer you are a police officer.          So then
30          why are you not a professional witness?          Why do they want
31          an account of feelings,       etc?   A n d then why on the front
32          sheet here is it - Mr. Don Denton was a Superintendent or
33          a Chief Superintendent in Staff Services or Management
34          Services.        "We have the following further comments on
35          statements requested by the West Midlands inquiry.            As
36          before,    the mention of a name without comment indicates
 1         that the statement has been read and that we have no
 2         suggestions for review or alteration." - which suggests
 3         they are being scrutinised.
 4   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          There is no question about this.
 5         As I understand it, what happened was that everybody
 6         involved was asked to write their own personal account of
 7         what they had done and what had happened that day,               and
 8         that is what you did?         That is right,   isn't it?
 9   MR.   FROST:   That is right,       yes.
10   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          That was for the benefit       of the
11         South Yorkshire Police and their solicitors.               A n d then
12         the West Midlands Police, because of the shortage of time
13         before the inquiry,        asked that instead of them taking
14         witness statements the personal accounts could be adapted
15         to become the witness statements,          and that is in effect
16         what happened.        And,   as I understand it, the process of
17         making the witness statement was dealt with by amendments
18         as were thought appropriate to the original statements
19         made by you.       Now,   of course,   if something important was
20         cut out,    that may be something for concern.         But I don't
21         imagine that you would have wanted this original
22         statement to go in as it was as a witness statement,
23         would you?
24   MR.   FROST:     No.    Having said that,     I didn't expect,     either,
25         to be given basically this back saying "You will re­
26         submit without various points in", as a lot of my
27         colleagues were very surprised.          A nd the gentleman on the
28         front,   P.S. Eddison, was my sergeant at the time,             and he
29         was very critical of the lack of management pyramid at
30         the time.        People who were of notable senior rank who
31         were at the front sort of joining in pulling out bodies
32         when they should have been actually setting up some sort
33         of organisation and pyramid structure - I mean,               I ‘haven't
34         seen him for a good while, but my recollection is that
35         that is what the comments referred to on here regarding



                                            7
 1         "You may with to reconsider some of the comment on pages
 2         3/4".     You may want to see him about that.
 3   LORD JUSTICE     STUART-SMITH:   Let us go   through this statement
 4         and you    tell me what you think ought not to have been cut
 5         out.
 6   MR.   FROST:     I don't know whether that would be relevant,       the
 7         comments about alcohol and purchase price.        There has
 8         been a lot of dispute about alcohol-related issues on the
 9         day.
10   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       About the price?
11   MR.   FROST:    Yes.   I   don't know how that would fit in with
12         other people's evidence about alcohol - no direct
13         -consequence.
14   LORD JUSTICE     STUART-SMITH:   You think   that the question about
15         the purchase price and the price       of alcohol for the match
16         should have been left in, do you?
17   MR.   FROST:    It is acomment about alcohol-related matters;
18         and alcohol-related matters were of consequence on the
19         day.     Any comments about the charge room.     The charge
20         room was in chaos.      I have never seen anything like it.
21   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Where are you now?
22   MR.   FROST:     "I remember thinking at the time how busy the
23         charge room was.      We couldn't get in and did the
24         necessary outside." - "the necessary" being taking
25         details and then ejection from the ground.        A n d I have
26         never known it.      And later on it goes on to describe the
27         chaotic scene in the charge room.        It was on the point
28         of, the people in the charge room actually breaking out.
29         A n d that is why I hung on until it had settled down a
30         little bit.      I had never known so many people arrested at
31         a football match.      In eight years of working at football
32         matches,    I had arrested two people.     On this day I had
33         arrested three people.      That is two people in those eight
34         years.    On this    day I had arrested three people.
35   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        It sounds as though there were
36         more problems on this day than on other days.
 1   MR.   FROST:   Indeed,     there were,    yes.
 2   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         These people you were arresting
 3         and the people who were in the charge room were the worse
 4         for drink,       as I understand it.
 5   MR.   FROST:     Yes.
 6   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         A nd they were being unruly because
 7         of that?
 8   MR.   FROST:   It just seemed that the place was completely
 9         overwhelmed by the number of prisoners that were being
10         taken to it.         The charge room - I don't know whether you
11         have seen the police room at the football ground.
12   MR.   BONE:    Yes, we have.
13   MR.   FROST:   It is very,     very small,       and it was in   absolute
14         tumult, overflowing with prisoners waiting to              be bo oked
15         in, who were in a high-state of agitation.               It was out of
16         control.     So that has relevance.           Again,   the next bit,
17         re-worded maybe for an official statement.
18   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Where are you now?
19   MR.   FROST:     Page 3: "It seemed that these crazed animals
20         would die if the game went on without them."               I mean,
21         that was just a comment on the atmosphere again in the
22         charge room.
23   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Haven't you covered that in the
24         previous sentence?
25   MR.   FROST:     Yes, but if you want me to go through each bit
26         and give you my comments ----
27   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Yes.     I am just pointing out to
28         you that that is probably covered in more diplomatic
29         terms in the previous sentence.
30   MR.   FROST:     Yes, OK.
31   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         I mean,       I don't think you would
32         put in a witness statement "I remember hating them.for
33         their mentality."
34   MR.   FROST:     No,    as we have discussed previously.         This is
35         why, having been asked to submit a report in this form -
36         which,   again,     I have never done before - your personal
 1         feelings and then it has been obviously doctored for,             as
 2         you say, a statement,       I mean,       I would not write - if you
 3         asked me to sit down and write you a police witness
 4         statement as a professional witness,            obviously it woul d
 5         be very different to this.              But at no stage was I asked
 6         to do that.
 7   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         No,    I follow that. If you had been
 8         asked to do that initially, would it have been more or
 9         less in the amended form that we have now got?
10   MR.   FROST:     In the amended form, no, because ----
11   PROFESSOR SCRATON:        Can I make an observation?
12   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Well,       I would rather you didn't.
13   MR.   FROST:     Comments about the radio being garbled and
14         frantic.     The communication system went down.
15   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         I have noted that.        Perhaps we had
16         better go on going through it and you tell me what you
17         think ought not to have been cut out.
18   MR.   FROST:     Yes.     Comments about the radio and communication
19         system - I don't see why that should have been cut out.
20         I can't understand why the references to the smell of
21         drink and urine and excreta ----
22   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Where are we now?
23   MR.   FROST:     We are    on page 4, five lines from the bottom.
24   MR.   BONE:    This is     in the pen.
25   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Yes.
26   MR.   FROST:     There is a comment at the top of the next page,
27         "Megaphone giving orders,          it's about time."     I would have
23         made reference       to the lack of senior       management or any
29         sort of structure of management until very late             on in the
30         day,    and when it came it was completely inadequate,          and
31         those would have been my comments in the statement -
32         especially when it was relevant to any form of inquiry.
33         I still don't understand why we were asked to submit a
34         statement like this.




                                              10
 1   LORD JUSTICE       STUART-SMITH: Never mind about that for the
 2         moment.       Can we go on through what you think ought not          to
 3         have been cut out.
 4   MR.   FROST:     There is a comment here just after "How many
 5         dead?" of "Bottleneck".        I don't see why that has been
 6         cut out.     Because there was no organisation,         even though
 7         there was a Chief Superintendent at the gate, he wasn't
 8         organising.     He was just part of the chain,         and there
 9         were two chains coming together,           and there was a complete
10         bottleneck at the door, which should have been easily
11         sorted out but it wasn't.
12   MR.   BONE:You mean the officers           were getting in each other's
13         way?
14   MR.   FROST:That is right.        There was       a main pile of bodies
15         four or     five deep,    and as we were pulling people out they
16         were being passed along,       and there were two going into
17         the gate,    one from each side of this pile; and as they
18         got towards the gate there were people being dropped and
19         having to wait instead        of it being co-ordinated.

20   LORD JUSTICE       STUART-SMITH: The trouble as I understand it is
21         that the gate was so narrow that it was difficult to get
22         more than perhaps two people carrying a body through.
23   MR.   FROST:      it was narrow but it was sufficient to get one
24         body through at a time, but the trouble is they were
25         trying to get two bodies through at a time.              So all it
26         did was jam it up completely.
27   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Yes.
28   MR.   FROST:     The next comment:     "Notice for the first time
29         gaffers    [senior officers]     are now about.       Where have they
30         been.      Why was the organisation so late."           I think that
31         has got a great deal of relevance.               Would you agree?
32   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Yes,    carry on.
33   MR.   FROST:     Is that "Yes",     you agree?
34   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Well,    it is not a question of
35         whether I agree.         I just want to know what you say about
36         it.

                                           11
 1   MR.    FROST:    I think,   again,    the comments regarding going down
 2          to the river.      If you d i d n ’t have the nouse to actually
 3          off your own bat do something,          then there was nobody to
 4          direct you to do something.            There was plenty of senior
 5          officers there at this point but nobody was actually c o ­
 6          ordinating any sort of triage or rescue or any other such
 1          useful activity.
 8   LORD   JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Which bit are you referring to?
 9   MR.    FROST:    The bottom of the next page,          but the   same page --
10   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:           What,    "Down by the river"?
11   MR.    FROST:    That is right.       Evidentially I think       those,   as
12          you asked for,     are the    comments that I would       have left in
13          and perhaps even expanded on if I was giving a statement
14          of witness.
15   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:           You were given this back in this
16          form,    is that right?
17   MR.    FROST:    Yes,    I submitted a handwritten statement;         it came
18          back typed up as this I believe - bearing in mind it is a
19          considerable time ago now - with these alterations, with
20          the instructions "Re-submit without anything that is
21          lined in.        Sign it as a standard C JA statement.         Sign it
22          and submit it."
23   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:           Where did that instruction come
24          from?
25   MR.    FROST:    From    my inspector,    Inspector Beresford.
26   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:           A nd you didn't    agree with that?
27   MR.    FROST:    No,
28   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:           So you never submitted a CJA
29          statement at all?
30   MR.    FROST:    No.
3L   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:           Do you know whether anybody else
32          did the same as you?
33   MR.    FROST:     I would think a good number.          I know that various
34          people who didn't,      whose evidence was important or
35          relevant, were put under a good deal of pressure to do so



                                              12
 1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         What I would like to know is if
 2         you know of anybody who was in            the same position as you
 3         •who didn't agree to sign a CJA statement?
 4   MR.   FROST:    I couldn't say whether          they refused to sign it.
 5         I can say that statements were altered,           things were
 6         amended which people were very unhappy with.            Whether
 7         they actually      signed it and submitted it or not,       I
 8         couldn't tell      you.    Wholesale changes were made.      There
 9         were queues of officers outside police stations,            and
10         senior officers sat there with their statements,            and they
11         were asked/impelled to sign things that they didn't want
12         to that had been changed.
13   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Well,      "impelled" is rather a
14         different thing from asked.
15   MR.    FROST:   Yes,    it is a strong word.
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          In what sense were they impelled?
17         Did you witness any of this?
18   MR.    FROST:   There    are officers I know who have witnessed
19         this.
20   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         No,    I am asking you whether you
21         witnessed it.
22   MR.   FROST:    I personally have not, no.           One of the reasons I
23         have come here is,        if you go to the South Yorkshire
24         Police and say "Have you anything else to offer us
25         regarding Hillsborough?",          etc,   then the answer will
26         probably be "No".         If you go in and ask the question
27          "Were your statements tampered with?" and asked,           like I
28          have been asked, which bits of your statement are
29          relevant to the events in the day, behaviour of fans and
30          senior officers alike,       and were those comments removed or
31          altered in any way,       you are going to get a lot of people
32          who are going to say "Yes"; and I am sure that there are
33          going to be far more relevant things than have been
34          removed from my statement removed from theirs.




                                              13
 1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          It would help me if you did know
 2           of anybody else who was in the same position as you who
 3           refused to sign a statement.
 4   MR.     FROST:    The trouble is that people,       for various reasons,
 5           aren't willing to come forward.          And this is why I have
 6           come forward.      If you ask the right questions I am sure
 7           people will come forward, because there was a lot of
 8           anger about the way this was dealt with afterwards - a
 9           lot of anger directed towards the hierarchy of the police
10         » who seemed to want to sanitise this whole event and
11         1 protect themselves.      A n d I think that there is more to it
12         I than just the officers who were illuminated in court,         if
13            you like. 1 This was an attempt, by senior management to
            ■r     —— ’
14          " sanitise and protect themselves; and any honour that the
15           South Yorkshire Police, which I thought at the time was
16           considerable,      disappeared for me.
17                   That is why I left the force.       I was medically
18          •, pensioned off.     I couldn't wear a uniform after this sort
19           of thing took place;      and it is not what I believe in and
20           I hope it is not what the establishment believes in.
21   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          This is something which I am
22           looking into.       But it would assist me if you could give
23           me the names of any other people who were in your
24           position.     Obviously I can look at the original
25           statements and the altered statements of those who signed
26           the CJA things and I have already done that to some
27           extent,    and I shall do it further.
28                   It may be that the Police will not make available
29           those statements like yours where there was a refusal to
30           sign.     That is why I am anxious to know if you know
31           anybody else in that position.
32   MR.     FROST:     I have asked various people whether they would be
33           willing to come down here with me and they have said "No"
34           - whether it is because they want to get on with the rest
35           of their lives and they can put this behind them - I
36           can't - or whether it is because they are still serving

                                            14
 1         officers and they fear retribution.      But what I can do is
 2         ask widely and if people are willing to come forward and
 3         speak to you,    I can submit a list to you; I can send you
 4         a list down or come down with them.
 5   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Yes.   What I am particularly
 6         interested in is people who - I am not particularly
 7         interested solely in people who are a little unhappy at
 8         the procedure,    but people who actually wrote out their
 9         own statements,    they were then amended into what was
10         thought to be a suitable form but were not signed or
11         refused to be signed b y the police officer.        Those people
12         I would be interested to know about.
13   MR.   FROST:   This is what I am saying to you.     I am going to
14         have to go and ask a lot of people a lot of questions to
15         establish, because you bear in mind,     if you sign
16         something that you really don't want to sign and you do
17         it privately and then you pop it in an envelope and you
18         send it off,    I could not tell you out of the ten
19         colleagues I work with who submitted a statement signed
20         and who didn't.
21               It is a very delicate issue.     If you were put in
22         that position,    if you were asked to sign something which
23         you didn't agree with,    there are people who will and
24         there are people who won't.      And it is a delicate
25         question which needs to be asked.      I will ask those
26         questions.
27   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Are you clear what I am interested
28         in.   I am interested in people who,    like you,    got back an
29         amended version of their original statement and said "I
30         am not going to sign this."      Those are the people who I
31         want to know the names of.
32   MR.   FROST:   This is it.    I think you are listening to me but
33         you are not hearing what I am saying.      I will go and find
34         out whether people are willing to come forward in the
35         situations you have just outlined,     and then I will submit



                                       15
 1         a list of anybody who wishes to come forward and speak to
 2         you in the same situation.
 3   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:           I don't think they need
 4         necessarily come forward and see me.              I would be more
 5         interested just to know their names because if I have got
 6         the names I can check up with the Police.               Do you see?
 7         It may not be necessary for them to come and give
 8         evidence to me.        I would just like to know the names
 9         first of all,       at any rate.
10   MR.   FROST:    A nd then what would          be the next step from that,
11         because obviously people are going to ask me that
12         question?
13   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:           I would then ask t o .see the
14         documentation in relation to them.              We would go and find
15         it.      All right?
16   MR.   FROST:    Yes.
17   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:           And,     if need be,   I would ask them
18         to come and see me.         But at      the moment I don't think that
19         would necessarily be required.              I don't suppose they
20         would particularly want to come and see me; and at the
21         moment I am not sure that it is necessary provided I have
22         the names.        All right?
23   MR.   FROST:     Yes.     I am just thinking how I am going to go
24         about it but,       yes,   I think it is possible - because this
25         was wholesale.
26   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:           I would imagine that it will be
27         people who did not give evidence either at the inquest or
28         at the Taylor inquiry.
29   MR.   FROST:    I would presume,      as      in my case,   if you refused to
30         sign an altered version or a submitted version to you
31         that you don't agree with on CJA paper and refuse to sign
32         it then, by definition they are not going to want you to
33         give evidence at the inquiry.
34   LORD JUSTICE     STUART-SMITH:       I don't know, but I would imagine
35         you are probably right.          Thank you very much.        Now,   is



                                              16
 1         there anything that you want to ask him,     Professor
 2         Scraton?
 3   PROFESSOR SCRATON:     About these particular points?
 4   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     A ny questions that you want to ask
 5         him?
 6   PROFESSOR SCRATON:     The focus that has been covered,    one
 7         question I would like to ask is, what happened next once
 8         you refused to sign?      Was there any internal pressure?
 9         What happened when West Midlands investigating officers
10         took over the case?
11   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Can we have one question at a
12         time.
13   PROFESSOR SCRATON:     That is the one question.
14   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      What is the question?
15   PROFESSOR SCRATON:     The question is, what happened next in
16         terns of the West Midlands investigation?
17   MR.   FROST:     The other time that I was seen by the West
18         Midlands inquiry was three months after this.        I was
19         never questioned at all by the West Midlands inquiry,
20         the only time I was seen was about three months later,
21         when I had to go and be interviewed by Complaints and
22         Discipline on behalf of the West Midlands inquiry for
23         allegedly taking bribes to let people in the ground,
24         because I matched the description of an officer outside;
25         and rather furiously,    I just said "It's well documented
26         where I have been.     I was never in that position at all.
27         Why are you wasting my time?"
28   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Where were you first accused of
29         taking bribes?
30   MR.   FROST:     It was at the Leppings Lane end of the ground
31         before the match,    and I was on the north stand;    and it is
32         well documented where I was,     etc.   And I was rather
33         annoyed,    to say the least, on such a sensitive issue that
34         they hadn't looked beyond the end of their noses to find
35         out where I was. But that was my only contact with the



                                       17
 1          West Midlands inquiry.     Nobody has asked me what I did,
 2          where I was, what I saw or anything.
 3   MR.    BONE:    Let us get this clear.   Are you saying it was an
 4          allegation that an officer was taking bribes to let
 5          people into the ground at the Leppings Lane end?
 6   MR.    FROST:     Yes.
 7   MR.    BONE:    In all this crowd?
 8   MR.    FROST:     Yes, because I think the allegation was that
 9          there were a lot of ticketless people and there were
10          allegations that an officer was letting people in for
11          money.
12   PROFESSOR SCRATON:       Did you feel that that allegation might
13          have been made as part of pressure that you were being
14          put under because you had refused to sign your statement?
15          Did that cross your mind as being possible?
16   MR.    FROST:     It didn't at the time, no.   I was left alone.        I
17          didn't personally undergo any pressure.         We were taken to
18          the pub by a certain                             who basically
19          said "It's backs to the wall, boys.         We've all got to say
20          the same thing."
21   LORD   JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      When was this?
22   MR.    FROST:    That was about three days after, about    19th
23          April.
24   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        You were asked to write your own
25          account?
26   MR.    FROST:    That is right.    We were taken out    for a   drink by
27          this                    and we were basically told "Look,
28          unless we all get our heads together and straighten it
29          out,    there are heads going to roll." A nd we were told in
30          no uncertain terms to ----
31   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        What was the date of your original
32          handwritten statement?
33   MR.    FROST:    I couldn't tell you.
34   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I mean was it within a day or so
35          of the actual events?
 1   MR.   FROST:     I think it was - I couldn't be precise about
 2         that.
 3   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Can you remember when you were
 4         asked to do it?      Was it on the day or was it the next
 5         day?
 6   MR.   FROST:    No, because out duties were such that we were ---
 7   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       You weren't perhaps on duty the
 8         next day.
 9   MR.   FROST:     The following day we were on duty at the hospital
10         because there were a lot of problems with the press.
11                                                      if you want his
12         name.
13   MR.   BONE:     By "the ten of   us" do you mean your serial?
14   MR.   FROST:    Yes.
15   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Thank you very much.   I don't know
16         what you want to do.       Do you want to go back on your own
17         or do you want to wait for Professor Scraton?
18   MR.   FROST:     Have you any questions?
19   PROFESSOR SCRATON:      Yes,   I would like to tease out some of the
20         issues around the procedure and how that procedure came
21         about, because it is such an exceptional procedure
22         despite them being exceptional circumstances.        It is a
23         most unusual procedure,      and you were just about saying,
24         the day after you were on duties elsewhere and then
25         presumably on the Monday or the Tuesday or some point
26         during the early part of the week officers were asked to
27         submit their recollections.        How did that happen?       Was
28         it just on a one-to-one basis or were people gathered
29          together?    I mean there must have been a lot of talk
30          about the fact that this was an unusual procedure.           So
31         how did that come about and how did people respond?
32   MR.    FROST:    I worked in a unit with eight other PCs,       a
33          sergeant and an inspector,     and we all worked from the
34          same office.    We were told in a minor briefing what was
35          expected;   and we were asked to submit these statements,
36         we asked why and we were told that it was to be a

                                         19
 1       personal account.          We were not really told w hy but we
 2       were told that it was to be on plain paper rather than
 3       CJA witness paper, which I considered to be
 4       unprecedented.          I have never been asked,     and nobody in
 5       the office had ever been asked to do that.              A nd it just
 6       makes you wonder, would people have made alterations on a
 7       Criminal Justice Act paper when it is signed and it
 8       becomes an exhibit?
 9               Would whoever altered this statement have done that
10       if it had been on CJA witness paper.              And the cynicism
11       about the event which has comes since suggests to me that
12       we were asked to do it in this way so that alterations
13       could be made and then resubmitted.              It seems completely
14       without precedent.          And,   as professional witnesses,     as
15        your goodself as a Judge knows,            you are not interested
16        about evidence of opinion or feeling,            you are interested
17        in fact.        If I had submitted that same statement with the
18       pieces in and probably more,            if I had known what was
19        going on about the various nuances that took place and
20       basically people trying to save their own necks,              if I had
21        submitted that statement on CJA witness paper would it
22        have come back altered or what would have happened to it?
23        Would I have been asked to give evidence at the court?                I
24        d o n 11 k n o w .
25               But the suggestion is to me that we were asked to do
26        it this way so that they could be doctored - and when a
27        statement is being sent by solicitors to review and
28        alter.       I believed that it would all be done fairly and
29        squarely and above board,          and I d o n ’t believe it was.
30   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          Yes,    I see.   Is there anything
31        else that you want to get ----
32   PROFESSOR SCRATON:          I d o n ’t know how relevant it is and only
33        yourself,       sir,   knows exactly how you are interpreting the
34        brief, but one area of concern has been about the
35        preparation for this particular game at senior management
36        level.

                                            20
 1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Rather than making submissions to
 2         me,   if you want to ask him any more questions just ask
 3         him a simple question if you can - I mean a single
 4         question.
 5   PROFESSOR SCRATON:     Could you make some kind of comment about
 6         how you felt about the management structure and the
 7         reasons for change and the issue that a chief
 8         superintendent with a lot of experience ----
 9   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I don't think I want to hear about
10         that.
11   PROFESSOR SCRATON:     You don't?
12   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       No.
13   PROFESSOR SCRATON:     That is. why I was making a submission to
14         you, because I wanted to clarify ----
15   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       No,   from this witness I am
16         interested in this question of the changes,       alterations,
17         to the statements.
18   MR.   FROST:     It is quite relevant what did take place.
19   LORD JUSTICE     STUART-SMITH:   I know,   but I don't think    that is
20         quite why I wanted ----
21   MR.   FROST:     Ah, but do you know?
22   LORD JUSTICE     STUART-SMITH:   I don't   think we can take    that any
23         further.    If you want to go off, Mr. Bone will take you
24         downstairs and out of the front door.        If you would like
25         to wait for Professor Scraton ----
26   PROFESSOR SCRATON:     We don't come from the same part of the
27         country but obviously for reasons which should be
28         apparent,   you are aware that David has been through a
29         tremendous amount of mental stress over the whole
30         business,   and although he is in very good health now,
31         situations like this are not easy for people who have
32         been through those processes.        I know you are aware of
33         that, having been up in Liverpool.        So I would feel
34         easier if I at least have a chance, when I leave,         to meet
35         up with David and maybe have a coffee before we set off
36         on our ways.
 1    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Yes.    Thank you very much for
 2          coming, Mr. Frost.
 3    MR.   FROST:     OK.   I hope that you can finally lay this matter
 4          to rest.
 3                            (Mr.   Frost left the room)

 7    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         As you know,    Professor Scraton,       I
 8          have had quite a lot of material from you.           I have h ad
 9          your preliminary submissions,          I have had your
10          supplementary submissions,          I have read the chapters in
11          your book which you suggested I should read,             and I have
12          also read a good deal of th i s , which in many ways is very
13-         similar to what is contained in your book.           I have not           .
14          read the whole of this but I have read the sections in
13          relation to Hillsborough.           So I know what you feel about
15          it and,    if I may say so, it has helped me to understand
17          the feelings of the families and so on, which I gained a
18          good deal of insight into when I was up in Liverpool.
19                But I don't imagine that it will be helpful simply
20          to ask you to expand on the written submissions because
2L          they do put the matter fairly succinctly.           What I would
22          like to do is to ask you one or two questions on them
23          unless there is any other way you want to tackle it.
24    PROFESSOR SCRATON:       I did cover it in the supplementary.          I
25          have tried to be concise because I realise how much you
25          have had to read.        I would at some point like to go back
27          to some of the things we have just heard, because
28          obviously I am hearing some of those things for the first
29          time myself.
30    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         We will deal with that afterwards.
3L    PROFESSOR SCRATON:       We will deal with that afterwards.          So,
32          no,   I think the best way forward is for you to raise
33          matters with me and see if I can help and respond.
34    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Can we go to your preliminary
35          submissions first of all.           You refer on page 2 to the
36          admission of liability in negligence.           I am still not

                                            22
 1        quite clear whether that was a formal admission of
2         liability or whether it was an acceptance of liability.
 3        To my mind it makes no difference, but it seems to be
 4        important to some of the Liverpool families for some
 5        reason or other.       But you describe it here as an
 6        admission of liability. Do you know whether that is so?
 1   PROFESSOR SCRATON:    No,    I think that was before.   I made the
 8        submission before we sat and listened to yourself.         And I
 9        would revise that and say that it was a reluctant
10        acceptance.     There has been no formal ----
11   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I don't know the answer to that.
12   PROFESSOR SCRATON:     There has been no formal admission,    and
13        the reason why it is important - you more than anyone are
14        aware of the difference between the technical/legal
15        position and the popular position.       People in Liverpool
16        and elsewhere and people who have been in the position
11        that David Frost has been and ambulance officers also who
18        are going through the courts at the present time in terms
19        of post traumatic stress claims,      I think there is a
20        feeling that there has been a real reluctance to accept
21        at any stage that there was a generic liability on the
22        part of the Police.       And - you put it in a nutshell at
23        the meeting in Liverpool - whilst there is, as we would
24        put it, a technical acceptance,      the fact that there has
25        been no verbal response and there has been,        for all the
26        reasons we would know,      a continual battling against that
27        acceptance,   that has been one of the main concerns of
28        most people who have been affected by the disaster.
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       M y position is that as far as I am
30        concerned there is no difference in practice between an
31        acceptance of liability and an admission of liability.
32        And,   as I have understand it, the Police have accepted
33        liability.    Whether they have done so reluctantly or not,
34        I don't know.     I expect initially certainly that was the
35        case.



                                        23

                                                                             i
 1                Can we go to page 3, which is where you discuss the
 2        question of issues.        No.   2, "the inconsistencies in
 3        police evidence to the Taylor Inquiry and to the
 4        inquests,    raising the possibility that certain officers
 5        made,    at best,   inaccurate assumptions concerning their
 6        actions",    that is a very broad generalisation.        It is not
 7        very helpful to me without specifics.           What are you
 8        referring to and what are the incidents you are referring
 9        to?
10   PROFESSOR SCRATON:       The kind of issues that came up with some
11        of the families that I sat in would be a good starting
12        point:    the fact that there were clearly changes made,, on
13        reflection - and we don't know the significance of that
14        reflection - changes made by police officers in terms of
15        what they did or did not do during the period of rescue
16        an evacuation.
17   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Are you talking about changes in
18        their evidence between the Taylor inquiry and the
19        inquests?
20   PROFESSOR SCRATON:       No,   it was meant to say "the
21        inconsistencies in police evidence to the Taylor Inquiry
22        and to the inquests."         It is not to say between the two,
23        it is not saying that they changed it between the two
24        inquiries.     It is saying that evidence that was put by
25        police officers to both the Taylor inquiry or to the
26        inquests or to either of those,         there are examples of
27        inconsistencies in evidence.          I mean,   David Duckinfield
28        would be a start.
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         I am sorry, but I am not quite
30        clear what the point is that you are making.            Is it that
31        some police witnesses said one thing and some said
32        another,    that there were inconsistencies between police
33        witnesses about certain matters?          Is that what you are
34        saying?




                                           24
 1   PROFESSOR SCRATON:     That is another issue.      No,   I am saying
 2        that certain police officers were inconsistent in terms
 3        of their own accounts of what they did or did not do.
 4   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Inconsistent with what?
 5   PROFESSOR SCRATON:     Inconsistent with their previous
 6        statements.     We are only just beginning to discover that
 7        as those statements have been released.
 8   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I am sorry.     I am having some
 9        difficulty with this.       I must have specifics of what you
10        are talking about here.
11   PROFESSOR SCRATON:     For example,      in the case of both Shipley
12        and Kierney, who were two officers who were involved with
13        the Andrew Sefton case,      in that there are several
14        statements - I can't remember off the top of m y head,            but
15        I think there are at least three each and in one case it
16        is three and maybe it is two in the other - but those
17        statements are inconsistent.          They do not add up to the
18        same person doing the same task; and there is a change.
19        I am saying that their evidence,         therefore, was
20        inconsistent.
21   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       What you are saying is that the
22        evidence of Police Constable Shipley is inconsistent with
23        the evidence of Police Constable Kierney?           Is that what
24        you are saying?
25   PROFESSOR SCRATON:     No,    I am saying the two statements that
26        they make each - their own statements are inconsistent.
27        I am sorry,   I am not making myself particularly clear.
28   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        So the first statement is
29        inconsistent with the second statement?
30   PROFESSOR SCRATON:     Yes.
31   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        You have given me an example of
32        that,   that is Shipley and Kierney.
33   PROFESSOR SCRATON:     Yes.
34   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Have you any other examples?
35   PROFESSOR SCRATON:     I could spend a lot of time going through
36        the statements and gathering them,         yes.

                                         25
 1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I did ask you,     and I think you
 2        said you would do this in relation to some of the
 3        families, because this point arose,      if you remember, when
 4        I was talking to the families.
 5   PROFESSOR SCRATON:    Yes,   and I did; and that family has m ad e a
 6        submission to you.      I felt that on the day, purely being
 7        able to point out the inconsistency in Kierney's and
 8        Shipley's evidence was sufficient;      and in the other case
 9        of the Roberts family,     you asked me if I could find,        and
10        I said I would have difficulty but I did find,         I knew I
11        had read it somewhere,     and I came across Edmondson,     I
12        think it was - is that his name? - I came across his
13        statement.      And that was about the movement of a person
14        by ambulance to the gymnasium from the Leppings ----
15   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Edmonds?
16   PROFESSOR SCRATON:     I think it was Edmondson, but I might now
17        be wrong, because I gave it to the family and they have
18        made a further submission to you, as I understand it.             I
19        gave them the reference so that they could inform you,
20        and I am led to believe from them that they have actually
21        made that written submission.
22   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Well, I may not have seen it.
23   PROFESSOR SCRATON:      An d it is contained in this.      I have done
24        my best, but you can appreciate that it is ---
25   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I am not trying to criticise you.
26   PROFESSOR SCRATON:     No,   I know you are not.
21   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       The trouble is that,    if I may say
28        so, one gets a generalisation like this,         and I can't cope
29        with it.     Even looking through the evidence to Taylor and
30        the inquiry and the inquests is a formidable task.           I
31        can't go through the thing with a tooth-comb,         it would
32        take me until     Kingdom come. I have simply got      to be put
33        on to what is     said to be the inconsistencies.      And if
34        they are of any significance,      I will try and deal with
35        them.



                                        26
 1             I do have to say,     as I think I said before,      that    in
 2        a situation like this it does not surprise me that people
 3        made mistakes.
 4   PROFESSOR SCRATON:    I would agree with that.     I would be the
 5        first person to say that.       In fact in almost everything
 6        that I have written and certainly in all of the talks             I
 7        have ever given about Hillsborough or any of these other
 8        unfortunate events,     the one thing that I preface all m y
 9        comments by is that in that situation people will always
10        make mistakes.
11             That is not my concern.       In one sense it   is
12        obviously in planning for the future.       But it    isnot m y
13        concern to see people as individuals held out         as I
14        suppose scapegoats would be not too strong a word for a
15        situation where they made an unfortunate error of
16        judgment in the heat of the moment.       I would never
17        criticise somebody for that.
18             What I am much more concerned about is a situation
19        where a difficult and complex issue is made worse by what
20        can only be described as a purposeful and an intended
21        handling of that situation in the aftermath.         The other
22      * issue,   I would say,   is that quite clearly - and it came
23        out in cross-examination - senior officers,      both before
24        Taylor and before the inquests,      were not ideal witnesses,
25        because part of the problem there was that - and Lord
26        Justice Taylor made that point ---
27   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I am sorry to stop you but you do
28        go on a bit,    if I may say so.
29   PROFESSOR SCRATON:     I am sorry.
30   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      It is difficult for me to stick to
31        the point.     When I say "mistakes" what I am talking about
32        here is that obviously people made mistakes about how
33        they treated people and that kind of thing, but what we
34        are talking about in the inconsistencies are mostly
35        mistakes of identification and what people did.           And that



                                       27
 1        seems to me to be something which is likely to happen in
 2        a confused and chaotic situation like this,      isn't it?
 3   PROFESSOR SCRATON:     I think that is correct.    M y concern is
 4        that some of the statements that were made to both of
 5        those inquiries and some of the written material that          I
 6        have seen and now knowing what I know about how those
 7        statements were taken,    leads me to raise as a matter of
 8        serious concern questions about the quality of that
 9        evidence.     That is what I am saying.
10             And it is a generalisation in which there are
11        several specific examples ranging from those that you
12        have just illustrated,    which are those made about
13        identification,    to those of serious consequence made by
14        senior officers both to the Taylor inquiry and to the
15        inquests.
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     What are the statements?     I have
17        read Mr. Duckinfield's evidence both to the inquiry and
18        the inquests,    and it is very evasive in many ways,    and he
19        was very severely criticised.     But I cannot go into all
20        that again.     What am I supposed to do about that?
21   PROFESSOR SCRATON:     I think it is a very difficult situation
22        given your terms of reference because it does not fit
23        easily within those terms of reference,      but that is one
24        of the major unanswered questions in Hillsborough which I
25        think will not go away.
26   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Right. Can I just go down to the
27        fourth one down from what we have just been discussing:
28        "the range of claims that witnesses were subjected to
29      I pressure in giving their statements."        We have got Mr.
30        Frost,   if that comes within that category.     I imagine that
31        you would say that it does.
32   PROFESSOR SCRATON:     Yes.
33   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     What other witnesses were
34        subjected to pressure in giving their statements?
35   PROFESSOR SCRATON:     There is the case - you will have seen on
36        the Cook Report ----
 1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I have put against this a Mr.
 2        Bruder.
 3   PROFESSOR SCRATON:     That is right.
 4   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        There is a suggestion that Mr.
 5        Bruder was subjected to pressure - Deborah Martin and
 6        Paul Taylor.
 7   PROFESSOR SCRATON:     Yes.
 8   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Are there any others?
 9   PROFESSOR SCRATON:    M y problem with this issue - and I don't
10        want to go on - is that once you have a series of claims
11        coming from quite different sources you then have to ask
12        the question about how extensive that was.
13   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I am so sorry,   Professor, but I
14        can't investigate these things without knowing what it is
15        suggested people have been put under pressure.           If I
16        investigate those three cases and I find that in all
17        three cases improper pressure has been put to bear upon
18        them, obviously there is some force in the suggestion
19        that is made.
20             If, on the other hand,          I investigate those three
21        cases and I come to the conclusion that nothing much was
22        amiss,    the suggestion falls to the ground.
23   PROFESSOR SCRATON:     I agree.
24   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I must have specific instances.       I
25        have given you the three cases that have occurred to me.
26        What I would like to know is whether there are any others
27        that occur to you.
28   PROFESSOR SCRATON:     The one     that occurs to me - that is why it
2?        is a range of claims,       it is    across a spectrum - is
30        obviously David Frost, which we have now heard,          and his
31        further claim that he believes some of his colleagues
32        were also put under pressure.          So that to me is the issue,
33        that that then,    I feel, has to be investigated.
34   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         I have got that in mind. Those
35        are the only questions        that I had on your first
35        submission.

                                          29
 1                So far as your supplementary submission is
 2        concerned, page 2, the last sentence of the first
 3        paragraph:       "Sadly,    some of the statements suggest that in
 4        some cases this did not happen as individuals were
 5        pronounced dead or assumed to be dead on the most cursory
 6        of examinations."
 7                Again,    I want to ask you for examples of that.
 8        Which cases are you referring to?
 9   PROFESSOR SCRATON:        I am very concerned about the 20 people
10        who were pronounced dead by Dr. Bull in the gymnasium.
11   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          So you think they may not have
12        been dead?
13   PROFESSOR SCRATON:        I am saying that it was a cursory
14        examination on asphyxia cases which are notoriously
15        difficult to be so certain about so quickly.
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:           Those are the ones you have in
17        mind?
18   PROFESSOR SCRATON:        Yes,   they are the ones that are at the
19        forefront of my mind;          and the rest, we have to rely on,
20        for example, what I am thinking of is one of the cases
21        where they were carrying the young man on a hoarding and
22        they put the hoarding down to try and revive them.             I
23        know it.     It is not somebody who has come to see you.           It
24        is the case of Andrew Brooks.           He was being carried
25        across the pitch having found a pulse and then in that
26        situation they thought that he was losing his ability to
27        breath so they put h i m down; and two civilians tried to
28        give him mouth-to-mouth;          and an unnamed doctor intervened
29        and told them to carry on,          and then returned a few
30        seconds later and told them that in his opinion it was
31        not worth carrying on.
32                So they then took him to the gymnasium.        That is an
33        example of a cursory-examination by an unnamed ----
34   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:           Where does this emerge from?
35   PROFESSOR SCRATON:        It is in the statement of ----



                                            30
 1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Is this the mini inquest in
 2        relation to Brook?
 3   PROFESSOR SCRATON:    It emerges from the material that has
 4        since been gathered relating to Andrew Brooks.          Of
 5        course,    it was not covered in that depth in the mini
 6        inquests, because,      as you know, one of my big concerns is
 1        the fact that that evidence was never cross-examined,         but
 8        it has now emerged in that case.
 9   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Just so that I understand it,    they
10        have now got the body file on Brooks,      have they?
11   PROFESSOR SCRATON:    Yes.
12   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      A n d you say that a consideration
13        of that raises the suggestion that it was a very cursory
14        examination and he should not have been pronounced dead?
15   PROFESSOR SCRATON:     I am giving you the example as a means of
16        demonstrating what I think was one of the serious
17        problems;    and it is a very good example, because an
18        unnamed doctor tells civilians who are not sure that they
19        are doing the right thing that there is no further hope.
20        They carry him to the gymnasium; he is then taken into
21        the gymnasium as somebody who has been said to be there.
22        So he is put with the dead.
23             He is then one of the 20 further cursory
24        examinations of Dr. Bull.       Already in people's minds at
25        that point was that he was admitted to the gymnasium as
26        somebody who in another d o c t o r ’s opinion had been dead.
27        What I am trying to get to is that these were crucial
28        minutes,    and there were paramedics and doctors in the
29        gymnasium and every single one of those people admitted
30        that there should as far as possible have been a thorough
31        examination.     A n d my concern is, as I have said before,
32        that it was not that an act intervened to kill them;         it
33        might have been that there was omission that killed them.
34             The thing about the Brooks case is that it is a
35        perfect example which also shows obviously,      and I am
36        sympathetic to it, the confusion of the matter.

                                        31
 1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Yes.    Thank you.   I will look into
 2        the Brooks case.     A nd if there are any other specific
 3        examples that occur to you hereafter, perhaps you will
 4        let me know.
 5             In the next paragraph you say "It is difficult for
 6        families to accept this" - that is blame - "given the
 7        strength, persistence and public proclamation of denial
 8        of negligence made by the South Yorkshire Police."          What
 9        are you referring to there?
10   PROFESSOR SCRATON:     What I am referring to, because I am
11        talking about the families I am not talking about the
12        legal definition of "negligence" which I obviously agree
13        with your interpretation on and would bow to that.
14             The issue that is of concern to me was the broad
15        public proclamations b y particularly the then Chief
16        Constable,   Peter Wright,    that when the whole issues got
17        as far as the inquests a different story would be told.
18        In other words,    it was "Yes, we have settled for damages,
19        but when we get into the inquest we will see a very
20        different story emerging."         And it was almost that it is
21        at that level,    it is the denial that the Police had any
22        real responsibility that is the concern.
23   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Is this a Press statement?
24   PROFESSOR SCRATON:     Yes,   it was.
25   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I mean,   you are talking about the
26        occasion before the inquest when the Chief Constable said
27        in effect that a different story will emerge.
28   PROFESSOR SCRATON:     Yes.
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Can you identify that for me,     or
30        have you got the document in relation to that?
31   PROFESSOR SCRATON:     I will be able to.
32   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       You talk about persistence,    which
33        suggests that this has happened on more than one
34        occasion.
35   PROFESSOR SCRATON:     The cases themselves,     in terms of the
36        evidence that the families heard at the inquests by

                                        32
 1        senior officers was part of that proclamation of denial.
 2        It is that delicate balance,      isn't it, between,    again,
 3        the technical denial and the real effective popular
 4        denial.
 5   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I read this as a public denial of
 6        liability in negligence by the South Yorkshire Police.               I
 7        have not come across anything of that sort at all.
 8   PROFESSOR SCRATON:      That is not what it is meant to read.         I
 9        should have used a different word from "negligence"
10        because that confuses it.      What I am saying in a nutshell
11        is that the South Yorkshire Police have continually
12        ducked responsibility on the public stage. That is what I
13        am trying to say.
14             I am not trying to say that they did not accept
15        technically liability in negligence.
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Is it your view that a formal
17        apology and an acceptance of liability would assuage some
18        of the feelings of the families?
19   PROFESSOR SCRATON:      I think it would have assuaged some of the
20        feelings.    I think it would have lessened severity of
21        feelings,   yes.    When I say "This whole sorry state of
22        affairs has been exacerbated by the seemingly obstinate
23        refusal by anyone in authority",      again I am talking here
24        about how people do business with each other.          And I
25        think had there been an apology,      an understanding and an
26        openness about those issues,      I feel that it would have
27        helped.     I am not saying that it would have satisfied
28        p e o p l e ’s concerns around criminal prosecution or concerns
29        around inquest verdicts,     but I feel it would have gone
30        some way - I think the word you used is correct - it
31        would have assuaged some of their feelings,      yes.
32   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Can I come on to another matter.
33        What sort of inquiry do you suggest that I should
34        recommend to the Home Secretary?
35   PROFESSOR SCRATON:      I feel that there has to be some kind of
36        forum.    I don't know whether we have the kind of forum

                                       33
 1        available, but m y own feeling is a public Home Office
 2        inquiry which would deal with the range of issues that I
 3        have tried to raise here.     Particularly of concern is to
 4        go over some of those key points that I make and which
 5       would enable families to raise some of the questions that
 6        I think they have been denied.
 7             It is a difficult one because I know now,       so long
 8        after the event,    that there will always be the problem of
 9        going over ground,   calling witnesses and the rest.         But I
10        feel that it has to be a far-reaching inquiry into the
11        precise circumstances in which people died and,        following
12        on from that,   it should also examine thoroughly the w a y
13        in which the investigation was mounted.        So it is at
14        those two levels.
15   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Could you identify what issues you
16        say an inquiry ought to address?
17   PROFESSOR SCRATON:    I think it needs to     address the general
18        issues around liability and at what levels those                      /
19        questions of liability obtain with       regard particularly to       II
20        senior officers.                                                      'j
21   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Are you talking about civil
22        liability or criminal liability?
23   PROFESSOR SCRATON:    We have to have a forum in which some of
24        the crucial questions about senior officers in post,
25        their responses on the day,       the adequacy or inadequacy of
26        their responses,    that has to be gone over.     A nd it might
27        be that that inquiry would make a recommendation
28        concerning criminal liability.
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      In other words,    another Taylor
30        Inquiry?
31   PROFESSOR SCRATON:    Again,   we are caught.     We are caught
32        between this unhappy relationship between public
33        inquiries and inquests, with the whole issue of criminal
34        liability somewhere hovering above,        or wherever we would
35        place it.   But it is an uneasy relationship.        And we can
36        see here in terms of the way in which that operated,           that

                                       34
 1        it has not worked to the best interests of the families
 2        in terms of getting to the core of how their loved ones
 3        actually died,    the circumstances of their deaths.
 4   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     When you say "how they died",      the
 5        Taylor Inquiry and the inquests were addressed to that
 €        issue.   So that issue has been addressed.
 1   PROFESSOR SCRATON:     But I don't believe that that has
 8        happened.     We are beginning to see case after case where
 9        people are now for the first time reading their
10        statements.     People are concerned about the precise
11        circumstances of how they died.
12   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     What - do you mean whether they
13        died at 3.05 or 3.25 or what?
14   PROFESSOR SCRATON:     Or whether something could have been to
15        save them.
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Is that the real point that you
17        are concerned with?
18   PROFESSOR SCRATON:     It is one of the points.
19   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     If I may say so,    I am not getting
20        as much help from you as I might,      because I do want some
21        specific suggestions here.        I have got to advise the
22        Secretary of State,    if I think right,    that there should
23        be a further inquiry.     I have got to define the issues
24        that the further inquiry has got to address.        It is no
25        good saying "Well,    you have got to go through the whole
26        thing again."      Nobody in their senses is going to re-run
27        the Taylor Inquiry.     The families have specifically said
28        that that should not be done.        They have specifically
29        said that there should not be a further inquest because
30        it is not practicable and not desirable.
31             So what am I to suggest,       and what are the issues
32        that it has got to address?        That is what I want to know.
33        I am sorry to try and pin you down on this.        If you are
34        going to assist me - and I am hopeful that you will - I
35        do need your help in trying to define the issues to which
36        any further inquiry should address its mind.        A nd then

                                       35
 1        one has to consider whether or not such an inquiry w oul d
 2        be practicable, whether it would produce any worth-while
 3        results and whether it would be worth the time,             expense
 4        and energy after eight and a half years.              Those are the
 5        questions which I have to consider.
 6                At the moment I do not find it, if I may say so,
 7        very helpful to say that one has got to go through the
 8        whole thing again.
 9   PROFESSOR SCRATON:        No,   I do not believe that that is
10        possible.     I would be the first person,          if I were asked
11        for m y opinion,      to say that there is no way that there
12        could be a re-run,         nor should there be a re-run,     of the
13        Taylor Inquiry, nor should there be a re-run of the
14        inquests.     But,    as you are aware,       I am very concerned
15        about the inadequacy of the inquests in terms of what
16        that offered to individual families.
17                M y answer to you over that issue is that I don't
18        know the answer.           I do not know what exists that could
19      I possibly now help the families to work through their
20        specific cases - and I am aware of how many cases there
21        and how many families there are that are involved in
22        this.     Not all families,       I know,    are directly involved,
23        but a lot of families are.             And what I am concerned about
24        is that an inadequate process,            in my opinion,   has brought
25        about not only an unfortunate verdict but,             for the
26        families,     a lack of an opportunity for the precise
27        hearing of evidence and cross-examination of that
28        evide nc e.
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:           How could one remedy that now.        I
30        have ensured,     if that is the right word,         that they have
31        got the material,          the body files.     That is the material
32        from which they can decide for themselves what happened.
33        How are we going to take that any further?
34   PROFESSOR SCRATON:        I think that it was exactly right that
35        they should have access to those body files, but
36        unfortunately,       as you are well aware,       that has raised in

                                            36
 1       many cases more questions than it has answered, because
 2        of the concern that families now have about in some cases
 3        the paucity of material in those body files in terms of
 4        the precise circumstances in which ----
 5   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      But the coroner explained this to
 6        everybody at the inquests.         He said that in some cases
 7        there is a great deal of information about where they
 8        were, what happened to them and so on, and in some cases
 9        unfortunately there is not.         That is inevitable in a
10        situation like this,     as you yourself accepted earlier on.
11   PROFESSOR SCRATON:    But the point is that the strength what
12        existed has never been tested.         The biggest concern is
13        that people were never able to cross-examine that
14      i evidence.    I accept that there is no way probably now
15       ; that that wrong - or you might not think it is a wrong,
16        but I do - can be righted.         I feel very strongly that,
17       j for whatever reasons,    the denial of the opportunity to
18        hear and test evidence relating to the precise
19        circumstances in which people died has caused major
20        problems to the families.
21   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      That I understand.     What I am
22        anxious to know is,      it may be that there is nothing that
23        can be done about t h a t .
24   PROFESSOR SCRATON:    Well,    I am not saying that there is
25        nothing that can be done about it.
26   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      What can be done about it?
27   PROFESSOR SCRATON:     I d o n ’t think it is fair to expect me to
28        be able,    in that circumstance,     to define exactly and
29        precisely what should be done about those issues.
30             One issue that could be taken is that certain of the
31        sensitive cases - I believe that there are certain cases
32        that could be - and I know what you will say, that you
33        cannot act as an appeal court for the judicial review for
34        the Divisional Court - but I believe that the accidental
35        death verdict as it stands,        for all the reasons that we
36        know about the debate around negligence in relation to

                                        37
 1        accidental death and previously the way in which lack of
 2        care had misinterpreted continually,     that the accidental
 3        death verdict at Hillsborough is unfortunate to say the
 4        least.    What that has led to is the common belief,
 5        despite the reassurance of the coroner,     that accidental
 6        death meant no negligence.
 7   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     That is another issue.    It is more
 8        in the nature of a debate and you are not giving me any
 9        evidence ----
10   PROFESSOR SCRATON:    I want to see that point through,    and I am
11        getting to a point.     The point I am getting to is, had
12        the judicial review quashed the verdict and referred the
13        inquest back,   I would say that what should have happened
14        is that exemplar cases should have been taken and those
15        inquests should have been held.
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     To determine what?
17   PROFESSOR SCRATON:    To determine the precise circumstances         in
18        which people died.     As you know,   I do not accept that the
19        medical evidence is reliable.     In its own terms it is not
20        reliable.    And the argument around the fact that fixation
21        of the chest meant that all people who died would have
22        died anyway is just not acceptable.
23   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Can I get back to the question
24        which I asked earlier - and it may be that you are unable
25        to answer it or you think it is unfair of me to ask you -
25        which is: How do you suggest that any form of inquiry now
27        could give the answer to any of these questions?
28   PROFESSOR SCRATON:    We have to start from the point that a lot
29        of the issues are around events after 3.15.        I feel that
30        an inquiry should focus on events after 3.15.       T a y l o r ’s
31        job was done in terms of the incident,      the disaster
32        itself.     What I am really concerned about is what
33        happened after 3.15,    not before it.
34             What I would want to see is an inquiry that would
35        look at the quality of health care,      the quality of
36        response, whether the major incident plan was activated,

                                       38
 1          who took responsibility,     how that responsibility was
 2          delegated, how senior officers performed,      all of those
 3          issues,    the relationship between the terrace,   the pitch,
 4          the temporary mortuary or the gymnasium and the
 5          hospitals.     That would be the first major area of review.
 6          Those issues for me are absolutely crucial.
 7   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        So you are not suggesting that     it
 8          would be helpful to reopen any particular case,      to
 9          resolve any conflicts that there might be between whether
10          Police Constable X took a person from here to there or
11          what happened?      These are the kind of discrepancies
12          which I am sure will arise on some of the body files.
13   PROFESSOR SCRATON:       Yes,   I think that if the discrepancy is of
14          sufficient seriousness from that which you read that it
15          was self-evident that it should go further,      then, yes;
16          but, no,    in terms of the ----
17   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        But how is any inquiry going to
18          resolve that question now?
19   PROFESSOR SCRATON:       I can give you one example - if we lift it
20          out of the issue of the police - I would want to see Dr.
21          Bull giving evidence to an inquiry and being questioned
22          cn how he could perform the task that he performed at the
23          time he did and how at a later date he could remember who
24          the 2 0 people were who he had pronounced dead.       In other
25          words,    I think it would help the families incredibly,      but
26          also to some extent there is a right that they have to
27          understand the circumstances in which their loved ones
28          died.     The circumstances are not the terrace and fixation
29          of the chest,    end of story.     For many people that is the
30          beginning of the story, because there was the struggle to
31          live, which then went on across the pitch,       into the
32          gymnasium and up to the hospitals.
33                  The first focus of an inquiry for me would look at
34          those circumstances and would raise serious questions
        I
35      i   about the activation of the major incident plan,       co-
36      | operation between agencies.

                                          39
 1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         You think that that is practicable
 2        after eight and a half years?
 3   PROFESSOR SCRATON:       Yes.    The second element of the inquiry
 4        would focus on how the investigation of the Hillsborough
 5        disaster was mounted,        which brings me to the story of
 6        David Frost.       I am deeply concerned that it has taken a
 7        considerable time to try and get to the bottom - I have
 8        not got near to the bottom,           I don't think - of that whole
 9        sequence of events.         I am very concerned to hear that the
10        procedures normally adopted for Police investigation went
11        by the board from almost immediately aft erwards.
12   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         What are the normal procedures      for
13        investigating a thing of this sort?
14   PROFESSOR SCRATON:       It would not matter what it is.         The
15        Police are trained as individuals to go away and write up
16        their pocket-books and then to make measured statements
17        free of emotion,         free of personal comment.    They are
18        expected to write up their pocket-books and then to make
19        statements which are to the point,           factual and precise,
20        as precise as they can be, more in a serious incident,              I
21        would have thought, of this nature,           than in any other
22        incident,    precisely because emotions were running high on
23        all sides and were being exacerbated by a media that was
24        in a state of frenzy itself.
25             So,    for    me,    rather than a departure from the normal
26        procedures,       I would have expected a tightening of the
27        normal procedures so that people would have written up
28        their pocket-books and then made their statements as
29        precisely and as accurately as possible.             I am very
30        concerned to learn that officers in general were sent
31        away to write recollections,           including emotion,   including
32        their feelings,       that those statements were then returned
33        to senior officers,         then passed to the South Yorkshire
34        solicitors,       and came back not just with minor comment and
35        amendment,    to words which we would expect in any
36        situation, but they become the defining statement.

                                           40
 1                In other words,   it is as if you take a wrong
 2        procedure and you then use that as the basis of all that
 3        follows, whereas it was the taking of the recollections
 4        that,      for me, was wrong.   A n d it was interesting and
 5        instructive when you were taking David Frost through his
 6        statement, we were using the statement as the issue,             as
 7        the base line,      and then adding back in the things he
 8        would have wanted back in.           A n d what he kept saying was
 9        "I would have made a different statement."
10   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       You think that is sinister?
11   PROFESSOR SCRATON:       I would not use the word "sinister".
12        First of all,      the term I would use is that it is highly
13      I irregular and it leaves itself open to accusations of
14      I widespread and institutional malpractice.            That is about
15        as strong as I feel at this stage I could put it.            But if
16        I found that that was typical I would be most concerned,
17        because it is an unusual practice.            It does smack of
18        "getting our stories right before they go to the
19        investigation force."
20   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I would have thought that it
21        smacks of exactly the opposite.           If you are told to go
22        and write out your recollection without any other officer
23        taking the statement or anything of that sort,           I would
24        have thought myself that it smacks not of a
25        co-ordination ---
26   PROFESSOR SCRATON:       But it did become co-ordinated.        It went
27          from there to senior officers,        from senior officers to
28          (I don't know who else was involved)         certainly a major
29          law firm who then advised.         And then it comes back and
30
31
        I pressure, no pressure,      but people are expected to make
            changes in their statements to their recollections.            So,
32          to me,    that is the point at which co-ordination takes
33        place; and each individual officer,           if David Frost was
34          typical,    is left to make that negotiation themselves.            It
35          is not something that the general public would be very



                                          41
 1        happy with.     It does not inspire confidence in how the
 2        processes operated.
 3   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Thank you very much.   I think I
 4        have got your views about that.
 5   PROFESSOR SCRATON:     So that would be the second area     that I
 6        would think it    is vital that an inquiry would look into.
 7        The first area is all the matters after 3.15 and the
 8        second area is an inquiry that would cover in some depth
 9        the whole process of investigation.
10   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Thank you very much.   Unless there
11        is any other point that you want to make,      I think those
12        are the points    that I wanted to cover.
13   PROFESSOR SCRATON:     No.    I am aware, although I have   not seen
14        any of the court submissions from the families'
15        solicitor,    that other areas that I raise you will be
16        covering with other people in other areas.        But I just
17        felt that I should include these to show the breadth of
18        my concerns.     Certainly I will go and look for material
19        that might be further helpful.
20   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      If you could find some specific
21        examples,    I would be grateful.
22   PROFESSOR SCRATON:     Yes.
23   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Thank you very much.

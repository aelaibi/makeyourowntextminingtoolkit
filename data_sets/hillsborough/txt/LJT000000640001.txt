                   /
Many thanks for your letter of 27th January, enclosing a copy of
your letter to the Editor of the Independent on Sunday.


As I think we managed to clear up during our telephone call
earlier today, I do not believe that we are in opposition in our
views regarding the implementation of your Report. What I, on
behalf of the Football Committee, have said is that the decision
taken by the Government not to extend mandatory seating to rugby
grounds does appear to undermine the logic of requiring smaller
fourth division grounds to go all-seater. In this, the Committee
is, of course, following closely your own argument in Paragraph
85 of your Final Report.


The   Committee  has   explicity   stated,   however,   that  any
uncontestable threat to safety would obviously override questions
of the cost of implementing the all-seater requirement for the
lower Divisions, or indeed any flexibility that might be
exercised by the Government or the Football Licensing Authority
over the deadlines outlined in your Final Report for clubs to go
all-seater.


I hope this will make the position of the Football Committee
clear and thank you once again for your letter - and indeed the
genuinely groundbreaking work which went into your Report!


Yours sincerelv.




Tom Pendry M P ^
Chairman: Parliamentary All-Party Football Committee.

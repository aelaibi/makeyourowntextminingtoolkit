physically            searched            by 2fne P o l i c e ,        who     were     apparently              looking         for a n y

ground,           we w e r e    directed           by the        p o li c e    to a     parking          spot.




The     parking          spot       was    in a s id e          street,        about        five     to t e n m i n u t e s        walk

Centre,           possibly a             cricket        ground        or    something         similar.             The     c o a c h was

parked        between          one       (1300)      and      quarter         past    one     (1315).             We    made     our

way     straight           to the         ground        from     the       coach.       I was        familiar           with     the

route        to    the     g ro u n d ,    as    I had a t t e n d e d         the    league         match        between

Liverpool            and Sheffield Wednesday                          at H i l l s b o r o u g h     in J a n u a r y      1989.        I

to m o v e        backwards           and       regain         our     original          position.                 During        the      co u r s e

of     thesfe g r a d u a l          surges          from      the     rear,       I remember             seeing          two       girls

p e a y to w h e r e         we w e r e         standing.              The      two     girls       were       slightly             forwards

ojt us a n d         slightly             to    our      riqp/i!\         I can       positively              state       no w      that       the

ftwo    girls        were       the       HICKS         %d^sters.          Who     subsequently                died       in the

tragedy.             I did        not      k n t h e           g i rl s    at     the    time,          but    I recognised                them

in     press       pictures           and       news         reports       following           the       tragedy.              After       a few

minutes           the     s u rg e    from        the        rear    became        more       frequent,             a n d at a b o u t          two

thirty         (1430),          we    decided            to    try and move              nearer          the       front       to    get       away

from        the    s u r ge s .       Just        before        we     started          to m o v e       nearer          the     front,

tw o    HICKS        sisters          had also               moved     nearer         the     front, apparently                      to

escape        th e      surges        as       wel l .        The Hicks           girls       moved       near        the      front,          at

an angle           of a b o u t       forty          five      degrees,           towards          the     bottom         right        hand

corner        of     the     pen as            y o u look      at    the     pitch.           We        followed them                down

towards           the     front       of       the pen s h o r t l y a f t e r .              I would          sa y       that       both

HICKS        girls        may     have         been      a    little       distressed              at    that       time,        nothing

more        than     that.           We    made         our    way     towards          the    front          of    the     pen,       taking

a    route        which      I have            marked         on the       seperate           grid       plan       using        a broken

dotted        line.          We      eventually               got    to a       position           towards          the     front         of    the

pen at        shortly after                    two t h i r t y      (1430).           I havemar k e d              this     position

on the        seperate            grid         p la n    using       the     figure          two.         At       this time,          iu was

getting           packed        in pe n         t h r e e , but        nothing          severe.           We w e r e        able       to m o v e

from        position         one      to       position          two      without        too m a n y          problems.             As     soon

as     we    got     to    position             two      we w e r e       immediately              behind          the    two H i c k s

girls.            There      had      not       been any            conversation              between          our       group and             the

HICKS        gi r l s .      We      stopped            in our       position           behind          the H I C K S       gi r l s ,     an d

over        the    next      fifteen minutes,                       the    pen w as          still       filling          up a n d wa s

becoming           uncomfortable.                       By    quarter        to    three       (1445),             it w a s      becoming

worryingly              uncomfortable                   as    it wa s      really        ti g h t .       At       this     time,         the

HICKS        g i rl s     were       now       one      person       in f r o n t       of    us,       because          somebody          else

had     squeezed           in b e t w e e n          us.        As    there was            now    somebody           directly          in

front        of me.         I could             not       really       see      the    HICKS       girls,           or w h a t

condition           they were              in.        During          the     next     ten minutes,                 things       became

more     and more           squeezed             in       pen    th r ee ,     a n d at      about        ten       to    three       (1450)

I became           crushed           by the          crowd.           Th e    c r u s h wa s      so    bad,        I could       not       move

a t all.           At    the     time       of       the    crush,           t he    players       were        on the          pitch

having        a kick        around.              I remember              the        players       coming        onto       the    pitch,

bu t    when       the    c r us h     started,             it wa s          impossible           to    concentrate              on    events

on     the    pitch.            At    about          five       to    three,         I saw a man              facing       the    crowd,

looking         towards          the       rear       of    the       pen.          I could       see     the m a n        as    I looked

over     the       shoulders           of       people          in f r o n t        of me.        This        m a n was        saying

"Push        back,       push        back,       there          in t r o u b l e " .

I then        caught        a glimpse                of    the H I C K S       girls        who    were        directly          behind

the m a n a s k i n q           the    crowd, to _push £ a c k .                      The    man       was     obviously          trying

to     protect          them.         I could             see    the H I C K S        girls       from        the    shoulders

upwards and              one w a s         holding          the       other         with    her a r m s        round       her

shoulders.               Th e    HICKS          girl       that       w as    being        held,       wa s    the y o u n g e r       one       of

th e    two.        I cannot           remember             much about               the    Hicks       girls,           but    the

younger        one w a s         slightly             shorter          and     thinner           than     the       e l de r    one.        The

young        one    that        was    b e in g       held       by her        sister,           appeared           in a ba d way,

he r    head was          tilted           to    one       side.         As    best        I can       remember,           I think          the

young        HICKS       girl        may    have          been       unconscious            at    that        time,       I would          not

s ay    that       she w as          dead.           That       was    the     last        time    that        I saw       e i t h e r ’ of

th e H I C K S      girls.            The       m a n w ho       was     trying        to    help       them        by a s k i n g     the

crowd        to m o v e     back,          continued             to    do     so     for    some m in ut e s             after    that.

In f a c t      he was a s k i n g              me    to m o v e       back         because       the     crush          had    brought

our     faces       clo s e      together.                 All       I could say was               that        I c o u l d n ’t,       I

c o u l d n ’t m o v e      a muscle.                 As    the       minutes         went       by,    this m a n s           face    became

more     redder          and     his       e ye s     became          bloodshoot.                The    mans        voice       gradually

dwindled,           and     very       occassionally                   he w o u l d a s k me            to     push       back.        At

some       stage        while        I wa s      facing            the m a n        there         w as      a    lar g e    cheer         from      the

crowd,        which         I think            was    the      game          kicking         o f f.         I could         not       see     any

happenings              on the        pitch.             Whilst          I w as       still          facing         the man,            Shaun       and

              were        stil l      on rny left              hand          side.         At     some          stage      I looked           to m y

right        hand       side       and     there         was a man             sidewards              on        facing      me.         The    m an

was    saying           "Oh    I'm d y in g ,            Oh    I'm d y i n g " .             He      wa s       screaming          a nd

shouting           whilst          I w as       looking            at    him,

                          I remember                looking         at       his    eyes,         which          just      ha d a v a c a n t

stare.

He    w as    in a bad way.                     I looked            to       the    front         again          b r i ef l y ,    and       the

first        m a n wa s       still        t h er e      looking             at me.          There          was     no     change         in his

facial        expression              and       I. t h i n k       he w a s        still        asking           for     people         to    push

twenty        five       and       thirty and              about         6'    tall.            He    was       w e l 1 b u i I t , not            fat,

I cannot           remember           much       else         about          that    man.            I did        not      see a n y

of    hi s    clothing.               He       did    not      have a mou st ac he .                        Whilst         I was        facing

frontwards              ag a i n ,    there          was      s t ill        movement           in the           crowd,        people         were

s t il l     being        s h if te d about.

At    some       point        I became           aware         that          the m a n w h o          had        been      in f r o n t       of m e

asking        people          to     push       back,         was       no    longer         t h e r e.          I cannot          say what

happened           to     him.        That       m a n w as a w h i t e ^ m a l e ,                  aged about             twenty           five.

He    had     d ar k      coloured             hair,       whis'n m a y            have      b e e n a bit             over       his     ears.

He was        unshaven,              with       a few/flays              s t u b b l e.         I would           estimate            his

height        at    between           f    i    v    s   i     x        and    five        feet       e i g h t.         I have         since

seen       a photograph               of       some      of    the       deceased            from        the      tragedy,            in the

I have        just      described amongst                      the        deceased,              I do       not     know      the         mans

name?       h o w ev e r ,    I am       certain             that     if       I wa s      shown a          photograph               of    the

person,        I would            recognise             h i m a g ai n ,         At a b o u t         quarter          past      three

(1315),        or m a y b e        twenty       past,          I f e lt a s u d d e n              e as e     in the        pressure                in

crush.         With         the    sudden       r e lief,           I somehow managed                       to    get      b ac k     towards

the    rear       of    the       pen.     I no w            thij>k^tha1k            I walked          through where                  the

collasped          crush barrier                woyda          have        been.           I d id      not       see    the      broken

barrier,          nor was          I aware          at a n y        stage        that       it h a d        br o k e n ,    however             I

walked        towards         the    rear       of       the     pen       in a       line w i t h w h e r e            it w o u l d        have

been.        By    no w t h e r e        were       a    number           of    people          l y ing     on the         terraces,

particularly                towards       the       fr o n t .        A    lot       of    people         ha d    got      out       from       the

pen    by no w a n d          I wa s      able          to    get     to       the    rear       of    the       pen q u i t e        easily.

When       I got       to    the    back       of       the    pen,        some       lads       said       to me       from         the

seating        area         overlooking             the       pens        "Come       on,       Come      up"     and      they       he 1 ped

me    up    into       the    seating          area.           I got           into       the    seats       at a b o u t        three

thirty,        and      remained          there          until        about          four       thirty        ( 1 6 3 0).        I

look       around       for       Shaun and                         I but        couldn't             see    them.          I J'eft         the

transport.              I took       this       advice           and       left       the       grourW^and             returned            to       our

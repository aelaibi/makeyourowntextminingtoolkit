Dear Mr Taylor

HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY

As part of his Inquiry, Lord Justice Taylor is now looking more
widely at issues of crowd control and safety at sports events.
An aspect of particular interest is that of identity cards, and
more especially the type of membership scheme envisaged in the
current Football Spectators Bill.

Lord Justice Taylor is aware, from formal submissions already
received, of the reservations felt both by yourselves and others
as to the merits of such a scheme. He recognises that striking a
balance between catering for the needs of the responsible
majority and dealing with the problem of an unruly minority is
not easy, and is anxious to hear in more detail of alternative
ideas for tackling these problems.  It would be helpful to know
whether you could let Lord Justice Taylor have written comments
about this in advance of any meeting with you which he might want
to arrange.

I am writing in similar terms to the Football Association and the
Football League.

                                        Yours sincerely




                                     ff R M WHALLEY

            In S e p t e m b e r          1987*        I    started serving              with        the C o m m u n i t y C o n s t a b l e s           at

            F.1    and      have          been       on     d u t y at the       m a j o r i t y of m a t c h e s .         At    all    t he s e

            gates         either          3    or 4.

            I originally                  took       up     this     position          as    there       wa s    less       manpower          at    that

            end      of    the       ground.               I have     never         been     detailed any              particular

            On Saturday,                  15th A p r i l          1989,       I arrived         at      the     g r o u n d at     9 .45 am and

            went      into       the          North        stand     for      the    briefing.at              10 am.         Ins p. D a r ling

sit    at    this         position       as     it      is    directly             between          two     sets       of       railings

on    the    terrace         and       often       fans       climb         up     pn    to a n d        over      the      railings

Liverpool            fans    scaled the              perimeter              fence        at    the       start        of    the       1988

semi    final         and    ran       onto     the      pitch.             I detained              one     as     he a t t e m p t e d             to

get    b ac k     in the         crowd.         T he     other         one       got     back       in    but      was      later          taken

out    by St.         Johns       with a        leg      i n j u ry ,       caused        when       he     fell       from       the

fence).

The    fans       began      arriving           at      the    Leppings             Lane       end       before        12.00 and                I

stood       on the         track       behind        the      goal        w i t h PC      Smith.            The       next       officer

on the       track         was    PC    442 C o ok s o n           wh o     wa s    near       the       sma l l      gate       in the

N o r t h Stand.            I don't          know where             the       ne x t     officer          wa s     in the         opposite

direction            (South Stand)

There       were      very       few Liverpool                f an s      in the         ground          but     the       ones       near       PC

S m i t h a n d me         were    sober        and      well       behaved.              I'm       not     s u re     of       the       time

but    about         1 pm    I heard a             r a dio     message             from PS C h a p m a n              (The       radio          was

canteen a message                  came       over       the       r a d io      "The     canteen           will       cl ose         in 20

minutes"             On    our    arrival          at    the       canteen          we    found          it w a s      closed and

one    of    the      ladies       said:        " W e ’ re     closed            for     the    next        twenty          minutes"

I f o u n d PC          700 Helliwell                   was       standing             behind       the      goal.         I saw        the

c e n t re    pen       (C N & C S ? was                very       full          but    the      two    outer       pens       were      only

about        half       full.           This       surprised                me    as    I'd      never       seen       the    fans      so

badly        distributed.                    At    first          there          didn't       appear         to    be a s e r i o u s

common        occurrence                at    l arge         matches.              The       swaying         and    pushing           became

much^orse               to    the       extent          that, f e m a l e s            were      screaming          and       fans      were

l aid    flat          out w i t h       fans          standing             on    him.        It wa s        impossible           at     that

stage        to    get       to    him.           We    were       dragging             f an s    out     of      gate    4 as        quickly

as    possible.               They were                climbing             over       the    fence       onto      the       track      and

over     the       railings             into       the       North          pen.        The      fans     began         pushing         the

dead and           injured          through             the       gate.           Officers          began         resuscitation               on

the     grass.            I assisted               in    pulling             a    l a rge     fat      man     from      gate     4.      He

jumper.         He     wa s       with       his        son about             30 years             he    had       black         h ai r     and      a

black    moustache.                  He      seemed           uninjured             but       very distressed.                         I carried

his    father         onto        the     grass             but    I thought             he was          d e a d as         he w a s n ' t

breathing         and wasn't                 conscious.                  1 began          to       gi v e     him      heart        massage

but    it d i d n ' t        appear          to     have          any    effect          but       I continued and                     he      began

to    breath      for        himself.               A       police       officer          wh o      I don't            now       but      I think

he was       either          from Barnsley                    or W o o d s e a t s        wa s      near         by    said       "make            sure

he    doesn't         swallow           his       t o n g u e 1'        I turned          him       onto         his       side     an      after         a

few minutes            he     regained              consciousness.                       By     this        ti m e     an a m b u l a n c e          ha d

arrived and            w as       parked          near        to       the    goal.           I carried               this       man      by his

arms    and a         civilian            had       his       legs       to    the       ambulance.                   Inside        the

ambulance         there           was     a body             on the          bench and             one      or     two      on    the       floor,

      lad to      put        the     casualty                down and          take       the       bodies            out    of     the

      ilance      then        put       hi m      i ns ide.             He    was    s t ill        breathing               and     conscious

and    his    son wa s            with       him.            I obtained             no    details             and      don't        know what

happened        to     him.

I d o n ’t k n o w      how        long        I stayed with                   this       particular                  casualty            but

whilst       1 was      reviving               him          on the       grass       many          more       bodies         had       been

brought       from Gate              4 and were                   covering          the       grass.             At    s om e     stage            I saw

the    first      officer,              he wa s             Inspector          Harper.              1 said            to    him     " C a n 't we

get    rid of         these        bodies” .                 He    replied:          "Bodies?"                with         disbelief.                It

appeared        to me         that        officers                were       being       directed             to      that       end      of       the

up at G a t e         3 where           the       crush           to    get    out       wa s      enormous,               several          fans         had

fallen       o ve r    the        s m al l     wall          and       were    trapped             by    their         legs a n d           the

crush     behind        t h e m a n d as                a    consequence             they          began         to    pile       up.          I

think     it w a s      at        this       stage           the       fans    began          to     pull        at    the       fencing

which     started            to    rip a w a y              I together           with         other         officers,             fans,

            way      so we       could       get     the     fans       under      it.

             I di d       several        journeys          carrying            bodies     and    injured           on a d v e r t i s i n g

             boards,        at    first       to     the     ambulance           station.            I first         remember          seeing

            about         6-10    bodies        or      injured         on     boards     on    the      floor       outside       the     gym.

             I made        another          journey and            on my        return       with a body             the    whole       f lo o r

             outside        the       g y m wa s     covered.            I made        another         journey        and    on    returning

             this     time       I sa w      the     bodies        were        being     taken       into      the    gym    i tself.           I

             followed           suit.        I don't         know       how m an y       trips       I made,,        the    descriptions

             of     the    bodies        or w h o       I wa s     with        during     this       time.         The     only

             recollection              of    staff       in the         gym     I have       is a n      officer         shoutings

             "Someone           must     stay      with      the       bodies".

            After         all    the     dead      were      in the          g y m a n d the      injured          had     gone     I was

            PC 7 0 0 H e l l i w e l l        and       2954 Morledge.                 The     fans      were      in f a c t     missing

             friends        and       relatives.             We    obtained           their     details         and      descriptions               of

             persons        missing.            After        this       wa s    completed        a     coach a r rived            in

DAVID ALFRED ILLINGWORTH




POLICE CONSTABLE 417




SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE HAMMERTON ROAD POLICE STATION




During my service with South Yorkshire Police and Sheffield and Rotherham, I have been

to many       large    football matches         at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club,                 and during my

time at West Bar did many duties at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.

In September 1987, I started serving with the Community Constables at FI and have been

on duty at the majority of matches.                    At all these games I have been on Serial 1 (the

track)    and I have placed myself behind                      the goal near to gate number 5, and PC 1285

Smith has been near gates either 3 or 4.

I originally          took up   this position         as       there   was   less manpower     at   that end of    the

ground.       I have never been detailed any particular position on the track.

On Saturday 15 April 1989, I arrived at the ground at 9-45 am and went into the North

stand for the briefing at 10 am.                  Inspector Darling was in control of our sector and

PS Chapman was in charge of Serial                    1.       After the briefing from Chief Superintendent

Duckenfield      and     Superintendent         Murray     I    had    a packed   meal   in   the North Stand but

received no other instruction regarding my duties for the day.

I   collected     a    stool    and    placed    it   near to gate           5-   At most     games I sit   at    this

position as it is directly               between two sets of railings on the terrace and often fans

climb up on to and over the railings and gives easy access for climbing the perimeter

fence.    (Two Liverpool fans scaled the perimeter fence at the start of the 1988 semi

final ran onto the pitch.                I detained one as he attempted             to get back in the crowd.

The   other    one     got   back     in but was      later taken out by          St Johns with a leg injury,

caused when he fell from the fence).

The fans began arriving at the Leppings Lane end before 12.00 and I stood on the track

behind the goal with PC Smith.                  The next officer on the track was PC 442 Cookson who
   was near the small gate in the North Stand.                  I don't know where the next officer was

   in the opposite direction (South Stand)

   There were very      few Liverpool       fansin the ground but the ones near PC               Smith and me

   were sober and well behaved.             I    am not sure of the time but at about 1 pm I heard a

   radio    message   from   PS   Chapman       (The   radio was   on   talk through)   to    the effect   "I'm

   taking half my serial for meal before it gets busy" Reply "Roger".                    I then saw a group

   of officers on the track, near the players tunnel leave the track via the North Stand

   obviously going for their meal.

   About half an hour later I saw PS Chapman back near the players tunnel and assumed he

   had had his meal and I was anticipating a radio message to go for mine.                       At 2 pm I had

   received no instruction regarding a meal and walked over to PS Chapman and asked him

^^if   PC Smith and I could take            our meal.       He said OK.     On our way to the canteen a

   message came over the radio "The canteen will close in 20 minutes".                       On our arrival at

   the canteen we found it was closed and one of the ladies said: "We're closed for the

   next twenty minutes" PC Smith and I then stood in the queue until they re-opened at

   approximately 2.20.        We were    served and returned to the track at 2.45-2.50 pm.                  PC

  Smith went     to the toilet I walked onto the Leppings Lane end where I found PC 700

  Helliwell was standing behind goal.                  I saw the centre pen (CN & CS) was very full but

   the two outer pens were only about half full.                This surprised me as I'd never seen the

  fans so badly distributed.           At first there didn't appear to be a serious problem the

^ ^ f a n s were swaying back and forth and some were climbing from the pen marked N on the

  map into the stand above.          This is a common occurrence at large matches.                The swaying

  and pushing became much worse to               the extent that females      were screaming and fans were

  beginning    to panic.      I put over a             radio message to the effect:     "There is   a serious

  crush down     here   it is     serious".        I don't know if it was received or not as I was

  unable to hear my radio due to the noise.                  At this time I was near gate 4 and it was

  obvious    that people against        the      fence were    in serious    trouble.    There was only PC

  Smith and me at this section and I think he was near to Gate 3-                       I opened gate 4 and
assisted the first injured man who I saw onto the track.                         The fans began to spill out.

I assisted          this man with   a leg    injury     to   the St Johns at the corner of the North

Stand.        All    the   fans who were spillingonto the track and               the grass   I was attempting

to get them back on the terrace through gates 5 and 6 which I opened.                          At this stage I

was joined by another serial which arrived from the direction of the North Stand.                             The

first body I saw was on the terrace just behind the fence.                            I cannot describe this

person as I could see little of him due to the crowd but he was male, white and laid

flat out with fans standing on him.                It was impossible at that stage to get to him.

We were dragging fans out of gate 4 as quickly as possible.                          They were climbing over

the fence          onto the track and over the railings into the North pen.                    The fans began

pushing       the dead and injured through the gate.               Officers began resuscitation on the

grass.          I assisted in pulling a large fat man from gate 4.                   He was about 50 years of

age, I          think bald/greying, wearing a green jumper. He was with his son about 30 years

he had black hair and a black moustache.                 He seemed uninjured but very distressed.               I

carried his father           onto the grass but I thought he was dead as he wasn't breathing and

wasn't          conscious. I began to give him heart massage but it didn't appear to have any

effect but I continued and he began to breath for himself.                           A police officer who I

don't know but I           think he was either from Barnsley or Woodseats was near by said "make

sure     he    doesn't     swallow his   tongue"        I turned      him onto    his side    and    after a few

minutes       he    regained consciousness.        By   this   time    an   ambulance   had   arrived and was

parked        near to the goal.     I carried this man by his arms and a civilian had his legs

to the          ambulance. Inside the ambulance there was a body on the bench and one or two

on the floor. We had to put the casualty down and take the bodies out of the ambulance

then put him inside.            He was still breathing and conscious and his son was with him.

I obtained no details and don't know what happened to him.

I don't know how long I stayed with this particular                     casualty but whilst I was reviving

him on         the grass many more bodies had been brought from gate 4and were covering the

grass.        At some stage I saw the first officer, he was Inspector Harper.                       I said to him
    "Can't    we   get   rid    of   these    bodies".     He    replied:   "Bodies?"   with   disbelief.      It

    appeared to me that officers were being directed to that end of the ground who had no

    idea what was taking place.              At some stage I ended up at gate 3 where the crush to get

    out was    enormous,       several   fans    had   fallen    over   the small wall and were trapped by

    their legs and the crush behind them and as a consequence                    they began to pile up.         I

    think it was at this stage the fans began                   to pull at the fencing which started to rip

    away I together with         other officers, fans,          ambulance staff began to kick at the bottom

    of it, sufficient gave way so we could get the fans under it.

    I did several journeys carrying bodies and injured on advertising boards, at first to

    the ambulance station.           I first remember seeing about 6-10 bodies or injured on boards

    on the floor outside the gym.              I made another journey and on my return with a body the
A
    whole floor outside the gym was covered.               I made another journey and on returning this

    time I saw the bodies were being taken into the gym itself.                   I followed suit.     I don't

    know how many trips          I made,      the descriptions of the bodies or who I was with during

    this time. The only          recollection of staffin the gym I have is an officer shouting:

    "Someone must stay with the bodies".

    After all the dead were in the gym and the injured had gone I was informed we should

    all go to the North Stand where we were de-briefed by Chief Inspector Beal.                             After

    that I was     asked by Inspector Calvert to sit with fans on a S.Y.T bus in Penistone

    Road.     I went with PC 700 Helliwell and 295^ Morledge. The fans were in fact missing

^^fri ends and relatives.            We obtained their details and descriptions of persons missing.

    After this was completed a coach arrived in Penistone Road and we put the relatives on

    the coach which I was informed was to take them to Hammerton Road Police Station.

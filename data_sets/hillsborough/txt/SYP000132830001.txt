ON^TURDAY      I FOUND A BLACK CASSETTE RECORDER SIMILAR TO A WALKMAN THAT FELL

OUT OF THE POCKET OF A MAN WHO WAS CARRIED OUT OF THE TERRACES DEAD.                THIS WAS

AT ABOUT 10 PAST 3.

I GAVE THE RECORDER TO A POLICEMAN TOGETHER WITH MY NAME AND ADDRESS.

I TRIED TO GIVE IT TO OTHER POLICEMEN BUT THEY WERE OBVIOUSLY TOO BUSY

DEALING WITH THE INJURED & DEAD.

THE MAN WAS IN HIS 308, BIG, WEARING A SHIRT AND JEANS.

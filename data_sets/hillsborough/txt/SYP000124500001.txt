 G53

 DO YOU HAVEN!      VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH
                           7 l^AMASSL- CftAvwwJ''
 I THOUGHT THE POLICE>ftESPONSE WAS POOR.        I SAW POLICEMEN PUSHING PEOPLE

 BACK IN WHEN THEY WERE CLIMBING OVER THE FENCE BUT I MUST SAY AT THAT

 TIME I THOUGHT IT WAS A PITCH INVASION SO THEY MAY HAVE THOUGHT SO AS

 WELL.      I THINK THEIR WAS A LACK OF ORGANISATION BY THE POLICE.     THE FANS

 T ®     THE INITIATIVE TO ORGANISE THE STRETCHERS TO CARRY THE INJURED OUT.

 THE POLICE WERE OBVIOUSLY MORE PREPARED FOR A CROWD CONTROL SITUATION THAN

 A TRAGEDY LIKE THIS.

 G54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 1.     THERE WAS A DEFINITE LACK OF STEWARDS

 2.     THERE WERE NO SIGNS DIRECTING PEOPLE TO THEIR VIEWING POINTS

 3.     I THINK THE LOUDSPEAKER COULD HAVE BEEN USED TO TELL THE FANS   WHAT

 WAS GOING ON AT AN EARLY STAGE (SUPPORTERS AT OTHER PARTS OF THEGROUND
                                                                                    PAGE    9

 DIDNT'X KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING)

 4.   LACK OF SUITABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT

 5.   I THINK THE      F.A. WERE WRONG BOTH IN TICKET ALLOCATION AND   THE   ENDS

 OF THE GROUND.

 6.   I C A N ’T SEE   ANY NECESSITY AT ALL IN HAVING SIDE FENCES WHICH CREATE

 PENS WHEN THERE       IS ONLY ONE TEA M’S FANS AT THAT END.

 I THINK THE POLICE DIDN'T HAVE A CLUE WHEN PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO RI!

 DOWN THE FENCE POLICE WERE STOPPING THEM ALSO THE LINE OF POLICE

 WERE IN THE WAY THEY WERE JUST STANDINGNfcRQUND DOING NOTHING,

 THERE WAS A LACK OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN POLICE OUTSIDE AND INSIDE.

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO AD'R WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

    DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY ThiE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED



    1.    THERE WAS A LACK OF AWARENESS BY THOSE IN CHARGE OF

    HAPPENING AND NOT JUST A HOOLIGAN ELEMENT PERFORMING.

 ABOUT 4 FANS TO EVERY 1 POLICE OFFICERNEVEN THOUGH THERE WERE PLENTY

 OF POLICE OFFICERS THERE

 3.     THERE WAS ONLY 1 AMBULANCE THAT CAME ONTO THE PITCH.

 4.     THE TANNOY OR THE ELECTRONIC SCOREBOARD WAS NOT USED TO INFORM THE

 CROWD OF THE SITUATION WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN USEFUL IN FACT THE ELECTRONIC

 SCOREBOARD WAS STILL FLASHING UP ADVERTS UNTIL I LEFT WHICH I FEEL WAS

 OBSCENE.

 I N H E R E ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 1.     I BELIEVE THAT ALL USERS OF THE NORTH STAND HAD TO ENTER THROUGH ABOUT

 3 OPERATIONAL T UR NS TI LE% AT THE LEPPINGS LANE END.   THE CAPACITY FOR THE

 NORTH STAND IS 10,000 FANS O & ^ O U S L Y EVEN WITH EFFECTIVE QUEUING THERE WOULD

 HAVE BEEN LARGE DELAYS GETTING INTbsJHE GROUND.      ALL TURNSTILES AT THE REAR

 OF THE NORTH STAND WERE CLOSED AND NOT\IN\USE =
                                                     ’A                     •
 2.     I ATTENDED THE GROUND LAST YEAR FOR THE SEMI-SPINAL AND I BELIEVE

 IT WAS BETTER ORGANISED THAN THIS YEAR.     POLICE CHECKED FANS TICKETS BEFORE

 A ^ p V I N G AT THE TURNSTILES, THERE WAS EFFECTIVE QUEUES AND I ENTERED WITH

 A LITTLE PROBLEM.

 3.     I FEEL THAT AS EARLY AS 14.35 HRS <1433) THE GAME SHOULD HAVE BEEN

 DELAYED AND THE PEOPLE STILL OUTSIDE INFORMED THAT THE GAME WOULD NOT

 START UNTIL EVERYONE WAS IN.

 LINED UP IN FRONT OF THE NORTH STAND, THEY COULDN'T HAVE REALISED WHAT

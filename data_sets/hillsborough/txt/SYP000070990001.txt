              I am a married man and I live at the above addres with my wife and

              da ug hte r.



£            On Sa tu r d a y , 45th April   198^ (150489),          I attended the Football

             Association Chal l^qge Cup Semi-Final at Hillsborough,                     Sheffield

              between the team I su p> cr t r Liverpool F .C . and Nottingham Forest F.C,



              I travelled to Sheffield with a group of nine other men                      in two cars.

              I travelled in one car with

I had obtained\a ticket for the game from Anfield Stadium,                Liverpool F,

C . ’s ground, as i\am a season ticket holder for the Spion Kop.     I paid
  \                                                   T          ^tJcxXh
six\pounds for my ticket which allowed me to stand or^the Leppings LN

terrace® at Hillsborough,



I met                         it his house at about     10.00 am (1000)    on the day

of the match and we picked up the other lads from various places                in

Liverpool,     eventually getting under way at about         11.00 am (1100).



On the way to Sheffield we h ^           a bit of a delay on the M62 m o to rw a y

because there had been an accident where someone had corne off a

motorcycle.        Eventually we got to Sheffield at about        1240 pm (1240)

and we parked opposite a pub called the Rose and Crown quite near to

the Football Ground.



vDnce we had parked up,       some of the lads knew the manager of the Rose

amr'Crowri,    through going up there before and so we went          into the pub

where we had some sandwiches and a couple\of             pints of beer.     In total

there were about twenty to thirty supporters all from L i v e r p o o l , in

that    pub, and some locals as well.         Everyone was   in high spirits

laughing and joking,       looking forward to the game.



When we came out of the pub we walked down to the ground,              four of us

sharing a can of beer.            I could see one or two others sharing      cans of

beer as they walked along but nobody appeared to be drunk as such.



On the way there was a bit of singing and general             excitement amongst

the people attending the match.

At about 2.30 pm (1430)                   the same day I arrived at the entrance to the

g round and tried to get to the turnstiles.                              There was no form of

queueing at the turnstiles and no form of crowd control.                               I could see
                                PO a U (0 T %£)       T   .
three officers on horseback                       in amongst the crowd trying to get some

control     but they were totally ineffectual.                           I did not see any Stewards

at all by the turnstiles.



I knew that I had to get                   into the ground by entrance B, and the lads                  I

was with had been last year and I ’ve been to that ground before,                               so we

knew where we were supposed to go.                            However,    getting to the proper

entrances was another matter due to the mass of people and the crush

of them all trying to get in.



In the end a mounted Policeman shouted for us to go round to the
           '                          "\
rightH^and side as they were going to o^^n one of the big g at e s.                               The

   owd a l K m o v e d    round to the right and I wfts swept along and through

this g a t e .        No-one    checked my ticket or asked for it at all.                  I did

not see the gate being opened,                      it was already open when I got round

there.      I still XH^.ye my ticket                in tact.         I wish to keep this ticket

but the Police have a photocopy of my ticket.                              (Ref. No;     > (Exh.

Once     inside the ground I drd not see any signs directing me where to

go but even if I t*ad I could not have done anything about it as I was

carried along and dowh a t u n n e l , which was quite tightly packed and

people were being jostled along and crushed against the wall.                               I did

not see any Police Officers or Stewards at this point in the ground at

a 11 h



At the end of the tunnel                   I went to the left of a fence which was              in
                                                                              PAGE     i

the middle and got carried along           into a Pen which I now know to be Pen

4-.   I was about half-way down the Pen to start with and about half-way

across.     I was there for a short while and then due to continuous

crushes and crowd pressure           I ended up moving sideways across the pen

up against the fencing next to a thin causway which I now know to be

Pen 3.          The match itself had started by now and the crowd was still

coming    in.     At this   point,                              were close by and

                                         were not far away.     We were pinned up

against the railings by now.           Suddenly there was a tiny space

available and at that                   managed to get up on the railings and

said to me,       "Somethings going to go,    I ’m going over the fence."

            rianaged to get into the Pen 5.       Then          tried to get over

the fence and I helped him over and                      pulled him from the other

side.    I then h a l f \ 1 i m b e d over half was dragged over t he \r ai l in gs
   c^-7--                 '           J-                 -                       ~

into Pen 5.    We then pulled                         iver as they wera trying to

climb ove'r'x^ In the end all five of us were        in Pen 5.     1         myself

and another lad,       then stayed in Pen 3.     Whilst the others,

and             walked through the gate and onto the pitch.              and I

started to drag people over the railings          into Pen 5.     As we could see

that people were being severely cxushed,          and stood on, and were close

to being killed.        I would say that w X dragged about fifty or more

people over thv^ railing and they escaped onto the pitch.



After a while a Policeman came into Pen 5 and told us that we were not

to pull any more out and that was enough.           People were being    pulled up

into the Stands above the terraces and climbing over the front

perimeter fences onto the pitch, and there was a geneal feeling of

panic with people grabbing at us to pull them out.              There were    people

coming out and landing on top of my head and shoulders and I was

getting angry at people, we had helped out who were running onto the
                                                                                   PAGE

                I d o n ’t know what he was doing       in that Pen in the first

place.     After a while the numbers of people            coming over slowed down a*

the crush was easing off. Eventually I went onto the pitch itself and

could see lots of people         lying down,    some ot\whom had scarves,

blankets or shirts       pulled up over their f a c e s . \ G t h e r   people were

obviously injured and one who I now know a                s     ___________ was   lying

on the floor.      I noticed that his face was all scratched,               his nose was

bleeding and both ears also.           He appeared to be semi-conscious at this

time and I asked him his name which is how I know his name was

T. know his last name because         I saw him being      interviewed in Hospital

the following night and it was on the television that his full                     name

was                      I shouted for St. John's Ambulance             people to come

and help and eventually got the attention of a young girl.                     She told

me to get a stretcher for him as she s u s p ^ t e d           head injuries,

ran towards the N Stand and I followed him to an advertising stand,

We pulled the board free and took it back to where                          as lying

.and put himiwnVt
              otVto it      With           and about another five or six           lads X

carried           to a corner between the N Stand and the Kop to an area

which had been set aside for the injured.               A Police Officer       pointed us

in this direction.        When we got there we put him down and a St. John's

Ambulanceman said he       would be looked after.             I could see about a dozen

other    injured people    in that area and I knew there            were loads of other

injured people lying       on the ground by the Leppings           LN end of the

ground so we took             off the board and took the            board back to that

end.     By this time I ' ^ & ^ w i t h three lads that       I didn't know.      When I

got back to the Leppings LN end of the ground I could see_a_SL_ad lying

on the ground with his jumper          pulled up over his helh^*         A Policeman

said for us to take him away so with the other                 lads I put him onto our

              makeshift stretcher and returned to the other end of the pitch.            This

              time    I was directed to a Gymnasium and I saw a lot of people with

              their heads covered.     I heard someone shout out,    "Put the dead on the

              outside and the injured in the middle."       We left this seco>td lad on

              the outside of the Gym next to the wall,      as it was obvious tm^t this.

              lad was dead.x I tXen returned to Leppings LN\ 4pd helped to carry

       -\-0   another two dead ladsr up to the G y m . Both of these had their heads

              covered so I could not recognise them or say how old they were           I can

              only say that one had jeans on with a light blue jacket over his head,

              Whilst    I was carrying these dead people    I was getting   into a state

              emotionally as all    these lads were dead.     I became very angry at one

              stage when I saw a lad with a red and white striped T-shirt on

              shouting at us,    calling us "Scouse bastards'   and being generally

              abusive.    Had I got hold of this lad I don't think     I would have been

              able to control myself.



              At this stage I remember seeing a line of Policemen standing across

              the middle of the pitch forming a cordon and I couldn't think what

              they were doing there    instead of helping us as by now      it must have

              been obvious that there were a lot of dead,       dying and injured people

              and no violence.     I must admit that   I spoke my m i n d to some of these

              officers and one Policewoman said she was sorry and staK^ed to cry.

 fb4          It appeared to me that they all seemed to be waiting for orii^rs to

              hel-^-^nd seemed unable to act on their own initiative.        Only a h a n d f u l

              of Poli ce-Officers seemed to have taken their helmets off and got

              stuck i7r£>^elping out.



              After    I had let off some steam I was wandering    round the ground not

              knowing what to do I re-met          and he took me to where my friends

              were.    At this stage we realsied that two of our     lads were missing.

                                                                                            S1525

                  An announcement was made that the game had been abandoned and we

                  started to look round for                   as we wanted to go.       After a

                  while we decided to go back to the cars and see if they were up there

                  by the Rose and Crown.    We walked up to the pub hoping to find them

                  and luckily once we got to the pub they were waiting for us.          What was

                  upsetting me prior to seeing the lads, was the fact that all the dead

                  people we had seen had had their faces    covered and we didn't know if

                  we had may be carried them to the Gym and not known it was them.             When

                  all of our party were accounted for we went    into the pub for a drink.

                  The manager of the pub took all our names and addresses and         'phone

                  numbers and 'phoned eve ry o n e ’s house to pass on messages that we were

                  all alright.   We left the pub at about 6.30 pm (1830) and went home.

                  I think that the disaster may well have been avoided had the F.A.            let

                  Liverpool   have more tickets and have the Kop end to stand in.           Also

                  the organisation of the event was very poor.      Instead of having Police

                  Officers at the turnstiles to coKtrol the ground and people going            in
t_e5P*_vw_?_s£S
                  there seemed to be more emphasis on\>ratecting     pubs and s h o p s .    Each

                  one we saw had between two and four Policemen outside and all those

                  officers or at least half   could have been at the ground.       The staff at

                  the ground were no help at all.    I did not see any Stewards at all

                  until after the disaster had happened.     Then I^ a w   a few walking      round

                  the pitch with watX^ handing out cups of^water.

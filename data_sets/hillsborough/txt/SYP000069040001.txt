about       2.20        pm       (1420     hrs).

My      father         parked        our      car       some       twenty          minutes          walk       from H i l l s b o r o u g h

We      then      began          to w a l k      to     the       ground.           As    we    got       clo              o t h e g ro u nd

could       see        groups        of    t hr e ^ a n a          four       Liverpool             s>#fporters            stood       &rouna

1 could           see       on    the     side         of    the       pavement          as    I walked,             l a rg e    quantities

of      discarded            beer       cans       and       could       still       see       numbers          of     fans      drinking

beer.          Many         appeared          drunk          and       I could       smell          beer       from       many     who

weren't           actually           drinking.

We    walked           along       Loppings             Ln    from a s ho p pi n g              are a,         as    I approached

the      ground         I could           se e     a    la rge         mass    of    people          at       the    entrance          to      the

ground-           I would          estimate             that       there       were       about          1,000       people        milling

around.            I could also                  see        several       police          officers             on    horseback             who

were       trying           to d i r e c t       the        crowd       into       the    ground.

As    we    got        to    the     metal         gates          at    the    entrance             to    the       ground       1 could            see

our      entrance            beyond        these            gates       but    a    police          officer          was    stopping              fans

from       going        through.              We       were       told    that       we       could       not       gain    access           to     our

stand       through              these     gates            but    would       have       to    walk          around       the     ground,.

By    this        time       we    were       in a m o n g s t          the    crowd          and    had       to    force       our       way

through           the       crowd       b ac k     into       Lsppings             Ln.

There       were        more       and     more         fans       walking          along       Lappings             Ln    towards           the

 ?\ ! '   O Duties   15»^«89 re.Hillsborough disaster


My period of duty    on this date was 12 midday to 12 midnight.
I commenced duty at Hammerton Road Police Station at 11.50am on this date dealing with        (
general clerical duties. Throughout this time I was monitoring both F1 and football
radio channels in the office.
At about 2.50pm on this date it was apparent from radio messages being transmitted over
the football channel that serious difficulties were being experienced at the Leppings
Lane end of the ground which without going into detail culminated in the crushing incident.
At about 3»15pra on this date Detective Chief Inspector Addison attended at F1 and after
briefing DC Brown, DC Lewin, PC Nottingham and myself on the situation, we then attended
at the Casualty Department of the Royal Hallamshire Hospital where we assisted with the
setting up and running of the Casualty Enquiry Bureau. Officers from West Bar Casualty
enquiry team were    already in attendance. On our arrival therewere already a large number
of injured persons present and it was ascertained that one dead body had been brought to
the hospital, that being a white unidentified male.
At about 6.30pm on this date as a result of a message received from the hospital staff
Dc Brown, DC Lewin, Pc Nottingham and myself left the hospital and went to the gymnasium
at the football ground. On arrival there Inspector Webster briefed us on the situation
and instructed us to assist with the body identification. This consisted of putting the
bodies into 'body bags', washing down their faces where necessary and placing them on trollies
w h e ^ p they were wheeled to a viewing area where once a positive identification had been
made by a relative or friend the body was passed to the ambulance service for conveyance
to the medico legal centre.
I concluded my duties at 5»30am on 16.4.89*

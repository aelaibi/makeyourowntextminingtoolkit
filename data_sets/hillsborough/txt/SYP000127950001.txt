                "At 11.15 a.m. I boarded the coach at Picton Clock Tower,
                Wavertree, with            _   The Journey was rather
                boring becasue of tailbacks and traffic jams on the M6.
                As we aproached Sheffield we were stopped about 2 miles
                away from the ground by Police. The Police boarded the coach
                and quickly searched for any drink on the coach. The coach then
                carried on towards the ground.
                At about 2.15 p.m., the coach parked about g mile away
                from the ground. Myself and        talked quickly towards
                the ground. As I remember, there was a lot of latecomers
                behind us. After a while we reached the ground and
                left me becasue he had a stand ticket. As I looked
                towards the Leppings Lane Turnstiles, there was about
                one - two thousand people queuing there, so I joined
                them. As I looked around in the disorganised queue,
                I noticed only about 4 policemen (one of them mounted
                on a horse) controlling the crowd. The crown was getting
                very impatient as the time was about 2.35 p.m. Eventually,
                I managed to force my way in through a turnstile, where the
                steward took my ticket and then returned the stub.
                I then slowly walked the tunnel leading towards the terrace.
                When I actually got on to the terrace the time was about
                2.40 p-*m. The terrace was capacity then, so I positioned
                myself to the left of the goal in front of the bar, so I
                wouldn’t get crushed. The crush got worse and I was pushed
                and I banged my right knee on the bar. Then at about 2.50 p.m.
                people started to panic near the front.


                                                                           cont/.

The game was kicked off, as soon as it was, people
started to climb over the railings at the front. The
crush now was extremely bad. Then I heard from someone
that the gates outside had been opened. A fan who was already
on the pitch then ran on and tugged Steve Nicol and pointed
behind the goal. The referee then stopped the gam as policemen
and women tried to ease the crush. Then I seen what appeared
to be someone dead or very badly injured being passed over
the railings. But there was panic everywhere so I stayed
where I was for about 5 mins until it was calmer. I then
ran to the left of the goal and helped rip down the fence.

As I got out of the fence on to the pitch, I looked around
and to my horror, I seen dead, dying and injured people
everywhere. People crying and panicking as the police
did everything they could behind the goal.
Then I offered my hand in help behind the goal, but was
told bluntly by a Police officer to "Go away son, leave this
to us” . Go and help the injured"... I then angered by his
reply, tore down advertising boards with other fans
to use as stretchers I then walked around the ground
dazed and after no more could be done, walked towards
the coaches and phoned home from a shop opposite our coach.
I then boarded the coach and found      L Then after
a quick count, in which only 2 was missing, we returned
home shocked and numb, with daze......... ”

           At 8.20am Saturday 15 April 1989, I reported for duty at Main Street

           Police Station,     in respect of the football match which was due to be

           played at Hillsborough Football Ground, Sheffield, between Liverpool

           and Nottingham Forest.



           At 9am that day together with other Officers, we were transported to
           Hillsborough Football Ground by coach, where we were later briefed b y

           Senior Officers regarding our duty that day, after the briefing

           together with D.S. Tissington and other officers I made my way to

           Halifax Road, and commenced duties with Serial 38.        The duty

           consisited of Parking of all mini coaches containing Liverpool

           supporters on a cul de sac off Halifax Road.
                                                                     PAGE   2


Whilst we were at that location only a few mini coaches came to our

location, the occupants of these were in a friendly mood? one or two

of the coaches were found to contain a few cans of alcohol, but none

of the occupants or drivers were drunk.



Further up the road from our location was a shopping centre, one of

these shops being the Gateway supermarket, a number of mini coaches

arriving early and very late found to be parking in the shopping

precinct and the occupants were entering the Gateway supermarket and

purchasing alcoholic drinks.



A large number of fans walked down Halifax Road,    past our serial, and

whilst they were passing us they were asking if there were any pubs

g   pen which would allow the Liverpool supporters in, when they were

told that most of them if not all of the pubs in the area were closed,

the younger men and youths were returning up Halifax Road to the

Gateway supermarket.    Officers on horse back and on foot and also

mobiles were requested to attend that area on a number of occasions to

deal with the rowdy elimant.



Halifax Road was very busy due to the number of fans attending the

football match, upto approximately 10 minutes before the kick off, and

quite a number of fans had to be spoken to due to their behaviour and

in respect of the alcohol they still had in their possession even at

that time, some of them were carrying four cans of beer/lager some

we re carrying eight cans, some just a single can, which they were

drinking and throwing the empty cans anywhere.     Other fans were

carrying large plastic bottles containing alcohol, others were

carrying bottles of wine.     It would appear that most of them were

drinking as much as they could and then they were not bothered what it
                                                                    PAGE   3


was as long as it was alcoholic.



A lot of the fans were in a good mood, some of them were merry due to

the match which was due to be played? the younger element were the

ones that were boistrous.



At appr o k imately 3pm together with the rest of my serial,   I made my

way towards Niagra where we were due to have our meal before going

onto the ground, whilst on route a message was received by radio

requesting all Officers to attend at the ground due to problems inside

the ground,



I was in possession of my personal   radio? and 1 heard some one ask

over the radio for the game to be put back for 15 minutes due to the

large number of fans that were still outside the ground prior to kick

off,   I did not hear any reply to this message.   I also heard Officers

asking for the gate or gates to be

opened as they believed that some one would be injured or the fans may

cause trouble due to the fact that they could not get into the ground

for the kick off.



Together with other Officers from other serials we made our way along

Leppings Lane towards the location of the West Stand, whilst we were

going along Leppings Lane near to the ground a small number of fans

were walking towards us.



When we approached Leppings Lane with its junction of Vere Road?

Inspector Charles informed match control by radio of how many Officers

he had with him and asked where we were to be directed to? we were

directed to enter the ground by the West Stand and assist other
                                                                  PAGE    4


Officers at that location.



When we first entered the ground we were met by a large number of

Liverpool supporters, who were angry and we were subjected to a lot of

verbal abuse.   I made my way towards the tunnel which runs underneath

the West Stand which was found to be blocked by the Liverpool

supporters hanging about, some of them seemed dazed,   in order to get

into the tunnel we had to get hold of the supporters and shout at them

to get out of the tunnel, even passing them from one Officer to

anothe r.



When I got onto the terrace behind the goals,   I saw a large number of

bodies on the floor,   people were standing on them to get out of the

way, some of the fans were pulling the wire barriers down with their

hands in order that they could get out from the terrace onto the

pitch, as the wire was being torn out from the supports other

spectators were picking some of the bodies off the floor and passing

them through the gate or through the openings in the fencing.



I assisted in helping with some of the bodies on the terrace and

placing them onto the playing area, Officers were trying to revive the

fans as were some of the other fans, there were also a large number of

fans that were ripping down the advertising boards which were being

used to carry the injured and the dead fans away from the goal mouth

towards the other end of the ground or to the gymnasium.



liost of the Liverpool supporters in the top of the West Stand in the

seated area were shouting abuse at the Officers at that end of the

ground, this 1 believe out of anger and frustration.
                                                                   PAGE      5


I assisted in removing a number of spectators from the playing area

near to the West stand to the other end of the ground.      I also helped

carry a number of people that were obviously dead to the gymnasium

behind the North Stand.    Whilst 1 was doing this a large number of

fans that were carrying bodies into the gymnasium were rushing about

knocking people out of the way irrespective of what they were doing?

trying to get to the gymnasium as soon as they could.      I believe that

this was with good intent as they were trying to get medical treatment

as fast as they could for there fellow fans.



Whilst I was in the gymnasium and in the process of returning to the

pitch,   I was asked by a Senior Officer that if I was not engaged would

I stand by one of the bodies laid inside the gymnasium.



I went to the body of Andre Brookes, approx 23 years of age of

         Si demoo r, Bromsgrove, he was certified dead by Dr. Bull from

the Royal Hal lamshi re Hospital, the body was later identified by his

friend John Harris of                                    Bromsgrove,

There was no identification on the body and very little property.



The body was later transported to the Medico Legal Centre and hande^l

over to DS.           together with the property.   At 1.30am Sunday 16.4.

89 I finished duty.

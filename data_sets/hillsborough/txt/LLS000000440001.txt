J O H N GLOVER              will say          :




I    wish     to      offer         f u rt h e r    instructions             in     relation       to     my    dealings           wit h    the

S outh Yorkshire Police




I do feel aggreived about a number o f matters.




On   the      day     of    the         tragedy       I had b e e n made             aware       t hat    so me t h i n g t e rrible had

h a p p e n e d to Ian by               virtue      of contact from my son Jo seph who was also embroiled

in the tragedy.




As a result,             m y s e l f and a friend left Liverpool i m m e d i a t e l y for Sheffield.

In    our     absence           a       p o lice    officer          fro m       Merseyside       ( against        w hom       I   register

no    complaint            at   all        ) came         to       my home       and tol d my,        already      d i s t re s s e d wife,

t hat   the        info r m a t io n        from      Barnsley             was     that   Joe     was     injured        and       had     been

t a k e n to Barnsley Hospital.

T here was no information, however,                                  in respect of Ian.




When    I     arrived           at       Barnsley         Ho s pital         I    there    saw     the     S ec urity         at   the     main

entrance           and     he       w ent     through              the     computor       list     of     d e c eased     and       injured.

He    t old      me      that       Ian's          name    did       not     feature      on    the      list    and     he    must        still

be    alive.          Again         I    level no criticism at the                        security        officer but          the    people

who p ro v i d e d him w i t h the information.




The p olice must h ave b e e n aware that Ian was one of the deceased.




From    there         we    went          to Sheffield Police                    Station w h e re        we made       enquiries           about

Ian.        We      were        the n      taken      on       a    bus    bac k    to    the    ground        i tself    and      there      to

the te mp o r a r y mortuary.
As    we    pulled           in    to       the    g round         there         was    the       obscene        spectacle          of    newspaper

cameramen             and     t.v.         cameramen           pushing           their       cameras        up    to    the    window           in    the

hop e of capturing the g r i e f on all our faces.




On    e ntering         the        g round         I    made      a    formal protest                to    a police          officer          a b o * the

p ress      and that          they          should do            s o m e t h i n g about it.              I was assured b y the police

officer that they would no                                   longer    be     there when we                left.        That w a s completely

untrue.           As we left there was the s ame sickening display.




On    en t ering            the        ground           there      was       a    b o ar d    wit h       phot o g r a ph s    of        many        dead.

Because          all        the    phot o g r a ph s           w ere     taken         after      their       demise         quite       frankly           at

that       stage        all       the        pho t o g ra p h s       looked           alike.         Ian's       picture,          however,              was


found.




This       was        done    in       an       a rea    which        was     full of p l a i n c l o t h e d p o lice              officers              who

were       simply s t anding r o u n d w a t c h i n g you.                            There was no privacy.                       I was distressed

at    the        total        lack          of    r e s p e ct     for      our     grief.           I    felt     even       worse          w hen    they

b r o ug h t     Ian     out       on       a    str e t c h er       for     he was         laid     out     in a gr o t es q u e position.

It     was       almost           as       th ough       he     had     simply          b een      thrown        onto    the       stretcher              and

a    b la n k e t      thrown          over        him.          T h e re    was       no    attempt        to    lay    him       out       properly.

All        in    all     the       Sh e f f i el d           Police      showed          a   complete         disregard            for       our     grief


and distress




After           Ian    was        formally             identified           we    were       told     to     go    back       to    our       homes        in

Liverpool             for     there          was        no    point      in      staying          overnight        in Sh ef f i e l d and that

they        would       send           a    police           officer        around          the    following           day    to    advise           as    to

the        arrangements                for       the     return         of       Ian's       body.         Quite       frankly,          I    am     still


waiting.
Thereafter,             however,            I    was       visited             by    the       Police         from     Sh e f f ie l d           who    w a nted

to    interview            my    other          son,                                  ]â–        It       s e e m e d that        t h e y p a r t icularly

wanted       a        statement        from       him          for    whatever             reason.             That    I t h o u g ht was rather

unusual b ea r i n g in mind that it                                 was the W est             Midlands Police w h o were c o n d u c t i n g


the investigations on b e h a l f o f                                the enquiry.




I    wish        to    say      that       I have          no     complaints               about         the    manner          in       which     the Wes t

Midlands              Police      conducted                themselves.                     They         did    enquire          about            whether          or

not        Ian    would         normally             go    for        a    drink       or      two       be fore      a    f o o tball            match.           I

advised t hem in no un c e r t ai n t e r m s that that was not Ian's n o r m a l habit.




I     u n d erstand          that      in       so       far         as    Ian       was co n c e rn e d , there                was         not        a     trace


of alcohol in his system.




One        other       matter          concerns            me    and       that        is      when       I    was    shown          a    photograph              by

the        Sheffield          Police of my sons                       belongings,              I n o t ed       that       co n t a i ne d        in a small

p l a s ti c      type       sleeve         was          his    m a t ch       ticket.            Consequently,                 I    then        s i gned         for

the r e turn of his property,                              i n c l u d i n g that item, but on i n s p e c t in g his p ro p e r t y

 I    found           that      that       item      was        missing.              I     can          only    assume             t hat    it        has    b een

r e t ained by the Sheffield Police for whatever reason.




 In       c o nc lusion         therefore,               I have           a number of g r ie vances                       against the S h e f f i e l d

 Police.               I     h ave     no       complaints,                however,             against either                the         W est        Midlands


 Police nor the Liverpool Police.



    One     final       point        t hat      has        come       to       mind       is   that          when     I went          to the te m p or a r y

    mortuary,           the      Sheffield                Police          indicated            to       me     that    both          Ian     and       my     other

     son    Joe,        were      dead.              I    knew,           of    course,         t hat         that    c o u ldn't           be    true       for        I

    had     already          been      made       aware          that          Joe    was      still          alive       and       i n deed       I had          seen

     him.         The      point       I     make,         however,             is     that         I    had    just       gone          straight            to    the

     Mo rtuary         and      hade    been         told        that          my    other      son h a d        also d i e d            this w o u l d have


     had a catastrophic effect u p o n me.
Again   it   is   an   illustration   of   the   lack   of   competence   di s pl a y e d   by   those


officers in Sheffield.

 RSCOLISCTTOHS OP EVENTS AT HILLSBOROUGH
 SATDEHA.T 15 APRIL 1989

 I am a Police Constable of the Nottinghamshire Constabulary presently
 attached to the Force Mounted Seotion*


 On Saturday 15 April 1989, in company with seven Mounted Seotion Officers
 X travelled to Hillsborough, Sheffield under the supervision of Police
 Sergeant 1J10 tfataony in order to assist South Yorkshire Police with
public order duties at the PA Cup semi final, Hottingham Forest v Livers001*


My deployment on arrival at Hillsborough was to monitor visiting ITottinghaa
Forest supporters attending the ground via Penistone Hoad turnstiles, in
company with Pc 1498 Swain, a South Yorkshire Mounted Offioer.   Also during
the course of my patrol, in company.-with Pc Swain I attended Eerries Hoad
and merries Hoad South from where visiting supporters were approaching the
ground. Approximately 2 50 P® that day Pc Swain resumed from Penistone Hoad
and I continued my patrol alone,


during v2e entirety of :ny patrol my duties consisted of monitoring JTottingham
Forest supporters only and at no tine prior to the beginning of the game
02? indeed following dispersal of fans at the postponement of the natch did
I encounter any Liverpool supporters*   My patrol was restricted only to
thsse roads and at no line was I aware of any crowd control problems whioh
had resulted on Leppinga lane or any other area around the ground, until
such time as details were released by other officers following the postponement
of the game, at which time I again assisted with the orderly dispersal
of Nottingham Forest supporters from the ground.

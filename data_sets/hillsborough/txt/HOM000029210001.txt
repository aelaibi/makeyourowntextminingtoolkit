BARRIER TESTING

I have pleasure in enclosing a further letter which has been received from
Nuttall Yarwood & Partners of Bradford. They enclose with their letter the
procedures they adopt for testing barriers.

 I trust these will be of assistance to you. If I can be of any further
 assistance please do not hesitate to contact me.

  Dear Sir,
  Re: Barrier Testing
  Further to our Fax of 16th June, 1989 in connection with the above
  we enclose copies of our methods for testing barriers together
  with test results from Odsal and Aston Villa which help to illus­
  trate the two methods used.
  With regard to your second question we have no experience in deter­
  mining ground capacities. However we suggest you contact
  Mr.Paul Stefanuti, Chief Building Control Officer, City of
  Bradford Metropolitan Council, Jacobs Well, Bradford.BDl.5RW.

  Thirdly we would like to add the following observations regarding
  barrier testing:-
  a)    The code refers to peak viewing areas but only defines those
         for football. Where are the peak viewing areas for other
         sports ie: Rugby, Speedway etc.?
  b)    There is a lower test load for new barriers as                opposed to old
        why?
   c)   The code does not appear to include any requirement to check
        that recommendations contained in a test report have been imp­
        lemented. We raise this point as there have been instances,
        when returning the following year for further testing, where
        we have found that our recommendations (either wholly or partly)
        have not been carried out.
   d)   Whilst we consider ourselves capable of designing and adapting
        equipment to pull or push Barriers/handrails, some are extremely
        difficult, if not impossible, to test. Designers of sports

Whilst the tests are being carried out the following observations
are made:
        a ) Watch for cracking of concrete around stanchion
            bases.
        b) Inspect welds for defects.
        c) Look for defects on barriers such as rust, holes
           in tubular sections and poor base plate details
           where applicable.

       The general appearance of the barriers on the Northern
       Terrace is poor. Rust is evident, particularly on the
       non-galvanised sections (N.B. some of the new tubular
       barriers ares not galvanised and are rusting).
       The equipment used to test the barriers is by necessity^
       quite heavy and damage to the barriers1 protective coating
       is inevitable. We recommend that a maintenance programme
       be instigated and that barries tested each year are repainted
       This would result in a barrier being repainted every 5 years.

      We consider the scaffolding segregation barriers on the
      Northern Terrace to be ineffective and dangerous. We
      recommend it be removed and if necessary replaced by a
      proper segregation fence.
      The scaffolding segregation barriers on the South Western
      Terrace have dangerous protrusions on which people could
      become impaled. These should also be removed or replaced
      as above.
       For the purpose of this document the following result
       sheets are titled as follows.

10    When first tested there were several barriers which failed
      to achieve the required standard, these were re tested
      and are marked such in the report.
      It was generally found that the reason for failure was
      the iisdsk of and defective grout at the base of the
      Stanchions. We would recommend that where the grouting is
      defective the stanchion base be scraped of all loose or
      defective debris and the core repacked with concrete to
      fill.all voids and achieve a reasonably water tight seal
      around base of stanchions.

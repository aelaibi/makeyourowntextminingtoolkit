               I am the resident Licencee                                                          Sheffield.

               am a member of the Sheffield Wednesday F oo tb al 1 Club and attend

               Hillsborough Football Ground on a regular basis.

               I have a friend who is a member of staff at the ground and he arranged

               to get me two tickets for the Liverpool                       v Nottingham Forest Semi-Final

               w hich was held on Saturday 15 April                   1989.      <150489)       I kept one ticket

               for myself and my uncle,                                    had the other.        I had arranged

               to meet my uncle at the ground.                   On that day during the course of
       A/-^'
      <iy      business in the pub I met three Liverpool supporters who had called in
                                                 io'T
               for a drink.  They were                 who is a fellow Licencee in

            V'Liverpool.        He keeps                                  Huyton, Liverpool.         The other

               two I only know as                                         They were also from Liverpool

               I was going to the match at about 2.10 pm (1410)                             so I offered all
                                                                             PAGE

three of them a lift to the ground in my car.              When we arrived at

Hi 1 Is borough,       I parked the car in Withens Ave which is about 3 minutes

walk to the ground.           I thought how light the traffic was along my

route to the ground via Middlewood Rd.             However,   there was a large

number of people on foot heading towards the ground.                All four of us

walked down to Leppings Ln together.             When we arrived near the

entrance I directed them to the various stands that they had tickets

for.   As we came into Leppings Ln, we could see how b u s y it was.

There was a very large crowd in and around the Leppings Ln entrance to

the ground.        Some were sat on the wall near to the bridge that         crosses

the river Don.          They were approaching     people^Up an attempt to purchase

tickets.     We had also seen a man in Mi ddy^wood Rd selling t i ck et s.              I

d o n ’t know what sort of price J24? was caking as we just walked passed

him.

At the Leppings Ln entrance after I had parted with the other lads I

was making my way to the turnstiles for the West S t a n d .           There was

quite a crowd there and a fair bit of a crush but t h a t ’s what you

would expect for a big mat/fh.           There was a long line of people to my

right that were d u m b i n g      the metal   railings situated between the two

sets of turnst i l e L ^ u n c e   on the top of the railings they went onto

the top of the walk at the turnstiles and then down into the ground.

I think the Police were waiting for them when they got down.

There was a lad two in front of me at the turnstile trying to buy his

way in.    I think he was trying to offer the turnstile operator £10 to

get in but he flatly refused to let him in.             While he was doing this

the people behind were getting agitated because the queue had come to

a standsti 1   1   .

Once through the turnstile           I made my way to the stairs leading up to

the West Stand.          It was about 2.45 pm (1445)     by then,   the fans going

towards the tunnel         did not appear to be having any difficulty in
                                                                           PAGE         3

getting down it.     I showed my ticket to the steward at the bottom of

the stairs and made my way into the West Stand.           When I arrived at my

seat which was right     in the middle of the stand and about half way

back,   I could see that the pens in front of me were full a nd that the

pens on both my right and left had room for more spectators.              The

other end of the ground where the Forest supporters were looked quite

full.   It was not until after the match had started that I became

aware that there was something wrong.         The first thing I remember

seeing was the supporters from pen three climbing over the fence

leading onto the pitch.       They were   climbing over to the right of the

gate in the fence.     More and more people started climbing over the

fence in both pens three and four.         There were several" people already

over the fence and behind the goal when B e a r d s l e y h i t   the cross bar.

I could see at this point that the people w ep4 surging forward.                The

match continued for a couple of minute<L>^fore being stopped.              People

did not appear to be aware of what was happening.            I can recollect

that I saw the gates     in the fence of pens three and four had been

opened and Policemen were pulling people out.           At one point there were

people pulling at the fence in pen f o u r .      They eventually pulled it

off and a lot of people climbed         through the hole.    The crowd was so

packed that I saw one lad crawl         over the heads of people and then over

the fence.    There was one girl who was being passed ov erh ead .         She was

obviously unconscious.      I first saw her when she was about three            parts

of the way down pen three and near the centre.           She was being moved

all over the place,     I could not see whether she was being passed along

by the other spectators or if she was ^u'st being carried along on top.

I would say she was about      1S-2Q yeat^ w ith long h a i r .    I think it was

blonde or at least fair.      \
                              NShe way'wearing jeans and a top.         I can't

remember what happened to '^8 r /       I cannot remember whether there was

anyone else passed overhead.        I   saw lotsof people jammed up      the front

                                                                       S 164 8

of the pens.     They had to be dragged out by people on the pitch side

of the fence.     Some people could not be pulled out until others had

been removed.     It was    like unlocking a jig saw.   There were several

people pulled up into our stand by people        leaning over the front.

I remained in my seat until about 3.30 pm (1530) when I decided to go

to the toilet.     It was a bit of a squeeze to get through because of

all the people who had been pulled up and were standing in the

gangway.     On my way down to the toilet     I met a policeman who told us

the game was being cancelled.        I returned to my uncle and told him.

We both then left the stand by the same stairs that we had come up.

When we got to the bottom of the stairs the area there was fairly

clear.     I could see one lad lying on the ground near to the wall at

the right hand side of the tunnel.        He had a friend with him who was

holding his head.        He had blood on his face.   I think he was still

alive.     There was another man near the porta-cabin where they sell

programmes.     He was    lying motionless.   He was a big set lad.   Probably

middle aged.     I did not see anyone else who was obviously injured on

my way out of the ground.        We left via the Leppings Ln entrance.

There was still a few people about       in the lane making their way away

from the ground.     We both returned to the car and made our way back to

             If I was required to give any evidence at the inquiry I

would be willing.

 INCIDENT WAS HANDLER), AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 POLICE TOTALLY UNO RG AN IS ED - NO ONE SEEMED TO DO A N Y T H I N G UNTIL THE FIRE

 BRIGADE ARRIVED.   IT SEEMED ABOUT 10 MINS BEFORE THE A M BU LA NCE ARR I.VED , WHICH

 WERE UTILISED INCORPN£CTLY. THEY SEEMED TO WALK AROUND AIMLESSLY.          I APPRECIATE

 THEY HAD TO DIVIDE THE PITCH SO THAT FANS C O U L D N ’T INTER-MINGLE.     SOME OFFICERS

 TOOK   IT ON THEMSELVES TO GET STUCK      IN AND DRAG OUT THE INJURED AND TRIED TO

 REMOVE THE FENCE TO GET MORE OUT.        IT SEEMED TO BE THE FANS RUNNING AROUND

 CARRYING THE FANS TO HELP.

 END WAS NOT LARGE ENOUGhNEiJR THE AMOUNT OF FANS. ALSO L I V E R P O O L ’S ALLOCATION

 WAS FAR TOO SMALL FOR THE NUMBER OF SUPPORTERS WISHING TO ATTEND THE MATCH.

 THE FA DIDN'T LISTEN TO LIVERPOOL FC AND DID WHAT THEY WANTED TO FOR THEIR

 EASE OF ORGANISATION NOT SAFETY.

 THERE SEEMED TO BE A LOT OF POLICE STANDING        IN STREETS NEAR TO THE G R O U N D , BUT

 N ^ MANY ACTUALLY OUTSIDE THE ENTRANCE.       THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN OFFICERS

 DIRECTING FANS WHERE TO GO AND ORGANISING THEM INTO ORDERLY QUEUES SO THAT

 THEY COULD HAVE BEEN FILTERED THROUGH THE TURNSTILES.

 I HAVE ALREADY SAID THAT WE ENTERED THROUGH A SIDE GATE.          I POINTED THIS OUT TO

 A STEWARD AND POLICE OFFICER AND SHOWED MY TICKET WHICH WAS WHOLE.            I ALSO SAID

 THAT MORE PEOPLE WERE ENTERING        IN THE SAME WAY AS THE GATE WAS STILL OPEN.         I

 D O N ’T THINK ANYTHING WAS DONE ABOUT THIS, SO I SUPPOSE A LOT MORE PEOPLE GOT

 IN BY THIS ENTRANCE THAN SHOULD HAVE ENTERED THE GROUND.

 THERE WERE A FEW PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE GROUND WITHOUT TICKETS,          ABOUT 30 MILLING

 AROUND.

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS H A N D L E D ,

 AFTER -THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THE POLICE WERE WHOLEY CONCERNED WITH KEEPING PEOPLE OFF THE PITCH.         AT ABOUT

 3.08 PM (1508) ABOUT 6 OR 7 POLICEMEN STOOD NEAR THE BY LINE AND FORMED A

 CORDON TO TRY AND KEEP PEOPLE OFF THE PITCH.      I FOUND THIS DISGUSTING IN THE

 LIGHT OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING ON THE TERRACES, PEOPLE TRYING TO CLIMB THE FENCES

 T, GET OUT, AND ALSO IN THE LIGHT THAT THE MATCH HAD BEEN ABANDONED.

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING     THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL   IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL   INQUIRY?                                                C O M l ^ j

 T ^ E   SHOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER ORGANISATION OR DISTRIBUTION OF FANS AT THE

 TURNSTILES IN LEPPINGS LANE TO PREVENT THEM FROM ENTERING THE MIDDLE SECTIONS,

 OR THE RIGHT HAND     SECTION NEAREST TO THE SOUTH STAND.    I MAKE THIS POINT      DUE

 TO MY PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE OR OVERCROWDING IN THOSE SECTIONS.       IN VIEW OF       THE

 FACT THAT LIVERPOOL HAVE FAR MORE SUPPORTERS THAN NOTTINGHAM FOREST,         THEY

 SHOULD HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED MORE TICKETS AND THE BIGGER SECTIONS OF THE GROUND.

 THE ALLOCATION WAS MADE LIKE THAT MORE TO COMBAT CROWD DISTURBANCES RATHER

 THAN CROWD SAFETY.

 FORMED A CORDON W HICH SEEMED TO BE A WASTE OF TIME AFTER

 WHILE.

 SOME PHOTOGRAPHERS WERE DONE OVER.

 4. PEOPLE W E R E N ’T TOLD WHAT HAD HAPPENED.     IF THEY HAD THEN PERHAPS

 THE FOREST FANS MIGHT HAVE STOPPED CHANTING - THIS WAS UPSETTING

 AND LED TO PEOPLE RUNNING UP THE PITCH - IT MADE IT LOOK AS IF

 i ^ E R P G O L FANS WERE RIOTING ON THE PITCH.


Q '16>

 Q 54

  IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL ENQUIRY?

  •1. POLICE S H O U L D N ’T HAVE SAID THAT PEOPLE HAD BEEN KILLED BECAUSE

 LIVERPOOL FANS HAD SMASHED DOWN THE GATE. FANS HEARD THIS ON

 THE RADIO'S WHEN LEAVING THE GROUND.         THIS LED TO PROBLEMS

 OUTSIDE THE GROUND.

 a ^ - I V E R P O O L WERE GIVEN THE SMALLEST END. , WE   SHOULD HAVE HAD THE

 KOP END.

 3.      I BELIEVE THAT THE LIVERPOOL FANS WERE REALLY WELL BEHAVED UNTIL

 THEY BECAME UPSET AND ANGRY AT THE WAY WE WERE BEING TREATED

 AND BLAMED FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED BEFORE WE'D EVEN LEFT THE GROUND.

Q53

DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS H A N D L E D ,

AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT PENS 3 AND 4 WERE OVERFULL AS PEOPLE WERE CLIMBING OUT AND

BEING PULLED UP INTO THE WEST STAND EVEN BEFORE THE GAME B E G A N , THE POLICE
                                                                 y       -



WERE VERY SLOW TO REACT TO THE SITUATION AND WHEN THEY Dpf> IT WAS ONLY A FEW

THAT ACTUALLY GOT STUCK    IN A LOT SEEMED TO JUST BE WATCHING AND A LARGE

NUMBER WERE USED IN A CORDON ACROSS THE PIT AND WH E N IT WAS EVIDENT THAT IT

       NOT A PITCH INVASION AND PEOPLE WERE ACTUALLY^DEAD THE CORDON OF THE

POLICE WAS STILL LEFT ACROSS THE PITCH, WHEN THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN USED TO

HELP AT PENS 3 AND 4 INSTEAD OF THE FANS DOING IT ALL.

Q54

IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

SOMETHING LIKE THIS WAS BOUND TO HAPPEN EVENTUALLY DUE TO THE DESIGN OF THE

GROUND.     THE DIVIDING FENCES BETWEEN THE PENS SHOULD NOT BE THERE AS THEY

PREVENT PEOPLE FROM BEING ABLE TO MOVE SIDEWAYS TO THE OUTER PENS.

NO ORGANISATION OR QUEUEING AT THE TURNSTILES.        NO STEWARDS OR SIGNS DIRECTING

 I D I D N ’T THINK THE POLICE GOT INVOLVED ENOUGH.   THEY WjERE SLOW TO REACT.

 I THINK THE YOUNG FANS DID VERY WELL.      I THINK A LOT OF THE POLICE WERE

 MORE INTENT ON CROWD CONTROL RATHER THAN ASSISTING WITH THE REAL PROBLEM

 AT HAND.     ANOTHER OBSERVATION I THINK IS THAT WHEN THERE ARE CROWDS LIKE

 THIS I FEEL THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE OFFICERS OR STEWARDS TRYING TO

 GET THE CROWD INTO LINE AND GET THEM TO HAVE THEIR TICKETS READY BEFORE

 THEY ENTERED THE TURNSTILE.


G19



 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I FEEL THAT THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE INFORMATION PUT THROUGH TO THE

 GROUND FROM OUTSIDE POLICE,    STATING THE NUMBERS OF FANS STILL ON ROUTE

 AND WILL NO DOUBT BE LATE ARRIVING WITH A VIEW TO PUTTING THE KICK OFF

 BACK A BIT.

 Q55

 DID YOU ATTEND THIS MATCH LAST YEAR?

 NO.

 THE HILLSBOROUGH SCRUTINY

 Please find attached correspondence from the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police,
 Richard Wells, the Attorney General, Rt Hon John Morris QC MP, and the Chairman of the
 Police Complaints Authority, Peter Moorhouse.


 Although there is little of substance in John Morris’ letter, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith may
 want to send a brief, personal reply. I have retained the attachments to Peter Moorhouse’s
 letter. These consist of the interim statements in respect of the complaints made - a list of the
 complainants is enclosed with this fax.




 Mike.

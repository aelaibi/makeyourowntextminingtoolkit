      THE PRESENT POSITION AT

             BARNSLEY PC

IN RELATION TO THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF

        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR
RBOOWEM3ATION 1



Barnsley Football Club has several viewing terraces at its ground which

are each self-contained with fixed capacities.              The existing safety

certificate does not, at this time, reflect the maximum capacities.




RB0CMMEM)ftTIC8N 2



The    calculation    for     maximum    capacities,        proposed     by   this

recoirmendation, has been     followed in determining a figure for each

terraced area as follows
                                                           Q 4


Pontefract Road End                       8,670

Brewery Stand                             7,500

Main Stand Terrace North                  3,315

Main Stand Terrace South                  3,145

Spion Kop                                 5,250        t    ^          ^ ^

(Pre Taylor, the capacity of the Spion Kop was 7,500, calculated upon a

density factor of 54 persons per 10 square metres.               In reducing that

figure by 15%, as recommended by Taylor, the Spion Kop area can safely

hold 6,375.     However, on the basis of the correlation between this

viewing area and the turnstiles serving it, only 5,250 spectators can

be accommodated on the Spion Kop within one hour - calculated at 750

per turnstile per hour.      (See Recommendation 19). )

The c e r t i f y i n g a u t h o r i t y are asked to re-examine the c a p acity of

Main S t a n d Terrace North.       On 17 October 1989 before the match between

3arnsley and Sheffield United, the club secretary at Barnsley PC closed off

access to the Terrace in the interests of the safety of those spectators

occupying the terrace.      The collated count from the turnstiles in that area

indicated that only 2402 spectators had entered - seme 913 below permitted cspecil
 recommendation   3



 (a) Barnsley PC has a mechanical counting system in respect of each

     turnstile.   The club undertook to check the counting mechanism of each

    turnstile at 15 minute intervals and to relay that information to the

    police control room at the ground.    To date, however, the club have not

    performed such checks in relation to the whole of the ground.    The club

    state that they are not in a position to do so, in the whole of the

    ground, because of the inadequate mechanical counting system on the

    turnstiles and insufficiency of staff.   The club did in fact experiment

    at one game with the Brewery Stand but the trial was unsuccessful.



    It is the police view that, unless the club meet the responsibility to

    count the spectators entering the ground, there is a real danger of

    this recommendation being breached.   It -is noted, that at a meeting of

    the Officer Working Party held on the 10 August 1989, the club

    undertook in the long term to install an electronic monitoring system.

   Notwithstanding this ccrnnitment, the Certifying Authority are asked to

   ensure immediate compliance with this recormendation.



(b) In the written agreement between South Yorkshire Police and Barnsley

   PC, (see Recommendation 4), the club undertook to close off the

   relevant turnstiles to prevent further access to any viewing area when

   its maximum capacity is about to be reached.   The Certifying Authority

   are asked to ensure that the club continue to meet their

   responsibilities in this regard.
RE0CM4ENDATI0N 4



A written agreement, setting out their respective responsibilities for

crowd     safety       and     control,    has      been    approved      and   signed    by

representatives of South Yorkshire Police and Barnsley PC.                         A copy of

that agreement is attached at document (6) .                  Whilst there have been no

variations to this agreement since it was signed by the club on the 22

August 1989, it is clear that the club are failing to comply with the

agreement. (See Recommendation 3 above).



RBOCtM QPanCM 5



Barnsley PC claim that there are            a number of stewards, deployed to each

side of the ground, whose               sole duty is to check crowd conditions in

those areas for possible overcrowding or distress.                   However, despite an

undertaking in the written agreement with the South Yorkshire Police,

and numerous subsequent requests made to the club secretary, the club

have    not     yet   provided a        plan of    the ground      indicating where      the

stewards, who have this responsibility, will be situated.



There are at each match, a number of stewards who appear to be under­

taking these responsibilities and the stewards have ready access to

police officers, authorised under Recamnendation 9 below, who each have

a radio giving them contact with the police control room.

RECCMMEMDftTIOM 6



All    police    officers      and   stewards     (not    just those authorised under

Recommendations        5     and   9)    are fully       briefed   with   regard    to   the

recognition of crowd densities and to the recognition of signs of
distress.     All officers and stewards have been issued, as an aide

memoire, with a laminated card vrtiich identifies the signs of distress.



Stewards are each issued with a copy of written instructions, by the

club, vrtiich detail their duties.        The chief stewards are each briefed

by a police inspector, before each match, on the responsibilities of

stewards    for crowd safety and control and their duties in case of

emergency evacuation.     The chief steward is expected to brief the other

stewards.



Police officers are briefed by a Senior police officer before each

match on their complementary responsibilities and duties.



The   South   Yorkshire   Police    are   presently   preparing    visual   aids,

designed to enable stewards and officers to recognise different crowd

densities, to recognise signs of distress, and to understand a little

more about crowd dynamics.         The aids will consist of a) Albums of

photographs depicting the various sections of Barnsley's ground with

different numbers of spectators therein, and b) A video tape film which

highlights    crowd densities,     distress and dynamics.         When completed

these photographs and film will be shown to the Safety of Sports Ground

Advisory Group.




The Certifying Authority are asked to ensure that the club undertakes

and continues to undertake its own reponsibilities for staff training

as set out in the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds - 'The Green Guide'

- paras, 26, 177, 195 and Annex B to the Guide.
RECCM4EHDATI0N 7



All gateways in radial or perimeter fences at Barnsley PC are painted

in the    international   safety colour - green - which is a different

colour frcm the rest of the fence.            Each is clearly identified by a

sign which proclaims 'Emergency Exit'.



RECOMEMPftTIOW 8



Only the Spion Kop end of the ground has a perimeter fence.             The three

gates in this perimeter fence have been removed and easily-broken tape

has been    placed across    the   openings    in the   fence.     This tape is

respected by the spectators, who have not made any attempts to invade

the.pitch, but would be no barrier in case of emergency.

RECOMEMPftTIOW 9



There is, in respect of each gateway in the perimeter fence, a police

officer    whose sole duty, whenever spectators are on the terrace, is to

decide whether or not       to   allow   spectators through      the   gateway to

relieve overcrowding.       Such police officers are to be identified by

means of a lime green tabard.       The officers are regularly deployed to

such duties and are therefore familiar to all stewards in that area,

(See Reccntnendation 5 above), are known by them to be authorised to

relieve overcrowding,     and are able to make radio contact with the

police control roan.




  RECCM4ENDATI0N 10



  A set of metal cutting equipment has been provided by Barnsley

  PC.      It has been agreed that, in case of need, an          employee of
the club trained in its use will be readily available to operate the

equipment.    An operative is deployed immediately adjacent to the police

control roan.       He is readily to hand should the need arise.



KBOOMBOanCMS 11 AND 12



It is understood that Barnsley Borough Council representatives on the

Safety of Sports Ground Advisory Group, have carried out an inspection

of all crush barriers.



KBCCM4EHDBTICMS 13 - 17



Safety     Certification    is   obviously    a    matter   for   Barnsley   Borough

Council.     At a meeting of the Officer Working Party on the 9 August

1989, it was decided to review the Safety Certificate in due course and

thereafter conduct an annual review of the certificate.



In respect     of    Recartnendation 17,     the   South Yorkshire Police await

notification of the constitution of the Advisory Group at Barnsley.               It

is the police view, however, that this Group should supplement, and not

replace, the existing Officer Working Group.



RECOMEMDftTICMS 18 AND 19



It is understood that each turnstile has been inspected and its

potential rate of flow measured.       The correlation between each

v i e w i n g area of the stadium and the turnstiles serving it

has been c a l c u l a t e d and,   as a result,       the capacity of the
Spion Cqp terrace has been reduced to 5250 because there are only

seven turnstiles to service this part of the ground.

Similarly the. capacity of the Brewery Stand terrace, has been reduced

to 7500 because there are only 10 turnstiles to service that part of

the ground.

RBCSEMBPBTICN 20



This   recommendation   is   linked directly with Recarmendation    3

above.    It is suggested that Barnsley PC do not have adequate

arrangements for monitoring the number of spectators entering the

ground and for limiting further access when capacities have been

aad are about to be reached.     The Certifying Authority are asked

to ensure compliance with this reccntnendation

RECCMMEM3ATICW 21



Barnsley PC currently have two CC TV cameras installed at the

ground and proposals to install a further two cameras.      A survey

of the installation has been carried out by a trained police CC

TV operator (no expert knowledge is professed) and his report is

attached at document (3).

For your further information the General Purposes Committee of

the Association c£ Chief Balioe QEficecs has convened a working group

to consider,   nationally,    the use of CC TV to promote public

safety at football grounds.     The group anticipate that it may be

possible to provide a 'package' of equipment for use as a test

for a common minimum standard of performance.      They will report

back in due course.
RECOMMENDATION 22



Signposting for spectators both inside and outside the ground has

been reviewed by the Barnsley               Borough Council Safety of Sports

Grounds     Advisory    Group.        The    police   are       satisfied with   the

signposting.



REOOMENDATIOSS 23 fitP 24



The South Yorkshire Police have had liaison with the club on the

question of ticketed matches.               The police are satisfied with the

arrangements and will ensure that the information on any ticket

corresponds    with their plans             for admitting spectators to the

ground.



REOCMMBJDATICN 25



At Barnsley PC there is no pre match entertainment and the club

do    not   recognise     any    supporters       club     as    representing    the

interests of the spectators in general.

RECOMMENDATION 26



The South Yorkshire Police Chief Constable nominated his Deputy,

Mr Peter Hayes, QPM, LLB, MA, to liaise with the management of

each football club and local authority concerned in respect of

the   safety   and     control   of    crowds.        Mr    Hayes   has   met   with

Directors and Secretaries of all five football league clubs in

the county, including Messrs Dennis and Spinks of Barnsley PC, on

24 August 1989.      He met with representatives of the four relevant
local   authorities,   including       Messrs    Harper     and   Jackson    of

Barnsley Borough Council on 18 September 1989.                A copy of the

minutes of that meeting are attached at document (7) .



RECXM4E3PATION 27



Both the Operational Order and the pre match briefing of all

officers on duty at each match at Barnsley PC alert officers to

the dangers of overcrowding, andr if any should be detected, of

taking immediate and appropriate steps to remedy it.



The   proposed   training   by   way   of     photographs   and   video     (see

Recommendation 6 above) will further emphasise these messages.



RECCMMENDanCM 28



The   operational   planning     for   each    match   at   Barnsley   PC    is

intended to enable the police to cope with forseeable patterns in

the arrival at, and departure frcm, any match by spectators.



The following scenarios are each catered for by way of police

contingency plans at Barnsley FC:-



a) All ticket, or otherwise restricted, matches.

b) Early arrival of spectators.

c) Unexpected and joint arrival of large numbers of spectators.

d) Individual section of ground approaching capacity.

e) Whole ground approaching capacity.

f) Late arrival of spectators.
g) Emergency opening of external gates           (or forcing of external

   gates), thereby allowing an influx of spectators.

h) Early departure of spectators frcm ground.

i) Emergency evacuation.



The police retain a reserve of officers at the ground to enable

rapid deployment to any difficulty which may arise inside or

outside the ground.



The certifying authority may, however, wish to satisfy themselves

that   the   club    have   made   contingency   plans   to   deal   with   a

situation where the available entrances might prove insufficient

to stop unduly large crowds gathering outside the ground.              Such

contingency plans are required by paragraph 46 of the Guide to

Safety at Sports Grounds - 'The Green Guide'.



RECXIWENDOTION 29



The police officer in ccrrmand at Barnsley PC is aware of the

option to delay kick-off, and discusses this matter, before each

game, with the match officials.         To enable instant contact with

the match referee when considering kick-off delay, the club have

installed a telephone link between the police control rocm and

the referee's roan.



RECXfrMEMDATION 30



There is available in the police control roan at Barnsley PC, the

results of all closed circuit television monitoring outside and
inside the ground.          Police officers who perform duty in the

control rocm are skilled in the use and interpretation of the

results of CC TV filming, and are to attend a CC TV operators

course which is run by the Greater Manchester Police.



RBOCMffiNDftTICN 31



There   are    sufficient    operators    employed   in the police

control rocm to deal with radio communications.                New police

cannunications      equipment    has     recently    been   installed    at

Barnsley PC's ground.



The equipment consists of a two-bay radio set with a spare

statical in case of radio failure on the primary station.                It

also has battery back-up in case of power failure.             This system

also gives operators in the control rocm priority over, and the

capacity to override, others using the same channel.



The police ground commander has the option of utilising, when

he   feels    it   necessary,   an   additional     radio   channel   which

provides     exclusive   connunication     between himself     and    other

sector ccnmanders.       This executive channel would be utilised in

an emergency when the primary channel may beccme overcrowded.



The police control rocm is purpose built and was only recently

completed.    The sound-proofing is adequate.



RECCMMEM3ATI0N 32



A survey of Barnsley PC's ground has identified sixteen key points
vdiere the police would wish to see dedicated telephone points to

enable direct communication with the police control rocm.



Attached, at document (4) , is a plan showing the location of those

points, together with an equipment specification prepared by the

South Yorkshire Police Communications Department.                   The Certifying

Authority are asked to oversee the installation of this telephone

system.




RECOMEJCIATICW 33



Inhere is in existence at Barnsley PC a public address system.

However, a survey of the system has identified the requirement for

six additional speakers, all of which would be utilised to address

spectators    waiting   to     gain    admission   to   the    ground.      It   is

reccmnended at the speakers be positioned as follows:-



a) Adjacent to Gate 12.

b) Adjacent to Gate 9.

c) Adjacent to Gate 8.

d) Adjacent to Gate 5.

e) Adjacent to Gate 3.

f) Adjacent to Gate 2.



The plan at (5)     shows the existing system and the proposed site

for new loud speakers.          The Certifying Authority are asked to

oversee the installation of any public address system to ensure

that   it   canplies    with    this    reccmnendation        and   that   it    is
effective.       In so doing, the Certifying Authority will wish to pay

regard, also, to paragraph 194 (iii) of the Guide to Safety at

Sports Grounds - 'The Green Guide' -                which lists the requirements

of an effective public address system.



It is noted that the club have equipped the public address system

with the facility to precede any messages with a loud signal.                      The

police   have      asked    the    club    to    ensure   that   this   facility    is

advertised in the club's programmes.



REOCMIEMDftTION 34



There is no illuminated advertising/score board at Barnsley PC.



A    series   of    hand    signals       for use    by   police   officers   in    an

emergency is presently being formulated, nationally, by a working

group of the Association of Chief Police Officers.                      The results

are awaited.

In advance of each match at Barnsley's ground, the South Yorkshire

Police forward to the South Yorkshire Fire and Ambulance Services

full details about the forthcoming event.



KBOCraEMDATION 37



Contingency plans for the arrival of emergency police, fire and

ambulance vehicles at Barnsley's ground, have been reviewed at a

meeting held at Barnsley Police Station on the 14 August 1989,

with the other emergency services.          The contingency plan prepared

as a result of that meeting forms part of the police operational

order.

The Certifying Authority will wish to consider whether the club

have taken adequate account of paragraph 29(v) of the Guide to

Safety   at   Sports   Grounds   -   'The   Green    Guide'    - which    tasks

management    with     the   responsibility    for     preparing      emergency

contingency    plans    in   consultation     with    the     three   emergency

services.

 Filling and Monitoring Terraces

 The Club will provide on the perimeter track a steward for each pen or

 terraced area during such times that there are spectators in that pen or

 terraced area.     The sole duty of these stewards, who will be in addition to

 any other stewards employed by The Club, will be to check crowd conditions in

 the pen or terraced area to which they are assigned for possible overcrowding

 or distress.     The Club will provide The Police with a plan of the ground

 showing where the stewards with this responsibility will be situated.




 The Police v i l l provide in respect of each gate in the perimeter fence (or

 g r o u p of gates if they are close together) police officers authorised to

 d e ci d e whether or not to allow spectators through a gate to relieve

 overcrowding.




 A l l police officers deployed at perimeter gates which will be kept fully open

 at all times w h en spectators are on the terraces, will be authorised as above.

 E a c h w i l l be in possession of a police radio in direct contact with police

 g r ou n d control and will be identifiable by a distinctive coloured tabard.




 T he stewards checking the crowd for overcrowding or distress will not be

/ issued with police radios but the police officers on the gates and perimeter

 t r a c k w i ll communicate to^ police ground control any relevant matter brought to

the i r attention by these stewards.




Cutting   Equipment

T h e C l u b will provide and make readily available suitable and sufficient

c u t t i n g equipment to permit the immediate removal of enough fencing to release

n u m b e r s of spectators if necessary.   This cutting equipment will be operated

    e m p l o ye e s of The Club who will be trained in its use.   The use of such

e q u i p m e n t will be at the discretion of the nominated senior police officer who

w i l l b e the officer in charge of policing the event.
riaison

Before each match both parties to this agreement will liaise in respect of the

following matters:-

      i)     the anticipated number of spectators expected having regard

             to the separate supporter groups;




      ii)    the method of crowd segregation (if any) intended to be used;




     iii)    any information in relation to crowd problems;




•'    iv)   ' the number and location of turnstiles to be made available

              to each group;




       v)    an estimation of the time it will take each group to pass

              through the turnstiles;




      iv)    where tickecs are used, that the information on those tickets

              corresponds with the planned arrangements for admitting

              spectators to the ground.

)
Postponement of kick-off is at the discretion of the police officer in command

at the ground.      It is therefore essential The Club provide a telephone link

between the referee's room and the police control room.




The Police have prepared contingency plans for the event of emergency services

being called to the ground.      These include routes of access,    rendezvous

points,     accessibility within the ground and routes of egress.     The Police will

liaise w i t h The Club concerning these arrangements whenever these plans are

amended     or as otherwise appropriate.
The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police has nominated his Deputy,

Mr Peter Hayes QPM LLB MA, as the Chief Officer with responsibility for

liaison with the management of each football club and local authority

concerned in respect of the safety and control of crowds.




Any variation of this agreement in respect of a particular match will be

agreed by the parties in advance in writing.

The Chairman opened the meeting by explaining that whilst local authorities
tend to act as a discrete organisation it is necessary for South Yorkshire
Police officers to serve throughout the Force area which includes five
football league clubs representing the four football league divisions.  There
ls therefore the need for some area of commonality.

The aim of this meeting therefore is two-fold.     First, to discuss areas of
com m o n interest and, second to strengthen the relationship of the South
Yorkshire Police with the four separate licensing authorities for football
league grounds in the area.

The Chairman then explained to the meeting the position of the South Yorkshire
Police subsequent to the Taylor Inquiry. He highlighted the various inquiries
and investigations that were taking place in relation to the incidents of
15"Ap r i l 1989.


Police Facilitation Team '

The Chairman pointed out that he was nominated by the Chief Constable to
oversee the implementation of the Taylor recommendations as far as the South
Yorkshire Police was concerned.  Of the 43 recommendations, 11 had to be in
place before 19 August.  The Chairman explained how the in-force
implementation team was constituted and how it functioned.  It was recorded
that each of the 11 recommendations had in fact been implemented before the
start of the football season and that written agreements with each of the five
Clubs were in being.

He explained that the centralised operation based on Headquarters, that was
n e cessary at first,- was now being increasingly delegated to the Divisional
responsibility to implement the remaining recommendations of Lord Justice
Taylor.
        The Chairman pointed out that so far our dealings with the various football
        clubs in the area had been very positive and he invited comment from local
        authority members on this fact.

        Mr Harper (Barnsley MBC) pointed out that at Barnsley most of the
        recommendations are already covered.  The Chairman pointed out that
        computerised turnstiles are an objective of Barnsley Football Club. Mr Harper
        agreed but pointed out that the Taylor recommendations allow for manual
        monitoring and that the Barnsley stance - that they were complying with the
        recommendations - was a sound one.

        The Chairman emphasised the need for both ourselves and local authorities to
        encourage Clubs to comply with ..safety requirements. Mr Harper agreed pointing
        out that often Clubs devote their resources to the football team to the
        detriment of their stadium.  Mr Harper suggested however that a conciliatory
        and co-operative approach to the football clubs is likely to reap greater
        rewards.

V   >   Mr Paxton made the point that he would not wish to see a dilution of the
        single contact arrangements that existed, with local authorities as that
        single contact, before the Taylor Report.  He pointed out that the South
        Yorkshire Police had necessarily been active in pursuing implementation of the
        Taylor recommendations and feared that the local authorities co-ordinating
        position may be overlooked.

        The Chairman thanked Mr Paxton for this point and agreed to discuss the
        process for future implementation at a. subsequent in-force implementation team
        m e et i n g when Mr Paxton's views would be taken into account.


        G r o u nd Safety Certificates

        The Chairman asked whether the agreements reached with football clubs should
        be included in the ground Safety Certificates.    Mr Paxton stated that
        Doncaster are now considering re-writing the Safety Certificate (in
        c o njunction with their Legal & Admin Department) to take account of matters
^       arising from the Taylor Report.

        N o n e of the other representatives offered a view about the status of Safety
        Certificates.

        Mr P a x t o n raised the question of ’advisory groups' and how they might
        influence licensing and certification.        The Chairman took up the subject of
        ad v i s o r y groups and asked the various local authority representatives how they
        f o re s a w the constitution of their group.   Would it be an extension of the
        e x isting officer working party or would it be something different, and in
        a d di t i o n to, that working party?

        M r P a x t o n and Mr Harper, representing Doncaster and Barnsley respectively, saw
        the advisory group as an additional group outside of the officer working party
        w h i c h would meet at infrequent but regular intervals under a neutral chairman
        w h o w o u l d then convey that group's views to the officer working party.

        M r W a r d (Sheffield City Council) pointed out that this matter amongst many
        o t he r s was not resolved.      He had submitted a report to members asking for
        d i r e c t i o n in certain areas.  The nature of the advisory group was one of those
        areas.          Mr Ward's personal view was that it may well be a two-tier structure
along the lines envisaged by Barnsley and Doncaster and pointed out that it
would be unfortunate if technical officers were out-voted by Club and
supporter members of such an advisory group.

Mr Crosby (Rotherham MBC) said that the officer working group in Rotherham had
always included a representative of the Club who might not necessarily be
invited to Meetings if the chairman of the working group felt it appropriate.

The position therefore is that Barnsley and Doncaster envisage the advisory
group as separate from the officer working group, Rotherham envisage it as an
extension of the officer working group and, Sheffield have yet to resolve the
natter.

Mr Harper asked if the Chairman could clear up the ambiguity with relation to
the intended constitution of the advisory group as far as the Tribunal members
were concerned.  The Chairman pointed out that an ACPO Sub-Committee on
Hooliganism at Sports Grounds is pursuing this question with the Treasury
Solicitors and the Chairman agreed to report back to the local authorities if
and when this is resolved.


Delegation of Licensing Authority

The Chairman raised this matter by pointing out that Mr Webster of the
Sheffield City Council had written to say that no individual officer
representing the Council had any authority to act without full Council
approval.

Mr Harper, representing the Planning Department at Barnsley MBC, stated that
all matters were officially delegated to his Department by the members there.

Mr Paxton of the Planning Department at Doncaster MBC, pointed out that
technical matters are delegated to the Director of Planning and procedural
matters to the Director of Legal & Admin Department.  He was hopeful that all
matters might become the responsibility of one Department.

Mr Crosby, representing the Environmental Health Department of Rotherham MBC,
pointed out that all powers are delegated to Environmental Health officers.

The Chairman's concern in this matter was that in the case of urgent need
there must be someone empowered to revoke or suspend the Safety Certificate as
required by the Safety at Sports Grounds Act.

Mr Ward (Sheffield C it y Council) stated that he had already appreciated the
need for genuine emergency powers and had flagged this need for members'
decision.

The representatives of Doncaster, Barnsley and Rotherham pointed out that
emergency powers are delegated to themselves.


Ambulance Dispute

The Chairman asked what action the licensing authorities intended to take in
the event of SYMAS being unable to provide an ambulance on stand-by at future
football matches.  Mr Paxton (Doncaster MBC) stated that this was an agenda
item for a meeting of the Authority next week although he did not anticipate
many future matches where the crowd would reach 5,000.
Hr Harper (Barnsley MBC) suggested the ambulance position would not make a lot
of difference in his mind and he would advise allowing the game to go ahead.
He went on to express the view that this recommendation was one of several in
the Taylor Report that, in his view, were unnecessary.

The counter view was expressed by Mr Paxton who thought it a very necessary
recommendation.

Mr Ward (Sheffield City Council) pointed out that in Sheffield it would be a
decision for members of the Council but his personal view was that in such a
situation where an ambulance could not be provided the Safety Certificate
would be revoked.

Mr Crosby (Rotherham MBC) pointed out that the need at Rotherham is marginal
w i t h crowds hovering around the 5,000 mark. He determined to look at each
individual match where this problem was likely to occur.


Concluding Remarks

The Chairman, in drawing the meeting to a close, thanked local authority
representatives for attending and asked if there was anything that the police
were doing that the local authorities would wish otherwise or anything that
the local authorities would like to see the police undertaking in relation to
the safety certification of football grounds.  None of the members expressed
a view.

Mr Paxton thanked the   Chairman for arranging   the meeting. He said     he felt
heartened by the fact   that there was so much   common ground      between     the various
local authorities and   the police.

The Chairman asked if the local authority representatives would like a meeting
to be arranged on a regular basis. Representatives of Doncaster, Sheffield
and Rotherham thought such a meeting annually would be very useful (July was
suggested as a most appropriate time). Mr Harper (Barnsley MBC) suggested he
saw no benefit in such meetings as the procedures in Rotherham, Sheffield and
Doncaster were of little concern to the safety certification of Barnsley
Football Club.




There being no further business the meeting closed at 3.30 pm.

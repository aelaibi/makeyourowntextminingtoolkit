     [SARD to 'top'n 'tail']

Lord Justice Taylor recognised in his final report into the
Hillsborough Stadium disaster, that there is no single solution
which would achieve total safety and cure all the problems of
crowd control and behaviour at football grounds. But he was
satisfied that seating does more to achieve these objectives than
any other single measure. He recommended that clubs in the first
and second divisions of the Football League should eliminate
standing accommodation before the start of the 1994-95 season,
and by August 1999 for clubs in the third and fourth divisions.
The government has accepted that recommendation, which is
consistent with the policies of FIFA and UEFA.

The Home Affairs Committee's report recommends that compulsory
seating proposals be re-examined in the case of smaller clubs.
However, there is no suggestion in the report that all seated
accommodation is not the way forward for clubs in the first and
second divisions. *

           * [Notts County was promoted to the 2nd Division at the
             end of last season; your S of S may wish to include
             here a word of personal support or congratulation.]


All seated accommodation will, we believe, be a major step
towards creating a better, safer environment in which all
spectators can enjoy the game. But there is no need for Notts
County, or any other league club, to provide more seats than the
number of spectators which it expects or hopes to accommodate,
even by 1994.

    FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL:   SAFETY 'H' COMMITTEE DRAFT

    I attach a copy of DOE's draft 'H' paper sent to us for
    consulation. I have annoted the draft in manuscript with
    comments and/or suggested charges which reflect my doubts about
    both the content and emphasis of the draft. All this has been
    rather hastily prepared.
    I have mounting concern about what is intended to be the local
    authority role on securing safety at football grounds. It seems
    to me that what DOE really want is to create a licensing
    authority which has powers to put into licences conditions which,
    if they conflict with local authority safety considerations,
    would over-ride the conditions of a safety certificate in order

•   to implement national membership. This begins to undermine the
    local authority role. It adds yet another agency to the list
    those who already have interests in safety enforcement. If the
    concern is over 'spoiling tactics' by local authorities
    preventing the introduction of national membership it is not only
    the safety certificate but the prohibition notice powers under
    S.10 of the 1975 Act (and to a lesser extent S.IO of the FPA
    1971) which also have to be over-ridden.     I told DOE a long time
    ago that any licensing provisions must not compromise safety
    certificates or prohibition notices. Assurances were given that
    there was no conflict.   (The ''bridges'' referred to in the Home
    Secretary's acceptance of option C seem to be of dwindling
    importance.) Incidentally the LFCDA, in their evidence to the
    Inquiry, want to have the power under S.IO of the 1975 Act, and
    advocate compulsory safety teams.

    It would be folly, in my opinion, for the new licensing body to
    be able to stipulate, for example, segregated areas unless the
    stipulation took account of the consequences of ingress/egress
    routes, exits, means of escape etc, not only for that particular
    area but also for adjacent parts of the ground. These are (or
    should be) issues dealt with in the safety certificate to
    determine the ''safe'' occupancy.
    Paragraph 7 of the draft seems unnecessary. If local authorities
    are to shed their responsibilities for safety, which is the
    implication of the criticisms quoted,it would be a radical
    departure from the present arrangements. This, we are told;is
    not intended.
    The ideas for all seated accommodation are not quite what I had
    understood them to be. I thought the government were to decide
    which stadia; the NDPB (if created) would enforce any directive.
    The enforcement would be either to ensure the local authority
    were administering the directive properly or directly on the club
    depending upon the role of the new body.  (The latter cuts right
    across the present role of the local authority who have a duty to
    enforce the 1975 Act's provisions.)
^ ^ h a t is igow proposed seems to be for the NDPB to decide which
   stadia, having the Home Secretary in the thankless position* of
   having to decide whether or not to accept the recommendation.
 The draft paper's link with the Hillsborough Inquiry is to my
 mind too tenuous and shoudl be made clearer.

        6.      Existing safety legislation does not specifically provide
        for the local authorities role in issuing safety certificates to
        be monitored nor does it empower the Home Secretary to take an
        enforcement role in respect of any fa ct ion s he_may Issue about
        the terms and conditions of safety certificates.

consistency of approach and              ijifljJroved monitoring.               The Sunday
Times ran a feature on                        Xclaiming that the enforcement
of legislation covering safety at sports grounds was inadequate.
The same article repots a Football League Club chairman denying
the need for his c^ub to deal with fiv^ separate agencies on
safety     issues    - ./the    local    authority,         the       police,    the    fire

justices.     H© is quoted as saying "they overlap each other, they
contxadicV^each other and they slow up everything.....We need
the Government to,pull them into,one agency".


 8.      Thus far in the passage of the Bill we have argued that
 there is no reason why the              local.- authorities should not work
 together with the licensing authority in dealing with safety
 certificates and the requirements of the national membership

 poteosaal conflict in this area.              The Hillsborough disaster, and
 the unsubstantiated assertions that the membership scheme "would
 have made it worse", have increased the risk that a small number
 of local authorities might seek to use their ^ole as "safety
                                                                  I                             I

9.     It is against this background that the Home. Secretary and
I have considered how, in the context of the relationship between
the local authorities and the licensing authority, we might best
deal with any amendments to legislation on safety which Lord
Justice Taylor may recommend.     My ia-t-t-p-   •30 May-1La— the Home
Secretary identified three options:-


       A.       maintain the existing role of lbcal authorities as
        "safety authorities" under the Safety of Sports Grounds
        Act and run alongside them a separate| licensing authority
        under the Football Spectators Bill, wjith a procedure for
        resolving disputes between them;


        B.   taka away local authorities' safejty role in relation
        to designated    football grounds    and Ifive   it   to   a new
        national safety authority, for which we would provide in
        the Football    Spectators Bill and whkch would        also be
        responsible for the licensing functions already In the
        Bill?


        C.      give the Bill’s licensing authority the additional
        task of ensuring that local authorities! were carrying out
        their responsibilities under the Safety! of Sports Grounds
        Act in' such a way as to achieve a consistent standard of
        safety at designated football grounds.

The status of the licensing am-hr^-n-y



12.      as   to defining the nature of the licensing authority,
there are three alternatives:-
                   I




            - —        the authority p„ t of       ^    Footfcau   Ma<_berehip

   All seater stadia


   15.   • Following the Hillsborough disaster, we announced that we
                                                                   jt'
   shared the view of many in football that there should be a move
   to all seater stadia.             I have discussed this issue with the
    football authorities and made clear to them that it is not our
    intention     that    there     should   blanket      change   to   ell   seated
    accommodation.        The move to all seating would be appropriate for
    the major     clubs,     which   ones    would   be    a matter     for   further
    discussion,     and    change    would   need    to   be   phased   in    at   the
    designated clubs.        The cost would be for football.            It is clear
    that there is no consensus on the merit of all seater stadia
    within football -and there could be opposition to the proposal
    from individual clubs.


    16.    The Home Secretary and 1 agree that the move to all seated

    charged to football clubs for the issue of licences.              1 do not
    propose that we should seek to provide for the costs of the
    licensing authority in respect of its safety functions to be
    recovered in this way.       Receipts from fees by the authority would
    be treated as revenue eurrenderable to the Consolidated Fund and
    the authority's expenses would be met by grant in aid for which
    we would need to seek PBS cover.


        18.      The proposal to extend the licensing authority1s functions
        requires a revision of the estimated cost to public funds given
        in my letter of 28 September seeking the Committee's approval to
        Part I of the Bill.    The annual salary and ancillary costs of the
        authority would be some £100,000, the inspectorate £360,000 and
        the administrative support team £             .   Accommodation would
        cost some £            a year, travelling and subsistence £40,000,
        and a possible consultancy budget, to cover the need to buy in
        any additional expertise not available to the inspection teams
        £30,000 a year.     This gives an annual cost to public funds of
        some £

Form of the amendment to the Football Spectators Bi11


20.    To deflect any possible criticism that we were pre-empting
the Taylor inquiry, I propose that we should take an enabling
power in the Bill to give the licensing authority the proposed
extended powers in respect of safety.   As the Home Secretary has
commented, we could present this as getting ourselves into the
position of being able to implement Taylor if he made such a
recommendation and we thought the case for it was right.
THE LICENSING AUTHORITY AND ITS INSPECTORATE


1.      In   order   to    carry    out     its    functions     the    licensing
authority would need to have an inspectorate.                 The Home Secretary
has pointed out that there would be strong misgivings by the
Association of Chief Police Officers and the Chief and Assistant
Chief Fire Officers' Association at the idea that the professional
competence of the police and fire services in making their input
into the content of individual             safety certificates should be
supervised by the licensing authority.              To secure the confidence
of interested parties both the authority and its inspectorate
will therefore need to include suitable people from the police
and   fire services.       We also think that the engineering and
building     professions    would    have     to    be    represented     on   the
authority and the inspectorate teams since both make an essential
contribution to the content of safety certificates.


2.      I    therefore propose      that     a    small   licensing     authority
should be set up on which the interests 1 have identified should
be represented under a lay chairman. Appointments would be at the
level   of   retired   Chief   Constable          and   his   equivalent.      The
inspectorate would comprise of teams of inspectors, and I think
we would require three teams or their part time equivalent, on
which the same interests would be represented.                   Appointments to
the inspectorate would be at Chief Superintendent/level.


3.      The team of inspectors could be expected to spend some 4
days on a ground inspection, including preliminary work on plans
and the safety certificates, reappraisal and report in the light
of the on site inspection and travelling.               We envisage      that
grounds should be inspected annually but that the authority would
have discretion about the nature and extent of each inspection.
It may decide that a full Inspection is only required at less
frequent intervals say every two or three years and in the light
of   physical   changes   to   the   ground.     The   authority   and   its
inspectorate would require a small,            say 5 man,   administrative
support team.

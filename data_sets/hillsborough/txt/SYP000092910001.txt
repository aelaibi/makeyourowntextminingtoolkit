             about 10.15 am (1015).             Our patrol area was as follows.                        Hillsborough

             Corner including Holme L a n e „ Bradfield Rd, Middlewood Rd as far as

             supervision of the area including pubs and also to keep an eye on

             traffic build up.             Right from the time we started patrol we found that

             pumerous fans of both clubs were already in t-He /area a nd large groups
                                                                  / / / ’')

attempting to gain access to the Beehive on DykesHall Rd although the

pub was closed a nd displaying notices to that effect they were

reluctant to leave.     The landlord came out to us and asked if we would

move them on as he was apprehensive what would happen should he let

them in.     We also received a call via ground radio regarding a

complaint of drunks    causing trouble.   Wads ley Lane M a r l e d iffe Rd and

on arrival    large number of Liverpool   supporters gathered outside an

off licence at this location bottles and empty cans strewn all over

pavement and road, although all were drinking and were happy no

trouble was being /caused at this time.      We also attended at the Royal

Hotel - Penistojfe/Rd/^ Bradfield Rd where it was reported fans were

smashing th                The first police vehicle to arrive had a

bottle thrown at it.     On our arrival we assisted to empty the pub and

to move a large crowd of up to 200 fans away from the pub.          The whole

of the area at the front was covered in broken glasses,        bottles and

empty beer ca ns , this also spread across the road and all over a

grassed area opposite.     The apparent   reason for t h ^ damage   inside the

pub was that they had run out of drink.       Throy^nout our patrol up

until about 2.45 pm (1445) we toured the a/ea all pubs that were open

were   packed and many were standing outride the pubs all the off

licence shops in the area were also packed with fans buying drink.

Hundreds were walking the streets drinking from cans and bottles and

we saw that a lot of these fans were carrying unopened bottles etc.

Under normal    circumstances when engaged on football duties       it is

practice when anything like this    is seen to inform by radio the

officers at the turnstiles that a drunk or a person carrying alcohol

is approaching a description is passed and appropriate action taken

when the person tries to enter the ground.       On this occasion because

of the large numbers of parsons affected b y , and carrying drink it was

impossible to do this.
                                                                                                        PAG E        3
                                                                                                        S3717

Our    brief was to take a meal               at N i a g a r a at 3 pm (1300).              We were to be

in and out as soon as possible                   to a l l o w the other dog              handlers       to

meal.     I left the        patrol      area at a bout £ .4 5         pm (1445)          and at that time

it was noticeable           that the      pubs were still           full.         The    last    checked was

the Free Masons Utalkley Lane and the re were                         still       large    numbers

standing     outside      drinking.           There were also         still a lot of fans making

their way along M i d d l e w o o d Rd towards              the ground and as said

p reviously a lot of these were                  car ryi ng drink.          To get to Niag a r a             I

drove along P e n i s t o n e Rd.         One    reason for this was that                  I could hear

on the radio that L e p p i n g s Lane was still                   busy.      Penistone R o a d ,

however     the H o p end was          clear of fans        it was     very quiet and a l 1

e ntrances to the ground were                  clear.      W h i 1st t r a v e l 1 ing    into Niag a r a        I

heard m e s s a g e s on the         personal    radio     indi eating that             large    numbers of

fans were still          in L e p pings L a n e .       I heard m e s s a g e s     sending        further

m o u n t e d officers    to that end and also gather serials                       of officers who

had been on standby.                 I also    heard a M n e s s ^ g e from someone             outside      the

ground    requesting        that the kick          o/f b e/de l a y e d    in order        to get the

Liverpool      fans     in and try to a/1 e v ia / i s / s one        pushi ng and         c r ushi ng .

S h o r t l y after    I heard a r e p b y      t hat^Xhe a u t h o r i t i e s    presu m a b l y F A and

Hi 11sborough Staff           had refused this           re^ue^%          I then heard that

problems were be i ng caused at one of the                       large     gates be cause            people

were    pushi ng      it and tryi ng to force            entry to the ground.                   I then heard

a message      requesting           the gate be opened          in o rder to prevent serious

i njury or d eath as          people were        still     pushi ng the gate and                it a p p e a r e d

likely they w ould fetch that gate and the wall                            down.         I then went off

at Niagara.

At about 3.2 0 - 3 . 2 5 pm (1520)               (1525)     Insp PHEONIX           came    into Niag a r a

and a sked all        those on meal           to turn out and go to thei r after m atch

points as      it a p p e a r e d    likely the game w ould be ended early.                         Our after

                                                                                                                  S3717

               a message        came over      for all       dog handlers to go to the ground as

               trouble was         t h r e a t e n e d from the N o t t i n g h a m fans.   We    returned to the

               ground,     to the L e p p i n g s Lane end,           but before we got          inside we were

               stopped by Insp PHEO N I X and told to                   remain    in L e p p i n g s Lane   to

               s upervise       d i s p e r s i o n of the   crowds and facilitate          free access          for

               ambulances        fire    engines an d other           eme r g e n c y services.    This we did

               until    the ground had emptied.

               W hat was very noticeable               during this time          in Leppings Lane was the

               fact that amon g s t         the first        lot of people to leave the ground and

               p resumably those who had been last                     in and at the back were a large

               number who were           still    the worse for drink.             They were all

               u n d e r s t a n d a b l y upset but their behaviour w hich             included using obscene

               language        shouting     t h r e a tening and spitting at Police O f f i c e r s was

               o bv i o u s l y due to their        being a f f e c t e d by alcohol.        Those    that       came out

               later after         the game had been o f f i c i a l l y a b a n d o n e d were      totally

               different,        they too were upset and a n g r y but did not                    cause the scenes

               like the first           lot had done.         My own      feelings     outside     the ground were

               of deep shock and also a fear                  that a      large scale       public order

               s i t uation     could arise       outside      the ground because of the             large number

               of those        still a f f e c t e d by drink

               I have wo r k e d numerous           football        matcfie//at®  this ground before and                I

               did in fact work           the same game         l^x     y a r Ltyfrx it was very q u i e t .            11

               was very n o ticeable however this year                     that a lot more        drink was           being

               consumed and also            being    carried.

^                    ‘far as    CQfrilTluni cations are      concerned        I had no trouble with the                radio

               and    it wo r k e d ok throughout.            Whilst     the    incident was at       its height

               however,        it was obvious        that the        control    room was    swamped with

               me s sages and several            unavoi d a b l e    delays    in responding      to m e s s a g e s were

    ^   SI ^   noticed,        however    given the grav i t y and e n o rmity of the s i t u a t i o n                and

    horses      were       in the open ar^a         between the              railings and stopping               people

    entering      the area          im m e d i a t e l y before     the turnstiles as                that was also

    pa c kea.

    It a pp e a r e d to me that            the Police       had       lost    their      power      to get     people

    into orderly queues                to d i r ect/control            the    crowd.

    At .this time of observation,                    I was       now    in the area marked on the map.

    I could see            on the    corner     of the W S tand              (marked),       a sign showing S

    Stand;      my ticket was           for   the S S tand and               I therefore         took       it that       I

    needed      to go through the             gates where           the horses were and along                    the

    side    of the W Stand             to gain access            to the S Stand.               The     reason    I had a

    ticket      for the S S ta n d was my son                           had    purchased them off a person

    i.ri the                            pub   in                 the W e d n e s d a y / T h u r s d a y    before    the

    match.                                                   1

    F r o m where      I     was stood,        I could see no improvement                    in the        situation          in

    front of the             turnstiles;         there were no people               going through the

    turnstiles. We stood              iulhis       are^, for/]iijout ^3/4. minuteyr whe n a                     Police

and    I was      frightened.            The act i o n of the                             had no constructive

result 5 the s it ua t i o n was             not   imp raj*     i.        I decided therefore                to seek-

a no t h e r   entry     point.

We then w ith d i f f i cu lt y           pushed our way back                 into the        road;        I could

still      see    fans       coming    towards     the turnstiles;                it would        now be about

2.45     pm     <1445 hrs).           I w a l ke d across       the       road,    with no        restriction,

and asked the P o l i c e m a n and P o l i c e w o m a n             if there was another                   entry

point      for the S Stand;              they directed me to go                   through the directors

car    park via Penis'tone Rd.

From     the     time of the P o l i c e ma n on horseback                    turning,        the m ood of the

immediate         crowd changed;             it was    this a c t i o n which            in my opinion          caused

it.      Whilst        I was    in the area,          there were           no a n n o u n c e m e n t s    to the

crowd,         there was       facil i t y over       the    tannoy system over the                       turnstiles

to do this.             We    ran ar o u n d the Ground;             it took about            five minutes           for

us to      reach the turnstile                block 23--H8; on our                journey there was             no

q u e ueing      outside       the    turnstiles       gaining access               to the S S t a n d or to

the S p i o n Kop        (marked on map).              We went        straight         through the

turnstile, got d i re ct io n from stewards                          inside and went              up to our

seats, G a ng wa y 1, Row                                                 lere we found them

occupied;         two    people       stated that          tp^y were        their      seats and showed us

du plicate        tickets.           The t i c ke t ^ r h a d been        issued by post w hich they

st a t e d had been           'lost"     and/auplicates             issued.        We d i d n ’t argue about

the    seats and went            and/sat at the front                 of the stand            in the gang w a y to

await a s t e w a r d ’s             rival    to sort out           the    situation.

We a r ri v e d    inside       the stand at about              the       same    time as the             players    came

out    onto      the    pitch,       about £ .50      pm    (1450 h r s ) . / l        could see           the Pens

behind the         goal       (3 and 4) were e x t r e m e l y            packed;      the    people        inside

these areas            had no free d o m of movement, /there was                         no swaying,          it was

             spaces      - the terracing was                     visible     in Pen 7.

             The      game    then kicked off.                   Wi t h i n seconds        I saw             climbing        over

             from Pen 3 into 2, also                       over the fencing                ,o the     pitch,       The

             s i tu at io n of a few             people         comjfng          the fencing          de v e l o p e d quickly

             stand.

             In the       initial          instance        of    people     coming     over    the fence,        I formed         the

             opin i o n that         they were            trying      to   ’escape",       not    cause trouble. The

             P ol ic e / s t e w a r d s    d i d n ’t    seem to have any           c o m p rehension of what was

             going      on.      It was after              a few minutes         that      it was     obviqus      by the

             numbers         of people         coming       over     the top meant          sornethi nc^was        d ra st i c a l l y

             wrong;       I could see            people         being drag g e d .over        the t o^i of the fence and

             this      time     the game had              been stopped;        there wesfl now numerous                  people     on

             the      pitch;     I could see              that attempts        to    pul. / down the fencing were                   not

             being met with m uch success.                           The    scene    bed    now d e v eloped       into a lot

             of    people       doing m ou t h to m outh and                 p e o e    being      carried on boardings.

             A number         of the        people        being     pulled j o u t   of Pen 3 were          partly       clothed;

             I saw one man on the                   pitch        in hi stride r p a n t s ; he was         ob v i o u s l y dead.

             (Marked on map).                  I saw a P o l i ce ma n        carrying a lad about               10 - 14 years

             in a full Liverpool                  t r a c k s u i t X the P o l i c e m a n was     crying and the           lad

             was      lifeless.            The P o l i c e m a / came from the are a behind the goals.                              The
'K/Scrf’f'
&£a>n<-      lad on the ground                 in his lander pants was white,                    male,     15 - 20 years.

             There was a well                b ui lt jm a.r\ in his        forty/fifties,           being     carried on a

             board;       his    body was          IJTfeless.         I c a n ’t describe          the    people    further.

             By now the          time was about 3.45                  pm    (1545 hrs)        and we decided to             leave

             the G r o un d of our own accord.

             Fr o m    the    time     people       star t e d to         come over     the f e n c ^ t h e r e     were     no

kick-off           there seemed      to be a lack of Police                    pj^g^i^rre--j^r'the area

a r o u n d the Pens        1 — 6,    and once the scenjr^sta^JjrSTa to develop there was

a lack of organisation.                    Pol i c e m enid^gXffot            in the area       in numbers

b y 7 they d i d n ’t seem to             compn^nend the situation.                      If I was able           to

see and u nd e r s t a n d the se riousness                 of the        situation,         it should         be that

the    people        in the Control          box should have also seen                    it.

I w o u l d wish to make            the    following        obs e r v a t i o n s about what         took       places

F i r s t l y we     passed a number          of Police          cars,      P o l i c e m e n on the way to the

en    route        to the Gr o u n d and      inform       people at          the Ground of the               numbers/

t irne s people are           g o i n g t oa r r i v e , t h us giving            Police m e n c ontrolli n g

t urnstiles          some   idea of what          to expect.             This should help to eliminate

t u rnstile         congestion.        The    c om m u n i c a t i o n of the s i tuation outside,

then fed. by the observing Officers,                          can then         if necessary delay               the

start      to the game.           Secondly,         if the       commu n i c a t i o n had been better as

outlined,           then the     b u i ld-up of s upporters                 in Leppings Ln w ould              not

s i t u at i o n    it did;    it was obvious             that     c«fptro 1 had completely               broken

    Dear Sir


   RE SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS


   On the 4 November 1989 you visited the National Stadium at Cardiff to look at the
   measures adopted in the interests of crowd safety.       During your visit you had the
   opportunity to speak w i t h both the W e l s h Rugby Union and members of the Local
   Authority Working Party.

   Cardiff City Council, as the "Building Authority", has recognised the important role
   that can be taken by Building Control and consequently my department is represented
   on the w o r ki ng party. In their dealings w i t h the enforcement of the Building
   Regulations building control officers have to deal with similar problems to those
   experienced in sports grounds; structural matters, structural fire precautions,
   means of escape, designs of stairways etc and access for the disabled.          They
   therefore have sufficient experience to make a contribution to the standard of
   safety at sports grounds and stadia.

    In May 1989 the A ss oc ia ti o n of District Councils invited local authorities to
    comment upon certain aspects to enable the ADC to write to yourself.   Enclosed with
    this letter is a copy of the comments sent by this authority.

   Since this letter was drafted my Building Control Division has been asked, both by
   other local authorities and designers, to comment upon grounds outside this area.     I
   am therefore of the opinion that ground safety standards w o u l d benefit from the
   establishment of regional worki n g parties.        Such w o rk i ng parties could be
   constituted of officers who have regular dealings with sports grounds together with
   representatives from other authorities as required.   I believe that this arrangement
   would lead to an overall improvement of standards within a region.     The inclusion of
   building control within any working party is I believe essential.        This should be
   clearly recommended in any guidance d oc uments.


                                                                                                        Local Authority
                                                       Continued.../                            BUILDING
                                                                                                CONTROL
A n extension of this proposal would be for the regions to liaise wi th each other.
You may be aware that a similar system already exists for the national type approval
of new housing and certain small commercial/industrial buildings.   This is operated
by a confederation of local authorities who represent regional consortia.   Although
some w e r e in existence, many consortia we re formed to tackle the prospect of
competition in building control from the private sector.

In respect of guidance publications such as the "Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds"
consideration is given to the provision of reasonable standards.

However the provisions should be regarded by the Club /g ro un d ma n a g e m e n t as the
  andards below which they should never drop and not as the standards they seek to


• hieve.

I appreciate that these comments m a y be too late for your con si de r at io n in the
preparation of your final report.   In conclusion I would like to thank you for the
courtesy extended to myself and my officers during your visit on the 4 November 1989
and await the publication of your final report.



Yours faithfully

Dear Sir


I am w ritin g in reply to your l a t t e r dated 31st May 1989 and apologise f o r tha
delay.               &

As you »ra aware, county councils ara the e n f o r c i n g a u t h o r i t y for the s a f e t y of
sp orts grounds l e g i s l a t i o n . Under t h i s l e g i s l a t i o n th e y ar e required to c o n s u l t
with the Building A u t h o r i t y , i . e . tha D i s t r i c t A u th o r ity , with p a r t i c u l a r
reference to Building Control m a t t e r s . The Building Authority is p a r t of a l o c a l
Working Group v?ith the County Council and tha P o l i c e , &nd as t h i s f u n c ti o n i s
administered by lha City Council's D irecto r of Environmental S er v ic e s, ha i s
represented on tha Working Party by tha Chief Building Control O f f i c e r or his
ncsi-fi^Q*

In respect of the f i t t e r s r?.issd by th£ ADC I would coataant as f o l l o w s :

Public sa fety aL s p o r t s grounds should ba 'c onsider ed from two a s p e c t s , v i z :

l.   Safety within the ground, and

2.   Safety outside and around the ground.

In looking at both a s p e c ts i t is important to              re a lise this interaction.

The sa fe ty of people w i th in the ground should be the predominant r e s p o n s i b i l i t y of
the ground management, as they in v i te the pu blic to a t te n d and should ensure t h e i r
s a fa t y . Any f a i l u r e t o do so au st be promptly and p r o f e s s i o n a l l y d e a l t viLh by tha
enforcing a u t h o r i t i e s .

Alcohol is an enduring problem at e v e n ts , and i t s s a l e in tha v i c i n i t y of th*
ground, and consumption p r i o r to the end of the event should be p r o h i b i t e d . I t i s
f e l t that aa a consequence, crowd behaviour vould s u b s t a n t i a l l y improve. A fter the
main event, the s e rv ic e of alcohol in r e c e p tio n areas could be resumed, thus
e n ticin g psjopla to remain and reducing tha rush to leave following an event .
As fo o tb a ll and rugby sp e c ta c le s u sually comprise only tho o&e'event, there i®
usually a rush of spectators prior to tha k ic k - o f f , and i t i s therefore f e l t that
pre-event and post-event sp e c ta c le s shou.ld be organised» to deduce to a minimum
*ny rush.

Access points should be located a t regular points around the outer perimeter of the
stadia to allow patrons to enter by c lo s e ly segregated means to the seated area of
th e ir choice; escape gates should be situated p a r a lle l to the t u r n s t ile entry; and
a lte r n a tiv e e x i t s from the stadium by means of in tern al ga tes should always be
a v a ila b le . Exit roads should be located to the rear of the stands to f a c i l i t a t e
e x it from the stadium and g iv in g access with the minimum of delay. The stands
should a ls o provide f a c i l i t i e s for disabled persons to be ifccoaoodated at l e v e l s
other than at ground l e v e l .

Each t u r n s tile of entry point should be capable of recording the number of
s p t y ^ i o r s entering the stadium even during a rush when entry by way of channelling
baJW ete i s often used. I t i s e s s e n t i a l that the ground or any other area i s not
f i l l e d to excess- Once in sid e the stadium a l l spectators should have a seat*
although areas could be se t a sid e where patrons can stand together for to support
th e ir teats- Segregation i s necessary at some ev en ts, p a r tic u la r ly where so
considered by tha P o lic e , and provision should be made to include space between
rival sp ectators. Escape i s paramount and as in d icated , patrons arriving e a r l i e r
should have the a b i l i t y to leave v ia the way in which they entered the ground, with
a ltern a tiv e routes within the stadium and onto the f i e l d being provided.

I t is often necessary to enclo.se some areas and these should have adequate
provision of opening gate? under police/stew ard control to ensure that escape e t c
i s not i m p e d e d P u b l i c address systems should bs s a t i s f a c t o r y , and the
es tablishm ent of an I n c i d e n t Room under p o l i c e / f i r e a u t h o r i t y c o n tr o l i s e s s e n t i a l .
Tha Room' should ba equipped w ith TV monitor s e t s p roviding u p - t o - d a t e information
to tha c o n t r o l l e r in raspect of c ar park/coach park a r e a s , approach to the stadium,
entry p o i n t s , a i l s e c to rs of tha crowd including e n t r y and e x i t r o u t e s , and i t
should be linked to a public address system capable of ad d ressin g l o c a l crowd
problem*.                             ,



Signage i s e s s e n t i a l , not only in the s t a d i a , but a l s o on the approach and e x i t
r o u te s. F i r s t Aid posts should be conveniently s i t u a t e d a t various p a r t s of the
ground and at various l e v e l s . Stewards should be of the hig h es t standard and they
should be provided with s e a t s and f i n a n c i a l reward, and p ro perly t r a i n e d . Building
Regulation?"should ina&st,, tfc&i s t a d i a ace tioti-combuatibl®- t f c c w g a w t %-q Clasfr- 0
surface spread of flame and tha r e g u la ti o n s should be amended accordingly with
p a r t i c u l a r account being taken of the Popplewell Report -

The l o catio n of major s t a d i a w it h i n r e s i d e n t i a l areas w i l l cause problems of
t r a f f i c congestion and lo s s of r e s i d e n t i a l amenity. I t i s p a r t l y for these reasons
th a t Leckwith has been chosen as the s i t e f o r the new C a rd if f a t h l e t i c s stadium and
ther e has been recent press p u b l i c i t y given to the s u g g e stio n th a t the main
f o o t b a l l and rugby grounds in C a rd if f would be b e n e f i c i a l l y located elsewhere. The
other advantages given f o r tha use of o u tl ying s i t e s a r e improved public i a f e t y and
f i n a n c i a l b e n e f it accruing from the redevelopment of e x i s t i n g s t a d i a which are
ge n e r a lly in prims l o c a t i o n s .

with regard to s t a d i a in town or c i t y c e n t r e s , for major ev ents these w i l l cause
some l o c a l t r a f f i c c on ges tio n, and w i l l p rejud ice r e s i d e n t i a l am enities in inner
housing areas as a r e s u l t of car parking. However, they w i l l in gen eral be located
a t the focal point of p ubli c t r a n s p o r t systems, and hence ace l i k e l y to gen er ate
f a r l e s s car movements than those on outlying s i t e s . They ar e th e r e fo r e l i k e l y to
generate l e s s t r a f f i c congestion on the highway network g e n e r a l l y , and require l a s s
public investment in highway i n f r a s t r u c t u r e .

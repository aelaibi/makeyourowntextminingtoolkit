                INCIDENT AT HILLSBOROUGH FO                   3HOUND r SHbi- i- ii~.LD ON

                SATURDAY„ 15TH APRIL 1989=



                With reference to recent           correspondence      I am submitting the self

                written' account of my actions 1 5 .0 4 .8 9 .-

                "I.             I came on duty that day at 0830 am.

                S.              I was responsible to PS Hodgett of E 1 .

                3.              I was deployed to tunstiles on the South              Stand,      along with

                                other officers.      The   intention was to take over supervision

                                of the whole South Stand area after 1500. h r s .              This,    however

                                did not take place.        Once    it became    clear what had happened

                                I made my way to the pitch itself in order to assist free

                                mov*ement, of emergency vehi c 1 es and pe rsonne 1 .          Furt he r to

                                this     I joined the line of officers forming a cordon along

                                the centre of the pitch because at one stage a clash between
    d                           fans appeared likely.        Once the match had been cancelled I .

                                was di r e ct ed t o Peni s tons Road to ass ist t raf f i c di re ct ion

                                At the time of the incident          I saw many confused and angry

                                people, mostly Liverpool          supporters.     Their anger was
                                                                                 PAGE
                                                                                 R259

                     directed at the Police and some were being verbally abusive

                    ’Some were clearly drunk.

         3n         In response to this   I tried to help these   people as best

                     I could and to calm them down.

         6.         The mood of' the Liverpool   fans was very angry and upset.

                    Many were very aggressive.

         7.         I did not see any stewards   inside the ground that I can

                     remember.;.

         S.         I was not equipped with a personal     radio and therefore    I

                    cannot   comment'.'on any breakdown in transmissions.

         9.         At no time did I handle any dead bodies.

         10.        Once   I realised what had happened,   I was very upset.     I was

                    also worried that the Liverpool    fans would start fighting

                    as their behaviour was very aggressive.

         11 was c 1ear to me that some Li ve r poo 1 supporters   were also ve ry

         drunk,.

obviously           very         drunk       as       he    had       to    be     supported                   by    his      friends           as    he

continually asking                    for       spare          tickets.

When      we     reached          the L e p p i n g s          Lane      en d    of       the     ground           there         was       a    larg e

for    turnstiles             by     th e      fans.

not    in      possession            of     tickets            and    they       did       pose        a    problem,             because           I

could       only advise              them       to       leve     the     queue           and     once          off    the       bridge          I do

not    know where             they went.                  At    this      t i me      I remember                 looking          b a ck

towards          the    ground and              seeing/a             number          of    youths           actually             on    top       of

immediately             made       their        way across               to     the       what        was       by n o w a v e r y              l a r ge

outside          Leppings          Lane        to    the       ground         control            inside          were       made       to       delay

was    going       to    be 3 . 1 3         pm,      to    the       point       of m y s e l f            telling          a    number          of

supporters               that      this        was       so.

Then      all       at    once         I c an       re c a l l      o      g         push a nd            seeing          the    l a r ge

section          of      it,      surging           through.              I was          unaware          of a n y        other       gates

being      o p e n e d at          t h is      tim e .         All       of a s u d d e n           it w e n t       quiet       where       we

were      and       officers            l o o k e d at         each       other          in d i s b e l i e f        at    what       they     had

just      witnessed,               some        officers             were        very       shaken         and    some       stated          that

they      feared          at      po i nts      for       people          lives.

Just      as    this was               happening              a message             came       ov e r     personal          radio       fo r      all

officers            to a t t e n d        inside          the       g r o u n d at         the      Leppings          Lane       end.        Along

with      other          officers             I ra n      through             the    open         gate     and       I have          previously

nietioned,            through           the     North          Stand          and    onto         the     p i t c h at      the       Leppings

Lane      End.           1 can         remember           seing          the     players            still       on the          p i t c h at      this

tim e .        My     first        r e a c ti o n was            that         there           was     fighting            taking       place

inside         the       standing             area       at    the       centre          of    th e      Leppings          Lane       stand,

because         there was               quite        a    large          number          of    people          already          on    the    pitch

around         the       rear      of    the        goals.              1 ran       to     this       area      and       immediately

jumped         o n to     the      boundary              wall       and assi ste d                other        officers          in    pulling

and    kicking            at      the    wire        perimeter                f en c e ,      because          I then       realised           that

this      was       not a         riot        but    something                more       serious,          the w i r e          fence       was    a

very      thick          gauge         wi r     and       were       unable          to m a k e          any    headway          in w h a t       we

were      handed          to      other        officers                       laid       them       o_n the      pitch and             perimeter

             the    gymnasiurr^i/fiderneath the                       North Stand where                   I was     then      told         to

             accompany            other      officers          whom    I do       not    know       in a t r a n s i t       v a n a n d we

             did a      patrol around              the     immediate           area      of    the       outskirts       of      the       ground

               In rny o p i n i o n       this     was     a    complete          waste       of    time     as   the    only       thing         we

             did was         get    held     up    in t r a f f i c     and were          no       use    whatsoever.

             Upon     returning           to CJLaywheels              Lane     at a b o u t        6.3Q     pm we     boarded          a       coach

             avid r e t u r n e d     to R o t h e r h a m ,     where        I was      stood       down      from     duty     at        7    pm.

             I was      on    d u t y at     the     same       Semi    Final        l$,st y e a r        a nd a l t h o u g h    I was          not

             present         at     the L e p p i n g s L a n e    End       of    Vyx    ground,          I was      on t h e      streets

             leading         up     that     s e c t i o n of   the    stadium.               V - c a n remember         that       the

             Liverpool            supporters         then       were    heavily          drinking,           although         no m e n t i o n

             of a n y    spare        tickets        was       made    then.

             From    where          I wa s    positioned           outside          the g r o u n d ,      I have       to    say      that       I

             have    never          seen     so m a n y s u p p o r t e r s       arriving         at     a match       as    l a te       as    the

             vast    majority          did     that      day,     which        in m y m i n d        is    the    most       significant

             factor      that       caused        th e   tragedy.

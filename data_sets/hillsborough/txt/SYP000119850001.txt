Dated                          050589



               I am       a Constable               with    19 y e a r s        service            during       which       time    I have          been

               on    duly      at    every          football          ground        in    the       force       area,       including          last

               y e a r ’s S e m i     Final          when    I was         on    duty         on    Leppings          Lane,       where      I saw        no

               trouble         at    all       either       before         or    after         the       game.

               I reported            on    duty       at    Doncaster            DHQ      at       8.30am       on    Saturday,          15 April.,

               •1989 w h e r e       I teamed          up    with        the      rest        of    my    serial,          number       31   I think,

              which        included            PS    2881    Pearson,            PC      919       Evans,       PC    139    Langley,          PC    1934

               Smith,       PC      235    Biackham,             PC    1239      Raybould,               PC    1900 Kent,          PC    1735       Wade,

              with        Inspector            Millet       in    overall          command.

#             We     travelled            by    Police       Transit            Van      to    Hillsborough                Stadium       where       the

              main        pre-match            briefing          was     held      in     the      North        Stand       about       10am.        This

               was       followed         by    A    packed       meal        taken       in       the    stand       before       deploying

               onto      the     streets.             I d o n ’t       remember           a    great          deal    about       the    briefing,

               it    was    the      usual          format       describing              who       was    going       where       etc.       I do

               remember          Chief         Superintendent                 D u c k e n f i e 1 d *s w o r d s       however          that    the

              match        would      start          "promptly           at     3pm".

               I    remember         thinking          to    myself           that       with       all       the    pre    match       build       up    on

              TV     and    in      the    press       about          L i v e r pool      supporters                having    the       smaller          end

              of     the    ground         and       less    tickets            than      Notts.          Forest,          that    if    a   lot     of

               them      arrived          without          tickets        and      tried           to    get    in    then    he    could       well
b e - y ron cf     in       that       assumption!

About        11am,          my    serial          walked          from       the    ground             to       the    roundabout                at    the

end     of    Leppings             Lane,          where       we       were       deployed             in       pairs       at    various             points

around        the       roundabout.                 I was          paired          up    with          PC       919    Evans       knd       we

 concentrated                on    the       shops       leading             just       from          the       roundabout             to

Penistone              Road       for       fear    of       the       fans       smashing             windows,             and    causing

trouble           at    a    "Hot       Pie       and    Pastie             Shop*       that          was       open    just       before             the

turn        off    to       Niagara          Sports          Ground.

There        weren't             many       fans    around             at    this       time,          but       I soon          noticed          that

certain           fans       in    groups          of    2    or       3    were    walking                backwards             and    forwards

from        Leppings             Lane,       past       us,       up       towards       W a d s 1 ey B r i d g e            and       back       down

again,        asking             other       fans       for       tickets          and     had         anyone          any       spare       tickets

or     tickets          for       sale.

It     soon       became          evident          that       as       time       passed          and       the       crowds       got       bigger

there        were       even more             fans       who       had       travelled                to    the       game       without                :

t ickets.

The     mood       of       the    fans       prior          to    the       game       was       jovial,             and    neither             myself

‘o r   PC    Evans          received          any       abuse          from       any    of       the       fans.           We    had       to    speak

to     quite       a    few       fans       who    were          walking          towards             the       ground          carrying             cans

of     beer       and       lager.           These       fans          were       told     that            if    they       went       any

further           then       they       probably             would          not    be    allowed                into    the       ground          and

they        agreed          to    go    to    a    garage          just       round        the         corner          where       according

to     PC    K e n t , who         was       outside          the          garage,       they          sat       on    the       wall       and

consumed           what          beer       they    had       left          before       walking                up    Leppings          Lane

towards           the       ground.           There          was       also       quite       a       few       fans    sat       on    the       wall

opposite           the       road       to    us,       drinking             beer,       etc.,             but       there       was    no

trouble           with,any             of    these       people.

The     crowds          tjot      bigger          and    bigger             and    quite          a    l ot      were       leaving          it

late,        in m y         estimation,             to       get       into       the    ground             and       get    comfortable

before        the       scheduled             kick       off       time.
Indeed          I    remember                a    group           o#    older          fans           in       their       30* s a n d          4 0* s a s k i n g

m e , about              2 , 3 0 pm,         where          the        Gate       Inn       M   / a s .        I told       them          and       away       they

walked          towards                the       p ub,      in     the       opposite                 direction             to       the       ground          with

only       half          an       hour       before           kick       off.              It       was        obvious          a    lot       of    the       fans

had    been          drinking,                   and     myself          and          PC    Evans              had    to    stop          them       using          the

rear       alleway                behind          the       shops        as       a    toilet,                 this       being          the    first

secluded             spot          they          had     after          getting             off           their       buses          on C l a y w h e e l s

Lane.           As       3pm       arived             there        were       still             a     few       fans       making          their          way       to

the    ground,                most       of       these           running             or    jogging,                 but    nowhere             near       the

large       amount                there          had     been          some       10 m i n u t e s              previously.

All    our          serial             started           to       walk       up       Leppings                 Lane,       as       our    brief          was       to

wait       there          on a          bus       until           half       time          when           we    were       to       go    to    ClaywheeIs

Lane       for       a    hot          nveal, if            there        was          no    need              for    us    to       remain          there       on

standby.

I d i d n ’t         have          a    personal              radio          but       I    can           remember          hearing             somebody

else's          as       we       walked          up     Leppings             Lane.                 We        had    been       joined          by    other

officers             and          one    told          me     fans       had          broken              a    gate       down       at    the       Leppings

Lane       end       of       the       ground.               We       all    started                 to       run    towards             the       ground          as

assistance                was          required.                  This       would          be        shortly             after          3pm.

On    arrival             at       the       ground           I    cannot             remember                 if    there          were       still       any

large       numbers                of    fans          outside           the          turnstiles,                    but    we       were       originally

formed          into          a    large          cordon           outside             the          ground           next       to       the    road,           I

don't       know          why,          nobody           said          what       was       happening.                     Little          bits       of

information                   filtered                through           that          there           had       been       some          trouble          and

there       were          some          people           injured             and       one          fan        said       there          were       some       dead

as    he    passed                us,    leaving              the       scene.

Our    serial             was          then       taken           towards             the       access              road    outside             Gate       C    on

and       bladder          movements.                    I have             seen       enough      dead         bodies           in m y     service

to      know     something                really             terrible             had     happened.              We    were          formed        up        in

a       cordon       by    Inspector                Sykes          at       this       location,           to    guard           these      bodies,

facing          towards             Gate       C.        The       gates          kept     being       opened          and        other

policemen             kept          bringing             more          people          out.      Some       were       dead,          others           were

injured.              They          were       kept          separate,             awaiting           ambulances                 which      by      now

were       arriving                at    the       scene.              The       road     was    kept        clear          for      them     to

arrive,          pick          up       and        depart.                 I still        had   no i d e a       what            had happened

inside          the       ground.                  I estimated                there       were     about          12       to     13 b o d i e s

right          behind          me.

A       Short    time          later          the       Liverpool                fans     started          leaving           the      ground,

where          the    first             people          they       saw       were       us,     guarding          bodies.               They

hurled          abuse          at       us,    saying             it       was    all     our    fault          for        opening        the

gate.           I d i d n ’t            even       know       what          they       were     talking          about,           but     what

could          I say,          they       might          be       right,          I didn't         know.          By        now      there        w ee r

lots       of    injured                outside          Gate          C    and    medical         teams         had        arrived          in

"response            to    a       radio       call.              Police          vans     were       used       to        ferry      some        of       the

injured          to       hospital.

As       the    crowds             built           up    outside             the       Leppings Lane             end,        a

superintendent                      whom           I did          not      know,        took    10 of      us    away           to    gently           move

the       crowds          to       the    other          side          of    the       bridge      and      stop       anyone

approaching                the          ground          without             good       reason.         What       a        futile       exercise

that       was.           As       we    tried          to    move          people,        more       came       out        behind        us,

filling          in       the       empty          spaces.                 Fans    were       coming        up    to       me     looking           for

their          sons,       asking             me    what          was       happening.             I c o u l d n ’t t e l l             them,          I

d i d n ’t k n o w ,               I made          something                up    so    that     it    appeared              everything                was

under          control.

I felt          as    if       I should             be       doing          something           more       to    help        the      injured,

instead          of       moving          people             away,          getting        j,Qts      of    abuse           in    the     process.

I never   actually   went   into   the   ground   until    we were   all   called   in for

de-briefing   in the North Stand.        I wasn't allocated a body to deal with

outside   the ground.   I didn't know the full extent of what had happened

until I saw the news on TV later that night.              I felt so helpless,       in that

I'd been there and didn't feel as though I'd done enough to help.                   I can't

remember seeing any club Stewards on my arrival at the ground.

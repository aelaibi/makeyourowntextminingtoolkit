                      Our Ref:


                      15th November, 1988




                      Dear

                      We have to hand your letter in relation to arrangements for
                      visiting supporters at last Saturday's match versus Aston
                      Villa, and were concerned to note your comments.

                       In accepting, with the benefit of hindsight, that more
                       spaces could have been allocated initially to Aston Villa
                       supporters, we would like to make the following points

                      Manchester United are one of the few first division clubs
                      who do all in their power to persuade visiting clubs to
                      take standing tickets.    The reason for this is two-fold;
                      firstly it enables speedier entry to the stadium in that
                      there is no cash transactions.    Secondly, and perhaps more
                      importantly,   it  gives   ourselves   and   the  police,   an
                      indication of the number of visiting supporters attending.
                      In   that   way,  the    appropriate    amount   of   terraced
                      accommodation can be reserved and an adequate number of
                      turnstiles provided.        ,

                      On approaching Aston Villa, they advised that they required
                      1,000 terraced tickets and these were duly despatched.
                      Just five days before, the match, Aston Villa requested
                      another S00 tickets.   He then contacted them two days prior
                      to the match only to be told that they had sold out the
                      previous evening.   In any event, there were 4,362 visiting
                      supporters and the terrace spaces allocated to them has a
                      capacity of 4,SS0. He are accepting the criticism that the
                      packing might have been better but in view of the advanced
                      sales to visiting supporters, we had absolutely no way of
                      knowing that such a large number of non—ticket holders
                      would   arrive   and   it   would   therefore,   have   been
                      inappropriate to pack early arrivals as tightly as one
                      would when capacity in that section was expected to be
                      achieved.    Problems were    also   compounded by traffic
                      congestions and we know that six or seven coaches did not
                      arrive at the stadium until 10 minutes after kick-off.

                      The above information should not be seen as criticism of
                      Aston Villa Football club.  They have to make an assessment
                      of the number of tickets they expect to sell and there is
                      the fact that very many football supporters refuse to
                      purchase tickets in advance.   This, in turn, leads to the
                      kind of problems experienced last Saturday.

                      Whilst also accepting that it may have seemed that the
                      police were 'slow to react' by opening additional sections,
                      it should be borne in mind that police officers on duty in
                      and around the stadium have specific tasks to perform and
                      it can take a little time and some 'juggling' in order to
                      arrange for an orderly and safe movement of spectators
                      without weakening other areas.

                      I do hope that this information helps to clarify the
                      situation and I thank you for taking the trouble to write,
                      thus giving us the opportunity to explain our actions.

Dear

I reply to your letter of the 7th November 1988 following your visit
to Manchester United football stadium when Manchester United played
Aston Villa.   Your main criticism is regarding the segregation and the
way that supporters were inadequately housed in the terraced area of
the ground.

As you may be aware, the ground attendance that day was 44,804 and of
those, 4,500 were Aston Villa supporters.   Prior to the game the
intelligence received from the home supporters club was that visitors
would be in the region of 2—3,000.     It was only based on our experience
over previous seasons that we allowed extra areas to accommodate any extra
casual supporters who might have arrived.

As a result of this we were able, albeit in a somewhat confined area, to
accommodate nearly twice the number of visitors anticipated.

Before and during the match police officers attempted, not always
successfully, to ensure that the Aston Villa fans moved towards the front
of the terraced areas and I can assure you that irrespective of where you
were standing or how tightly packed it may have been, each of the areas in
question was not filled to capacity.

I am not aware of the specific incident you identify in your letter of the
gentleman and his wife, but to date I have received no other letters of
complaint in respect of these matters.

I accept the incident with the firework prior to the game but I am sure you
will appreciate that with crowds in such numbers coming into the stadium
officers who are searching on a random basis have to rely on experience
and such crowds, particularly arriving at the last minute as invariably
they do, are not conducive to finding small items such as fireworks being
brought in.



                                                                        contd:-
                              -   2   -




I thank you for your letter as I am always aware that any criticism
must be looked at constructively, and as such we will endeavour, as
we always do, to improve and ensure that Old Trafford remains one of
the safest stadia in England.




                          Yours sincerely,




                                  Chief Superintendent

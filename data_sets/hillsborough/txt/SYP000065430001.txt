through           the    turnstiles                and    were        met    on    the     inside           by a P o 1 i e e w o m a n               who

Initially          we    stood          behind        a barrier             which       was      about       two     thirds          of    the

we w e r e      taking        up    this       position a              'wave*        of      pushing         from      behind           hit      us

and    threw       me    intothe          barrier           itself.           Then        it     eased       off     and       t h en

happensa          again.           There       was       a man     next       to me          wh o    put     his     foot       on      the

carrier         and     stretched             his     leg    out       so    his     k ne e      w as     locked?         to    stop       him

the    p r essure,                             and       1 decided           that       we'd        have     to m o v e        or we *d be

been     standing           there        for       about     two       minutes          when        we    heard      the       loud

speaker         announcement              for       tne     teams.           At    this        time       we w e r e      being         pushed

up a g a i n s t      the     fence       to       stop     myself          crushing           the       person      in f r o n t         of me.

squashing           my    head       on m y       n e c k , squashing               my    head     on my       left       shoulder             by

know     if t h e y       were        all     dead          but       I think         roost of        t h e m w e re.           I just        lay

there        and    it was           a wierd           feeling           but      all    I wanted           to      do w as      sl e e p ,    my

shocked        me       and     I woke        up a n d           1 thought            God     what       am I doing             and    I

started        trying           to    get     up,           I didn't            seem     to a b l e to get             up      partly

oscause        when       I tried            to       get    up m y         feet      kept     falling           between         the       dead

and     I was       frightened               to       stand       on    them,         I wa s       helped        to    hold      onto       the

fence        then       I sa w                             lying       down,       she       eventually             spoke       to me       and     1

knew     she       was    alright,                A    lad       then       p i c k e d me     up a n d        got     me      over    the     top

of     the    fence       but        I lost           my    balance          and      fell     back       onto        the      lad a n d

we     both    fell       over        onto        the       dead       b od i e s ,     these       bodies          were       all    behind

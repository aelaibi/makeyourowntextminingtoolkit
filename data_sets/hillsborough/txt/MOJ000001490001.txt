IN THE M ATTER of an application by THE CHIEF CONSTABLE OF SOUTH
YORKSHIRE POLICE FO R LEAVE TO APPLY FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW


I IAN DAINES, Assistant Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police, Police Headquarters,
Snig Hill, Sheffield, S3 8LY MAKE OATH AND SWEAR as follows :


1.    I am the Assistant Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police, I am duly authorised to
       swear this affidavit on behalf of the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police. I
       make this affidavit in support of an application for leave to apply for judicial review of
       certain decisions o f the South Yorkshire Police Authority made on 5th February 1999
       referred to in RSC Appendix A Form No 86A,


2.    Save as stated herein, all facts and matters deposed to within this affidavit are within
       my knowledge, information and belief.


3.    The concerns and worries which I outline and to which I refer in this Affidavit are
       shared by The Chief Constable. Indeed, I cannot stress too highly how important it is
      to The Chief Constable that the question of whether there is power to provide financial
       assistance to police officers be resolved. Moreover, while clearly it is a matter for the
       Court, it is regarded as crucial for proper and efficient policing that it be established
       that there is power to grant financial assistance. It is a matter of the highest priority.




                                                                           chi.057-0009,aff,1002,pcm,wd.doc
                                                 1
I have read the Notice of Application prepared by those advising the Chief Constable
and confirm that the factual assertions contained therein are true.


There is now produced and shown to me:-


a)      marked EDI a copy of the recommendations section of a report dated 1
       February 1999 and prepared by Messrs Garretts, the South Yorkshire Police
        Authority’s legal advisors. On 5 February 1999 the Authority resolved to act
        in accordance with paragraphs 1 - 4 of those recommendations. The terms of
       those resolutions are set out in the body of the Notice of Application,


b)     marked ID2 a letter from Messrs Garretts dated 10 February 1999 on behalf of
       the South Yorkshire Police Authority which indicates that they do not oppose
       the application for leave to apply for judicial review and supporting the
       application for an expedited substantive hearing ;


c)      marked ID3 copies of the informations laid against David Duckenfield and
       Bernard Murray dated 10th July 1998,


d)      marked ID4 correspondence received from The Association of Chief Police
        Officers and the Police Superintendents Association of England & Wales
        dealing with the concern which these bodies have with regard to the decision
        made by the Police Authority and the need to have this application determined
        as a matter of urgency.


It is my experience that there has never been any question but that a Police Authority
has the power to grant financial assistance to a police officer who faces legal
proceedings brought in respect of his or her conduct whilst on duty, I know of no
other case or set of circumstance in which the Police Authority’s power to grant
assistance has been questioned or challenged. As can be seen from the letter from the
Chief Constable of Derbyshire Constabulary, President of the Association of Chief
Officers, the decision that there is no power to provide financial assistance which is the
essential subject matter of this application is contrary to current practice and
understanding. The resolution of this issue is a matter of national importance,


I am greatly concerned at the suggestion that there is no power to provide financial
assistance to police officers who face legal proceedings. I consider it absolutely vital
that officers should know that if they act in good faith in performing their duties that
their Police Authority will support them in the event that they face litigation,


I fear that if officers do not enjoy the confidence that they have this form of support,
that we will see defensive policing. That is, officers deciding not to act when faced
with a difficult situation in case it rebounds upon them, or officers seeking to push
decision making up the rank structure rather than taking responsibility themselves.. It is
absolutely vital that officers feel confident about immediate decision making. This is
essential to proper policing.


It is important to bear in mind that it is a particular feature of police work that it is
usually the most junior officers who are faced with the immediate problems of
managing or dealing with violent or dangerous situations. They are at the front line, as
it were. These officers need to know that if they act in good faith they will have the
support of their police authority in the vent that they become the subject or target of
litigation. It is essential to effective policing that junior officers have the confidence to
make the difficult decisions and choices which are demanded of them in the course of
their duties.


Policing necessarily involves situations of conflict. Police officers daily deal with the
unscrupulous who are well practised in taking advantage of any weaknesses which they
may be able to exploit. It takes little imagination to think of how the threat of private
prosecution may be used to intimidate where police officers do not have the confidence
that they will receive police authority assistance should any such threat be realised.


I am concerned that if police officers cannot act in the knowledge that they will be
supported if they face litigation that it will impact on recruitment.
12.   As a result of the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster tragically 96 people died. The impact
       on South Yorkshire Police has been enormous.         Such is the profile of the private
       prosecution that the whole Force will know of the decision on the part of the Police
       Authority to cease funding, I have no doubt that the decision will be the subject of
       much concern within the Force, both with regard to the way that David Duckenfield
       and Bernard Murray have been treated and how the decision will affect all current
       officers. Further, given the press coverage of events, it will not have escaped any
       officer’s attention that the decision to cease funding came about as a result of
       representations made by the private prosecutor,


13.   The decision to cease funding has come at a crucial stage in the private prosecution.
       The decision can only have come as a major blow to the two former officers who have
       thus far acted in the belief that they had financial assistance. Clearly, the question of
       whether they have funding or not has to be determined as a matter of absolute urgency
       either so that funding can be resumed so that they can continue properly to defend the
       prosecution brought against them or so that they can make alternative financial
       arrangements.


14.   In all the circumstances, the Chief Constable seeks leave to apply for judicial review as
       sought in RSC Appendix A Form No 86A and thereafter, the substantive relief
       claimed.

 15 CONFIDENTIAL. IT CONTAINS INFORMATION DISCLOSED BY MR
 DUCKENF1ELD. MR MURRAY AND THEIR ADVISERS WHICH IF IT
 BECOMES GENERALLY AVAILABLE AT THIS STAGE COULD PREJUDICE
 THEIR LEGAL POSITION.                        MEMBERS ARE THEREFORE REQUESTED TO
 KEEP THIS REPORT SECURE AND DISCUSS ITS CONTENTS WITH NO-ONE
 OUTSIDE THE MEMBERS OF THE POLICE COMMITTEE, ITS OFFICERS AND
 ADVISERS.

 PURPOSE OF THE REPORT

 To consider:                                               '■

 i)       the decisions taken in principle on 2711' February 1998 to provide financial
           assistance to Mr David Duckenfield and Mr Bernard Murray in relation to
           certain criminal proceedings taken against them and to review and decide
           whether to reverse or confirm those decisions;

ii)       further applications for financial assistance from Mr David Duckenfield and
           Mr Bernard Murray to meet their respective legal costs and disbursements in
           proposed proceedings for judicial review of:

           a.        the decision of the Crown Prosecution Service not to intervene to take
                     over the conduct of the private prosecutions brought against them by
                     Ms Ann Adlir.gton, Solicitor, on behalf of the Hillsborough Family
                     Support Group ("HFSG");

           b.        an adverse ruling by the Clerk to the South Sefton Justices on claims
                     made for the payment of costs from central funds;

iii)    • written representations submitted by Ms Adlington, on behalf of the HFSG,
          tc the Authority;

RECOMMENDATIONS

1-      In the light of legal advice, including advice from leading Counsel, members
        are recommended to resolve that, on balance, the Authority has no legal power
        to provide financial assistance to Mr David Duckenfield or Mr Bernard Murray
        in relation to their costs and expenses of defending the private prosecutions
        brought against them by the HFSG, by Information dated 10 July 1998, and
        accordingly to determine that any previous decision of the Authority, or any


AtM\MiTr,sounjYCRJa!t:ftEroLk:E,'Fv-di*>ii.i>oc     1
          officer acting under its authority, to make such assistance available is null and
          void.

 2.       In the light of legal advice, including advice from leading Counsel, members
          are recommended to resolve that, on balance, the Authority has no legal power
          to provide financial assistance to Mr David Duckenfield or Mr Bernard Murray
          in relation to the costs of any judicial review proceedings brought by either of
          diem: whether relating to the decision of die Crown Prosecution Service not to
          take over tlie conduct cf the private prosecutions and discontinue such
          prosecutions, or to any decision of the G eik to the Sefton Magistrates' Court to
          challenge the payment of the officers' costs of proceedings before that court
          from central funds, or to any other decision of any ccrurt, authority or body
          arising from such prosecutions; and, accordingly, to reject the applications of
          Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray for financial assistance in relation to such
          proceedings-.                               ' ■

 3.       In recognition of the fact that the legal advice provided to the Authority is that
          it remains arguable that power exists to provide die assistance referred to in 1
          and 2 above, to take such action as the Clerk and Treasurer, in consultation
          with the Chief Constable, the Authority's legal advisers and the Chairman of
          the Authority, may decide as appropriate to have the decisions referred to in 1
          and 2 reviewed by the High Court and to expedite such review with a view to
          clarifying the Authority's powers in this regard.

4.        To defer consideration of the procedural issues raised by Ms Adlington, in her
          letters of 22 December 1998 to the Clerk and Treasurer and 5 January 1999 to
          the members of tine Authority, until the legal power of the Authority to provide
          the financial assistance referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 has been resolved to
          the satisfaction of the Authority.

       Dear Madam

       R - v - The South Yorkshire Police Authority ex parte The Chief Constable of South
       Yorkshire Police

       We have been instructed by the South Yorkshire Police Authority ("SYPA")-                                                        f
                                                                                                                                    .             ■ -       -. • . .


       We are aware that the Chief Constable proposes to seek judicial review of resolutions made by
       SYPA on 5 February 1999. These resolutions were to the effect that SYPA did not have power to
       provide financial assistance to two former police officers in relation to their costs and expenses of

       disaster.

       SYPA passed these resolutions with great reluctance on the basis of the advice received from
       ourselves and Counsel we instructed to advise, Miss Presiley Baxendale QC and Mr Mark Shaw.

       The Chief Constable contends that SYPA, and indeed all police authorities, did have power to
       grant financial assistance to officers fading prosecution. This view accords with a practice which
       police authorities have adopted for some 60 years. This practice appears to have been endorsed by
       the Home Office in two Circulars (Number 77 of 1987 and Number 4 of 1998), although we have
       now received a letter from the Home Office which appears to cast some doubt on the matter.

       The Chief Constable's proceedings will raise questions of national importance. The questions need
       to be determined as a matter of urgency. This is because the officers who have been denied
       financial assistance as a result of SYPA's decision are facing committal proceedings due to
       commence in April 1999 in the Leeds Magistrates Court Those committal proceedings have been
       given an estimate of 4 weeks.

       We understand that the Chief Constable will be seeking leave for judicial review and an order or
       direction that these proceedings be expedited.

On behalf of the SYPA/ whose decision is to be the subject: of review by the court we:

1       consent to the grant of leave; and

2       endorse the Chief Constable's application that the full hearing of his application be
        expedited. Indeed, we should hope that the matter can be heard as soon as practicable, and
        in any event during the month of Match 1999.

In order to facilitate an early hearing date, SYPA will endeavour to put in its evidence in reply
within 7 days of service of the application.

We understand that those acting for the Chief Constable intend to serve the Home Office as a
interested party. We consider that we should draw to the Court's attention at this stage, in order to
save time, that this is a case where the Court might be assisted by submissions on behalf of the
Home Office at any substantive hearing.

Yours faithfully

RESOLUTIONS OF THE SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE AUTHORITY ON
FRIDAY, 5 FEBRUARY 1999

1. In the light of legal advice, including advice from leading Counsel/ members are
      recommended to resolve that, on balance, the Authority has no legal power to
      provide financial assistance to Mr David Duckenfield or Mr Bernard Murray in
      relation to their costs and expenses of defending the private prosecutions brought
      against them by the HFSG, by Information dated 10 July 1998, and accordingly to
      determine that any previous decision of the Authority, or any officer acting
      under its authority, to make such assistance available is null and void.

2. In the light of legal advice, including advice from leading Counsel, members are
      recommended to resolve that, on balance, the Authority has no legal power to
      provide financial assistance to Mr David Duckenfield or Mr Bernard Murray in
      relation to the costs of any judicial review proceedings brought by either of them;
      whether relating to the decision of the Crown Prosecution Service not to take
      over the conduct of the private prosecutions and discontinue such prosecutions,
      or to any decision of the Clerk to the Sefton Magistrates' Court to challenge the
      payment of the officers' costs of proceedings before that court from central funds,
      or to any other decision of any court, authority or body arising from such
      prosecutions; and, accordingly, to rqect the applications of Mr Duckenfield and
      Mr Murray for financial assistance in relation to such proceedings.

3. In recognition of the fact that the legal advice provided to the Authority is that it
      remains arguable that power exists to provide the assistance referred to in 1 and 2
      above, to take such action as the Clerk and Treasurer, in consultation with the
      Chief Constable, the Authority's legal advisers and the Chairman of the
      Authority, may decide as appropriate to have the decisions referred to in 1 and 2
      reviewed by the High Court and to expedite such review with a view to
      clarifying the Authority's powers in this regard.

4. To defer consideration of the procedural issues raised by Ms Adlington, in her
      letters of 22 December 1998 to the Clerk and Treasurer and 5 January 1999 to the
      members of the Authority, until the legal power of the Authority to provide the
      financial assistance referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 has been resolved to the
      satisfaction of the Authority.

          CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT


          South Yorkshire Police Authority has met today to consider issues relating to the
          funding of the defence costs of former police officers in legal proceedings relating to
          the Hillsborough disaster.


          As well as considering various legal advice, we heard representations from the
          Hillsborough Families Support Group and solicitors representing two former
          officers.


          Questions have been raised recently about the powers of Police Authorities to pay
          the defence costs of police officers in legal proceedings. We have taken extensive
          legal advice on the matter. On balance, our advisers have concluded that Police
          Authorities do not have the powers and we have felt obliged to support that view.

                                                             ♦

          However, the issue is far from clear cut We have heard this morning from several
          other legal advisers - including the Chief Constable's adviser - who are firmly of the
          view that Police Authorities do have the powers. We are therefore co-operating with
          the Chief Constable to have the true legal position determined by the court.


          The implications of this matter go beyond South Yorkshire and could affect the
          Police Service as a whole.

                  I u n derstand that the South Yorkshire Police A uthority have received
in d ep en d en t legal advice w hich inform s them that they have no pow er to grant
financial su p p o rt to serving or form er officers facing prosecution. This advice was
given in respect of a private prosecution currently faced by form er Chief
S uperintendent Duckenfield and form er Superintendent M urray as a result of their
involvem ent in the tragic events at H illsborough.

              This decision is clearly contrary to current practice and understanding
and is a m atter of national concern. You have said that you are looking for this to be

Dear

FIN A NCIA L SUPPORT FOR FORMER POLICE OFFICERS D A V ID DUCKENFIELD A N D
BERNARD MURRAY

It has come to my notice that at a meeting of the South Yorkshire Police A uthority on 5 February it was
decided to discontinue financial support for the two above nam ed officers. As I understand it that
decision w as based upon independent legal advice w hich they had received as to w hether there w as
a pow er in law for them to make such financial assistance available, and in particular w hether that
power w as available under the Police Act 1996, sections 6 and 88, and the Local Governm ent Act 1972,
section 111 (1).

H om e Office Circular 4/1998 deals w ith the issue of w hen police authorities can provide financial
assistance to police officers in legal proceedings and in its introduction says "It is important that police
officers should be able to carry out their duties in the confidence that their police authorities will support them if
they act in good faith and exercise their judgement reasonably.".

The decision by the South Yorkshire Police A uthority has therefore come as a considerable surprise to
the Superintendents' Association and w ould appear to ru n counter to all previous beliefs and practices
of police authorities in supporting both serving and former police officers. I understand that your
position, as advised by your Counsel, is that there is clear authority in law for such an action and that
you intend to seek a determ ination of this m atter by w ay of Judicial Review.

This m atter is clearly of national im portance for the Police Service and certainly from the perspective
of the Superintendents' Association I w ould ask you to take this forw ard w ith all due despatch and
diligence and seek as early a hearing before the H igh C ourt as you can possibly arrange.

Yours sincerely,


Des Parkinson
Chief Superintendent

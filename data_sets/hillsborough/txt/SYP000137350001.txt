        Dear Mr Jones,

        VIDEO     mm    RECORDING OF INTERVIEWS

        The Director has asked me to thank you for your letter of
        n t h December; he has passed it to ;:><* fui attention since I have
        special responsibility within the CPS            issues relating to
        video recording.

        I am grateful to you for bringing to our attention the fact that
        it is likely that early in the New Year the Coronerfs Court will
        be shown a video recording of an interview,     I an aware that
        three Police Forces are currently conducting experiments
        concerning the video recording of interviews with suspects and
        indeed, 1 understand that to date only one such video has been
        shown at a magistrates* court in the West Midlands,.
        in the event that it is decided to show a video recording of an
        interview, it certainly would be of interest to we to attend the
        proceedings and observe the process of replay; perhaps you would
        bo good enough to let me know in due course if this is arranged
        so that I can attend court as an observer, if pon<-.;M,*.

       Thank you once again for bringing this matter to my attention and
       1 should add that the Director has asked me to reciprocate your
       good wishes for the forthcoming festive season.

       Yours sincerely,

                                                                                                                         St.

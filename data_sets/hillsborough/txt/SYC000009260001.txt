         Our Ref: Hills/Sol/4/SLP/JT                                              17th September 1990

o        Dear Sirs,

         Re: RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990.


         If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
         of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of whom you represent,
         on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m. Details of venue will be notified in
         due course.

         I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
         evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
         coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarial but
         inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only limited objectives.

         Subject to the Coroners’ Act 1988 and the Coroners’ Rules, the Inquest is
         under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
         witnesses who wish to give evidence.  I am at present engaged in considering
         this and in determining who I wish to invite to attend.

             Without prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter, I am writing to you
             to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
             appropriate details of any witness or witnesses whom you would like me to
             consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

             May I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to my
             attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

             I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
             names for consideration is nothing more than that, and that the decision as
             to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

             I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
                                                      will assume you have no names to
             submit.

             Yours faithfully,

   Dear Dr topper

   RE:
   I have just seen Anthcny's mother (Mrs Sinns) and been through the Summary
   with her.

   She has a couple of points to natce, the Steering Ocomlttee Questionnaire is
   attached with full details.       Sbs is quite adamant about the timings and
   identifications, I do hops that these can be checked before Anthony's
   Inquest on the 26th April.

   Mrs Simas will be in Court to hear the Suaaary presented, I believe she will
   travel from Manchester with her husband and a social worker.

   No questions arise fraa the Fost^forten-

   Yours sincerely

     Dear         Sirs,

     Re:          ANTHONY P KELLY (deceased) Mo. 54.

     As you are aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
     Disaster stand adjourned to a date to "be fixed. You may also
     "be aware that it had "been in my mind to resume these Inquests
     on the 15th of January 1990*

      I have now "been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
      has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
      behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided not*to resume the
      Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

      I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
      Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
      he may wish to undertake.

      I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
      or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
      matter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
      a substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
      on this matter further.

 \ I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
   is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
   fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

     <Tours faithfully,



\      S.L.Popper,

Dear Dr Popper

RE:   AN1HONY EE3ER JCBTJ-V

I have just seen Anthony's mother (Mrs Siians) and been through the Swsmary
with her.

She has a couple of points to make, the Stealing Committee Questionnaire is
attached with full details.      She is quite adamant about the timings and
identifications, I do hope that these can be checked before Anthony's
Inquest on the 26th April.

Mrs Simms will be in Court to hear the Suranary presented, I believe she will
travel from Manehester with her husband and a social worker.

No questionsarise from the Post-Mortem.

Yours sincerely

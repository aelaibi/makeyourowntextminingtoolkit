Dear Mr. Sweet,

Re: Safety of Sports Grounds -
Sheffield United Football Club
 vl
I rarer to your telephone conversation with Mrs.
Woodhead on 22nd September 1989 and enclose a copy of
the Safety Certificate which was issued to Shefffeld
United Football Club on 16th August 1989. This is an
interim certificate and is likely to be revised in the
near future in the light of Lord Justice Taylor's final
recommendations.

Yottrjjf sincerely,                                     I

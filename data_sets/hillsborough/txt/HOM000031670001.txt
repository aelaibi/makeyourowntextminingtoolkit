HILLSBOROUGH: LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH



Mr Howarth has seen Mr Pugh's submission of 11 July. He is broadly happy
with the approach it recommends on the disclosure of evidence submitted to
Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's scrutiny. However, Mr Howarth feels that it should
be made clear that any transcripts which are not published are exceptions and
that it is very important that you give the reasons for withholding evidence in
line with the undertaking you gave on 30 June.

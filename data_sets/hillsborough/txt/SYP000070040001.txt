              I took      up my        present        posting         on 27 M a r c h        1989,,      My   responsibilities

              play      in the P o l i c i n g        of major         events,          ! am also          required       to a t t e n d

              many meeti n g s           throughout         the year         in respect            of matters          rela t e d to

              football.              On taking        up rny new         post     I was aware            that an F .A . C u p Bern

              Final      was     to be played at H i l l s b o r o u g h on                   IS April        1989,      betw e e n

              considered             it correct        that    I should join                 them and offer my

from other Forces              and e q u a l l y as         important,          it w ould give me

match,      thus enabling            me     to speak wit h some a u t h o r i t y w h e n a t t e n d i n g

conferences.            I con t a c t e d Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Duckenfield,                      requestin

his    p e rmission to work as above,                       full    a g r e e m e n t and asked

if on his behalf,              I would         de-brief M o u n t e d and Dog O f f icers                     at      the

c o n c l u s i o n of the match.              I,    of    course,     was      only too h appy             to

by Inspector          Phenix        (Appendix         *A').        This    order was          prepared           in

been    catered       for     by the        section.

Also    during       the week        preceeding            the m a t c h   I received a list

of officers who w o u l d              be work i n g        on the m o u n t e d section               from

car ry i ng out         the i.r dut i es .

At    1030 hrs       I attended           the    briefing         of    the M o u n t e d O f f i c e r s    again      in

the N i a g a r a Club.            Due    to    the    sickness        of one      of the      horses,

w h i c h should have           been      ridden       by Police Con s t a b l e          Henwood,          slight

adjustment          was    n e c e ss a r y as no       replacement           was available.                The    revise

list    of officers            is at A p p e n d i x      ’D*.         I again     opened      the    b r i efing       by

left.        I then han d e d the              briefing      to    Inspec.tor jHjmd-Davis,

who    had    prepared         specific         duties.         He deploy

officers       as    per A p p e n d i x       *E*.     It will        be seen that           the

basic     principle was             that M e r s e y s i d e      O f f i c e r s w ould work with

S ou t h Y o rkshire O f f i c e r s           in P o l icing and L i verpool              supporters             and   tha

It will        be seen that          this     is   in slight           v a r iance with the            ’F ’

Cii) The       *F* D i v i s i o n Order        made no        p r o v i s i o n for       the M o u n t e d S e c t i o n

         to    cover    the S o u t h S t a n d .          It was       consi d e r e d that       this was

         n e c e s s a r y an d therefore,           the H a l i f a x Roa d and Merr i e s Road

         patrols were           reduced       from four           to   two,     thus a l l o w i n g    four    horses

        wa s awar e o f t his.

It should be noted               that     the      reason to take              the    sick horse        out    of    the

L e p p i n g s Ln    contingent was            because       six O f f i c e r s      were     d e p l o y e d on

which     they w o u l d t h e n       be deplo y e d        in L e p p i n g s      Ln.

himself with his/her                 partner(s)          and all       being aware           of what was

expected       of them.         The    Inspector           covered       the      salient      points     from the

*F*    Divisional        Order,       these       included        communications,              where    prisoners

sho u l d    be taken,      colour      coded tickets and                  that     the gates w o u l d            be

Nottinghamshire           trains       w o u l d be a r r i v i n g at         the S h e f f i e l d M i d l a n d

S tation.        Inspector H an d - D a v i s           concluded his             briefing      by telling all

Officers       that they were all                 experienced          in P o l i c i n g    football         matches?

their       duty was     crowd       control       and a high s t a n d a r d was e x p e c t e d              from

everyone.         Again,       packed meals             were    d i s tr i b u t e d and the O f f i c e r s            were

soon    out    on patrol.

It is perhaps           pertinent       to m e n t i o n at        this     stage       that    it    is n e c essary

to utilise        horses and dogs              from other Forces                  on such o c c asions as                the

F A Cup Semi-Final,              as S o u t h Y o r k s h i r e      is unable          to fulfill        the

requirement.           This     is    common        practice       for all         major     events     and

people were           dead and

that we       had a major           incident        on our    hands.         On seeing all           the activit

assistance           I could give          to the     injured that were                being     brought

across       the ground to where                  I was   stood.          This was also         the A m b u l a n c e

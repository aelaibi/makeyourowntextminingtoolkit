Inspector PHOE N I X             carried out the briefing                   by d etailing         such me n as           to

his    patrol       areas.       I was    d et ailed         to   patrol   with PC 995 P E A R CE          of the

S o u t h Yor k s hi re Dog S e ct i o n         (photostat           of our brief and            patrol      area

a ttached).             During     the briefing a q ue st i on was               raised by a S o ut h

Y o r k s h i r e Dog Handler.            This       particular Police C o n s t ab l e was              concerned

about       the    route     to be taken by the Liv er po ol                  coaches,       as

d e s c r i b e d by Insp PHOENIX,              his        concern    centred a r o u nd the        number       of

road works          of a Major         Nature        that were        being   carried out a lon g             the

p roposed         r o u t e . (He did state            that he had only just               been g ive n the

proposed          route)     and    the delays             this   could    create.     He did sugg es t an

alternative             route.      H ow e ve v er     he was quite         clearly    told that         this was

going       to be the        route and not             in so man y words         to sit down and              stop

creating          problems.

At the end of briefing                   I went        to try and         clarify    the    role they wi s h e d
                                                       r
to    perform.          As   the a l l o c a t i o n       of Notts O ff icers       and the d ep lo ym en t             of

men and       reducing        my e ff e ct i ve n es s as a s upervisor               in the event            to a n y

public       order       problems      dramatically.               I was    u ns uc cessful       in this and at

approximately 9.45am                 (0945)      I commenced           patrol    wit h PC 995 PEARCE.

larger.           The    public     houses along             this m ai n    road were       closed.        Howe ve r

public      houses        on the     side      roads        remained open,       it did not take              long

for    the visiters           to discover            this and a        continuous      stream       of fans

A steady bui'^^upi of Liverpool                        fans     began at     this     location.          M an y were

drinking           from    cans and      bottles       they had brought wit h them as well                          as

from glasses              containing alcohol            that     they had     purchased        from the

Horse and Jockey.

had    to take some a c t i on            to prevent           the fans and         residents      coming       to

had happened.             F ro m what        I was    told    I formed the opin io n that a

serious        public or<jer s it u at i on had arisen,                   culminating      in an       invasion

of the        pitch.                                          /V^     ^

At    this     time    nothing       had     come from M a t ch Control.

Being     the only s up er vi so r            that    1' could see        I tried to contact M at ch

Control        to find out w hay the wanted us to do,                        now that we        had ente re d

the gr ou nd and had             our dogs       out with us.          After a short while               we were

told     to    leave the       gr ou nd a nd wait outside.                 Still    without a         c 1 ear

picture as to what               had happened.          R um ou rs    began to spread that             people

had been killed at               the L ep pi n gs Ln end of the ground.

H ow e ve r    no official        c o nf i rm a ti o n of this was          forthcoming.         Many

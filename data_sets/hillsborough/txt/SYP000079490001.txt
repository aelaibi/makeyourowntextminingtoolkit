that at Liverpool                 FC,    Airfield Ground,

Arrangements             had been made           to m e e t __                      at a house    in

         near Sheffield,                where we w ould          pay for our tickets when we knew

w h i c h stand and what                price    they were,

I tr a v e l l e d to S h e f f i el d with                      a r ri vi ng   m                        at about

'12 3 0 pm    (1230)?          where we met          up with                together with five            other

people.            These       being                                      , a man named                    one

name d                   and a person I can't               remember,       but was                    brothe r „

At the house              I paid £.14 for a seat               ticket     in the North Stand,            titis was

one    of two        together          and             bought the other one.

At about           1.30pm       (1330)       w^feft     the house       in two       cars and stop ped at a

public house              in                           where we had a meal             and two    pints     of

beer,        except the d r i ^ ^ s           of the     cars.      There were         no other fans        in

this     public          house,    w hi ch we        left at about 2 . 1 5 pm         (1415)    and drove        from

there        to a road about a mile                   fron the ground where we                parked.     It took

about        fifteen minutes             to get there          due to heavy traffic.

After        parking       the    car we walked towards               the football        ground.        I did

not know where we were                       going    to enter the ground,             but the    lads     1 was

w ith did,          so    I stayed with them.               On the way to the ground               I saw

several        hundred fans             from both teams.            1 could see this as they were

wearing        relevant          football       insignia.         As we    ca^e      inuo L ep pings Ln from

a shopping area                 I could see occasional              fanjr carrying        four    packs     of

beer,        but    cannot       say    I w it n es s ed any act^^l         drinking.          As we got     near

the    ground we were              being a sk ed every few y a r d s                if we had any spare

tickets.            It was       obvious       that there w e l a r g e             numbers    of fans— 11 tat--

were     there who             did not       have tickets^r        Whilst walking         down Lep pi ng s Ln

I saw one Liverpool                    fan who had eytfv i o u s 1y had an excessive amount                      of

drink as he was                 being held up between two other                      supporters,       who were

v i r tu a l l y    carrying       him.        I also heard one           of them say,         "I told you not

to get        into this          state.        T h e y ’ll never     let you        into the ground n o w , ”

           or words       to that      effect.      There were       others who a pp eared from the

           demeanor       to have had more          th^n enough to drink,            but were walking

           towards       the ground.

           As    1 got    to a point where/ I could see the entrance                      gates    to the

S,o.£      ground,       I could see a J^arge mass            of    people a ro u nd the gates         out    onto
   Li_.    the L e p pings Ln r               I could not see any orderly queues and                   could see

fouct      about     four or five Police isf f i ce rs on horseback and about                        two on foot
  A T      who a p p e a r e d that     they yn.d not know what             to do for the best for
L •l _ .
           orga n i s i n g   the    crowd.

           We a r r i v e d at the entrance             to the ground,       it was about 2. 4 5 p m       (1445),

           As we entered the gates                towards    the turnstiles,        the    crowd began to

           become a crush,             I was a p pr o ac hi ng /     point w hich o n a      map     I have      been

           shown     ;i.s ma rk ed    !A !, when    I coulc/see and hear s upporters                 'in front     of

           me banging and hamrnering               ob   a ocncertina        g a teway at that        point and

           push i ng f r om be h i nd me          was       ting har de r .

           Prior     to getting        to this     point,    I had seen a couple           children being

           passed up onto            some metal     railing     posts out of the          crowd,      I could

           also    see a woman         in a space        between two of the entrance              gates,     w hich

           did not       contain m any        people,     calling    out for someone        to tell a

           P o l i c e m a n she had    injured her arm.            We were    unable     to do so and she

           did not appear            badly    injured and was        in a safe      position so we took no

           further       notice      of her.

           I was     in this        crushing       position until we heard a             roar from    inside     the

           ground at which time               I    believed the game had started.              At this point

           the    pushing and         crushing     became worse,       o b vi ou sl y because      of the

           anxious       herd of supporters waiting                to get    into   the ground and see            the

           game.

           It was at about            this    time that     I saw the       c oncertina gate,        w hi ch was       to

c a t      my    left,    was   being opened,            I am unable    to ^ a ^ ^ h o    opened it,       but    it

           was    opened and the         crush eased somewhat and              I saw hundr^is         of
                                                                                               PAGE         4

s u pporters     running     throug h the open gate.              I turned to                 who was

still     stood by me and s u gg es te d we went            that way as well,          just to gain

access     to the ground more        quickly.

I made rny way towards          the age and        realised that                was    still    stood

waiting     to get through the turnstiles,                 so    I turned back and went          to

him.      This was      quite a struggle         because of the        crush of people         pushing

through the gate.

I got     back to him and went           through a t m f iY s t yi e , I do not know w hich

one,     but the    person    in atte nd an ce at the           cxirnstile took the      relevant

portion of my ticket and             returned the stub to me.              This stub      is no

longer     in my    possession as        I gave    it to              because    of the

po ss ib il it y of obtaining a ticket for the                   replayed game.

Once     inside the ground we m oved forwards a few yards,                      where    I saw an

open     gateway    in front of us,        maybe    slightly to the        right      of us,     There

was a P ol i ce m an at that      gate,     together with a man           I took to be a

groundsman,        a lt ho u gh he was    not wearing any          identif ic at io n as far as         I

remember.        We went     through the gate believing               it was the way to our

stand and we wa nt ed to get to our seat as quickly as                          possible.       The

gate was     closed behind us when                       realised that we had gone             the

w rong way so we turned          round,     told the P o l i c e m a n that we had gone the

wrong way and he          let us back through the gate.                At the time       he    let us

thro ug h several        fans went   through the same way.               I heard the

gr ou nd s ma n tell    the P ol i ce m an to leave        the/gate     open.

On going     back through this           small    gate w eX be g an    to run along      the

w a lk w ay towards      the stand   for w hich we^'tad tickets,            as we did         I saw

about     ten or fifteen youths and -fffen ypinating                  up against      railings       or a

wall     to my   right.

we    ran along     to the entrance        steps    to the       part of the stand m ar ke d on

our tickets,        I cannot    remember      if it was a number          or a lettered area,

but    it was    near    to the half way         line.

There was        some              g and    crushing along         these    steps       into the stand,
                       M
W he n we got      in              stand    I saw two stewards,            who were        identified by

their     clothing as stewards,              who were      checking       tickets and         pointing

fans     in the    right d i re ct io n for their           respective       seats,        if as ked to do

so .

Mine     was    checked and        I went with                  to the seats allocated.                    On

a rr iving at the seats we found that someone was                           in                   s eat

          told him to move,            which he did.

On sitting        down       I looked ar ou nd the ground and saw about 50                        people

either     sat or lying           down behind the dead ball               line,     behind the goal at

the L e p pings Ln entrance              end,     I thought       this was       very strange,             but

b e l i e v e d that       too many    people had got       in and the Police              had    let them

out of the terraces,                  I could see a number          of P ol i ce m en milling

around,        but did not w orry about            it too much.           It was about 3 . 06pm

(1506)     at this time,           I know this      because as we sat down                 I asked

how muc h of the game we had missed.

I began to w atch the game and saw Liverpoc^r had gained a corner,                                          it

was     taken and          I saw B EA R DS L EY shoot at sroal.           This shot        hit the

crossbar and there was a reaction frojf the                         crowd,       s i m ul t an e ou s ly    I

looked towards              the L ep pings Ln endiand saw that              the     crowd     reaction was

as     is normal,       that    is to surge f o r w a r d s , however' no one seemed to move

 back as normally happens.         s^Temed an irregular movement.  Almost

 straight af ter this, wi ihin a minute or two, 1* saw a Po 11 ceman run

over     to the    referee and          point    towards    the West S ta nd area,               after which

the     referee    took the        players      off the    pitch.     A short         time after           this       I

could see fans              climbing    over the front          perimeter    fence       of the Leppings

Ln end     into the          pitch and     I could see fans         being    lifted from the areas

could not see what was                 happening at the fence             or gates,        w hich are set

into     the fence          because    of the amount       of    people    on the       pitcn and around

the goal area.

I could see more Police Officers                     corning     into the area of the        pitch

near       to the West Stand,          but      I cannot recall          where they came from,       I

also       saw St Johns amb ul an ce            Officers moving          about and an a mbulance

came       onto   the   pitch.

I saw one fan running from that area                        of the       ground towards where we

were       sitting and       I could see that his            right arm a pp ea re d    broken    in two

places       because       of the shape       of it.

I still       did    not    realise    the gravity of the s i tu at io n until             I saw a

person       being      carried from the area on a stretcher with                     a coat covering

his face.           On seeing      this     I formed the o p in io n         that he was   dead as       you

w ou l d    not    cover someones          face with ar coat unless          they were dead.

N u m erous       people were       carried off am stretchers and makeshift

s t retchers made           from a d v e r t i s i n g boards.

E v e r y t h i n g a pp ea re d   chaotic lyo no one          could unde rs ta nd what      exactly

was    happening.           There were       no a n no u nc em en ts    on the   public address

We    remained       in our seats          until we heard an ann ou nc em en t        on the address

s ystem asking          everyone      to    leave   in an orderly manner,           this was at

about 4 . 20p m         (1620).

We    left    the ground at about             4 .30pm    (1630),       whe n most of the g round had




away.        Also    that    the    kick off time        could have       been put back and

            I was   shown a map of the H i ll s bo r ou g h ground by POL                                    onto

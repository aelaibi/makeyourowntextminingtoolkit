           I am a fully qualified paramedic with the Derbyshire Ambulance

           Servi ce .    I have been in the service for 10 years & have been a

           paramedic for 12 months.



           On Saturday 15th April      1989 (150489)       *—     — nn/R -Ham (0800)         4.0prn

           (1600) duty, with another      paramedic,                        in a fully equipped

           accident & emergency ambu l a n c e .              :
                                                    At abcrat 3.25pm       (1525)   that day we

           had a message from our ambulance          control     to the effect that the South

           Yorkshire Ambulance Service          required assistance at the Hillsborough

           Football Stadium in Sheffield.          At that time we were not told by radio

           the nature of the incident.



           As we crossed the borders      into South Yorkshire we went onto the
                                                                       PAGE       2
                                                                       S 3471

SYMAS Radio Channel and told to go direct to the stadium. We were

still not given any details of the incident we were attending.



We arrived at the ground at about 3.55pm      (1555) and were directed by

police into the ground area,      that I understand was the Leppings Lane

end of the ground.    We drove up the side of tha/^round and were

confronted with a line of bodies      laying aga>r>st the wall of the ground,



As we arrived a South Yorkshire AmbuLance Control vehicle left the

scene,   so we had no ambulance    p^r>«nnel to report to.



We got out of our ambulance, and together, went to one of the

casualties at the ground to assess the situation,,                     was

with the first one,   I went to the second one, and after a brief period

1 realised he was deceased.             began to treat his casualty,    and I

went to our ambulance for more equipment.       I took the equipment to

         then I started to treat another    person, at first by a police

constable and then very shortly afterwards      I was Joined by a man

saying he was a doctor .



I do not know the identity of any of the persons who helped me,

nor can I describe any of the casualties,      other than to say they all

appeared to be young men.



After a short time of being with the doctor he said we were wasting

our time with that particular patient.       I then helped                   to

load his patient onto a SYMAS ambulance & ha went off with that

ambulance to the hospital.     I then looked and saw the doctor was

at the other end of the line of persons      lying on the ground & 1

presumed he had carried out a brief examination of each of them.
                                                                                       PAGE    3
                                                                                       S3V71



             I went to the doctor & asked if there was anything       1 could do.      He

             intimated there was nothing to be done.



             We were then told to go to the gymna s 1urn.    I d o n ’t know by who,    so

             together, we ran around the ^f'ont to the gyre.     The doctor    liaised

             with medical staff already at the gym.       He was told that most of

             the injured had been dealt with & were waiting to go to hospital

             and so again there was nothing more for us to do.



             I returned to my ambulance at the Leppings Lane end which had

             been looked after by an observer who had beer: out with on the shift

      oJ'A   that day.    The observer was                     a girl from

<ML                               who had been with us that day, as part of her

             training    in connection with the                                          On
QjU^cr^
             my return I found that approximately six           nts had been loaded
s
             into the vehicle and            was in fact recording details and talking

             to them to keep them calm,



             I checked over the patients in the ambulance & found that they were

             suffering minor
                                                  X
                                rib & arm injuries.    ihere were no more serious

             casualties to be dealt with &/so, after      liaison with a South Yorkshire

             Ambulance Officer at the sarene,     it was decided to take the people we

             had in the ambulance to / h e Royal Hal lamshi re Hospital.      This we did.



             I then returned to the vehicle and the control eventually told me to

             go to the Herris Road Bus Station to standby.       I there met

             and he and his equipment were returned to the ambulance.          We were

             eventually stood down at about 6 . 3 0 pm (1830) & returned to our

             station.

         None of the persons    I took to the hospital appeared to be in any

         danger.    They were all able to walk.

           HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY

          Thank you for your letter of 25 October with enclosures which you faxed to
          me.

          You will recall that we had our telephone conversation of this morning and
          we agreed the following:-

                  1.     That I would invite the Forensic Science service to examine the
                         barrier 124a and Dr Nicholson's findings as reported in his initial
                         report (of which you have a copy) and his second report which is
                         presently in draft. I have already put these arrangements in hand.

                  2.    I will write to Dr Nicholson and ask you if he is happy with the
                        tests he has carried out on the barrierand ask him to confirm, in
                        writing, that he has no further use for the barrier from his point
                        of view.

                 3.     Having received Dr Nicholson's letter and also the advice from the
                        Forensic Science service, I will write formally to Lord Justice
                        Taylor and seek his approval to release the barrier. No doubt he
                        will consult his technical advisor, Professor L Maunder of the
                        University of Newcastle.

                 4.     I will write a similar letter to Dr S Popper, HM Coroner in
                        Sheffield, seeking the appropriate approval.

                 5.     I will write to the Police Complaints Authority and advise them
                        what I am doing for information only.


                                                                                                                   Cont.
      PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE A T . . . . B l ™ l n ? 1?£l11? ..........................................................
                                     - 2



    6.   That on receipt of these approvals from Dr Nicholson, Forensic
         Science service, Lord Justice Taylor and Dr Popper, I will write to
         you, giving their responses. No doubt at that point you would want
         to raise your interest as detailed in your letter of 25 October to
         Messrs Hammond Suddards and proceed with the owners, Hammond
         Suddards and the other litigants who have an interest in the case.
         It may be that when samples are taken and tests carried out you may
         wish to involve the Forensic Science service.

You will recall in our telephone conversation I referred to a letter from
Davies, Arnold & Cooper, Solicitors, who represent the interests of
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club. A copy of this letter is also enclosed.

        Dear Mr Jones

        Hillsborough/Crush Barriers

        I enclose a copy of a letter dated the 11th September from Mr
        Heyes of the Health and Safety Executive in response to my
        letter of the 24th August.   I understand that copies of the
        relevant correspondence between my firm and Mr Heyes are in
        your possession.

        As  you will   appreciate,  a number   of experts   have   been
        instructed by the parties to the civil claims to advise upon
        the effect of the missing barrier, and also as to the adequacy
        or otherwise of the broken barrier ie, barrier 124A.     I note
        that the Health and Safety Executive have yet to complete
        their tests both in relation to the broken barrier, and those
        further barriers that were removed on the 7th July.

        It would be of great assistance if you would kindly confirm
        when it is likely those investigations or tests now being
        conducted  by   the   Health  and   Safety   Executive,  will  be
        completed.   A Pre-Trial Review will take place on the 26th
        October before     Mr Justice  Rose   in   Manchester,  and   the
        arrangements for the experts involved will be considered.

        As the barriers are of course the property of the Club,                                                                                                                                            it is
        likely that our Counsel will be asked the following :~

        1.                        When  the  investigations  by the Health                                                                                                             and              Safety
                                  Executive are likely to be completed.

        2.                        Whether the test results so far obtained by the Health
                                  and  Safety Executive   will  be  disclosed   for  the
                                  purposes  of the civil actions, and the likely    date
                                  when such information will be made available.


                                                                                                                                                                                           C o n t d ../..

       3-      Whether those experts to the civil actions may have
               access to the barriers to carry out their own tests
               and when.

       The above request is of some importance as it is likely at the
       hearing on the 26th October that a trial date will be given
       probably in May/June 1990, and there may be some concern that
       the e x p e r t ’s involved will not have a proper or reasonable
       opportunity in which to consider the evidence in relation to
       crush barriers.

       I would like to be able to refer to the latest position rather
       than  simply  refer  to the letter of    the   11th September.
       Accordingly, I would ask you to comment upon the above points
       so that I, in turn, can make use of your replies at the Pre-
       Trial Review.

       I  look   forward   to   hearing   from   you   at     your    earliest
       convenience.

       Yours sincerely



       PETER DOYLE

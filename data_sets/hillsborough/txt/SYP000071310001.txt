             the Heart Of England supp

            On Saturday 15 May 1989rl went to the Hillsborough F o o t b a l 1 ground to

             see Liverpool           play Nottingham Forest.



            Secretary,

               he day.

            At about       10.30 am on the day I went to Coventry City Cent re outside

             the Rocket        p u b ,/neai^ to the Railway Station.    I went with my brother

                     who       is a l w a supporters    club member and the coach pick up

             point was outs i/qfe this p u b .

            When we arrived at the pub the coach was already there.                 The   coach was
                                                                                                PAGE         2
                                                                                                S 1537

          about a quarter full, as Coventry was the first pick up point.                         The

          coach was a Lloyds of Muneaton coach whi ch is the company normally

          used by the supporters       club.

          I k n e w XsxBfne

                                      and                   ^ There,was also a lad I
                                                                       ...    _ —Xs*
          kffow from a Y        scheme by the            of                             I didn't know

          anyone else,

          We set off just a f t e r we yot      there   and stopped three times on the way.

          These were all pick up points at Nuneaton,                   Hinckley, and Leicester.

          Several    people got on at each point however,                    I did not recogise or

          know any of them.       In fact    I did not pay much attention to them.

          We were sitting       in the middle of the          coach,    on the left hand side,         and

          I had the aisle seat.        During the journey I only spoke to                           and

          his mates who I have already mentioned.                 Definately no one else.

          On the way to Sheffield               handed out the tickets for the ground.

                                   Mine was £6 Leppings Lane,Apart
                                                               standing
                                                                    from ticket
                                                                         the pick up

          points the only time we stopped on the way, was when a ^ jdo^ jt^ema^n                   n
                                                                                                   4=4.
          Leicester stopped us,       thinking we were Chelsea fans.                   This was only

          for a few minutes.       We were     in no traffic delays on the way and

          reached Sheffield at about 2 pm.              I can't remember where we parked,

          but it was     in a side street, about         10 minutes          from the ground.    We

          left the coach and me,                                                       walked to the

          ground.     I did not see anyone       I recognised from the coach at all on

          the way.     I did not see any disorder,             fighting or drunkeness on the

          way to the ground.

          We arrived at the entranj^ to the ground at about 2. 1tl^fm or 2.15 pm.
D .o /£
          There were small,      orderly queues at the turnstiles/and we stood in a

          |ueue of about 40y p e o p i e .   There were about t p r e e           policemen on each

          turnstiles,     searching people as they went J m .                  I was not searched     I

          did not see & x\y stewards outside the tyfnstiles.
                                                                                                  PAGE          3
                                                                                                  S I 537

                  I had no problems finding my turnstile and experience no difficulties

                  in entering the ground.         I went    in through a turnsitle and met the

                  other four inside the turnstiles.             I did not see or witness the

                  opening of any gates other than the turnstiles and did not see any

                  unauthorised entry to the ground.

                  On the ground side of the turnstiles,              there was a jovial atmosphere

                  and there was plenty of room in this              large open space.

                  We hung around inside whilst a couple of the               lads went to the toilet

                  then mde our way towards the tunnel.

                  We used the tunnel      because    it seemed the most direct route to the

                  stand,and everyone else was using           it.     I did not see e i t h e r police

                  officer or stewards at the tunne 1 entrance.               We had jPf^ee passage along

                  up our standing position with ea s e .            Wjr we re in Pen 3, as I now know

                  As time went on, morj/'and more people came             in and a lot of pushing

                  started.      We got more and more tightly packed and eventually the five

                  of us got split up.       I could not move my arms because of the amount of

                  people      pressing against me and at one point, my feet were            lifted off

                  the floor.       It was extremely hot and all         I could do was try to push

                  people back.      The more   I did this,     the more out of breath I became.             I

                  was gradual ly pushed mo re to the left hand side arrfr down towards the

                  fence.      There were people     climbing over my head/and up onto the fence.

                  I remember the players       coming onto the pitctyf and play starting.

                  There were people around me screaming and/shouting as the pushing got

                  worse.       1 did not see a barrier break a.% all.          I do not remember any

particular surges forward it was a gradual          build up.    Eventually I got

my arms free, and I remember someone grabbing me.

They pushed me under a barrier t                                estandand

shouted,    “Get out."    I then made                           unrsel.

I rememember that play had stopp                                no players were

on the pitch.     I cannot   remember                           ed.    When I got

to the tunnel    I was able to make my along easily,       not realising the

full   extent of what had happened.      I met           at the end of the

tunnel.

At no time during all     of this,   did I see any one I recognsied from our

supporters    club other that

We waited around for the other 3,                                     Por a while

and then when we couldn't find them made our way back to the coach.

We arrived back at the coach at about 3.45 pm me and                      be i ng

the first two b a c k .

I was not injured at all,       other than aching.     I did not witness any

death or assist anyone who was dead or injured.           I did not witness

anything    1 consider to be a criminal offence.        After the match was

stopped I feel that everyone did as much as they could to help.                     They

could not have done much more.

I d o n ’t think that anyone    in particular    is to blame for this

happening    I think we have said everything about       it.

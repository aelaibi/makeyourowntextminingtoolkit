Dear Professor Maunder

HIIXSBC8RDUGH DISASTER INQUIRY

Now that the Interim Report has been issued I would like to describe hew the
details of HSE's contribution will be reported and invite you to consider
requirements for additional work.

It is my intention to produce a compilation report, similar in style and format
to the first HSE report, covering the following areas: testing of turnstiles;
metallurgical assessment of barrier 124A; strength of crush barrier
calculations; finite element stress analysis of barrier 124A; calculation of
crowd capacity in Pens 3 and 4; further crowd density estimates in Pens 3 and 4
(including the 1988 semi-final); noise level measurements.

A length of wrought iron tube, from barrier 129, will be tested to establish
the flow stress but, since the calculations explain adequately the collapse of
barrier 124A, it does not at this stage seem necessary to commit further
resources to the testing of a complete barrier. I would welcome your views on
this matter and on any further work which may be required from HSE in the
second phase of the Inquiry. For example, do you foresee any HSE involvement
in the revision of the Green Guide?

In our internal discussions, a number of relevant areas in which information
appears to be lacking have been identified. These include: the relationship
between crowd density and surges â€¢ stresses induced in crush barriers by crowd
pressure; the height of crush barriers; methods of testing crush barriers.
Staff in HSE could, if required, be involved in the discussion of these topics
and it may be appropriate for research to be commissioned by the Home Office.

I am now on leave until 29 August. Please contact                        or            |if
any urgent matters arise before then.

Yours sincerely

Dear Len

Thank you for your letter of 18 August 1989 which I received on 29 August 1989
on my return from annual leave.

I note that you hope we will be involved in Phase 2, as indeed I do. I should
add that various associated topics are currently under discussion internally
within HSE so we will most probably continue seme of our work in any case.

With regard to the crush barriers, I am pleased to note that the Home Office
are assembling details of previous research findings.This will   be most useful
and I look forward to receiving a copy. I suggest we hold any further plans
for testing in abeyance until we have had a chance to digest all the data and
then arrange a meeting to discuss the way ahead.

I look forward to hearing from you in due course.

Yours sincerely

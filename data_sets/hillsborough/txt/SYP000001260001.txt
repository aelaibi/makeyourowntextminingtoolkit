     On 3 or 4 occasions                       in the      past      I've       been to stay at         I n g a ’s house

     when Marion w ou ld                  stop      over also.

     I met        Inga and M a r i o n outside S h e f f ie l d W e d n e s d a y Football                        Ground a t

     queue with              both girls waiting                 to enter          to see      the semi        final.

     We all        passed          hrough         the    t u r n s 1 i 1 es and took          up our    position        in the

     central         enclosure            at    the L ep pi n gs Ln S t a n di n g area.

     We were         stood be tween               the    last m e t a l ’S ta nd in g B a r f and the wire mes h

     f enee.

     I cannot             recall    the        time     but    the enclosure             seemed    to fill       up all     of a

     sudden and             people        behind were           pushing          forwards „

     At this         point       I lost         sight     of    Inga and Marion.

     The      pushing         behind       became        intense and             I was    pushed     up a g a i n s t the

     escaping             through a gate              in the fence and                 I went   onto    the football

              Furt h e r    to my s tatement          dated    16th April        1989       160489    I have        tried    to

              football         ground but         can ad d very    little,

              I ^am unajble to add a n y ^ mo r e           regarding      the hist or y of either M a r i a n

              M C C A B E or    Inga SHAH.          I can remember        that       they had t ravel led by train

              from L o n d o n to S h e f f i e l d and met at a           p r e- ar ra ng ed      point      in L ep pi n gs

              Ln.       I can remembe r t hat           the re was a lot of            people at       the      t u r ns ti le s

              but there was           no orde rl y queues.          At   this        time     there was       no    c ru shing

              or      pushing and we         got    into the    ground fairly             easily.      We all        had

              standing         tickets      for    the L ep pi n gs Ln end.          We had all        got     our    tickets

              thro ug h the        club as we were all            se as on ticket           holders.

Once    thro ug h the t u rn st il e we made               our way        into the tunnel            to get             to

the    terracing.           There was a steady flow of                     people     going down the

tunnel    but    nothing        excessive.          As we       got    onto    the te rr ac in g we w e n t to

the    right    of the fence w hi ch divides                    the    tunnel     m ou th and made             our way

down towards          the front        of the terrace            behind the goal.                I can     remember

that we     positioned our se lv es w ith the                    crush barrier          nearest        the      front

just    behind us.           B oth the fence at the               side      of us and the           pe rimeter

fence were about arms                length away.            M a ri a n and      Inga stood just               in

front    of me,       one step down.

At this     time      the    pens were       quite       full    but     I was able      to move a r ou n d

quite    easily.        There was a bit             of pushing and swaying                   but    nothing

unusual     in c omparison           to any other          football         match.      E ve ry on e      a ro u nd

seemed to be enjoying                the m se lv es and         I d o n ’t remember a n y th i ng              else

out    of the ordin ar y other              than    I was       s ur p ri s ed as the        time    passed that

more and more          people were          coining in an d m ov em e nt was             becoming

restricted.

I d o n ’t know what          the    time was       but    I remember          the    players       had    come             on

for a w ar m up and everyone was                    shouting          for A la n H A N S A N .      My next

r e co ll ec ti on    is that       the    game had star te d and              I was    knoc ke d from

behind and went             down    on the terracing.                 I was    face    down trying             to get

up but all       I could see was             legs and e verytime               I tried to get             up    I was

tr ampled      back down.           1 remember          feeling my        ribs    cracking.

It was whe n         I was    knoc ke d down that            I last saw M a ri a n and              Inga.           I

d o n ’t know    if they were             knoc ke d down w it h me.            I must    have       passed out

because     the next         thing     I remember         is coming         round on the           pitch near

the goa lm ou th and someone was                   spl as hi ng me w i t h water.

I stayed on the             pitch trying        to find the            two girls       but    I d i d n ’t see

them again until             a f t e r w a r d s when    I i de nt if ie d them        in the g y m n a s i u m as

I have stated          in my       previous     statement.             There     is nothing         further             I

can add as a lot of                it is still          a blank.

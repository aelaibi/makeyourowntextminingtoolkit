          Dear Mr. Sharp,                                                                         S T A F F O FFSID E



          Thank you very much                     for your letter of the 2nd of August.   I have read with
          interest the letter                     from the Crown Prosecution Service addressed to Hammond
          Suddards dated the                     26th of July.   I assume that in fact they have by now
          received the final                     police report.

          I have noted what you say regarding the Coronal side of things and am pleased
          that the situation is now resolved. I will, as you say, disregard your letter
          of the 17th of July 1990.

           Further to my previous statement dated 05/5/89 I would like to add the

           foilowi n g :-



           I am a senior house officer            in Renal and General Medicine MB ChB

           (Bristol    1986).

           On Saturday 15 April,        1989,     I was telephoned by the Northern General

           Hospital Switchboard at approximately 1530 hrs whilst on call from

           home.     I was asked to come into the hospital as there had been an

           incident at Hillsborough.            I reached the Northern General at 1550 hrs

           and was informed by a colleague,            Dr N B r u n s k i 11, that there appeared

           to be fatalities from television pictures.                     I reached the accident

           department at 1555 approximately.              I went to the triage             point and was

           asked by Dr Wardrobe        (Consultant     in A&E)        to count fatalities        in the
Plaster Room.   I initially,      in error, went to the A&E oiaster area?

this was being used as a resuscitation area.             Three yteenaged male

casualties were present.      I assisted Dr Stuart Cal/aer in resuscitating

a male   patient approximately      12 years old - at that stage there were

no signte of life in the patient.       I left that area after 1 - 2        minutes

as farther medical help became available.             I went to the Orthopaedic

Plaster Room. Here,    I examined the bodies of nine male victims and one
 [                                                ~
fy&male victim, assisted by S/N |                      J, There were no signs of

life in any of the victims,       in that no major       pulses were   palpable,      no

respiratory effort was observed.       The    pupils were fixed and dilated and

heart and breath sounds absent.       I certified these bodies as dead.

No form of indentification was present on the bodies of any victim.

I Later learnt from media coverage the female victim to be Victoria
 / i n
Micks. Whilst I was present a further male victim was brought in I

also examined and certified him to be dead./I again went to the triage

point and was asked to attend stretcher          casualties.    I saw between five

and ten teenaged male victims, all of whom had soft tissue               crush

injuries.   I returned to the Orthopaedic Plaster Room at approximately

1640 hrs. No new fatalities were       present.       Three Police Officers were

present. A female officer gave me a verbal             description obtained from a

male   relative consistent with the appearance of Victoria Hicks.                At

this stage the majority of stretcher victims had been cleared from the

A&E Department,   having been transferred to Ward 60.           I went to Ward 60,

most beds were occupied by victims each with an attendant Nurse.                  A

large number of medical and nursing staff were present. None of the

patients required urgent treatment.          I examined a male casualty with

severe bruising of his right thigh and arranged for X ray. He was

enquiring of the whereabouts of his ten year old son from whom he had

become separated. All the remaining casualties had been re-assessed by

the staff already p r e se nt .
                                                                                    PAGE        3
                                                                                    S575A

         At approximately 1700 hrs I returned to the A&E and finding no

         casualties    requiring treatment went back to Ward 60. Most medical

         staff were redundant by virtue of their number. The casualties were

         awaiting   investigation or transfer to other wards.        I re-attended A& E

         at approximately 1220 hrs Nursing Staff were tidying the department.               A

         non- Hillsborough casualty was in the department,          a middle aged lady

         with fractured humerus.       At 1730 hrs I went to the Physiotherapy

         Department where the    "walking wounded"    casualties had been sent.       I

         found no one still    requiring medical attention,       as was also the

         situation in A & E    and Ward 60.    I left the A & E    Department at    1815

 ^       hrs and returned to my duties       in the medical wards.    I had no further-

             States s

             Since making my previous statements           1 have   moved hospitals and now

             work in Leeds at the above address.

             In respect of my previous statements             I would   like to state that      I have

             been as accurate as possible under the circumstances and all                    times

             given are approximations.

             I now accept that the times stated in my first statement dated 5.5.89

              (050589) are inaccurate as I did not arrive at the Northern Genera.:

             Hos pi tal         effield until approximately 15,50 hours         (1550)

             In relatii/n to my second statement,          dated 26.7,89      (260789)     these times

             are also approximations and are as accurate as I could re call at the

             time.      I do however accept that they may be incorrect.              The    reason

             being that throughout the course of events that afternoon the time did
                                                                                                  PAGE    2

         not appear     important as I was more           concerned in the treatment and

         welfare of the patients,

         I did during the afternoon of Saturday 15th April                     1989    (150489)

         initially examine the bodies of ni n^ /m a 1e victims and one female

         An additional male was brought to the plaster                     room whilst    I was

         present,      I am unable to state what time this occurred but I did

         examine this body and certified him d e a d .

         At the time I did not know the identifications of these                        persons but
                                                                /                                   s-

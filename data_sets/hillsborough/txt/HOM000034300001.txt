Mr Maclean

HILLSBOROUGH

We are currently examining the report from South Yorkshire which considers whether
there is new evidence which would justify reopening the inquiry into the Hillsborough
disaster. Whatever decision Ministers finally reach, it will be important to show that
each aspect of the charges made by the Granada programme Hillsborough has been
carefully examined.

2.      Most of the charges were listed in the form of a series of questions which were
made public through a Granada press release but there appears to be some uncertainty
about the precise nature of the allegations made by the video technician Mr Roger
Houldsworth. We also feel that it is important to ask the Hillsborough Family Support
Group whether there are any other concerns that were not covered in the Granada
programme which they would wish the Home Secretary to consider before he came to
a decision on whether to reopen the inquiry. We are therefore seeking your agreement
that we should contact Mr Kilfoyle, the Member for Liverpool, Walton, who has been
representing many of the bereaved families and who should be in a position both to
explain Mr Houldsworthâ€™s concerns and to put us in touch with the Hillsborough
Family Support Group. If you agree that we should contact Mr Kilfoyle, we will of
course keep Richard Wells, the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire informed.

     HILLSBOROUGH: COSTS OF INQUIRIES BY WEST MIDLANDS POLICE


     I attach a copy of Mr Johnston's letter of 21 August to Mr
     Addison together with a draft reply which I propose to send as
     soon as possible.  I would appreciate your comments.

^ 2.   Now that South Yorkshire are        minded to accept our offer of a
  special payment I think we should        be in a position to make
  financial assistance available to        them as soon as possible. It
  is at least one incentive to them        to take it now even if itdoes
  not offer them all they want.

     3.   Following discussion between our staff it has been suggested
     that we should write to HM Treasury seeking their agreement to a
     call on the reserve.  We have drafted the attached letter for
     your consideration which attempts to persuade Treasury to use the
     "urgent" procedure for drawing on the reserve.  I do think this
     is important.  Perhaps you will wish to discuss this with me
     before I go on leave tomorrow evening.

                         POLICE


                         Thank       you     for     your       letter      of     21    August       to    Mr     Addison
                         informing us that South Yorkshire Police Authority is now
                         prepared          to    agree that           it will        reimburse West Midlands
                         Police           Authority              the       additional                c o sts      of         the
                         investigation              by    the      West      Midlands          Police       subject           to
                         clarification              of    some      matters.             I   am      replying           in    Mr
                         Addison's absence on leave.


                         It    is    a matter            of long-standing Government policy that
                         Central Government grant should not be paid on interest
                         costs.        We cannot therefore consider paying special grant
                         or indeed ordinary police grant on any interest charged
                         by      the      West       Midlands          Police         Authority.               For       your
                         information we are not aware                            of any       instance where one
                         police        authority          has    agreed       to pay another               interest on
                         the costs of an investigation.




       H.O. EST. 112
S536                                                                                                       35688 9.85 XNW
With regard to whether the special payment will cover the
cost      of     the    criminal         investigation             announced         recently,
this was not included in the original offer of a special
payment.         Moreover, investigation of criminal offences is
part      of     the    force's          normal       function.           However,          as Mr
Addison's         letter       of    9        August       indicated,         we    anticipate
that      much     of    the       work        already         completed       by    the     West
Midlands         police as part of their original                              investigation
should         prove    helpful          to    the     new criminal            investigation
and will still qualify for the special payment.


If       South     Yorkshire         Police           Authority          wish       to     pursue
special         payment       for    new        work       related       to    the       criminal
investigation            we will          need       to    consider       this      separately
with      details        of    costs          and    reasons       why    your       authority
considers these costs should qualify for special payment.


Mr Walker         in his       recent telephone conversation with us
asked      for clarification of the penultimate paragraph of
Mr Addison's            letter of 9 August and whether the special
payment        will     apply       to    the       costs       of work undertaken by
We s t     Midlands           Police           connected          with        the    Coroner's
inquest,         discipline and complaints investigation.                                   As Mr
Addison         stated    in       his    letter much             of    the work          already
undertaken         will       be    relevant              to   these     areas       with    some
presentational            adjustment.                However,          I can confirm that
the additional costs of such further work carried out on
behalf of the South Yorkshire Police by the West Midlands
Police in these areas will qualify for special payment.


As Mr Addison's letter made clear any work which is being
undertaken by forces other than West Midlands in relation
to   disciplinary             investigations                   would    not     qualify       for
special payment and as stated above we will require more
information about the major criminal                               investigation costs
before making a decision on whether to include these in
the special payment arrangements.
In conclusion, we suggest that your authority should make
arrangements for paying the outstanding amounts to avoid
further delay.       We   are   in contact with       HM Treasury to
organise the method of making special payments to you to
assist with     meeting   the   costs   and our Finance Division
will be   in contact with your Finance Department as soon
as   possible   to   discuss    and   arrange   the    mechanism   for
reimbursement.

            I have       p r eviously s u b m i t t e d my        recollections         in respect of the events

            that      took        place at H i l l s b o r o u g h on      15 April    1989    (130489)     and     I now

            w i s h to clarify             certain matters         in respect         of deceased       persons      I dealt

            with.



            I e n t e r e d the ground             via P e n i s t o n e Rd and went         straight    to the

            Le p p i n g s    Ln end of the g r o u n d .          The     players were        leaving the        pitch,    so

            it w o u l d have            been a bout 3 . 0 7 pm       (1307).     Spectators,        some    in a

            distressed             condje-tion, were       coming       out of the      perimeter       gate     from P e n 4

            onto      the     pit^t.         I a s s i s t e d some of these and            th^n   I retur n e d to the

            per imetery^ e n c e .             Spectators    at the f ront., of^/f^en 4 w ere shouting                 that

            they'st"f'eading on people who had                     collapsed to the floor.                  I tried to

            as s i s t   persons who were              climbing       over    the top of the fencing,               but this

                                                                                                                        S2494A

                  did not       relieve     the    pressure       in the      pen sufficiently.             I then saw a

                  male    person      lying on the          floor.         He was about      one yard back         from the

                  front    of the      pen and about          two yards           from the dividing metal            fence

                  w i t h Pen 5.



                  1 w o u l d describe       the m a n as being about 3 2 - 3 3 yrs of^ar-gi, well                         built,

                  witrh a beer belly.              He had      light brown hair,            pos^l'bly even a ginger

                  colour.        He was wearing a white or                   light c o l o r e d shirt. I think                  it
^     I      4^                                                                       "/
                  was    short-sleeved.             It had buttons           up the f r ont w hich were all
IolC-
    ckjt-G        undone.        He was wear i n g         jeans.      I remember        seeing a red mark           on the

l-^>. k<5<>t-uy           S ide of his stomach.               His     fa^_js«^s a yel l o w       colour,     his eyes were

                  open and to me he a p p e a r e d dead.                   The    perimeter     fencing was       ripped

                  open,    and with other            officers,        I carried the man onto the                pitch.           He

                  was    placed on the            pitch about 8 yards              out a n d direc t l y     in front       of

                  the hole that had been               ripped       in the fencing.            A s p e c t a t o r , who    I

                  cannot    describe,         star t e d    to a d m i n i s t e r m o u t h to m o u t h   resuscitation.

                  Another       gave him heart massage.                    They were     unsuccessful         in reviving

                  him and       event u a l l y    I he l p e d to place him           in a nearby St Johns

                  a m bulance.        I had no further            dealings wit h this            person.

Dear Lord Justice Taylor,

I am the author of the enclosed Sunday Times piece about the reaction to
your final report on the Hillsborough disaster. You may remember that The
Sunday Times ran a campaign on the issue of football safety in the months
after Hillsborough.

I had originally intended to send you this piece as a matter of courtesy.

However, in the last couple of days, several newspapers have reported that
you have undergone a change of heart on the issue of all seat-stadiums. I
enclose copies of two such reports, in The Independent on Sunday of January
26 and The Daily Telegraph of January 27.

I am mindful of your apparent wish to make no further comment on the issue
of safety at football. I do not wish to butt in on a privacy, both professional
and personal, that you may wish to maintain on this issue.

I am not asking for an interview. Or even necessarily, a comment on these
reports.

But in view of a supposed change of heart that has been so widely reported
in the public domain, I feel it would be remiss to-not ask you if there is
any substance to these reports.

I will obviously respect whatever form - on or off the record - you may wish
to use in replying to this letter.

With all best wishes,

Yours sincerely,




Chris Lightbown

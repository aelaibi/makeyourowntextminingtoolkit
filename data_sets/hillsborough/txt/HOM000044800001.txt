We have received further correspondence from relatives of the Hillsborough victims,
referring both to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s recent off-the-cuff comments in
Liverpool, and to what they perceive to be the limitations of the Judge’s terms of
reference (enclosed behind).
                                                                                      "ifS

Recommendation

3.        That you reply to the correspondence along the lines of the attached drafts.

Consideration

4.     My submission of 22 October (attached) covered the background and reaction
to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s comments. He remains committed to the scrutiny, and
has not indicated that he finds his terms of reference to be restrictive.

Handling/presentation

5.     Hillsborough disaster relatives have in the past received S of S replies. There
are no additional handling considerations.

Dear Home Secretary.
                                   Re    Hillsborough Scrutiny.

It is with great sadness we write to you regarding the Hillsborough Scrutiny, after two
meetings with Lord Justice Stuart -Smith , firstly with other families then a 30minute
private meeting after which we were convinced that the terms of reference are far to
narrow to give any semblance of a way forward to the rightful justice we deserve.

New Evidence The missing video tape of events prior to 3-00 pm showing the build-up
of over crowding in pens 3 & 4.
Having visited the control box during the inquest it was plain to see with the naked eye
the build -up to over crowding in the central pens and the lack of supporters in the side
pens. Surely any intelligent person would ask himself why this was happening and realise
that too many people were coming through the tunnel and not being directed to the side
pens. I mention inteligence for its something I was led to beleive all Police Officers had,
let alone Superintendants who controlled the box or was there a lack of assistance from
the established officers to the "NEW BOY" .Duckinfield due to the removal of "their"
Commander Chief Superintendent Brian Mole who was relieved of his command due to
disciplinary measures taken by the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Peter Wright due
to an embarrassing prank that whent terribly wrong ( details of which I enclose in this
letter.
Police Disciplinary enquiry was conducted by the Chief Constable of South Cumbria and
was conveniently side stepped by Duckinfield and Murray, the evidence gathered by the
afore mentioned should be made available to Lord Justice Stuart -Smith in full.
The 3 -15 pm Cut-off time by the Coroner was a complete cover-up so as not to allow
questions to be asked regarding the emergency services when it is known that many of
the fans who died were still alive after that time and with proper medical treatment and
care would still be alive today.
All theseoinanswered questions need to be answered UNDER OATH in a court of law. We
look tp'youAo be forthcoming in ordering a new enquiry.

The Home Secretary
Rt. Hon. Jack Straw
50 Queen Annes Gate
London, SW1H 9AT

c.c. Rt. Hon. T Blair
     Rt. Hon. E O’Hara

Dear Mr Straw,

                       The Hillsborough Disaster, April 1989
                           Scrutiny of “New Evidence”

We are writing to express our extreme dismay in relation to the remark made by Lord
Justice Smith on Monday, 6 October, along with other issues we believe require
comment. As you may be aware the remark was made to Mr Hammond who lost his
14 year old son at Hillsborough. Far from being “late” for our meeting with Lord
Justice Smith, quote, “like Liverpool fans arriving at Hillsborough” we, along with the
other families awaited his arrival at the venue for the initial meeting; whilst he played
court to the media circus. We would like to say, never has any member of the
Establishment generated such intense disgust, but we have found this sort of
ignorant/arrogant behaviour commonplace.

We have personally expressed our opinions as to the remark to Lord Justice Smith.
He did apologise, but may we add, many of the families felt that the proceedings had
already been undermined.

We attended a second personal meeting on Tuesday, 7 October, in relation to the
circumstances surrounding the loss of our son James. The conclusion we came to
following the meeting, was that Lord Justice Smith is far from “open minded”. Our
initial optimism that a new Government would bring a fresh “open” approach to the
issues is waning rapidly.

We have been advised that if the outcome of the “scrutiny” is unfavourable our legal
options are limited. This is because six of the families received a Judicial review.
Why should the remaining families be penalised? We would welcome clarification,
we believe this is grossly unfair given that generalisations as to the specific
circumstances surrounding the loss of our loved ones cannot be made.

We have studied the statement you made to the House of Commons on Monday, 30
June, 1997, and we request clarification of a number of points relating to your
statement and other matters.
(i)     If, as you state, Lord Taylor cited the main reason for the disaster was the
        failure of police control, how could the DPP find that there was insufficient
        evidence for a prosecution(s)?

(ii)    Is it not true that Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and indirectly, the Football
        Association owed a Common Law Duty of Care to the spectators on that fateful
        day, to ensure their health and safety whilst on the premises? If so are there
        not grounds for a civil prosecution for negligence?

(iii)   Could you explain why the Coroner’s rules, whilst prohibiting the framing of an
        inquest verdict in such a way as to appear to determine any question of
        criminal liability; can be used as a means of restricting the terms of reference,
        “3.15 pm cut off’, of subsequent investigations, e.g. the scrutiny. It is a fact
        that some of our loved ones were alive post 3.15 pm, yet events after this time
        cannot be investigated. We request that you intervene even at this late stage
        and amend the terms of reference to include evidence after 3.15 pm.

(iv) Could you explain why the blood alcohol concentration of the deceased,
     including children was determined and used in the inquest? Yet the blood
     alcohol levels of those who where responsible for their safety were not
     assessed? Could you determine on our behalf why Dr Popper chose to include
     this data as evidence and yet discount so much other information?

(v)     Could you explain why the HSE were never involved in the investigations into
        the disaster as you know they carry a Royai Warrant and are quite capable of
        investigating organisations, e.g. Police, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

(vi) Could you provide a copy of the DPP’s conclusions as to why no person should
     be subject to criminal proceedings? This disaster was not an “Act of God”, our
      loved ones were killed due to human failings at every level.

(vii) Could you explain why investigations into possible criminal proceedings
      against the Police are conducted by the Police? This undermines public
      confidence, and requires review. We require an organisation similar to the FBI.
      I hope you will consider such a possibility in future legislation to improve our
      democratic process.

(viii) The Police Complaints Authority found that both the Chief Superintendent in
        charge on the day, and Superintendent should face disciplinary charges for
        neglect of duty. Why can retirement due to ill health be used as an escape
        route. The Police disciplinary rules must be changed. Does not a vicarious
        liability remain with the South Yorkshire Police? Please clarify.

 (ix)   Forgive us, but we do not understand how the Attorney General and the DPP
        can say that the new evidence does not justify fresh criminal investigations, if
        the independent scrutiny by Lord Justice Smith finds in our favour, their “view”
        is wrong. It appears almost like a verdict being reached before there is a trial,
        please explain, as we are beginning to see the scrutiny as a sham, a tactic, a
        device, of which we have many examples over the past 8 years.
(x)   Would you explain where the “evidence not previously available” came from?
      Was it wilfully withheld/filtered out or “conveniently” lost? Provided the
      circumstances surrounding this evidence can be established, is not withholding
      evidence a criminal offence?

We believe only a comprehensive unfettered review/inquiry of all of the evidence and
events surrounding the tragedy both before, during and after will satisfy our desire
for the truth. Irrespective of the outcome of the “Scrutiny” our resolve will remain
indefatigable to attain our goal. Our lives were irrevocably changed as a result of the
events on that fateful day, we have seen families torn apart, lost lovedones through
grief and stress, suffered all manner of slander/libel at the hands of the media, and
professional people. To you this is one of many issues, to all of the families the fight
for truth and justice has become the focus of our lives.

Thank you in advance for taking the trouble to answer our questions.

Yours expectantly,




Mr 5?. Mrc Ae»r\inol1

Dear Mr Straw,

                        The Hillsborough Disaster April 1989
                            Scrutiny of “New Evidence”

We are writing to express our serious concern in relation to the remark made by Lord
Justice Smith on Monday, 6 October, 1997, along with other matters. The remark
was made in full view of the media, the context of the remark and the person to
whom it was made generated intense distress. Mr Hammond lost his 14 year old son
at Hillsborough, we cannot find anything “humorous” in the circumstances that
surrounded the loss of our loved ones.

To infer, however flippantly, that one of the factors in the disaster was the late arrival
of Liverpool fans, gives credence to one of the many myths created following the
tragedy. Late arrival at public events by large numbers of people has always been a
common occurrence. To my knowledge this factor is always considered in the
planning of policing of major public events, so effective crowd control can be
ensured. At the semi final of 1988, same teams, same venue, same terracing
allocation; the crowd was filtered through police lines at least 100 yards from the
turnstiles. In 1989 the police singularly failed in their common law duty of care to the
public arriving at the venue.

We have already expressed our revulsion to the Lord Justice at his remarks and he
has apologised. Unfortunately, the tone of the proceedings were marred as a result.
This is not the first and probably not the last time we have suffered as a result of
unprofessionalism from so called professional people.

We attended a second pre-arranged private meeting on Tuesday, 7 October. Any
residual confidence which we had in Lord Justice Smith was eroded still further by
comments made during our discussions. The conclusion we came to following the
meeting was that Justice Smith does not appear to have an open mind in relation to
the issues which surround the disaster; even though he denied this.

With reference to the letter we received from you relating to the Scrutiny, you stated
that “no matter of significance would be overlooked”. The terms of reference for the
Scrutiny are extremely limited, could you explain this apparent contradiction?
We consider the suppression of evidence at the original inquests to be of paramount
significance, yet according to the terms of reference this cannot be classified as “new
evidence”. To our utter dismay 3.15 pm will again be used as a legal device for
evading a thorough and open assessment of the events.

We would like to take this opportunity to raise some further points and request that
the following questions must be answered:-

♦   Why wasn’t the “Major Accident and Emergency Plan” put into operation
    immediately?

♦   Why were only 14 of the 96 victims of the tragedy taken to hospital?

♦   Why weren’t the paramedics stationed outside the ground allowed access to
    attend to the casualties?

Again Lord Justice Smith operating within the “shackles” of his terms of reference
believes these questions lie outside. You as the Home Secretary have the power to
change his terms of reference!

We were dismayed by Lord Justice Smith’s comment that he was not concerned that
only rewritten statements made by Police Officer’s on duty at Hillsborough were used
in the inquest. If the Law allowed criminals the right to rewrite their statements to put
them in a better light, our prisons would be empty.

We have, and will continue, to conduct our campaign constructively, but as
highlighted earlier, we are becoming more pessimistic as to the outcome of the
scrutiny given its inherent handicap. After eight years of inquests/additional reviews
etc, we are no longer naive in respect of the vagaries of the legal process of this
country.

The fact that the Government appointed Lord Justice Smith, brings us to the belief
that you must have some knowledge of his apparent “pre-disposition” to the issues.
We have as a result, to consider the Government’s “pre-disposition” and what
they/you are prepared to consider a reasonable outcome.

We will shortly reach a decision as a family on the way the Scrutiny is proceeding,
and if possible we would welcome a response to the matters raised, to aid our
decision.

May we add that irrespective of the outcome of the “Scrutiny” our resolve to see truth
and justice triumph will remain unabated. We owe no less and much more to the
memory of all the victims of the disaster, not withstanding the personal loss of our
son and his girlfriend. Thank you for taking the time to read this letter.

                                                                  •   V



          I am writing to you firstly to ex ^ r^s'ip ^ o n cem s over Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s          \A
          remarks about Liverpool Fans. I wa^Q tti^f theAmilies meeting him that day.                    ^
         *TEowasupposedly unbiased person of s i ^ m j h standing, appointed by yourself, to conduct D
          an already sensitive issue, could say such a Ming almost beggars belief. I reluctantly
          accepted his apology with reservations.                                      "    '--------->

          Secondly, I must also set down my concerns about your terms of reference. Lord Justice
          Stuart-Smith himself, said he was very restricted by them, as only fresh evidence was going
          to be considered. My concern is about suppressed evidence, which apparently cannot be
          considered, as it was available to the coroner. The fact that he did not call this, was his own
          choice, and we had no right to insist that he called key witnesses. At this point I would like
          to refer to a letter I received from you. It has no reference number, but I believe it was sent
          to all o f the families dated 30th June 1997.1 quote one paragraph. "I have decided, in all
    I     circumstances, that there should be an independent scrutiny to ensure that no m atter of
          significance is overlooked before a final decision is taken". I take this at face value, and I
          have many significant matters that concern me, but they do not fit into the terms of
          reference. I feel as though I have been put into bat, with not one, but both hands tied behind
          my back.

          I would like to further state that I feel the inquest was invalid and should be declared as
          such. The how, when and where were not adhered to. The how is in dispute, and the 3.15
          p.m. cut off point is certainly not appropriate. In my mind, you cannot have an inquest
          ending 3.15 p.m. when people are still alive, and could possibly have stayed alive if given
          medical treatment by paramedics nearby, who's access was forbidden by the police.

          In my opinion I have not had an inquest on my son Steven, and I am entitled to one, which
          allows me to ask questions.

          I quote the following "Everyone is entitled in full equality to a fair and public hearing, by an
          independent and impartial tribunal, in the determination of his (sic) rights and obligations."
          (Article 10 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948.

          I would appreciate your remarks, as one who helped vote your Government into power.



          Yours sincerely

           King.        I then briefed the Serial                       as    to their        duties and      instructed

            them    to work        in pairs.            Our    initial        duties were        football      supporter

            r e c epti on at       the M i d la nd S t a t i o n a n d PSV            escort     to the     ground.         At

           the M i d l a n d Station,             with other Serials,                 we met     supporters        from

           Liverpool         from the         trains.

            In the main          they were            good humoured,            a l t h o u g h some groups.of          youths

           w a n t e d to go       into     the       city centre,           w h i c h we    prevented them

           from     doing.         I saw a number              of o f f icers       stop fans who were             in

            p o ssession       of a few cans             of beer,          although         not a great amount.             The

fans d i s p o s e d of the beer.                    My serial       eventually         came to PSV escort

duty,         the      i n s t r uctions     to the first         few    pairs,      were     that they      return

t,o the M id l a n d S t at io n with PSV that                      they were accompanying.

At about              1.40 to       1.43pm,    my     last     pair of officers were a b o a r d a FSV.

T h e r e wer e a number               of other        officers      still       in the area.        The PSV

was about              one third full and the next                   t rain not due til about

2.20pm.               I spoke wit h my         immediate         s u p e r v i s o r y officer,    Inspector Dews,

and after              c on su l t a t i o n with SYT        Inspector,         it was decided that           the

bus should                 leave and not wait            for the next           supporters.        I boarded the

bus    having              been a ut ho ri se d by       Inspector Dews to remain at the

football              ground and not          return to the M i d l a n d Station.                 We made good

time     until             N e t h e rt ho rp e Road and Hoyle Street,               where we       came    to heavy

traffic.               During       the journey        I spoke      to a number         of people         on the

upper-deck,                 two    in particular,         an A sian      g e ntleman      from L o n d o n and a

middle aged man from Liverpool.                                We d i s c u s s e d the various methods             of

travel         to and          from football          matches and the older man stated that                         he

preferr ed             to Use the train and                co m m e n t e d on the excellent

o r g a n i sa ti on at H i l l sborough.                 He said that           he had a t t e n d e d    the same

fixture              the    previous       year,    by train,       had a couple         of    pints and      lunch

in town and                 caught    the bus to the ground.                    He had not seen any

trouble,              or a N o t t i n g h a m Forest        s u pporter       that day.

On our arrival                    at the    ground,      the    bus s to p p e d    in L e p pings    Lane,    near

to the         bridge,            before    the ground at about 2.10pm.                     The    road was    very           .

busy with              pedestrians,          both on the         road and on the            pavements.        As    the

bus    stopped a crowd gath e r e d                    round the        doors and as the            passengers

got    off the bus they were                       repea t e d l y a s k e d    if anyone      had any spare

tickets,              by memb e r s    of the       crowd.       I eventually         called to all

passengers                 still    on the bus,        asking      if anyone       had any sparf           tickets,

and    re ceived             no    positive    replies,         and told the youths at the bus

door,         a sking        them to move back to a ll ow                passengers         off.

We then got off            the bus and w a l k e d thro u g h the             crowd to the ground.

We went     in through a gate,               under     the N o r t h Stand to the G y m n a s i u m

area.     I there         tried       to trace the      remainder          of my Serial.           I found

them all        except PC *^"405 Fenwick arid 747 Law.

At about 2 . 4 5 p n / f c o ntacted the m a t c h             control       room by t e lephone and

Spoke    to PC/Ryan.             I toldhim         the s t r e n g t h of my Serial          and a sked for

instructions.             He    sjad’ke to someone         else and told m»-^ro^adopt a call

sign Sierra 65 ,/Cnd to go to                                  Lane,       outside    the ground,              see

Ins p e c tor Sykes,           a n d assist with       crowd     control.        there were         problems.

We made     our way towards' Gate A,                  into L e p p i n g s Lane.          On the way

several     people        stopped me,        telling me        that    the    c r o w ^ s i t u a t ion

outside was           serious.           At Gate A,      the gate man,         Jrack S t o n e , refused

to open the gate,               due    to the     crowds    outside.         I glan c e d through the

small    wi n d o w    in the     gate and Saw a sea of faces.                      The    crowd waiting

at the    turn s t i l e s was         o b viously    packed tightly together and the

si tu at io n    looked serious.              I realised that          I would have          to get

outside     thro u g h a no t h e r       gate.      I shou t e d to the Serial             to follow and

ran along        the     back    of the     turnstiles.          On the way         I was    stopped           by

supporters,           compla i n i n g    of the s i t u a t i o n outside.          I went      through a

gate m a n ne d by a steward,               into     the area     behind      the terrace and West

St a n d and then t hr o u g h a gate              in the wall        dividing       that area.               The

gate was        unmanned.,        I then turned          right    towards Gate C leading                      to the

service     road,       intending         to ask     the s t e w a r d to open       it,    to   let      us

out.     I saw that            the gate was a l r e a d y open and that a small                     number           of

people were           coming     in.      I cannot     remember       seeing a stew a r d at              this

gate.

I ran through           the gate and as            I did so      I saw four m o u n t e d        officers

outside,        apparently        protecting         the gate.        As    I turned       right    into        the

service     road,       I saw a large           crowd of     people        in the    compound       leading

to the    turnstiles.             The     people were       packed     tightly together.                  A
                                                                                                               PAGE
                                                                 : '                                           r 115

number were           pale and     looked        ill and m a n y were          screaming         and     crying.

It was a        seething mass             of people.

liy first       thoughts were             to stop the crush.             Ita p p e a r e d    to me that

people were pushing               from Leppings Lane.                  The    barrier        betw e e n this

compound and the             service       road consists             of a single tubular               type     rail.

I start ed telling            people       to    come out       of the       compound and go             in

thro u g h Gate C.          The y w o u l d n ’t.        A few shouted that                  they had got

tickets and were             going     in.       I was       pleading with them to               come out.

Onl y a few did,           but    it didn't           seem to    relieve the          crush.       I didn't

know    how     to stop them.              I c onsidered putting          a       cordon into          the     crowd,

but w he n      I looked                                                               The s it u a t i o n was

injured.        I was       pleading with             people    to    come out of the            compound and

qo    in thro u g h Gate C .           S u d d enly I saw Gate^Sf^ opposite me                            &
’                 "                                                         ...

the    crush seemed          to ease.           My    immediate       thought was,            "Thank     fuck for

that."        At the       same   time other           people    in the       crowd seemed          to

u n d e r s t a n d what
                      I had been saying about Gate C being open and came
                                          ■               y**
under       the barrier.   After      seconds I. saw Ga^e B close. The

crush       had been eased           cons i de r a b l y . The       peoplf/who         came     under        the

barrier       began queuing          towards Gate C,             being m a r s h a l l e d      by the mounted

officers.        One of these             officers        put his h o r s e ’s face            to the wall and

heard      him shout words            to the effect that              the supporters             should walk

under       the horses       between         it and      the wall      and    in through         the     gates.

people      ran      in.      I shoute d to them to slow down.                        8y this time          I was

inside the           compound.         Some     slowed and walked,                others    ran past        me    to

the    turnstiles.             I dealt wit h a few queries                     regarding     turnstile

locations and then                cleared off a number                  of youths who were still

stand i n g    in the        compound.          I a sked them all              individually,        about 8 or

10 in number,             if they had tickets.                O n l y one had a ticket and                  X moved

the others         out of the         compound.

After     a few seconds            I heard the voice               of Serqe.ant G o d d a r d on the

radio,     he said,          "We are      going    tcK.have to stop the game".                      He    then

                             I then      ran from the         compound and            into1 the ground,

thro u g h Gate C,           w h i c h was    still    open.        I ran to the           right    to a gate

under     the m at c h       control      room.       As    I ran       past    the   rear of the         terrace

and stand,           I noti c e d an absence            of   police       officers.         The only

o fficers      I     saw were       two      standing at          the   foot     of the stairs      leading          to

the West Stand.                I m om en t a r i l y w o n d e r e d where       the others were.                When

I reached the             gate,    the    remainder         of my Serial          had joined me.               The

gate was       locked and had to be u n l o c k e d by a gateman.                            We    ran

u n d e r n e a t h the    control       box,    along      the    rear of the unc o v e r e d           seating

a nd then left,            down an aisle,          onto      the    pitch.        I remember        noticing

that    the    players were           not on the           pitch.        I could see a large              number

of    people on the           perimeter         track at      the       rear of the       goal.      I ran

towards       them and as I did so                I could hear            people      screaming,         moan i n g

an d shouting.             I could not see            into    the       centre    south    pen,     but     people

were waving and shouting                     for me to go          into the       terrace.         Gate No.          2,

leading       into the south end of the                     terrace was          open.

I went     into the          terrace      through that            gate and moved towards                 the

centre     south      pen.        People were         in front          df me and      I c o u l d n ’t see       past

them.      Others         g ra b b e d me,    telling      me to go and help.                I could still

hear    people      s c reaming        from the       centre       pen.     I remember        one y o u t h

s aying     it was my fault and that they should have                              had the other           end,

o b v i o u s l y mean i n g    the Spion Kop.              I got    to the fence         s eparating          the

pens/ on the        terrace.           The    fence    is of solid steel             bars and about 7 or

h /Teet high.            As    1 a pp ro a c he d the       fence,    I could see         people      crushed

up against         it.        All    the   people     I saw were upright.

As    I reached the            fence a young          girl    was    handed over        the    top,     she was

unconscious,,            W i t h help from a supporter,                   I caught     the girl as she

was    passed over            the    fence and      I carried her back to Gate E.                       She was

in her      late    teens and          I remember       she was wearing            j enas and had              long

hair.      People were              st i 11 ,sto ppi ng me and telling me to help.                        When        I.

reached the         gate,       I saw a PC dres s e d           in a full y e l l o w jacket,

standing at the gate                  on the track.           I think       he was a N o t t i n g h a m s h i r e

officer.         A man was           trying    to get out          of the gate,        but    c o u l d n ’t

climb up the wall.                   I pushed him out of the way and handed the                                girl

to the PC and then went                    back to the fence.               1 then helped others                 over

the fence and helped                  carry them back           to Gate 2.         On one o c c a s i o n        I

reached the         fence and saw a pile of                   people,       laid on the terrace at

the front.          This was the first                time that       1 had seen         people     not        in an

upright      position.              Some   of them were         purple      or blue      in the face.                It

was    only at that            time    that    I thought        people may have           died.       I was

shoc k e d and drai n e d            both m e n t a l l y and      physically.         I radioed the

control      roorn and a s k ed that officers                   be sent      to the     rear of the

tunnel     to stop        people       pushing.        The    reply was that           this had been

done.      I saw that           people on the          perimeter          track were      unable      to get

into    the terrace,            due    to the s e c urity          fence.      It was     ovious      that       the

fence     had to be d i s m a nt le d quickly,                or    cut.     1 again      radioed       control

room,     asking     for       bolt croppers.           1 did not          hear a reply,         but heard

con v e r s a t i o n on the         radio.

O n my next        return to the gate,                the    same PC asked me how              I was.          He

said "Are you alright Serg.",                      I said,        "I'm fucked".          I was      tired and

m y m.i.nd didn't            seem -to be functioning.                He said "Come out,             we * 11 get

s o m ebody fresh            in".     I remember t h i n k i n g      that was a good          idea and he

h e l p e d me up olit0 the track.

E3y this time           it    can only be d e s c r i b e d as bedlam.               There were       police

officers,       supporters,            first aid         people and stewards,            mill i n g about.

Pe o p l e were      being         carried from the          terrace,        I tried to        recover my

breath and        composure and then went                    to the       crowd of    people at       the gate

of the      centre        pen.       People    in a collapsed state were being                      handed out

from wi t h i n the           pen.     I helped       to    carry one man onto           the    pitch and

laid him down,               his eyes were wide and staring,                      Inspector Ha r v e y was

with me.        He      began to       prepare      the man for m outh to mouth.                    I ripped

open the man's               shirt and began          chest massage.             I remember      the shirt

was an off white                  colour,    with a feint         brown     pattern.      We    tried

resuscitation             for about 2 or 3 minutes,                  but    it was a p p arent       that    the

man was       dead.          As    I stood up I looked at             Inspector Harvey,             he was

o b v i o u s l y upset and          distraut and so was             I.     Then a young man           came and

began m outh to m ou t h on the same man.                           I knew the m a n was         dead,      but

knelt and a ga i n t ried heart massage.                          After     a mi n u t e or two,       I told

the you th       that the man was dead.                    He started        to cry and w a l k e d away.

I felt      so helpless.              Some    other      people     came,     I don't    know who,       and

carried the ma n away.

All     ar o u n d me     people were         being      carried and others were a t t e m p t i n g

artific ial       respiration.               I c o u l d n ’t get    close     to the fence,         there

were     too man y        people      in front      of     it.

I busied my s e l f           comforting       people who were             obv i o u s l y upset.     A number

w ere    nasty and upset              and f o r cibly blamed me for what                 had happened.             I

wefe     i n structed         to    leave the ground and we were                  to go to P e nistone

           In the main,           the   fans were good natured,           a l t h o u g h a few were abusive.

POLICE SERGEANT 840

ATTERCLIFFE POLICE STATION   D2




At 8.00 am Saturday 15 April 1989, I commenced duty at Attercliffe Police Station,

for duties in connection with the football semi-final, between Nottingham Forrest

and Liverpool.    A previously circulated Operational   Order had   indicatedthatI was

one of two sergeants in charge of serial 13, on the D Divisional Order.      The other

sergeant was Detective Sergeant 2235 Gutcher, Headquarters CID.

Serial comprised the following officers, PC's 2236 Brown, 405 Fenwick, 1632 Smith,

747 Law, 2118 Beaumont, 122 Dixon, 1790 Craighill, 492 Tranter, 1668 Leckey and 3346

Hardwick.   We travelled to West Bar Police Station, where we were briefed by Chief

Inspector King.   I then briefed the Serial as to their duties and instructed them to

work in pairs.    Out initial duties were football supporter reception at the Midland

Station and PSV escort to the ground.    At the Midland Station, with other Serials,

we met supporters frcm Liverpool frcm the trains.

In the main they were good humoured, although seme groups of        youths wanted        to go

into the City centre, which we prevented them frcm doing.           I saw a number of

officers stop fans who were in possession of a few cans of beer, although not a

great amount.     The fans disposed of the beer.    My Serial eventually came to PSV

escort duty, the insturctions to the first few pairs, were that they return to the

Midland Station with the PSV that they were accompanying.

At about 1.40 to 1.45 pm, my last pair of officers were aboard a PSV.     There were a

number of other officers still in the area.     The PSV was about one third full and

the next train not due till about 2.20 pm.     I spoke with my immediate supervisory

officer, Inspector Dews, and after consultation with SYT Inspector, it was decided

that the bus should leave and not wait for the next supporters.      I boarded the bus
having been authorised by Inspector Dews to remain at the football ground and not

return to the Midland Station.    We made good time until Netherthorpe Road and Hoyle

Street, where we came to heavy traffic.     During the journey I spoke to a number of

people on the upper-deck, two in particular, and Asian gentleman frcm London and a

middle aged man frcm Liverpool.    We discussed the various methods of travel to and

frcm football matches and the older man stated that he prefered to use the train and

ccmmented on the excellent organisation at Hillsborough.         He said that he had

attended the same fixture the previous year, by train, had a couple of pints and

lunch in town and caught the bus to the ground.     He had not seen any trouble, or a

Nottingham Forrest supporter that day.

On our arrival at the ground, the bus stopped in Leppings Lane, near to the bridge,

before the ground at about 2.10 pm.      The road was very busy with pedestrians, both

on the road and on the pavements.     As the bus stopped a crowd gathered round the

doors and as the passengers got off the bus they were repeatedly asked if anyone had

any spare tickets, by members of the crowd.      I eventually called to all passengers

still on the bus, asking if anyone had any spare tickets, and received no positive

replies, and told the youths at the bus door, asking them to move back to allow

passengers off.

We then got off the bus and walked through the crown to the ground.        We then in

through a gate, under the North Stand to the Gymnasium area.    I there tried to trace

the remainder of my Serial.   I found them all except PC's 405 Fenwick and 747 Law.

At about 2.45 pm I contacted the match control room by telephone and spoke to PC

Ryan.   I told him the strength of my Serial and asked for instructions.   He spoke to

scmeone else and told me to adopt a callsign Sierra 65, and to go to Leppings Lane,

outside the ground, see Inspector Sykes, and assist with crowd control.     There were

problems.

We made our way towards Gate A, into Leppings Lane.        On the way several people

stopped me, telling me that the crowd situation outside was serious.   At Gate A, the

gate man, Jack Stone, refused to open the gate, due to the crowds outside.            I

glanced through the small window in the gate and saw a sea of faces.        The crowd
waiting at the turnstyles was obviously packed tightly together and the situation

looked serious.      I realised that I would have to get outside through another gate.

I shouted to the Serial to follow me and ran along the back of the turnstyles.           On

the way I was stopped by supporters, complaining of the situation outside.          I went

through a gate manned by a steward,      into the areabehind the terrace and West Stand

and then through a gate in the wall dividing that area.         The gate was unmanned.    I

then turned right towards Gate C leading to the service road, intending to ask the

steward to open it, to let us out.      I saw that the gate was already open and that a

small number of people were coming in.      I cannot remember seeing a steward at this

gate.

I ran through the gate and as I         did so I saw four mounted officers outside,

apparantly protecting the gate.      As I turned right into the service road, I saw a

large crowd of people in the compound leading to the turnstyles.          The people were

packed tightly together.     A number were pale and looked ill and many were screaming

and crying.   It was a seething mass of people.

My first thoughts was to stop the crush.        It appeared to me that people were pushing

from Leppings Lane.     The barrier between this compound and the service road consists

of a single tubular type rail.     I started telling people to came out of the compound

and go in through Gate C.      They wouldn't.     A few shouted that they had got tickets

and were going in.      I was pleading with them to cone out.      Only a few did, but it

didn't seem to relieve the crush.       I didn't know how to stop them.      I considered

putting a cordon into the crowd, but when I looked I only saw two other officers.

The   situation   was desperate,   I firmly believed      that people were going to be

seriously injured.     I was pleading with people to came out of the compound and go in

through Gate C.    Suddenly I saw Gate B opposite me open slightly and then open wider

to maybe 6 feet.     Almost immediately the crush seemed to ease.    My iinmediate thought

was, "Thank fuck for that."      At the same time other people in the crowd seemed to

understand what I had been saying about Gate C being open and came under the

barrier.    After a few seconds I saw Gate B close.            The crush had been eased

considerably. The people who came under the barrier began queuing towards Gate C,
                                                                                 i'"     '   ’



                                      - 4 -



being marshalled by the mounted officers.       One of these officers put his horse's

face to the wall and heard him shout words to the effect that the supporters should

walk under the horses between it and the wall and in through the gates.                Other

people were going in through the turnstyles normally and orderly.        Looking to my

left I saw two mounted officers blocking the gates into the compound from Leppings

Lane.   There was another large crowd in Leppings Lane, waiting to come towards the

turnstyles.     After a few seconds the queues at the turnstyles were small and the

mounted officers moved to allow this crowd into the compound.       Some people ran in.

I shouted to them to slow down.        By this time I was inside the compound.          Some

slowed and walked, others ran past me to the turnstyles.     I dealt with a few queries

regarding turnstyle locations and then cleared off a number of youths who were still

standing in the compound.     I asked them all individually, about 8 or 10 in number,

if they had tickets.      Only one had a ticket and I moved the others out of the

compound.

After a few seconds I heard the voice of Sergeant Goddard on the radio, he said, "We

are going to have to stop the game".      He then repeated it.   After a short pause, I

heard him say, "All available Serials to the perimeter track at Leppings Lane, there

are supporters on the pitch."       I then ran from the compound and into the ground,

through Gate C, which was still open.     I ran to the right to a gate under the match

control room.    As I ran past the rear of the terrace and stand, I noticed an absence

of police officers.    The only officers I saw were two standing at the foot of the

stairs leading to the West Stand.     I momentarily wondered where the others were.

When I reached the gate, the remainder of my Serial had joined me.        The gate was

locked and had to be unlocked by a gateman.        We ran underneath the control box,

along the rear of the uncovered seating and then left, down an aisle, onto the

pitch. I remember noticing that the players were not on the pitch.       I could see a

large number of people on the perimeter track at the rear of the goal.             I ran

towards them and as I did so I could hear people screaming, moaning and shouting.                I

could not see into the centre south pen, but people were waving and shouting for me

to go into the terrace.     Gate No 2, leading into the south end of the terrace was
                                       - 5 -



open.

I went into the terrace through that gate and moved towards the centre south pen.

People were infront     of me and I couldn't see past them.    Others grabbed me, telling

me to go and help.        I could still hear people screaming frcm the centre pen.      I

remember one youth saying it was my fault and that they should have had the other

end, obviously meaning the Spion Cop.     I got to the fence separating the pens on the

terrace.     The fence is of solid steel bars and about 7 or 8 feet high.           As I

approached the fence, I could see people crushed up against it.         All the people I

saw were upright.

As I reached the fence a young girl was handed over the top, she was unconscious.

With help frcm a supporter, I caught the girl as she was passed over the fence and I

carried her back to Gate 2.        She was in her late teens and I remember she was

wearing jeans and had long hair.      People were still stopping me and telling me to

help.    When I reached the gate, I saw a PC dressed in a full yellow jacket, standing

at the gate on the track.       I think he was a Nottinghamshire officer.      A man was

trying to get out of the gate, but couldn't climb up the wall.        I pushed him out of

the way and handed      the girl to the PC and then went back to the fence.        I then

helped others over the fence and helped carry them back to Gate 2.       On one occasion

I reached the fence and saw a pile of people, layed on the terrace at the front.

This was the first time that I had seen people not in an upright position.       Seme of

them were purple or blue in the face.          It was only at that time that I thought

people may have died.    I was shocked and drained both mentally and physically.

I radioed the control rocm and asked that officers be sent to the rear of the tunnel

to stop people pushing.      The reply was that this had been done.    I saw that people

on the perimeter tracK were unable to get into the terrace, due to the security

fence.   It was obvious that the fence had to be dismantled quickly, or cut.     I again

radioed control rocm, asking for bolt croppers.        I did not hear a reply, but heard

conversation on the radio.

On my next return to the gate, the same PC asked me how I was.         He said, "Are you

all right Serg,"    I said, "I'm fucked."      I was tired and my mind didn't seem to be
functioning.     He said, "Ccme out, we'll get somebody fresh in."   I remember thinking

that was a good idea and he help me up onto the track.

By this time it can only be described as bedlam.            There were police officers,

supporters, first aid people and stewards, milling about.      People were being carried

frcm the terrace.     I tried to recover my breath and composure and then went to the

crowd of people at the gate of the center pen.         People in a collapsed state were

being handed out frcm within the pen.       I helped to carry one man onto the pitch and

layed    him down, his eyes were wide and staring.     Inspector Harvey was with me.     He

began to prepare the man for mouth to mouth.         I ripped open the man's shirt and

began chest massage.      I remember the shirt was a off white colour, with a feint

brown pattern.     We tried resuscitation for about 2 or 3 minutes, but it was apparent

that the man was dead.     AsI stood up I    looked at Inspector Harvey, he was obviously

upset and distraut and so was     I.   Then a young man came and began mouth to mouth on

the same man.      I knew the man was dead, but knelt and again tried heart massage.

After a minute or two, I told the youth that the man was dead.         He started to cry

and walked away.     I felt so helpless.    Seme other people came, I don't know who, and

carried the man away.

All around me people were being carried and others were attempting artificial

respiration. I couldn't get close to the fence, there were too many people in front

of it.

I busied myself comforting people who were obviously upset.      A number were nasty and

upset and forcibly blamed me for what had happened.      I eventually gathered my Serial

together and after a period of time we were instructed to leave the ground and we

were to go to Penistone Road North, to provide PSV escort to the City centre.          Very

few people used the PSV's and we then received instructions to return to the ground,

which was now quiet and totally empty of supporters.

In the main, the fans were good natured, although a few were abusive.        Outside the

ground before the kick off, I detected fear amongst a lot of them.

I saw a number of stewards, but there was no steward at Gate C.

I was not aware of any break down in radio transmissions at any stage during the
policing of the event.

I feel that had supporters arrived in good time to take their places the build-up of

people in Leppings Lane, outside the turnstyles, would not have taken place and the

crush which ensued would have been prevented.       There would then have been no

necessity whatsoever for either gates B or C to be opened.

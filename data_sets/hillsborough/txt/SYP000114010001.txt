             At Sam 15 April             1989 I commenced duty at WeTt**B^nrH»«>Jf i ce Station for

             briefing in relation to the FA Cup Semi Final between Nottingham

             Forest and Liverpool.

             Phase    1 of my ser ials__(1_LL. duty comme g ^ a              about 9.30am at the Midland

             Station, Sheaf Street .               We were susfecif i eal ly detailed to supervise

             the arrival             of Nottingham Forest football           supporters travelling by

             rail and their subsequent escort by PSV to Hillsborough.

             The early arrivals were very orderly although in general spirits were

             high.        The later the arrivals the higher the spirits.                  It was

             apparent that alcohol was a ma^or                    influence towards this.     I believe

             I travelled on the                last PSV escorting the Forest supporters.              These

             were under the influence of alcohol                   shouting and swearing.        We

             increased the number of police officers on this escort to prevent

             trouble.              However,    this did not stop them singing obscenities and

             there was a stream of urine flowing from the upper deck of the PSV.

             At that time we d i d n ’t have enough policemen to police effectively and

             safely.              Although Phase    1 was successful a large number of supporters

             went to Hillsborough under the influence of alcohol.

             I arrived at Hillsborough about 2.30pm and immediately went to the
                                                                                                    PAGE

            gymnasium to regroup my serial.               They were all       present.     However, 4

            of the officers were           completing arrest      reports.      I was issued with

            ftleal tickets an<| obtained a meal.’ On completion serial                    sergeants

            were called tfl the reception desk in the gymnasium.                    I reported that

            because of          arrests my serial was currently reduced to *3             PCsi and

            myself.        I    was told to remain on            standby. '                    <

            A few minutes         later serial     sergeants were again trailed to the

            reception desk.           I informed an Inspector the numbers on my serial.

            He told me          to go to the Leppings      Lane straight away.       I asked him

            outside or          inside.   He told me to go around dn the track.             It was a

            bit vague but I thought I would be met by an Inspector                       in Charge of

            the ground.

            I informed serial members engaged in arrest reports that I was going

            to the Leppings Lane.          I switched my radio to the match channel and
                                                                    s J S o t o ^ s i S
            walked towards         the Leppings Lane.  I was with PC 269 Broomhead, PC 22

            Fletcher and PC 1785 Cheetham.

            I could see         that the two teams were warming up on the pitch.               As     we

            walked. down        the track the atmosphere was electric and            the noise

            dea f e n i n g .   I c o u l d n ’t hear a thing.   When I reached the Leppings

             ane end I walked towards the middle where                I met briefly with PS

            993.     We commented on the middle of the terrace section.                     I could see
0&>c
So&*£ Or*that       it was      packed.    Too packed.      People were scaling      the perimeter

T£fUAti£    fence.       The    fence was bowing with pressure and the people at the

            f/ont were screaming for help.               Shouting for the gates to be opened.

            I was completely suprised by this because the terracing to the right

            of me was far from full.             I could see the terracing steps.             It seemed
H t *S
            ludicrous.

            I went towards the safety gate and I think someone opened it just in
T3kAc*      front of me.          It seemed that we should allow some in the middle

U I t * *   section into the right hand section.                 One of the first        people out, a

                 man in his late teens came screaming towards me.          He shouted that he

                 had been screaming for the gate to be opened and a police officer had

                 refused.     He had the* number written on his hand.      He screamed that

                 people were being killed.      I told him to get off the pitch so I could

                 gtt other'* out.     I continued to filter people out towards "the rA$ht

                 hand terrace.      They were refusing* to go in and stayed on the

                 perimeter*,    I was looking round for people to help me but I had

                 already become detached from my s e r i a l ,

                 I noticed that several people were coming out injured as a result of

                 the crush.     St. Johns Ambulancemen were getting involved with these.

                 I still tried to filter people from the middle towards the right.

                 Everyone seemed to have a go at me.        Shouting abuse.    I was getting

                 embroiled in argument after argument.        I still didn't know anything

                 of the tragedy.      I heard nothing on the radio.      I believed we were

                 still trying to prevent a pitch'.invasion.         The numbers of police were

                 increasing but the situation was getting out of hand.          The crush d i d n ’t

                 seem to abate and the crowd were frantic.

                 There seemed to be loads spitting onto the pitch over the fence.             I

                 saw a young man on the pitch near the goals and a policeman running

                 onto the field.      I just thought what a ’cock up*.

                 The number of injured people coming from the terrace increased^

                 rapidly,     I began helping the injured.       Sitting them on the pitch or

                 tryincf to get them assistance.       1 can *t remember how many 1 helped.

                 1   ryfnember one chap who really worried me.      He was unconscious but he

                 wans breathing.    A man asked me to help him.       I placed him in the

Q £Sc            recovery position with the help of an ambulanceman.          He said he would

                 be alright.     I left him when the other man came back.       I helped

fA**'            another girl to the side of the pitch with an arm injury.          She was

    Qf           extremely distraught.    Whilst    I was at the side of the pitch a young

         screaming that      it was our fault.         I told him we couldn't g6t people

         out.     I saw the ambulance on the pitch and went back towards the

       ' goals.    Several    paliceraen «ere giving mouth to wjouth.          One man had         ;_

         his head covered and was obviously dead.               1 looked around and there';

         enormity of it.      The fire fcrignde were there and the fence was beit^s^-

         pul led down.    I saw some youths with wooden boards and we pxit a man oh

         it.     He was about 35 years old and heavy.              We ran across the pitch

         with him.    He was dead.          I left them at the Kop end of the pitch and

         went back towards the Leppings Lane.               The Forest supporters were

         taunting the Liverpool            end.   A large number    ran towards the Kop.         It

         looked nasty.       An Inspector shouted at me to get my men together.                    I

         didn't know where any of them were.               I saw some other officers from

         West Bar and we formed a,line across half way.                 We were there for a

         few minutes when a Chief Inspector told me to go outside onto the

         Leppings Lane.

         I stood on the Leppings Lane while the Liverpool                crowd dispersed.

         Host of the crowd were shocked,             some were distraught,    others were

         nasty and abusive.          We stood there mainly in silence and took the

         flak.     I don't know how long I stood there but that is where              I heard

         the first messages over the radio.

         When the crowd had dispered I went             into the ground looking for the

         remnants of my serial.             I found PC Cheetham in the gymnasium.          He was

         dealing with a body.             I became aware how big the tragedy was.          The

         other members of my serial were outside the ground completing the

         escort of the Forest fans back to the Midland Station.

HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE INQUIRY INTO THE POLICING OF FOOTBALL
HOOLIGANISM: GOVERNMENT RESPONSE

I have noted that a minor transposition has occurred in the draft
response to the HAC report on football hooliganism which was put
forward with your submission of 25 April. The last paragraph of
the response to recommendation 54 should in fact be the last part
of the response to recommendation 51. I have told Mr Pickering
who has amended the top copy.

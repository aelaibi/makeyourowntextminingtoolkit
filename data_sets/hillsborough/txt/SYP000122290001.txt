       The      quick a n s w er         to the above             question        is "No",      but     see    paragraph

<c )   In letter            to J u d icial       Inquiry,           Local    A u t h o r i t y ' s move      was    to

       provide         care,      comfort and             counselling.            What was          involved?            How

       were Social            S e rv ic es      mobilised           etc?

       M u c h of the a n sw er            to this           question        lies in what was           provided

       under      p ar ag r a p h     (a) above.

<d>    The Pla n a p p e ar s            to have       been       last     revised      in    1987    <000087).

       Has      the P lan been            revised since?                 If so when?           Be f o r e    or after

       H i l l s b o rough.

       Briefly,         the P l a n has          not been           revi s e d since         1987    (000087)        by a

       formal       process and            re - p r i n t i n g     etc.     Mr OGL E does           say that        in his

       capacity as            the     re s p o n s i b l e    officer        he was in a p o s i t i o n to              review

       in his m i n d the P l a n an d alter                        or ad d to it as          he saw fit.                He

       confirms         that      he made        no a l t e r a t i o n s    to   it.

( e)   What was         the m e th od of           rev i e w i n g    the Eme rgency P lan?

       Further         to    p a r a g r a ph   (d) above,           and    see also         paragraph        <f)    below,

       it w o u l d be        possible          for    this       to occur at        convened meetings                   with

       other      re s p o n s i b l e    groups.            Mr O G L E does      not    exude       confidence           in

       deal i n g w i t h this aspect

       the meet i n g         m i n u t ed ?     Do    the P o l i c e      review the Local                Authority

the Local         Authority          response may have                been more          organised         (and       in such

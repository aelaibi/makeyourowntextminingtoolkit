                       fnd t h a t ’s all   the details         I know about            him.f(

whilst         I h#ve been using         the    ’Heart     of E n g l a n d ’ supporters           club over

the      past years,          on several    occasion       I have      noticed when           collecting

s u pporters          from Leicester,       two brothers         using       the       club from this

particular area.                Not until      the disaster       had happened did               I know there

names to be Hewitt.

On the day of the semi-final                    I remember       the      coach stopping          to pick

s upporters u p , at 2 or 3 pi eki ng up points                        but    I can't       recall     these

two      lads       being on or getting         on the     coach on this occasion.

‘
w he n    I got on the          coach at Coventry,          I   took        up a seat towards          the

middle        of      the    coach,   the opposite        side from         the driver,        and at this

time      I sat on m y own.           But   during       the jour n e y to the game,              on picking

up other            supporters    on route,      one of them sat             by me,       unf o r tunat e l y    I

can't       recall      any d es cr i p t i o n of this gentleman.

As for as             I recall     we had an u n d elayed journey to Sheffield,                       not

recalling whether we stopped on route.

I cannot            recall    nobody drinking      on the       coach or w i tnessing              supporters

drinking            on routs to the time we          parked the           coach.

We    parked the            coach with the      rest of the Liverpool                   supporters     coaches,

I can't            recall    the t ime we arrived.

My friends and myself                 got off the        coach and made our way to the

ground,            on route    1 never w it ne s s e d any d i s t u r b a n c e or fighting             or     can

I remember           witnessing        people     drinking      alcohol          on the way to the            ground,

I do     recall        seeing m o u n t e d    police    officers          some       distance      from the

ground and           they did walk         towards      the ground with us.

On    reaching         the t urnstiles         I can't       really    recall          if   I nad to queue          or

n o t , I never         had any d i f f i c u lty finding            the    turnstiles and whe n              I

entered        the     turnstiles       1 rememfaer nanding            my       ticket      in,   I c a n ’t recall

a lot after            entering     the    ground,      bat all       my friends            d^Ld enter      the

g r o u n d wit h m e .

1 do     remember        walking       with my friends          along       the / urine 1 to the            ter race;

in the Leppings             Lane    end and on /oming            out       of    the    tunnel,     ws all        went

to the        r ight    h a n d side    of t h e / e n ce d i re c 1 1y         i n f ront    of u s .

At    this     time     there was aire-aray quite a few Liverpool                            supporters

already        standing       on the      terraces,      we    pushed our way through to try and

get a good           viewing      position.

I can't        remember what           happened       to three       of my friends            but    I do

remember when            1 had m a n a g e d    to    push my way          to the       fence w hich        runs

ar o u n d    the    ground,      I remember         my friend ______ | standi ng next                  to me      by

the    fence,        1 presume my other              three    friends       stood some where             else.

At the        time     1 reached t h i y f e n c e      the    place was             r e asonably full       but    not

uncomfortable,             I can't      r/i member what time I a r ri v ed a t t h e f^fice b u t I

think        it was a b o u t g.fr/f pm and not              long after,             the L i v erpool    players

came    out to warm           up before        the    start    of the m a t c h which w ould                have

been about S . 55           pm.

At    this     time     I experienced          great    pres/ure       being          exerted on my         body

f r om behind and also             f rom both s i fy/k .

I had got my            right arm up a g a i n s t       the    fence,          my    left arm was       down      by

my side,        holding my small              L i verpool     shoe    bag.           The wall     underneaatn

the    fence was         pressing       up against       my hip bones,                but   beca,use of my

                   wail    and     fence.          The    pressure       at    this     time was       causing me d i f f i c u l t y

                   :i.n breathing         and      I started        to take       short       pants    of air,.

                   The    pressure        then      relieved        i tself     for a very sho rt              period wni ch

                   enab l e d me      to move my head,                but almost            i m m e d iately a greater         pressure

                   a r r i v e d against          my body       pinning my head              in a position that              I could

                   only     look     straight           forward..

                   was    unb e l i e v a b l e    and    I was     exp e r i e n c i n g    even more        difficulty       in

                   b r e athing      than before.            I w ould      say or       it seernea like           I was      in this

                   unable      to move        just       pinned the r e .

                   I just      Kept     thinking          now    long     I had got to          remain      like this and        1

                   began     to    pray to God            for    his    guidance.

                   During      this     unforgetable             time     I do     remember b e i n g ^ b l e         to look        on the

                   floor,      and seeing a pair                 of black        shoes and thsr legs were                  cove r e d in

“I X - '   'TbP*   blue    den im jsa n s y it may have                  been the           q i rl/^hat     had been standi ng to

                   my    right,     but     I c a n ’t recall          what     she     looked       like.,

                   while     I was      i n thi s pos i ti o n , I            remember        seeing      people     dro pping        aown

                   in front        of me,         the    other    side     of the      fence and          sitting      and    lying        down

                   on the      pitch,       people        getting      over the        fencing were also               using my

                   s h oulders      and head to help them get                       over      the    fence,,

                   Eventually although                   it seemed       like an e t e r n i t y       the     pressure      was      being

                   relieved        f r o rn a r o u n d me ,,

                   I looked along            the        perimeter      fence      towards        a gate       in the fence w hich

                   was    to my     right,         the    gate was       open but           I noticed at         least    ID or       11

                   bodies      just     1y n g      mot i o n 1 ess    on the te r races             i n f ront of these             gate s „

                   it seemed        I was         on my own at         this     lei m e .     I was    dasecL^£nd I e v e n t u a l l y

                   turned      round and w a l k e d            backward's      towards        the se^tfti ng area ana               then

                        stopped with my two                friends       for a t im e"”’*fh e n whe n we            realised

e v e r y b o d y was     leaving      the    ground we decided              to    leave with    them.

We    left    the     ground      by using         the same      tunnel      we    used to enter       the

terraces,           but   I can't      recall       seeing a n y t h i n g    inside       the tunnel     that

was    out    of the ordinary,,

I think       it was about           4 .00    pm when we         left    the ground and we made                our

way back           to the    coach     park .

We got       back     to the      coach      park safely,         and then waited for            the     rest    of

t h e s u P p o r ! e r s t o re t u r n -

At    the    time     the    coach started           its    return jour n e y        I believed     that       every

body    that        used the      coach to get          to the m a t c h was         on the    coach,,

I can't       recall        a n y t h i n g about    anyone      commi t t i n g a criminal       offence,,

It a p p e a r e d    to me     that    e v e r y b o d y was    in grist         and shocK about        the

i n c id e n t „

P e o p l e were      very slow        to    realise       how bad the        incident was and also

people were           shouting       for     the    gate    to be opened a long time              before        it

Due    to this        incident       I received the             foilowj^ffg       injuries,    bruising        to my

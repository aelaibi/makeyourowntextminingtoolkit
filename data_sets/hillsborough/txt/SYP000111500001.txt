                  At 8.45 a.m.          S a t ur da y    15 April     1989,         I commenced duty at Woodssats

                  Police Station.               I was     transported        to the S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y

                  Football       Ground,        Hillsborough,         for    duties                     in relation to          the F . A .

Of) *   *V<’i    On    c onclusion of the               briefing    we were              provided with a meal.                       On

                  conclusion        of the meal          w e.went     to the S pion Hop.                              T o g e t h e r with other

                 officers        I was     to    provide      s e c u r / t y for            the Liverpool                 s u pporters   that

                 had been a l l o c a te d tickets             f o V the S p i o n Kop.                            This was a small       area

                 a d j ace nt    to the N or t h Stand.                                                     ;



                 At 2.1 0       p.m.    that     same day,       I was      on the Kop area of the                              ground,       when

                 my- a t te nt io n was         drawn to a group/of               youths                        a short   distance away

                 from me.         The    group were          chanting and g e s t i c u l a t i n g                       to the Liverpool

s u p p o r t e r s , who were        standing     on the Kop.             Together with other

officers      I went      to this         particular        group.         One member     of the group         I

had a con v e r s a t i o n with had             consumed a considerable amount                   of alcohol

an d was    drunk.        He was ar restejjxfiy Police Constable VI W a l m s l e y for

the offence         of being          drunkest a d e s i g n a t e d sporting          event and

also a r r es te d by other             officers.



At 2 ...40 p.m.      I returned to the Kop,                    by this time the           crowd had filled

the Kop to the extent                  that   there was         little or no standing             room on

the t e r raced areas and                people were        standing         on the access w a l k w a y s .

I saw no stewards ass i s t i n g                people     onto      the Kop or keeping walkw a y s

clear.      I w ou ld estimate             t u m i s e r              of    peop 1 e on the Kop was        too

many for safety.              Whilst making my way                 back to the        remainder      of my

s e r i a l , there were        numerous         people who        smelled strongly of

intoxicants,         a lt h o u g h    the behaviour           of the       fans w ould    be de s c r i b e d as

well    behaved.



At about 3.0 4         p.m.     I was      on duty towards             the    rear of the side          of the

Kop,   that    is adjacent             to the N o r t h Stand.              I looked across       the    pitch

an d saw p e o p l e    climbing          the^p^i^ife’tfe'r fencing            of the L e p p i n g s Lane

terrace.       On    initial          o b s e r vations    it a p p e a r e d to be a pitch

invasion.       Due to the             length of time           the    game had been going           it was

obvious     that     this was          not the     case.       People        continued    to   climb over

the    perimeter       fence,         others were         being    pulled up into the West Stand

from the terraces.               As      I w at ch ed     I saw one youth who was wear i n g what

a p p e a r e d to be a y el l o w shirt           or jumper,          was    pulled from the Leppings

parapet wall         of the West S tand             then fell          backwards      down onto      the fans

in the terrace.             It was at this              time    that       I heard over a personal

                         A small       group of           the Liverpool           fans     that we had been guarding were

                         distraught          by the scenes            from the       far end of the           pitch.       They

                         requested that              they        be e s c orted from the ground.               The m a t c h had not

                         at this time been abandoned,                        but    they stated that           they did not wish

                         to    remain       in the        ground .any longer.

                         were more          bodies and            injured    laid out on boards.               I was a p p r o a c h e d by

            At 8,45am Saturday 15th April 19^9* I commenced duty at Woodseats Police Station
I was transported to the Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground, Hillsborough for duties in
relation to the F.A, Cup, Semi-Final, Nottingham Forrest versus Liverpool,      On my arrival .
at the ground we were breifed, I was detailed to Serial 8, immediate supervision was
police Sergeant 1203 Marples and Inspector Calvert. On conclusion of the breifing were
were provided with a meal. On conclusion of the meal were went to the Spion Kop, together
with other officers I was to provide security for the Liverpool supporters that had been
allocated tickets for the spion kop, this was a small area adjacent co the      North Stand.
            At 2.10pm that same day I was on the Kop area of the ground, when my attention w,
was drawn to a group of youths a short distance away from me, the group were chanting and
gesticulating to the Liverpool supporters, who, were standing on the Kop. Together with
other officers I went to this particular group, one member of the group I had conversation
with, he had consumed a considerable amount of alcohol and was drunk, he was arrested by
Police Constable 41 Walmsley for the offence of being drunk at a designated sporting event
and escorted to the police room. Several other members of the group were also      arre.;ted
by other officers.
            At 2,40pm I returned to the kop, by this time the crowd had filled the kop to
the extent that there was little or no standing room on the terraced areas and people
were standing on the access walkways, I saw no stewards assisting people onto the kop or
keeping walkways clear, I would estimate that the number of people on the kop was too
many for safety. Whilst making my way back to the remainder of my serial, there were
numerous people who smelled strongly of intoxicants, although the behaviour of the fans
would be described as well behaved.
            At about 3.04pm I was on duty towards the rear of the side of the Kop that is
adjacent to the North Stand. I looked across the pitch and saw people climbing the
perimiter    fencing   of   the Leppings Lane terrace, on initial observations it appeared to
be a pitch invasion, due to    the length of time the game had been going it was obvious that
this was not the case. People continued to climb over the perimiter fence, others were
being pulled up into the West Stand from the terraces, as I watched, I saw one youth who
was wearing what appeared to be a yellow shirt or jumper, was pulled from the Leppings
Lane terrace into the west stand, the youth got his feet onto the parapet wall of the
West Stand then fell backward down onto the fans in the terrace. It was at this time that
I heard over a personal radio that there may have been fatalities, A small group of the
Liverpool fans that we had been guarding were distraught by the scenes from the far end
of the pitch, there requested that they be escorted from the ground, the match had not,
at this time been abandoned, but they stated that they did not wish to remain in the
ground any longer. Together with Police Constable 41 Walmsley and other officers we
escorted there fans from the ground onto Penistone Road. At this time I was approached
by a man who identifiedhimself to me as a doctor,     he   was escorted by myself send Police
Constable Walmsley onto     the pitch, gaining access on the slip-way between the kop and'the
North Stand.

          Whilst at the top of this slip-way I saw numerous dead bodies and injured people
being carried off the pich on M i l bpards by Police Officers and other Liverpool supporters
I ran onto the pitch, there were more bodies and injured laid out on boards, I was
approached by another Police constable who asked if I had any experience of rescusitation,
I had and I went to the first board, on the board was a young male, apparently dead, two
people were doing mouth to mouth and cardiac massage, as I approached the man doing the
 cardiac massage told me he was a doctor. I went to the next board, another young male,
apparently dead, nobody with him,    olice Constable Walmsley and I were about to commence
rescusitation when numerous Liverpool supporters ran down the pitch towards the Kop to the
Nottingham Forrest supporters, fearing another incident at   tie Kop end of the ground, I
and other officers went and prevented the Liverpool supporters reaching the Kop. I was
told by either an Inspector or Gheif Inspector to forn a cordon across the pitch to prevent
more disorder. The cordon moved up the pitch to the centre line, we remained at the centre
line until the order came to clear the ground, this being about 4-0 minutes after I had
first gone onto the pitch. From the time I went onto the pitch I saw numerous supporters
who were very abusive and aggressive towards the police, many of these were clearly drunk.
The situation on the pitch was very chaotic, there were many orders and counter orders, the
majority of decisions were made by Police Constables. For a considerable time I saw no
officers on the pitch above the rank of Cheif Inspector.
          I             had been on the pitch for a considerable length of time when I saw     Ch
Superintendent Nesbit, who appeared to take some control of the situation. Shortly after
the match was official abandoned and the fans were asked to leave. I went with other
officers into Penistone Road, I was detailed to stand outside Charlie Browns tyre shop and
stop people going down towards Herries Road, this I was told, was to keep an access route
for ambulances. It soon became apparent that the ambulances were travelling in the opposite
direction, by this time the congestion v/as so accute on penistone Road that nothing appeare
to be moviag.
          On conclusion, when the congestion had subsided, I returned to the North Stand
where I re-joined my serial. We were eventually stood down, we went into Penistmne Road
and waited for some time for transport back to Woodseats Police Station. On arriving at
that Police Station I went off duty ay 7 .15pm»




Police Constable 411.

             iL su.              wJf,


                   Thank you for your letter of 7 May about the
              release of material in the Hillsborough Disaster.


                   My Secretary has spoken to your office an^
              explained that, most unfortunately, we are unable
              to trace our file copy of my letter of 26 January
              1998 to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith.   If you would
              kindly send me a photocopy of that letter, I will
              be in a position to consider your (entirely
              appropriate)request.

                   I cannot imagine that I would have any cause
              to seek restraint on disclosure of the letter - but
              it would seem prudent to make sure.


                        My apologies again.

I can only          remember          two other         stops     being made where               other    sections         of

the    club boarded             the    coach.           The   first     of     these     two was made at

names      boarded the           coach.           The    other     stop was made at sometime                     between

      only things          that    I can        remember about             them     is that      one had dark          hair

      an d made      us    late    in a r r i v i n g     in Sheffield,             that was at about 2.0Qpm.

      (1400)        The    coach was        parked        in a road near a                chocolate      factory.

      It was       then a matter           of    leaving      the     coach and making my way-

      on foot       to the ground.              On    leaving       the    coach,      the    s e cretary

                   told us to meet              up back at          that     point after         the match.            It

      a p p e a r e d to me that all             the    s upporters          from the        coach made        their    own

      ways     to the      ground whe n          leaving      the     coach.           We did not all           go as one

      this     is a usual         sight     this       early before a m a t c h and there were

O u t s i d e the turnstiles,                  there were about 2 or 3 police                          officers      to

each turnstile           checking              f a n ’s tickets and              pockets.          There were        no

stewa r d s     there at that                 time    to my       recollection,           and     1 simply w a l k e d up

to a. turnstile,          (landed my ticket                      in and w a l k e d      through.           I had no

difficulty        in entering                 the    ground whatsoever.                   Once     inside,      again

there were a few fans m i l l i n g around                              but     it was    fairly empty and

easy    for others        and mys e l f              to move about.               Be f o r e    this    point,      that    is

f rom    leaving    the       coach to a c t u a l l y entering                    the ground,          I did not         see

any other        person       that       had t r a ve l l e d          on our     coach.



1 then bought a           programme                 from a nearby             vendor and                     went    to the

toilet.          We had       inten d e d to meet                 up a gain wit h each other                 but

s o m e h o w we m i s s e d one an d other and                        I did not      see                   a g a i n until

we    later     reached the          coach.



At about 2 . 3 0 p m      <1430)              I w a l k e d quite         freely through the             turiir ,

 eadi ng f rom the turnsti 1 e area and towards                                    the terrace.              There wer e

others     using    the       tunnel           at    this     time,       but    it was     not    crowded and

a p p e a r e d to be a normal                 m a t c h s p e ctator movement.



On    reaching     the    end of the                 tunnel,          overlooking        the, terrace,        1 saw that

there was a l r e a d y a large amount                           of    people a l r e a d y     there    in the      pens

be h i n d the goal.            This am o u n t             of    people were         not a c t u a l l y

overspilling        into the             tunnel         but      it was as a large              crowd d i r e c t l y at

the     point    of the       tunnel           meet i n g     the      terrace.          The    crowd a p p e a r e d

tightly       packed together,                  m uch    tighter         than a usual           crowd should         be.



1 did not want           to    push my way t h r o u g h the                    crowd and knowin                e layout

of the     ground as          I have           been there             once    before at        last Ve a        semi-

final,       I deci d e d to make my way out of that are a w ith a view to take

up a m a t c h      viewing        p o s ition at        the side      of the       terraces     behind    the

goal.         I was able           to talk with ease            t h r o u g h the t u n n e l, a g a i n there

was    no masses         of    people w a l k i n g       thro u g h and      I entered the        turnstile

y a r d a rea where           there was          still    a usual      size    crowd of       people milling

around       but    in the m a i n were walk i n g              towards       the     tunnel.      I noticed

that    there were            very few fans walking                towards      the side        of the    pens       I

had just       seen a l r e a d y       crowded.



                                                                               I h#m easy access           to the

                                                                                          here was a large

difference          betw e e n     this      pen and the        pens    behind         the goals.         T h e re

were    people       s t a nding       in the wing areas,              but    there was       so much more

space    that       could have          been used by a large                 number     of fans    had they

been d i r e c t e d     or knew where              to go other        than through the tunnel.                      I

stood    in this area and. perso n a l l y                  felt    safer      than whe n       i had    in the

pe ns b ehi nd th e goal.



As    I s tood      in tliis posit i o n my a t t e n t i o n was              constantly        being    drawn to

the    persons       b   e     h   i    n    d    f *       ^ 8 c a m 8 aware       tha 1 a 1ar ge amount            of

the    one    in w hich        1 was        standing and the           far    corner.



Leading       up to kick-off                time,   there were         in my opinion a l r e a d y too many

people       in the      pens beh i n d the goal.

started        to    cj, imb the         f ^ i c e ^ and e v e n t u a l l y    spil l e d onto        the     pitch,

I left     the ground at a bout 4 . 2 0 pm                     (1620).           I made my own way to the

coach a n d during                this    time     saw no other          person from our               coach.



Eventually,              on the      coach,       it became       known        that    two     persons were

miss i n g and we w a i t e d             for    them at       that    time.            I had no        idea who was

missing.             We w a i t e d      up until       6.00pm      (1800)       that      evening when a police

officer        came and told              us to      resume      our   journey.              1 still       had no      idea

who and why anyone was missing,                            it was      not      until      the following Mo n d a y

that     I found out the                 two    lads    from our       coach had died               in the tragedy.

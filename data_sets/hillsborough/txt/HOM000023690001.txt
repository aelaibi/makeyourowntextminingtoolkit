             FOOTBALL TRUST PAY £1.55m TO POLICE LEAGUE FOOTBALL LAST SEASON




The Football Trust,                      which is funded entirely by Littlewoods,                                            Vernons and

Betters        from         their        Spotting-the-Ball                   competition,              has      completed            a   total

payment of £1.55 million to clubs from the Football League, Scottish Football

League and GM Vauxhall Conference to help meet the cost of police charges at

league matches last season.                               The level of Trust support represents one third

of the total policing bill.



According to Football Trust statistics, the cost of policing league matches

in Great Britain increased during 1988-89 by 15.3% rising to the highest ever

level of £4.79 million.                           These figures follow the 14% increase shown in the

previous season when costs rose from £3.64 million in 1986-87 to £4.15

million during 1987-88.



Richard Faulkner,                    Deputy Chairman of The Football Trust,                                          commented ; 'The

Trust is particularly keen to encourage more effective policing at football

grounds and our commitment to make significant contributions towards police

charges   is designed       to enable clubs provide a safer environment               for

nupportero to watch the game.       However,       we are   extremely    concerned    with

the   rapid   rate    at which policing costs are rising.        Estimated figures for

the current season reflect this alarming trend and it is imperative that the

police authorities set a consistent and realistic level."               He added : "As a

result    the Trust    is   encouraging, clubs to re-negotiate their policing

arrangements."



Further analysis of the Trust's statistics for season 1988-89 reveals :



      *    The Football League First Division accounted for 36% of
           the total policing costs in Britain,

      *   for the second time in three seasons Chelsea paid the
          highest charges in England £166,929 - £45,000 more than
          season '87-88. Followed by Liverpool (£137,423), west Ham
          United (£134,079), Manchester United (£130,789), Everton
           (£118,974), Leeds United (£116,725), A s t o n Villa
           (£116,321) and Newcastle united (£100,727).

      *   the highest rate per 1,000 spectators paid by Chelsea -
           £461. Followed by Walsall (£405), Birmingham City (£403),
          Queen's Park Rangers (£401), Halifax Town (£396),
          Aldershot (£392) and Wimbledon (£371),

      *   policing costs continue to vary throughout the country.
          Chelsea's costs (£166,929) for '88-89 were almost nine
           times higher than fellow promotion challengers Blackburn
          Rovers (£20,070).    Wolves (£98,648) charged eleven times
           more than Southend United (£8,712).       Midlands clubs
           Walsall and Birmingham City pay second and third highest
           cost per spectator in England,

      *   total policing costs in Scotland are at their lowest level
           since 1985/6 falling by 17% from £812,187 to £694,617,

      *   for the fifth consecutive season Celtic have the highest
           police charges in Great Britain - £209,129 - whilst
          neighbours Rangers paid the third highest at £157,651,



                                                                           Continued.../

      *    Scunthorpe United are the Football League's most             cost
            effective club to police paying 5 pence per fan,

      *    six clubs in the Vauxhall Conference and five in the
            Scottish Second Division were not charged for policing.
            List includes Conference champions Maidstone United and FA
            Cup hopefuls Welling United.




The Football Trust introduced its policy to assist with police charges in

1985 when the three pools firms increased their donation from Spotting-the-

Ball.     The amount allocated by the Trust toward police charges alone is now

equivalent to more than 34 of the turnover of the PPA's competition.                Since

1984-85,    the    Trust's   support has     steadily    increased and now totals     £6.3

million over the five season period.



Grant-aid    for    police   charges   is    currently   available to Football   League,

Scottish Football League and GM Vauxhall Conference clubs at the rate of 35%

of total police charges.         First Division clubs in England are eligible for

assistance with costs up to a ceiling of £76,000 costs.              The Football Trust

has allocated a budget of £1.6 million for police charges during season 1909-

90.

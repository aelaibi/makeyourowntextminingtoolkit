        YOUR REF



        Dear Mr Burnnell

        The Hillsborough Disaster

        I refer to our telephone conversation today and confirm that my
        firm have been instructed by the Sun Alliance Insurance    Group
        to  act on behalf of their insured, the Football    League   and
        Sheffield   Wednesday   Football  Club,  with  regard   to   the
        forthcoming public inquiry and the civil claims that are likely
        to arise following the recent disaster at Hillsborough.

       I should be grateful if you would kindly note our interest.  An
       application will be made at the preliminary hearing on the 28th
       April  for Sheffield Wednesday Football Club to be  represented
       at the public inquiry.

        I note your interest in instructing Counsel for the inquiry,

     z'— ¥e^rs sincepe±y                                                — .

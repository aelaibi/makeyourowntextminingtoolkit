             I am                         a Police Constable in the Greater Manchester

             Police attached to the As hton-unde r~ Lyne/ Traf f i c Unit,



             On Saturday,   15th April,    1989 (150489)    my tour of duty was from 7.00

             am <0700 hrs) to 3.00 pm (1500 hrs)          driving a signed traffic       patrol

             Range Rover using the call sign Gold Tango Three Zero             (GT30).



             One of my main duties that day was to act as the Motorway and Accident

             Unit for the 'G* Division      <Ashton-unde r~-Lyne) .



             From approximately 9.00 am      (0900 hrs)     to 10.15 am    <1015 hrs)    that day,

             I assisted the Section Inspector,       Inspector Lord regarding the traffic

             lights   in the centre of Mott ram village and those at the Gun
                                                                                  PAGE      2
                                                                                  S1027

Inn at Hoilingworth,    anticipating very heavy traffic travelling                 from

the Manchester direction through our area towards Sheffield,                 the vast

majority being football     fans of Liverpool who were supporting their

team at a match in Sheffield,



As far as 1 can remember,      there was not a heavy flow of traffic when I

left the t raf f i c lights to return to the ^P'raffic Unit.
                                                        I   .                           m C
                                                  tjof             ,         04             ^
H o w e v e r , when I returned to the traffic    1 igrits a^yijffttram at   11.45 a W

(1145 h r s ) I could now see t raff i c w a s almost at a standstill          from the

eastern terminal    roundabout at Mott ram to the Gun Inn traffic, lights

in Hoi 1ingworth.


                                                  yo feiko"2-
I saw a Police motor     cyclist,   Constable                   operating the

traffic lights in Mottraro village manually to assist              in giving

Sheffield bound traffic a longer run to hopefully clear the back                      log

of traffic whi ch was now at a standst i11 on the M&7 Motorway for

approximately two and a half miles.



I also saw Section Police Constable, Constable                         operating the

t raff i c 1ights at the Gun Inn manually for a similar effect



Both the Force Control Room and Divisional Communications were

constantly giving updates      regarding the traffic to the Of f i ce rs clase

to the scene.                                                                     /


It was now quite clear that the vast majority of traffic was L i v e r p o o l

footbali   fans en route to Sheffi eld as most           cars had scarves hanging

from the vehicles they were travelling           in.
                                                                                        PAGE      3
                                                                                        SI 027

         Approximately 1.00 pm <1300 hrs)         I was liaising with Constable

                     also of the Tames i de T raf f i c Unit, and the Section C o n s t a b l e ,

         Constable                at the traffic lights at the Gun Inn,

         Hoi 1i ngWorth,   whilst trying     to give East bound t raff i c a longer      run to

         try agaiyi to c 1 ear any back log of traffic travelling to the match,

         but the linger the run,         the more vehicles seemed to come from the

         di rection \f the m o t o r w a y , the nambers/of vehicles seemed endless,

                        uS    J-m jjiC c M Jt
         A short time later I returned toy^he m o t o r w a y , travelling West and as

         I went down the m o t o r w a y , I cojtfld still see st anding traffic on the

         East bound carriageway up to/the Hyde on slip road, a distance of

         approximately two miles'



         At 1.15 pm <1315 h r s ) I again liaised with Constable]_________ on the

         motorway West bound near to the Hyde off slip,             regarding the traffic,

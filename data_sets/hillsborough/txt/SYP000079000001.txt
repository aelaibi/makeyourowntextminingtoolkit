We stop pe d at a service                   station on the m o t o r w a y but          I do not know

w h i c h one,       we also      had a delay but             only a slight        one.       As a result of

an a c c i d e nt w h i ch o c c u rr e d         in front     of us.      We d i d n ’t have a ny drink

in our van but              there m a y have          been    in the     other    but   I ’m not     sure.

We a r r i v e d     in S h e f f i e l d at about         1.00     pm parking     ojn^a pub car         park

a bout       10 m i nu te s    from the          ground.      We went>*rTXo the         pub and       it had

more N o t t i n g h a m Fo re st           suppo rt er s     th^rffLi ve r poo 1 but the a tm os ph er e

was    good.         We   st ay ed there          for aj^dut one hour,           we never      received a

P ol i c e    escort      but we      knew whe/e we were              going any how.           During      our

walk     to the ground            I never w i t n e s s e d a ny d r un ke ne ss        or disorder.

I got to the Lep pings Lane ^ ^ s t ) ^ 8 s a t                        a bout 2.30      pm.     There was no

queues        It was just, a mass                of jreople.        We w a l k ed thro ug h the       perimeter

gates        quite eas il y but as ^ o o n               as we got      in between the         perimeter

gates and the             t ur ns t il e s you felt a crush starting.                     AS more      people

s t a r t e d entering         the area.           The    people were       going thro ug h any

tu rn s t i l e    to get      to any       part     of the ground,        you    could not see any

signs        telling you w h ic h           turnstile        te^ enter.

I can not          remember       seeing any stewards                outside     the ground but, I was

s e a r c h e d twice       outside        the    t urnstiles       by Pol ic e Officers.           N o r m al l y

you're        s e arched      if y ou g e t/ t h r o u g h    the turnstiles.           I thought        this

added        to the delays           for    getting       into the ground.          I e v e nt u al l y got          in

t h ro u g h a t u rnstile at about, 2 .45                   pm.     I did not see any other               gates

open,        or being       opened.

I did not          know my w ay to the N o rt h S tand and                   I didn't      see any signs

h owever       the    lad     I was w i t h did know how to get there                     I saw no

disorder,          drunkness         or    c o ns um pt io n of alcohol        on my wa y to my seat.                     I

didn't        see any Police  a / s t e w a r d s . We had to find our own wa y to our
                                 x57
seats.         I got to my syeat aa about 2 .50 pm.         I was near the H a l f w a y

Line     but      s l i ghtly towards            the L ep pi n gs    lane Side and towards             the

               came      onto     the    pitch,    an d the m at ch kicked                off.       I had

               /noticed the           centre     pens were        packed but                two side         pens were      empty,

itiT5 y        Just     after Peter B e a r d s l e y           hit o n e I           noti c e d th e      surge     in the     pens

               b eh i n d the goal.            T he n    people     a^arted         coming over the fences w i t h i n               a

               minute       shor t l y after        this ylme       game was stop pe d and               I remained w here           I

               was     for about        15 minuts

               I then m o v e d down to join my brother who w ^ / in the N orth S tand about

               J ust     prior       to joining my brother               I noti ce d that            people who       had    climbed

               over      the    fence were        being arrested,             I also        noticed Police            officers

                pointing        at    people     on top of the fence an d they                       climbed back         in.

               UJhilst      I was wit h my brother                I wa lk ed to the             front    of the stand.           I

               wanted       to go on to the              pitch to assist            the    injured        people     but a number

               of      people     in front       of me were         offering their              a ss is ta nc e   but were      told

                to stay where            they were,

                I think        a number     of    things were a factor                in the deaths and               injuries

               the     fact     that there were            too m an y       people    in the         pens,    the    surge whe n

               Eleardsley hit the               post,     n or ma ll y you w o u l d go back but                  people were

               still       coming       in and took        up the     space w h ic h had been                created.
                                                                                                 <°/y I r ^ M A / a y
                I left      the      ground just after            4 pm after         I had heard jc l oudspeaker

                I do \not think           the P ol i ce         relied      q u i c k ly enough also          the amount        of

               Pol i c e    in front       of the N o r 'th S tand and across                    the    pitch why d i d n ’t

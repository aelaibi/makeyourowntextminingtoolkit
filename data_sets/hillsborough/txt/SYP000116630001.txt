            area     mostly          in    company       with PS Reynolds                       o n foot p a t r o l a l o n g L e p p i n g s

            Lane     between          th e      two    r o ads     above.            As      t i me     went      by    the       volume       of

            spectators           arriving             grew,      many      asking            for      directions             to P u b l i c        Houses

            and     it w a s     apparent             to me      t h at    a    large         number         of     them        di d    not    have

            tickets        for       the     match.          I must        have        b e e n a s k e d at            l e as t    5 0 — 60         t i m es

                                                                                                                                         R2A



There       were        groups       of      fans        walking           up a n d       down Lappings              Lane        asking

others        for       tickets,          this       went           on    from    the       t i me     of m y a r r i v a l         at    the

point       until        just       before          kick-off.               I saw         several          instances           of

spectators              purchasing             tickets              I think         23 was           the     asking       price.




The       mood     of    the       fans      arriving               was    generally            happy/boisterous/singing

obviously               lookingforwa rd               to       the       match.         1      did     not    see        any     bad

behaviour               as    s u c h but      as     t im e        g ot n e a r e r    k i c k — off      there      were       still

m a ny a s k i n g f o r t i ckets.



From       about        2pm     I was        with        PS       "1561 R e y n o l d s        standing          in f r o n t       of a

private          garage        area       almost             opposite           Eskdale         Road       just     after        I t h i nk

B i e k e r t o n Road.             This       was       a    result         of a       complaint            from an        elderly

couple        who       were       washing          their           car    in the         garage        area       regarding             fans

using        the        garages           as     a t oi l e t .




From       that         point      we     could        see          down    L e p p i n g s Lane        to the       bottom          at    the

roundabout              at    Peni stone            R o ad ,        during       t h at     t im e     there       was    -a c o n t i n u o u

stream        of    f ans      arriving,              causing             problems          for      traffic        on the          road,

one       f a n w as     spoken         to     by P S R e y n o l d s            for      deliberately              walking          on    the

road       in f r o n t       of    a bus.            The m o o d          was    generally             good       natured          and

e n t h u s ias t i c .        There         seer        1 to        be    no    1e I     up    of     numbe r s     arri v i n g         a nd

about       2.30pm           I made       the       po int          to P S (Reynolds              that       there       was     no w ay

could       they        get     into      the       ground           for    kick-off,             and      for     them     to      do    so

the       kick-off           would      have        to       be     delayed.            About        3pm     1 heard        on PS

Reynold*s           radio          that      there           wa s    a    large        crowd      at    the      turnstiles              and

apparent           trouble          t he r e .




As    a    res u l t     together            with PS Reynolds,                      PC      Bradley          and    PC    S e v e r n we
went     directly             to    to     the       turnstile             area,        l a rge      numbers         of    persona

the re ,      I saw        some          climbing          up    o ve r     t he       wall     into      the       ground       and many

of     them    running             up and         climbing            over        the       turnstiles          themselves.                 The

time     then w o u l d            be     about       3.05pm          just        after       the       main    bulk       of    them       ha d

been     let       in t h r o u g h        the       gate       which       had        been opened.                 Not    knowing          at

th at    time       th at         the     gate       had    been        opened          I    prevented          several          youths

from     climbing             over        the     turnstiles               and moved            others         to    the    other        side

of     the    gates        in      front        of    the       turnstiles.                  Remained          there       and. s e v e r a l

'fans*        leaving             t he    ground        then      informed              me    that       there       were       serious

problems           i nside,          one     described             it      it as        being        worse      than       the       Heysel

diaafter.




Many     people          leaving            the      ground       now and              the    general          attitude          n ow was

of     anger       and     sheer          hatred        towards            th e     Police,          many      threatening

officers           and     calling           us m u r d e r e r s ,         the        main     were      very       hostile          towards

us,     so m u c h       so       that      I was       afraid          for       my    own and          other       officers

safety.            Many       of     them were             in    tear s.




About        3.20pm        I was          in d e s p e r a t e        need        of    the     toilet,         so    I want          into

th e    ground          and w a l k e d         down       the    side         of      the N o r t h      Stand       to    the       to i l e t ,

there        were       large        numbers          leaving           t he      stand       by     them,      while        in the

toilet        ( alone)            I was      subjected            to a b a r r a g e            of      threats       and       abuse       from

about        3 0 men,         3    or     4 t old       them      to       leave        me    alone       as    it w a s        not m y

fa ul t,      if t h e y          had     not     d on e    t hi s      I feel          s ure      that     I would         h av e     been

assaulted.               On       leaving         the      toilet          I walked           around        the      back       of    the

West     Stand          t ry ing         t o f i nd a w a y           on    t o t he         playing        a r ea,       but    noI

knowing        the       ground           could       not       get     on.         Unable         to    get    on    to    the       pitch        I

then     had       to    return           outside          the    ground            and      join       other       officers          there.

Ambulances              and       fire     tenders          were        arriving             now a n d a s t e a d y            continuous

stream        of    people           leaving          the       ground         and      the a b u s e       and      threats

                                                                                                                            RE4

       continued.         Some        coming       up a n d       asking    me w h e r e    the     nearest        pub w a s .

       I remained         there       until    we     were        stood    down and asked            to    regroup          in the

      No r t h Stand,           From     there        I walked       with    my    serial       to C l a y w h e e l s      for

       food     and   subsequent           transport          back    to D o n c a s t e r .



       I feel     t hat    I should          have      been       informed     in the       event        of a n    emergency

       where     to go     in    the     ground -           should    I be     needed.          It w a s ji&Trt'ioned

       about     codes     in    emergencies,               but    1 did    not J k j T a ^ ^ o w   to    get     on   to    the

       While     standing        outside        the     ground       and    being      subjected          to    the    threads

            I o bt ai ne d a ticket          for     the Cu p semi               final     on   15th April        1989 from

            Anfield.          I paid £6 and the                 ticket was          for    the L ep pings       Lane     terrace

            On the morning           of S a t u r d a y       15th April           1989 I t ra v el l ed up to

            Merseyside.

            T here were       no delays        on the           journey and we a r r i v e d at S h e f f i e l d

            M i d l a n d R a il w ay S t at i o n at         12.25prn.          On our arrival          at the      railway

            s ta ti on we were m a r s h a l l e d            onto a wait in g            bus   by police who           then
                                                                                                                    PAGE            I

        e sc or te d us to the ground.

        We a r r i v e d at the g r o u n d at about               1pm and made          our way to the

        t ur ns ti le s at the .Leppings Lane t e r r a c e .                   I had a free          passage t h ro ug h

        the    t u rn st il es    because       of the early arrival.

        I a r r i v e d on the terrace,               t hr ou gh the tunnel          at about       1 .15pm a nd we

        met    up w ith some         of our      friends who we u s ua l ly see at the matches.                                We

        d ec i de d to go to the           front       of the terrace           by the      fence     for a good

        view,      but when the terrace                filled up three            of us decided to go to the

        back.       Once       at the    back    I had d if fi cu lt y        in seeing         enough of the           pitch

        so    I forced my way back               down to thet f r o n t .

        I e v en t u a l l y a r ri v ed at my m a t c h viewing              point w h ic h was          right at the

t f r   front at the fence at about 2 . 4 0 p m .

        The    crowd was         packed t ig h tl y       by now and         I could not move             i n d e pe n da n ti y

        from     the     crowd.     I was       s q u as he d up agai ns t        the    fence.      As    I f aced the

        pitch      I was       p ositioned a few yards              to the      right      of the     right     hand

        post.       Whilst       I was at       the front         I was    s ta nding wit h       Inga S H A H r r

                                   G ol de rs Green,            London,    M a r i a n n e M C C A B E from B a s i l d o n

        in Essex,         both of these          girls       died in the        crush,     and Steve OATES.

        T here was a tight              crush from 2 . 4 0 p m until 4 m i nu te s               to three w he n         the

        teams were a n n o u n c e d .          At    this      point   there was a surge             from the        back

        crushing me up against                  the    perimeter        fence.       The    surge then         relaxed

        s li g h t l y   but    it was    i m m e d ia t el y    followed     by a se co nd surge a ga in

        crushing me against               the    fence.          At this     point      I was    t er r if i ed that       I

        was    going      to die,       there was       just      sheer    panic     e ve r yb o dy was      screaming.

        The    second      surge    s ub si de d an d then          it was      i m m e d ia t el y f ol lo w e d   by the

        most     powerful        surge    that       fo rc ed me flat a g ai ns t          the fence.          This surge

        never      relaxed and as          I was       s qu as he d up a g ai ns t       the fence the          only     part

        of my body that            I could move were my fingers.                         My face had been             turned

        to the      left and the          right       side      of my face was          being    forced      into the

        fence.

                                                                                                                 S 11 6 6

The ,Iast time             I saw    Inga a l i v e was just            before            the final     s u r g e , she

was    standing         to my      left.         After    the final          surge when my face was

fo r c e d to face          I n g a ’s I saw that she had gone                      purple,      her    eyes were

shut                                                              she was          o b vi ou sl y dead

About        3-4 feet       past    Inga       I saw a man trying              to        protect a w o m a n      in

front        of him by holding              his arms        out straight            and holding         the fence.

I saw another man who was                        forced against         this mans arm.                 The mans arm

was    being        kept    s t at i on a ry     because     of the      crush and the other                  m a n ’s

throat        was    being       forced onto        this arm.          He was        trying      to make a noise

but he        could not          breath.         He was     conscious         but        his m ou th was      open

attempting           to gasp for          b re a th but to no avail.

       he then         lost      consciou sness,          turned     purple and died.

I was        standing       just    in front        of the       barrier       that        e ve nt u al l y broke and

there were a lot of dead                       bodies,      o b vi ou sl y    caused whe n the            barrier

broke,        that were          crushed agai ns t me,              it was         the    dead weight       of all

these        bodies     that a d d ed to the             force     on my back.

Du r i n g   the     crush        as     I was   being forced          into the            fence I began to            lose

consciousness,              it was        so hot and         I could         not    breath. I        e v en t u a l l y

lost     c o n s c i o u s n e s s and    I can     remember       e ve ry t hi n g        going silent        and

peaceful.            All    I could see was a bright w hite                         light.       At this        point        I

was a w o k e n      by a police          officer who was            s la pping my face and tell in g me

to keep my eyes                 open.     Once     I had r e g a i n e d      c o ns c io us ne ss     1 could         see

police       o f f i c e r ’s      legs in front          of me,     they were             up on the     fence      trying

to    rip     it down.            They e v en t u a l l y    pulled some a wa y to my left.The

immense        prssure on my             back    slowly s ub sided until                   the only pressure

on me was           that    of the       dead     bodies on        my legs          forcing them         into the

wall     in front          of me.

I could        put my hand t h ro u g h the open gate                        but    I could not get             thro ug h

it.

I e v e n t u a l ly    climbed out            of the     stack of dead bodies                  up the      fence
                                                                                                               PAGE       4
                                                                                                               S 116 6

             s l i ghtly and then thro ug h the gate              to my    r i g h t,.   I was    then drag ge d

             out of the gate an d s tu mb l ed onto             the    pitch.       1 c o 1 lapsed     into the

             goalmouth,       I was   trea te d    by the St.      J o h n ’s ambulance,         they gave me

             water an d oxygen.         After     a while      1 made my way to the middle                  of the

             pitch,                    helped me to walk           because      I had no feeling            in my

             legs and     I c o u l d n ’t see    because     I had    lost my glasses.

             I sawI             I n g a ’s son,   and    I then saw Inga being             carried away          on a

             stretcher     so   I d iv er te d             s a t t e n t i o n so he w ou ld     not see.

            Most      of the bodies     had been        removed from the          terrace and were           being

             taken off the       pitch w he n      I saw                  |s jacket      on the gravel         between

             the     pitch and y here     she was       standing      behind the fence.             I never      saw

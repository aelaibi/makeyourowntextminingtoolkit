  Thank you for your letter of 15 April to Jack Straw, enclosing correspondence
  from |______________________________________________________________
        labout the Home Secretary's decision not to hold a fresh inquiry into the
 .Hillsborough Disaster.

  I can fu lly appreciate that the Home Secretary's decision is a disappointment to
  the families of those who died and for many who have supported the families'
  campaign. As he explained in the House, one of our first concerns on taking
  office last year was to ensure that there should be a thorough and independent
  investigation of any material which cast doubt on earlier findings about the
  disaster, and it was to this end that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith was asked to
\ conduct his scrutiny.

 The Home Secretary has emphasised that he is satisfied Lord Justice Stuart-




I
 Smith has conducted a thorough scrutiny of the evidence and considered its
 significance carefully. His report is comprehensive and sets out clearly the
 matters he has considered and the reasons for his conclusions. He has
 considered all the material allegations about missing or concealed videotape
 evidence, the alleged interference w ith witnesses and witness statements and
 ^concerns about the use of the 3 .1 5pm cut-off time at the Inquest.

 It is inevitable w ith a disaster of this magnitude that evidence w ill emerge from
 time to time which has not been heard publicly before. What the scrutiny had to
 consider was not only whether the evidence put forward was new, but also
 whether it was of such significance that it would justify a new inquiry, or further
 consideration by the Attorney General (with regard to the inquest) or the criminal
 or disciplinary authorities.

 The Home Secretary has considered the Judge's report carefully and accepts the
 conclusion which he has reached that the evidence submitted to him does not
 add anything significant to the evidence available to and considered by the
 Taylor Inquiry and the Inquests. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has made it clear that
 he entirely accepts Lord Justice Taylor's conclusion that the principal cause of
01 JUL   '98   15:42 HO F2 DIVISION 0171 273 2703                                  P. 3/3




  the disaster was the failure of police control. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith himself
  condemned w hat he described as Chief Superintendent Duckenfield's
  "disgraceful lies" that the fans had opened Gate C.

  The Home Secretary has indicated that he shares the sentiments expressed by
  the Lord Justice Stuart-Smith in Chapter 7 of his Report when he says:

  7 understand the dismay that they (the families) have that no individual has
  personaiiy been heid to account either in a criminal court, disciplinary
  proceedings, or even to the extent o f losing their jo b ‚Äù.

  There are profound shortcomings in the present police discipline system which
  we intend to address- In January, the Home Affairs Select Committee published
  some im portant recommendations about the police complaints and discipline
  procedures. The Home Secretary has recently announced his response to the
  HAC recommendations including his intention to reduce the standard of proof to
  the civil standard in discipline procedures and to remove the existing double
  jeopardy provision which restricts criminal and disciplinary action on the same
  facts. He has also endorsed the Committee's recommendation that forces should
  show greater commitment to their powers to verify claims of sickness and
  disability and, where appropriate, to postpone a request to retire on ill health
  grounds until the completion of disciplinary proceedings.

 The Home Secretary has also indicated his support fo r Lord Justice Stuart-
 Sm ith's endorsement of the findings of a Home Office Working Party, published
 in March 1997, that the role of the coroner after a public inquiry should be
 lim ited, The main change proposed by the Working Party was to relieve coroners
 of the need to resume their inquest after an inquiry has been completed. If this
 had been in place at the time of the Hillsborough Disaster, it would have spared
 the families of those who died unnecessary distress when the Taylor Inquiry had
 covered substantially the same ground as the Inquest.

 r For the families of those who died at Hillsborough the grief w ill never end, and it
   Iwill clearly be d ifficu lt for them to accept the Home Secretary's decision. The
  /original Taylor Inquiry was very thorough and was unequivocal in identifying the
 I main causes of the disaster, and I hope that the families w ill accept Lord Justice
I Stuart-Sm ith's scrutiny was equally rigorous- As you w ill know, a number of
| Members spoke at the adjournment debate on 8 May, The Home Secretary also
I met a delegation of families to explain his approach w hilst in Southport on 7
jj March, and has indicated his willingness to meet the families again in
 j Merseyside.

            Hillsborough Stadium Disaster Inquiry

I refer to your letter of 23rd May 1989 to the General
Secretary of the ACPO at New Scotland Yard which was passed
to me for my attention, and enclose six copies of the ACPO
Submission to your Inquiry,     together with the relevant
Appendices.   Although the bound document incorporating the
Appendices is not marked 'Confidential' there are some papers
in it (e.g. the minutes of Police Conferences on Football)
which are clearly not public documents.    I am sure you will
be mindful of this point in your use of the various papers.

If there are any particular aspects upon which further police
evidence or information is required I will be happy to oblige
on request.

I should mention that the formal minutes of the latest series
of post-season police conferences on football are not yet
available and will be forwarded in due course.

Mr. David Phillips (Secretary of the ACPO Sub-Committee) and
I will be glad to meet The Rt. Hon. Lord Justice Taylor if he
wishes.

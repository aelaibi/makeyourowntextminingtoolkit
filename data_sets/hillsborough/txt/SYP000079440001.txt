                      There were some Police OJ^icers about;                       I remember seeing a mounted

      A               policeman and an I riipe^or but it appeared that there was very little

        some     verballing           going on because                people were           getting         very anxious

        a bout    the situation a nd                it w/(s heading               towards        kick off.         I ought     to

        say that        I a tt en d ed       last ^ a r s        m atch with a similar                     ticket and all        I

        can say       is that         nothing A p r ings             to min d that          there was any d ifficulty

        last year at all               in getting             into    the ground.

        T here were        no orderly queues as                      such at all,           for example at A n fx el d

        m o u n t e d Police O f f icers are at each turnstiles at the Kop E nt rances

        w h i c h force you to go                 into orderly queues?                  what was happening at

        H i l l s b o r o u g h was    not    like       that and          it a p p e a r e d that         the turnstiles

        were     closed;      I of - course - d i d n ’t know if that was so neither

        obv io u s l y did the          people who were joining at the back of this                                       crowd,

        it just a p pe ar ed that                 there was          no movement at all and the                        crush just

        got worse with             people         shouting       things          like    ’W e ’ve paid for our             tickets

        now they w o n ’t let us                  in."

        At   kick off time             I found myself                pir          by the      blue        concertina g a t e

        which was        suddenly opened from                              eft    to    right.           I just got      carried

i       Police Officers               standing a longside                  the wall       on my          left   hand side

        There was a lot of verbals                        to the Police as                they      passed       throh

        probably       venting         their       frustration.

        I got to my seat about 5 minutes after                                    ’k i c k - o f f ’ j

        not there,         they a r ri v ed about 2 — 3 minutes                            later,

        There was a moment               in the m atch when Liverpool                            hit^the        goal   bar and

        this was met with a huge                     vocal       roar       from the supporters;                  shortly after

        this     I became aware              of    people       climbing          over yr\e perimeter              fence a t the

        L ap pings     Ln E n d .       I formed          the opinion thatfr it was a form of

        h o o l ig a n i s m and      it w a s n ’t until            I saw people            lying on the          pitch near
                                                                                                           P AGE     3
                                                                                                           S2370

the goal mouth that                I realised that something was                       s er iously w rong and

that       it w a s n ’t hooliganism.            Shor tl y after        this the m atch was

a b a n d o n n e d and ob v io us ly the N ot ti n gh a m supporters                   d i d n ’t know what

had h a p pened and            there was a lot of           chanting,        a    lot of uniform           police

officers arri v e d on the               pitch at about           the same t irne i n j ured f a n s were

being       carried away from             the Leppings Ln end.               I suppose           the Police

Officers       d i d n ’t really know what had h ap pe ne d at this stage,                            it must
                                 y
have       been like havin g/ a piece of a jigsaw puzzle.        G ra d ua l ly                       the

picture       emerged o f/how serious               the    incident was           because        I saw fans

being       carried o r/ st re tc he rs with their                faces    covered and their               limbs

just       hanging    over the sides.             The     fans were       first      to    react;    I think

the    police     officers at L ep pings Ln                probably thought               it was

h oo l i g a n i s m rather      than    people being        injured arfid shortly after                   this

more Police          officers a r ri ve d and formed a j n n e                   across     the    pitch.

Gradually        events        u n f olded and the o rg an is a ti o n seemed to get                  better

but    it did take quite a time to get                      i\rto full       swing.         I left trie

g round at about          quarter        to four. . At this           time       I was aware        that 3

people       had died but         of    course    I found out         later       the     full    extent    of the

disaster.         We drove back            to L i ve r p o o l / o n l y stopping         to make a phone

call   .
In my opinion what was                  oc curring y^utside the ground                    (ie the    crushing)

s hould have been relayed to thoi-p inside                          the ground who w ould have

been able        to take some ac t io n about               it.     Also when Ule first               fans

began to       climb the         perimeter       fences     the Police           o j ^ i o u s 1y thought

initially that           it was        h o ol ig an is m and d i d n ’t rjract a c c o r d i n g l y but of

ccurse they may not have                   known what was          hcnj^jjieni rtg .      Some    individual

officers       did begin to take action when they o bv i ou s ly / re a li s ed what

was    happening       but they a pp ea r ed to            lack any       co-ord^Tnation at first.

Finally       I have     seen and         read   items 29 — 38 i nc                 i ve on my      completed

q u e s t i o n n a i re and    really they sum up my opinions and observations.

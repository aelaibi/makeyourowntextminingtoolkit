                Wednesday            footbaisl g round .



                 On S a t u r d a y     15 April           1989 >4^0489^       I opened the snack                bar   up at about

                 113Q am        (113Q)        wit h my husband                          We were       there       to serve    the
                                                                                                                   PAGE      ;
                                                                                                                   S2050

farts from the N o t t i n g h a m Forest                v Liverpool             football        semi    final.



The    fans       on foot a nd who            came     in cars star te d            coming for          food straight

away.



We were          busy all       the    time    up until         2 . 30pm     <1430)       when    I was      thinking

of    closing           but we then had an           influx      of        fans constantly between 2.30prn

<1430)          and 3. 10 pm          <1530)    I believe they must have                   come off         late

a rr iv i n g     coaches.



Some       of the        fans were      obv io us ly drunk            but only          in a m erry f ri en dl y way

they w e r e n ’t abus iv e at all.                     They were            all    very jovial.              We saw no

trouble.                I d i d n ’t see a ny fans       drinking          out     of    cans. All      the fans

w h ic h    I served were Liv er po ol                 fans.



Some       of    the fans were          swearing        in general           c o n ve rs at io n but- whe n they

saw my 2 year old grand daughter                           in the bar            they a p o l o g i s e d    to me for

their       language.                                                   \.



I must          say that       I      thought      the fans were late a rr iv in g                I served         the

last       fan just after 3pm               <1500)      and      we    closed a b o u V - \ e n    past      three

<1510)          whe n    I s t a rt ed to      clear    up.



About       half        past   four we      left     in our       car to go home.                 I noticed a lot

of    crowds        of L iverpool        farts       walking          back up Hali fa x Rd towards                  us.      I

just       thought        they were      fans        who      c o u l d n ’t get    in.



I forgot          to say about          three      o ’clock       <1500)      I started to see               police

v ehicles         speeding         up and down the            road and hearing              police sirens,               I

just       thought        there was a big            fight      going      on.

                                                                                                  S2050



We    drove down P e n i st on e Rd towards           the football        ground and the traffic

was    blocked and      congested so my         husband did a            ’U ’ turn and went home

along    the back streets         to a v oi d   the traffic.              I still b el ieved it              was

just a fight w hich         had spilled out onto            the streets.



We a r r i v e d home   between 5 p m and quarter            past    (1700 and       1715).            I

turned the t el ev i s i o n on and        immediately        saw on      ’S p o r t s v i e w ’ the

t rouble at H i l l s b o r o u g h at   the football        ground and       I c o u l d n ’t believe

it.      I c o u l d n ’t believe    people     had died.



While    I was    on the snack       bar   no   one asked      if I had any          tickets      for        the

m a t c h and no one     tried to sell me any.



I wo rk ed   the same m at ch       last year     1988.         I wo rk ed the bar w i t h my

sister.        I must admit       I d i d n ’t think      the fans were as           late a rr iv in g

as    this year.        A ga in the fans were          very frien dl y and          I never-

w i t n e s s e d any trouble.



T here were      quite a few food sellers a ro u n d              the football         ground      on

Saturday     13 April     1989    <-150489)     but    I ’m a fr a i d   I cannot      name any of

them because       I d o n ’t know who      they were.            If I did      I w ould      tell         you.

 arrive       about          this             tim e.          There      was      still     a vast        number          of        supporters,

 again      the     majority                   being          Liverpool           fans    moving         along         both sides             of

 Penistone          Road            and        again          I would add           that many            of       these      fans      had

 obviously          been            drinking,                 some     I would       say       from      my       experience,              quite

 heavily.          There                was        the    usual        rowdiness          and     chanting             from         these

 supporters            at          t h is      time       but      nothing         that     warranted a n y P o l i c e                    action.

At     about      2.30             p.m.        I looked            up a l o n g     Leppings            Lane,       it w a s        extremely

 the    entire         r oad            looked           just      like      ’a s e a     of    bobbing           Heads'.             It w a s

 certainly         unpassable                       to    vehicular            traffic.         There         did      not     appear         to   be

      request          of    Inspector            (name      not      known)          we    formed a            cordon a c r os s            the

      mouth       of    the       turnstiles           to    stop any             further          persons         gaining         access.

      Shortly          after       this     an    ambulance             arrived and                went      through         the     cordon

      to    the    rear       of     the    stand.           I then          saw      one     or    two L i v e r p o o l         supporters

      come     out      of     the      ground      they were             red       faced      and       one,      a middle.aged

     man,     was       c ry ing.          I then        noticed what                 I presumed were                  i n j u r e d .'persons

      being       carried          to     the    rear       of    the     ambulance.                The      middle         aged     chap

     stood        in f r o n t       of    the    cor d o n ,       he w a s        crying         and     saying,          "Is    it w o r t h

      it?     People          are       dying     in     there."             At     t his     stage        I had       no    i dea      of w h a t

the match was being abandoned, with this and after an announcement by Kenny

Dalglish the fans started to drift away and the stadium slowly emptied.                   I

was   then   joined   in   the       cordon by    Police   Sergeant    Ashton   and Police

Constable    2905   Greatorex.       After a     short   while   Police   Sergeant   Ashton

directed us    to return toour designated duty and we made                out   way to the

roundabout where we again        located Police Constable 243 Landers and Police

Constable 2804 McFarlane, together with other members                 of the serial,    all

except for Police Constable 2967 Frost.




I would point out at this stage that the length of Penistone Road towards

the railway station was littered with beer cans and bottles.




At around 6 p.m. we were stood down to Claywheels Lane for standby there.

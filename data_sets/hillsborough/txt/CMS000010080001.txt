    Mr Bolton


                          TAYLOR INQUIRY:
           THE FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION AND FOOTBALL LEAGUE


        Thank you for your note of 23 February.  I have written as
    you proposed to the Football Association (copy attached).

    2. You mentioned that the DOE were inclined to recommend
    a joint DOE/Home Office meeting with the Football Association.
    The Home Secretary would like to know what the DOE has in
    mind, but his initial reaction is to accept DOE's suggestion.
    I would be grateful for further advice on this, when it is
    possible.




    27 February 1990                                                   MS S J DENT

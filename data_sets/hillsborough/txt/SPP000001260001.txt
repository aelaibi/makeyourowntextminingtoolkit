           i, ROGER HOUIDSWORaH, of

           will state:



           I am    years old and up to the wsek commencing 10th April (100489) I

           was employed as Technical Director by M W (Technology) Limited of

           Sheffield.    I had been employed in that capacity for some 2 years

           until I resigned my position.    I hold an HNC qualification as an

           Electronics Engineer.   Prior to working with M W (Technology) Limited,

           I had previously worked for more than 10 years abroad, in the

           electronics field.



           When I returned from working abroad, in 1986 (000086), I was

           approached by the then Company Secretary of Sheffield Wednesday

           Football Club, Dick CHESTER, who asked me to assist in relation to



                                                                                           620
                                                                 PAGE      2
                                                                 S668A

certain problems the Club were having with their closed-circuit

television systems (CCTV). I understand the CCTV system then

installed, had been put in place by Philips Alarms in about 1984

(000084), but that Company had subsequently gone out of business.



I did look at the system at Mr CHESTER'S request and as then designed

and installed it was not working properly.



Shortly afterwards, I joined M W (Technology) Limited, and whilst

their employee, I completed my examination of the existing system and

re—designed it to improve the system and also the computer system

related to it.    I also re-designed the CCTV system which had been

installed by the Club for police use - this being a separate system

from that operated by the Club for its own purposes.



THE CLUB SYSTEM
This consisted of a number of static TV cameras situated at

strategic points around the ground.    As a result of my examining the

system, I arranged for some additional cameras to be installed to

enhance it, particularly when the Spion Kop part of the Ground was

re-opened in 1986 (000086).



 Being a static system, the cameras are in a fixed position and focus

 on a particular fixed area.    They were in fact positioned at strategic

 points to view the turnstile entrances, and there was also a camera

 covering the players' entrance.   Within the CCTV room, situated in the
                                                             ^   ‘   )
 South Stand near the players' entrance, there is a bank of 20 monitors,

 plus a monitor for the computer system.    This computer system records

 the number of spectators who come through the turnstiles for each

 separate area of the ground.    Of the 20 monitors within the control
                                                                     PAGE        3
                                                                     S668A

    roan, 19 display the scene as depicted in the Club's static system.
                                                                                 I / D /.
    The remaining monitor is connected to the Police CCTV system.                I £=*> v '0<^ e*

    Each of the monitors connected to the Club system is in turn connected

    to a VCR so that we have the facility to tape the film shown on those

/"' monitors, on a video tape.   Of the 19 static cameras however, 1 was

    not in commission at the time because a wall had been constructed                \

    after the camera had been installed, which obstructed that camera's

    view of the relevant turnstiles.    The turnstiles in question were          /

\   those numbered 9-16 which will be referred to later in this              /

    statement.



    THE POLICE SYSTEM

    This consisted of 5 fully functional remote controlled cameras - ie.

    those cameras could pan-tilt through 360 degrees, and zoom on a 16/160

    lens.   They are controlled from a Police control box which is fixed in

    position at the south west comer of the Ground, adjacent to the

    western end of the South Stand.    The cameras for the Police system are

    positioned as follows:-

    1 on the upper south v*=st comer of the West Stand;

    2 are positioned on the top of the South Stand;

    1 at about its centre point and the other to the eastern end of the

      stand at the top;

    1 at the top (rear) of the roof of the Spion Kop;

    1 at the south west comer of the ground, mounted on high near the

      score-board and close to the Police control box.



    Within the Police control box there are 7 TV monitors, 5 of them are

    dedicated, 1 to each of the CCTV cameras.   The other 2 are connected

    to special time lapse video recorders, and you can switch from camera




                                                                                         622
                                                                  PAGE    4
                                                                  S668A

to camera by means of a passive switch within the control roan so that

the officer in charge can record the scene being displayed on any 1

of the 5 cameras.   The remaining 2 monitors are used so that the

officer can check which of        cameras are being recorded at any

given time.   PC Trevpr BISHOP Was the Officer who worked the CCTV

system for the Police, but it was not usual for him to be alone in the

control roan - there might perhaps be 3 or 4 other officers in there

with him at any given time, for their own reasons - eg. to watch a

section of the crowd frcm the elevated position.



Within the Police control box, there is also a telephone land line

which is part of Sheffield Wednesday EC's internal telephone system,

and the Police have their own separate telephone land lines installed

also.



THE EVENTS OF SATURDAY, 15TH APRIL 1989 (150489)

Although I had previously resigned my position as Technical Director

of M W (Technology) Limited, I was asked by Graham MACKRELL to attend

at the Ground on that day, in case my assistance was required.     We

knew that the FA Cup Semi-Final between Liverpool PC and Nottingham

Forest PC was a sell out, all-ticket match and I arrived at the Ground
                                     <v‘
                                       \
fairly early on the Saturday morning, to check that everything was in

order.   I was in fact asked to rectify a fault on 1 of the Police CCTV

cameras, the one at the south west comer near the score-board.      I

checked it, found it was not functioning properly, and I made the

necessary adjustments to the iris controls within the camera and

thereafter checked that it was working OK.   Late in the morning I then

went to the CCTV Control Roam where PC Harold GUEST was also in

attendance, as usual.   In addition, there was present Doug LOCK, the

Security Officer for Sheffield Wednesday PC and Geoff PLANE of M W
                                                               PAGE      5
                                                               S668A

(Technology). PC GUEST, as a matter of routine, would have ensured

early in the morning that cassette tapes were inserted in the 19 VCRs -

1 of course would not be recording a picture because the camera was

out of action, but PC GUEST would nevertheless routinely load all 19.

The authorised crowd capacity figures for each section of the ground

was part of the data stored in the computer, and the display monitor

for the computer would show how many spectators came through each of

the turnstiles in operation as the day went on.   The system was so

designed that when the turnstiles for a particular area had admitted

90   capacity to that area, the total for that section would flash on

the TV screen and if, for example, one part of the Ground was being

filled up quickly and there was capacity in another part (subject to

segregation of supporters), that would enable the Police to be aware

that they should direct remaining supporters to a different set of

turnstiles.   Each of the turnstiles was also fitted with an infra-red

ray sensor, so that if spectators tried to climb over the turnstiles

but within the turnstiles enclosure, that would also be recorded on

the screen, under a separate heading.   I produce (Exhibit 1) a copy of

the print-out frcm the computer monitor for the game in question.

Numbers climbing over the turnstiles within the enclosure would be

shown on the column headed 'Check Total.' The first heading 'Gate'

is the turnstile number through which the fans entered, the 'Gate

Ttotal' shows the number who entered through each of those turnstiles

and there will be sub-totals for each section.



I was present in the CCTV Control Room frcm about 11.30 am (1130)

that morning, when the turnstiles were opened and spectators were

entering the ground.   The Spion Kop and the South Stand had been

designated for Nottingham Forest supporters, and the North Stand and

West Stand (including Leppings Lane), were reserved for Liverpool
                                                                     PAGE    6
                                                                     S668A

supporters. The authorised capacity for the various sections of the

ground was as follows:-

Spion Kop                       21,000

South Stand covered              5,524

South Stand uncovered            3,310

West Stand                       4,465

Leppings Lane                   10,100

North Stand                      9,702



By about 2.45 pm (1445) the Kop and the South Stand areas were

full of Nottingham Forest supporters but the North Stand and the West

Stand areas were only about 2/3 (two thirds) full at that time and it

was noticeable from the static camera covering the Lappings Lane

turnstiles, that there was a build up of fans outside the turnstiles

in that area.     I produce (Exhibit 2) a plan of the Ground showing the

Leppings Lane entrance to the west and the turnstiles (7 in number)

which admit spectators to the terraced area of the West Stand are

designated A/G.     It will be seen that to the south of those turnstiles

runs a concrete path which leads around eventually to the South Stand.

That path is bounded on the one side (the south) by the river Don and

on the north side by a high brick wall.        Situated in that wall just

immediately beyond the turnstiles - ie. to the east of them - was an

exit gate designated Gate C which is a double gate of the concertina

metal-type which was kept closed.        One of the static cameras of the

CCTV system was situated on a post just east of that gate, the camera

being positioned so as to shew the area of the turnstiles A/G.



It was through the monitor showing the scene depicted by that camera

that it was possible to see the build up of supporters outside the

turnstiles.     The Police had erected sane barriers across the pathway a
                                                                  PAGE     7
                                                                  S668A

short distance east of Gate C, so that spectators could not walk

along the pathway to get access to the South Stand.    The build up of

Liverpool supporters outside the Lappings Lane entrance, was such that

sane had been forced beyond the entrance to the turnstiles outside

Gate C, and sane of those supporters were visible within the field of

vision of the static camera.

Bie position was such that I recall carmenting, at perhajjps 2.50 pin

(1450), "For God's sake why don't they delay the kick-off?/ and I

made that comment in the presence of Doug LOCK and PC G0EST.     We were

all, as I recall, in general agreement that it would be sensible to

postpone the kick-off to enable people to get into the ground,

although I do not recall that anyone in the CCTV Control Roan

attempted to contact the Police by radio or telephone to suggest that.

The Police, of course, were monitoring       situation themselves frcm

their own CCTV system, and in particular using the camera on tft& SQuth

west corner of the West Stand roof.   We could, of course, see that ~'"N

that camera was trained on Leppings Lane turnstiles because we were

able to monitor the Police pictures on one of the monitors within our

control room, although we did not have the facility to record that

picture.



There came a time when Gate C appeared to be opened, and a number of

spectators rushed through into the 'reservoir' area between the

turnstiles and the rear of the West Stand.   An examination of the

video recording appears to indicate that this occurred when the Police

opened the gate in an effort to eject one of the spectators that way,

and a number of the fans pressed through from the outside.   It would

appear that several hundred got through before the gates were again

closed.
                                                                     PAGE  8
                                                                     S668A



Subsequently, the static camera picked up the fact that a number of

fans climbed up over the structure housing the turnstiles, and

jumped down into the reservoir area inside.     That is, it seems,

further indication of the pressures building up outside the

turnstiles, although a steady flow of spectators was caning through

those turnstiles at all times, in the normal way.



I recall that after the first influx of several hundred spectators

through Gate C, Doug LOCK left the CCTV roan to go outside, presumably

to report the matter to the Club Secretary, Graham MACKRELL, and/or to

check the position for himself on the ground.



Sane time later, I am unsure of the exact time, I heard over the

Police radio (we had one in the CCTV roan), a senior police officer

make a request that a gate be opened at the Leppings Lane entrance.

Police control asked which gate he wished opened and he repeated his

request 2 or 3 times.    On about the fourth occasion he said, "Saneone

is going to die here, open the gate," and the Police control replied,

"If saneone is going to die open the gate, open the gate."



As appears fron the video tape, recording the scene, the gate was then

opened, apparently by a uniformed PC, and a huge number of fans

flooded into the area.



At that point in time, I realised from the number already displayed

on the monitor as having entered from the Leppings Lane turnstiles,

that a dangerous situation was being created.     I left the roan and

went down the players' tunnel to the pitch and, just as I did so, the

referee stopped the match as I recall.    I looted over to the West
                          I\   O fp
                                                                  PAGE    9
                                                                  S668A
 Stand area and I saw fans climbing over the fence and my first thought

 at that time was that it was a pitch invasion, and the match had been

 stopped for that reason.   The perimeter fencing at that point is high

and not easy to climb over.    I sat down in the stand area behind the

dug-out, and watched the situation for a little time - perhaps 2 or 3

minutes - before I realised what really was occurring.   One of the

Sheffield Wednesday ground staff came down the tunnel holding 2

stretchers and I grabbed one frcm him and ran across with it to help

ferry the injured people to the gymnasium area where the first aid

rocm was situated.   It was in fact only after I had ferried 3 or 4

injured people in that way, that I then realised that there were many

people who had died as a result, and the gym was in fact designated as

a temporary mortuary.



After helping on the pitch as much as possible, at about 4.15 (1615)

/4.30 pm (1630), I went back to the CCTV room where Geoff PLANE and

PC GUEST were present, and I had a cup of coffee and a cigarette.

Subsequently, I took print-outs of the attendance from the computer

monitor, and ejected the tapes frcm the VCR's, leaving them in the

machines in the ejected position, so that I could later know exactly

which tape related to which monitor/area.



I normally take 3 print-outs from the ccnputer for the attendance

figures, 2 of which go to the Secretary, Graham MACKRELL, and the

third will normally go to the ticket office staff.   However, on this

occasion, since it was an FA Cup Semi-Final, all-ticket, I did at

first give the third print-out to PC GUEST, at his request, since he

said his superior officers might want it.   Later, however, Graham

MACKRELL said that he wanted to keep all 3 in his secure possession

and I, therefore, retrieved it frcm PC GUEST.
                                                                          pacs: 10
                                                                          S668A



       At atout 6.15 (1815)/6.30 pm (1830), Graham MACKRELL asked me to

       ensure the video room was properly secured.    Geoff PLANE and PC GUEST

       had left the ground at that time.    I went to the CCTV roan, locked the

       cupboard doors where the VCR's were and then locked the roan and

       activated the alarm system for the roan.    I kept the key in my

       possession overnight.   On locking the cupboard doors where the VCR's

       were, I do not recall specifically checking that all the tapes were

       still in the machine, but I do recall that as I finally left the

       ground at atout 7.30 pm (1930) that night, with my fiancee who works

       as a receptionist at the Club, I asked the Security Guard at the

       players' entrance, to ensure that no one entered the CCTV roan

       overnight.   He premised to do so.



       1 returned to the ground at 9 am (0900), on the Sunday morning and

       checked the rocm where it was still locked and the alarm operative.

       However, when I opened up the roan and checked the VCR's, I found that

       2 tapes were missing.   One of those was the tape relating to the

       camera which looks over Gates 9 - 16, and the other was frcm the VCR

       which had not been activated at the time.     I have no idea who removed

       the tapes - I mentioned it to the Security Officer, Doug LOCK, and he

       was surprised and had no knowledge of it.



        I have read this statement and it is correct to the best of my

       knowledge and belief.

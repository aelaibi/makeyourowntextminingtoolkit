     Dear Madam
     HILLSBOROUGH

     Thank you for your letter of the 5th February 1990 addressed to
     the Director of Public Prosecutions. I have been asked to reply.
     Following receipt of your letter I have been in correspondence
     with the coroner, Dr Popper, and your request for information
     has been discussed in detail with the Assistant Chief Constable
     Mr J Mervyn Jones. We have a great deal of sympathy with your
     request and I have recently received Counsel's opinion on this
     unusual point.     I am sure you will understand that the
     prosecuting authorities are under a duty to ensure that they -do
     not conduct themselves in such a way as to prejudice either .the
     criminal investigation or any subsequent criminal proceedings.
     Generally, none of the information which is collected by criminal
     investigation is released until the later time either of a
     decision not to prosecute being reached or the conclusion of any
     criminal proceedings.
     However, I have considered the matter fully and whilst I am not
     prepared to disclose all the copies of the statements direct to
     you I feel that your request can be dealt with by a more formal
     disclosure in the arena of the coroner's court. I have written
     to Dr Popper confirming that the inquests could be resumed to
     hear evidence on a restricted basis providing only that
     information requested by you relating to the movements on the
     15th April 1989 of those who died, evidence of identification and
     medical evidence of the cause of death.

I believe that the release of such evidence in this way will
satisfy your request and provide the necessary formal framework
for the release of that information. I have copied this letter
to Dr Popper and to Mr J Mervyn Jones.
Should you wish to discuss this letter please do not hesitate to
telephone Michael Kennedy in this office who is dealing with the
case.
Yours faithfully

     Dear Dr Popper
    HILLSBOROUGH
     I write further to your letter of the 15th February 1990 and my
     reply of the 16th February.
     I have now received Counsel's opinion and considered fully the
     request made by the Steering Committee in their letter of the 5th
     February.
     The matter has been fully discussed at some length with
     Mr J Mervyn Jones and I am satisfied that evidence can be given
     formally at the adjourned inquest within strict parameters and
     that provided the evidence is given in this way there will be no
     prejudice either to the current criminal investigation or to any
     subsequent prosecution.
     Such evidence should relate only to the movements on April 15th
     1989 of those who died, evidence of identification and medical
     evidence of the cause of death.      Any requests for evidence
     exceeding those restrictions should be refused as it is likely
     to impinge upon matters which are currently the subject of the
     criminal investigation and which will be considered when a
     decision is made about the initiation of any criminal
     proceedings.
     I enclose a copy of a letter which I have sent to the Steering
     Committee and I confirm I have sent a copy of this letter to
     Mr Jones.




Fax 01-222-4751                                Telex 9 4 5 3 1 0 CPS HQ                                     Britdoc D X 2 3 2 8 Victoria

I should be pleased to attend any meeting which you may wish to
hold to discuss the practicalities of the adjourned inquest
hearing.
Should you wish to discuss the matter on the telephone please do
not hesitate to contact me.
Yours faithfully

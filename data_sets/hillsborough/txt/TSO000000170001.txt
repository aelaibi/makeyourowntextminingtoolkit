Mr Peter Whitehurst
Treasury Solicitors
Sheffield Town Hall
Surrey Street
Sheffield




I write in response to your recent request for clarification of information on
the South Yorkshire Control Room audio tapes.

The initial transcript is based solely on the V.H.F. transmissions and I am
satisfied that, given the severe time constraints imposed, it is accurate.

I enclose for your information additional material, which includes background
speech, as follows;

Tape Ref                              Time Ref               Comment

KWP/30/14/17                          1449-1529 hours        One page only commencing     10 minutes
                                                              and 30 seconds

KWP/30/15/17                          1449-1529 hours        Pages 8 and 9 only

The confusion over the speech on this latter tape attributed to a gentleman by
the name of ’A L F ’ has been resolved and is infact the word ’O P S ’ (Operations),
and is attributable to Police Constable 2470 Waugh.

I hope this will assist you in responding to the correspondence from Dibb,
Lupton and Broomead on behalf of Michael Kallipetis QC.

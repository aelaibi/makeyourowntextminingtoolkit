enga g e d on the turnstiles.                         I was       directed          by Police S e r geant

1080 Hoyland,              together with                  other Serial            10 officers,             to a t t e n d wi t h i n

the    ground        towards          the L e p p i n g s Lane           end,       where an         incident          was       taking

place.         The     turnstiles            were         then    closed at P e n i s t o n e Road and                      I made

my way onto            the      pitch       via the K o p and S o u t h Stand,                      where        I could see a

large      gathering            of    people         concentrated around                    the    goal     posts adjac e n t

to the West Stand,                    occupied            by Liverpool            fa n s . H a v i n g    run acro ss            the

full     length of the                pitch towards               the    crowd,           I could see           people       trying

to    climb over           the       front     securing           fence       of the middle               pen of the West

Stand,      a s s i s t e d by Police                officers        from the             pitch side.            It became

a p p arent        that    due to what               appeared        to be o v e r - c r o w d i n g        in the          centre

pen,     fans were           being       forced           to the     front        of the       pen and some were

forcibly           pushed agai n s t          the         front metal           perimeter          fencing,           wh i l s t

offic e r s were           pulling          some      fans       over    the      fencing         onto the        pitch side

to a l l e v i a t e      the    c r u s h . I fa s s i s t e d    by conveying              these        fans    from the

Police      officers at               the    fencing          onto      the     pitch,       where        they were          placed

into    the        recovery          position,            some    of who m a p p e a r e d to have                breathing

diffic u l t i e s .         These       people were              then       left w ith other Police                       officers.

After     a short while,                 I then made my way over                          to the No.            2 Gate       of    the

perimeter           fencing          of the a d j a c e n t        pen,       where       officers         had a l r e a d y

e n t e r e d and had made               their way across                    to the       centre         pen.     I    went        into

the    pen and a s s i s t e d           these officers                 to     carry       people        from the          centre

e n c l o s u r e , over        the s e p e r a t i n g       fence along             closure N o . 2 , and                 passed

them     out       through Gate             No.      2,    to other          Po l i c e   officers,         they w ere             then

c o n v e y e d onto the             pitch.

Once    a number           of    people       had         been removed fro m the middle                          pen,       it
                                                                                                                                PAG E
                                                                                                                                S 1532

               became a p p a r e n t      that      several      people       beneath the             crowds were        d e a d.Thes

               people,        in turn,        were    removed and            t a k en onto       the    pitch via        the

              No.    2 Gate.          T ogether wit h other                 officers,       I then stood           in a line

              across         the     centre    of the      pitch to segregate                rival       fans and as sist            the

              emergency            services     to operate more               freely.

              Du r i n g     this     time,    an a n n o u n c e m e n t    was made       to    the    effect      that      the

              m atch was            postponed and        fans     began to          leave    the       ground,     following

              which,         together with Serial                10 officers,          I made          my way to the

              Penistone            Road   end and a s s i s t e d fans             to board and depart               on local

               L ra n s p o r t »

              Once all         the N o t t i n g h a m Forest         supporters        had departed,              toget her with

              Serial         10 officers,         I returned to the N orth Stand,                         where a further

              briefing         was    held and we were              then stood down.

              After        this,     at 6.30      pm that       same        day,   I was     conveyed         to H a c k s n t n o r p e

              Police.Station,              where,      at “7.00pm,           I concluded duty.
